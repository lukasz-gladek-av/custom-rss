			<p>While the genre has never returned to the heights of the Lucasarts and Sierra boom of the mid-90s, point and click adventure games have never gone away. Every now and again one will break through (such as Excavation of Hob’s Barrow or Kathy Rain) but a devoted community of developers and players continue to enjoy their gripping storylines and challenging puzzles. I often go back and check out recent releases and am always excited to find one that blends in my fondness of the dark and mysterious. The Drifter is a game that ticks all my boxes, ending up as a real standout entry in the genre.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Drifter - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2GiHlkE2z8g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Powerhoof, the devs behind The Drifter, have made the game through their own custom designed Unity point and click creation tool, called Powerquest, with the ending credits including an invocation for players to tell their own stories through this. This passion for the form really shines through in the game, which is a love letter both to gritty pulp science fiction and adventure classics. There is more here than tribute and nostalgia, though, as the quality of the writing, voice acting, and storytelling are all extremely high.</p>


<p>The opening to the game immediately strikes you with its gorgeous pixel graphics and animation, alongside the superb voice acting of the main character and narrator, Mick Carter by Adrian Vaughan. Other characters are all professionally voiced but it is Mick’s story to tell and the rough Aussie voiceover fits the style of the game to perfection. There is a grittiness to Vaughan’s acting here that elevates the story to a level of polish that is rare to see.</p>
<p>We first meet Mick stowing away aboard a freight train en route to the home he abandoned under mysterious circumstances. He is returning to attend his mother’s funeral, but it is clear that there are layers of regret and sorrow beneath his rough exterior. Immediately upon arriving at his destination, a fellow stowaway is murdered in front of him and the narrative of intrigue and terror begins.</p>


<p>The opening section (which is also in the demo if you want to get a taste of the game) sets out the broad outline of the story, introduces several characters and takes you through the familiar point and click controls. Everything is carried out through a highly intuitive graphical interface that is tailor made for either mouse or controller. I played the game through on desktop, but it is designed to work just as well on console or Steam Deck. With mouse you follow the familiar point and click whereas on controller you can scroll through interactive points which removes some of the frustration of pixel hunting or lesser accuracy of an analogue stick.</p>
<p>At the end of the first chapter, Mick has been drowned (with a clear nod to Guybrush Threepwood in both setting and a hidden achievement) and come back to life. The remainder of the game sees Mick try to find out how he has unlocked this new found ability, survive against sinister plots, and rescue those closest to him. The narrative zips along at a thrilling pace, with each chapter building and escalating to create an emotional crescendo that is surprisingly affecting. These chapters could be taken individually to give an episodic feel that would be well in keeping with the pulp thrillers that have influenced the game, but I felt compelled to binge the game in two sittings.</p>

<p>So, graphics, voice-acting, and narrative are all excellent, but what really matters with point and click adventures is the quality of the puzzles. The Drifter focuses on item-based puzzles, with dialogue furthering the story at times or revealing new areas to investigate. There are none of the overly complex dialogue trees that can prove frustrating as you repeat lines multiple times to try and find the one path that opens up new information. Instead, all conversations are clearly laid out with icons representing the subject, and these light up when they haven’t been discussed or when new information is available. This is one of the most intuitive dialogue systems I’ve seen and shows just how refined the Powerquest engine is.</p>
<p>Inventory manipulation is the main area for puzzles and you’ll pick up the traditional array of items, many of which would never fit in a real pocket. Puzzles either involve combining items to create new ones, or interacting with the environment with others. Stripped down to that basic description, this mechanic always sounds somewhat limited, but the skilful design of puzzles, alongside the ever-present threat of death (albeit with a swift return) constantly keep you on your toes. There are some memorable moments where you have to quickly react to threats to survive whilst some late game puzzles involving deliberately dying and resurrecting bring in a level of depth and time travel that reminds me of peak Day of the Tentacle (with a much darker aesthetic).</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		The Drifter is a new standard in point and click adventures and deserves to be spoken about in the same breath as the very best the genre has to offer. The look, sound, and feel of the game are all superb and it tells a story that never stops being thrilling. All in all, it’s an essential purchase for anybody who has even a passing interest in the genre.	</p></div>

			<p>Black Mesa, the well-known remake of the first entry in the Half-Life series developed by Crowbar Collective, looks great with modded path tracing, but it also proves, <a href="https://wccftech.com/left-4-dead-2-path-tracing-rtx-5080-obliterates-performance/">once again</a>, how gaming hardware is still not at a point where it can run even older games with full path tracing at high resolutions without upscalers and frame generation.</p>



<p>A new video shared on YouTube today by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC">MxBenchmarkPC</a> shows the game's Remixed mod running with RTX Remix path tracing, highlighting how path tracing, alongside the other improvements featured in the mod, significantly improves visuals, but also completely tanks performance even on a powerful GPU like the RTX 5080. In the side-by-side shots at the beginning of the video, it's highlighted via a performance overlay how the game can go from running in the 200-plus FPS range without path tracing to the high 30s, low-to-mid 40s range with path tracing with NVIDIA DLSS in Performance mode. As such, Frame Generation becomes a necessity to run the game at higher, more playable framerates with path tracing.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The Black Mesa Remixed mod, which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/black-mesa-remixed-poc-inbound">ModDB</a>, introduces plenty of improvements to the remake of the first Half-Life game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/362890/Black_Mesa/">released in 2020</a>. It relights the inbound train ride and parts of the laboratory, and introduces five new meshes including 2K and 4K textures, 10 new meshes that were only present as texture in the original game, 40 to 50 very high quality materials built from the ground up and around 100 materials created from the original colormap using a mixture of techniques and workflows. As such, the mod is worth trying out even without path tracing to experience a small portion of the Half-Life remake like never before.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-available-in-saudi-arabia-and-uae/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/grand-theft-auto-v-is-now-available-in-saudi-arabia-and-the-uae-nearly-12-years-after-launch.1247271/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-enhanced-edition-realityv-ray-tracing-improvements/">Grand Theft Auto V</a> was initially released on September 17, 2013, and will have officially been out for 12 years this coming September. For hundreds of millions of people around the world, it's been a game they played countless times, or at least have had access to through legal means for the last dozen years. Unless you've spent the last 12 years of your life living in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, and didn't try to obtain the game through any under-the-counter means, in which case, Grand Theft Auto V is a brand new release for you in 2025. </p>



<p>Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online are now available in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, and as <a href="https://nikopartners.com/grand-theft-approval-a-turning-point-for-mena-game-regulations/">Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad reports</a>, both titles being approved for launch in the regions is a "<em>turning point for MENA game regulations</em>."</p>



<p>Grand Theft Auto V getting approval for launch in Saudi Arabia and the UAE also marks the introduction of a new age rating in the region, with the General Authority for Media Regulation in Saudi Arabia and the UAE Media Council introducing a 21+ rating. Grand Theft Auto isn't the only series that hasn't had major releases in Saudi Arabia and the UAE. </p>



<p>The regulatory boards in both regions have previously blocked games based on restrictions that for ratings boards like the ESRB or PEGI would fall under M for Mature/PEGI 18+. The introduction of this new age rating, as Ahmad points out, is what potentially opens the door for those titles that would've previously not made it through. Particularly because under this new rating, Grand Theft Auto V is being allowed to launch "<em>without any major modification</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>This is a positive signal for the industry as it potentially allows games to be approved without edits, thereby offering publishers a viable path to market for games that would normally be blocked</em>," Ahmad writes.</p>



<p>So while GTA V and GTA Online getting approval isn't the most significant thing on its own, especially because GTA V has still circulated in the region through unofficial means in the last decade, this new age rating is the thing that has the power to have a drastic impact on the video game industry in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, and the rest of the globe. </p>

            <p>If you're sick of being tag-teamed by Gaping Jaw &amp; Darkdrift Knight, then I bring good news. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>'s next wave of enhanced bosses have now successfully RSVPed to the big darkness party. They'll be arriving when the next cycle begins on July 31st.</p>
<p>Sure, that was the most logical point for a fresh rotation, given it's when the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/surprise-elden-ring-nightreigns-first-enhanced-boss-has-arrived-kicking-off-weekly-big-baddie-visits">established lot of Everdark Nightlord duos</a> were set to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-hero-for-our-times-elden-ring-nightreign-boss-becomes-unbeatable-by-refusing-to-show-up">disappear</a>. Though, for whatever reason, FromSoft haven't fully committed to a date until now. One can only assume the Equilibrious Beast was busy polishing its horns.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Anyway, as the makers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>s about rolling around the big lad until one of you expires have just tweeted, the enhanced versions of Tricephalos, Augur, Fissure in the Fog, and the goat-headed beast I just mentioned will be arriving as part of a cycle starting on the final day of this month.</p>
<p>So, they're really August bosses, but they're doing you a favour and rocking up to the party before the first of the month. Early boss gets to slap up the worm with an underwhelming build, I guess.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>The veil thins, and the Night hungers still.</p><p>On July 31, 2025, a new Everdark cycle shall begin; the enhanced Nightlords Tricephalos, Augur, Equilibrious Beast and Fissure in the Fog will soon unleash their darkest powers upon Limveld.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ELDENRING?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ELDENRING</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NIGHTREIGN?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NIGHTREIGN</a> <a href="https://t.co/IN71Mm53ux">pic.twitter.com/IN71Mm53ux</a></p></div>— ELDEN RING (@ELDENRING) <a href="https://twitter.com/ELDENRING/status/1946208540416168293?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 18, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>If they follow the same cadence established by the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-latest-elden-ring-nightreign-enhanced-boss-is-plenty-tough-enough-without-the-everdark-treatment">first wave</a> of Everdark Sovereigns, you can expect three weeks of one new boss invading at a time, then three weeks when you can take them in pairs. Is that enough to keep you Nightreigning without some more juicy additions, like the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-now-confirmed-to-be-getting-those-duo-expeditions-plus-enhanced-fights-against-its-current-nightlord-crop">already confirmed duos mode</a>, currently in sight?</p>
<p>Well, if you're desperate for ways to spice things up, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-inevitable-randomiser-mod-is-here-to-spice-up-your-runs-with-extra-funky-map-scrambling">a randomiser mod for Nightreign</a> came out earlier this week. Nothing like taking your chances with a map structure that may or may not be balanced, eh? Maybe blindfold and truss yourself up like Hannibal Lecter too. Can't make thing easy by being able to see or touch things as you try to beat the bosses, can we?</p>
<p>Better plug up your nose as well. No hunting bosses by smell unless you want the FromSoft lot sniggering at the amount of training wheels you're running with.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-next-enhanced-boss-wave-crashes-against-the-shores-of-frustration-at-the-end-of-this-month]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Peter Connelly, the video game composer and sound designer on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/tomb-raider-i-iii-remastered-starring-lara-croft/user-reviews/2200-12865716/" data-ref-id="2200-12865716">Tomb Raider Remaster series</a> and Tomb Raider: Chronicles, has been sentenced to 16 months in prison for fraudulently applying for a government COVID-19 support loan. Based in Peterlee, County Durham, Connelly obtained a second Bounce Back Loan (BBL) of £37,500 (approximately $55,000) in June 2020 by greatly overstating his company's turnover. This was in direct violation of the loan rules, which only permitted one loan per business. He had already secured a legitimate loan of £22,000 the previous month.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/tomb-raider-video-game-composer-jailed-for-covid-loan-fraud" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">UK Insovlency Service</a>, Connelly claimed his company had a 2019 turnover of £150,000 when, in reality, it had earned just over £58,000. Additionally, he falsely claimed that he had not previously applied for a BBL. His actions led to a criminal investigation by the Insolvency Service, the body responsible for monitoring misuse of the COVID loans.</p><p>At a hearing this week, Connelly was sentenced not only to prison but also disqualified from serving as a company director for six years. The Insolvency Service emphasized the seriousness of his fraud, noting that this sort of loan was created to support struggling small businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic, not to be exploited for personal gain. Chief Investigator David Snasdell condemned Connelly’s "blatant disregard" for the rules.</p><p>In his defense, Connelly stated that he had undertaken financial risks to work on a high-profile project involving the reimagining of the Tomb Raider soundtrack. He claimed to have sold his car and taken out personal loans in anticipation of the project's success, which he also claimed was sidelined by the pandemic. However, the court ruled that his financial mismanagement did not excuse committing fraud.</p><p>His company, Peter Connelly Limited, entered liquidation in August 2021, with neither of the two loans repaid. In June 2022, Connelly entered into an Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA), agreeing to repay his debts through regular payments to an insolvency agency.</p>

Robert Patino (<em>Westworld</em>, <em>DMZ</em>) and David Wiener (<em>Halo</em>, <em>Fear The Walking Dead</em>) will lead the project as co-creators, showrunners, and executive producers. Gerard Guillemot, Margaret Boykin, Austin Dill, and Matt O'Toole will also serve as executive producers.</p><p>If this news sounds familiar, you're not imagining things. In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2020/10/27/netflix-reveals-live-action-assassins-creed-series">2020, Netflix announced the show,</a> led at the time by executive producers Jason Altman and Danielle Kreinik.

Now that the show has been greenlit, it can formally move from development into production and is more likely to actually come out.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1k6HqBK1TRo"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1k6HqBK1TRo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The Assassin's Creed series is known for its detailed historical settings, typically focusing on major cities at pivotal moments in history. We don't know exactly when or where this live-action series will be set, but according to a description provided on Ubisoft's news page, it might take place at several time periods.</p><p>The description reads, "The Assassin's Creed live-action series is a high-octane thriller centered on the secret war between two shadowy factions: one set on determining mankind's future through control and manipulation, the other fighting to preserve free will. The series follows characters across pivotal historical events as they battle to shape humanity's destiny."</p><p>Later in the announcement, a joint statement from showrunners Patino and Wiener communicates their feelings on the games as they begin developing the show. "Beneath the scope, the spectacle, the parkour and the thrills is a baseline for the most essential kind of human story - about people searching for purpose, struggling with questions of identity and destiny and faith," they write. "It is about power and violence and sex and greed and vengeance. But more than anything, this is a show about the value of human connection, across cultures, across time. And it's about what we stand to lose as a species, when those connections break."</p><p>For more on live-action video game adaptations,&nbsp;<a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/16/nintendo-reveals-link-and-zelda-actors-for-live-action-legend-of-zelda-movie">see who was cast as Link and Zelda in the upcoming Legend of Zelda movie</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/18/netflix-greenlights-live-action-assassins-creed-series-led-by-westworld-halo-producers]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Focus Entertainment and developer Hutlihut Games have announced that their co-op space action game Void Crew is coming out for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S on 4th September 2025.</p>
<p>New console players will join the existing PC-based community, which grew through early access and the full game’s launch back in November 2024.</p>
<p><iframe title="Console Release Date Trailer [Void Crew]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hcwJCbd_PQs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Void Crew sneds you off into the depths of METEM space to fight back against the HOLLOW alien enemy that is invading. With crews of 1-6 players, you will take on specific roles within the ship as Pilot, Gunner, Engineer, and Scavenger, running around the 3D environment to man stations, perform tasks and generally work together to try and push back the enemy. There will be job like hopping onto cannons, of course, but also planning out your moves at a shared table, going on space walks to patch up the hull, making internal repairs, flipping internal controls, and more.</p>
<p>As you progress from objective to objective, you’ll expand your ship’s loadout, taking the opportunity to customise and upgrade your ship, hopefully improving your survivability for when you wind up in space battles with swarms of enemies and huge bosses. It’s a roguelite, though, so expect to fail a good few times and have to start all over from the beginning.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>When Nintendo first announced the Switch 2’s slate of launch titles, people were very <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lcz0a4/why_is_the_switch_2_selling_so_well_it_seems/">quick to cry foul</a> about how few original, exclusive games the company had lined up for its latest console. There were ports from other systems and updated versions of original Switch games. But <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/684518/mario-kart-world-review-nintendo-switch-2"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a> was the Switch 2’s only major new exclusive title, which, for some, put a further damper on a launch that was already mired in confusion about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/650982/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-price-fair">pricing</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/644803/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-trade-borrow-resell">game key cards</a>.</p><p>While <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685142/nintendo-switch-2-3-5-million-sold">the Switch 2’s sales</a> disproved that pessimistic read, the system’s relatively thin selection of exclusives has <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-hype-pre-order-special-compared/">continued to be a talking point</a> in the ongoing discourse about <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/611518/one-month-analysis-hype">whether the overall launch was exciting enough</a>. But after a month of the Switch 2 being on the market, what do you know — there just so happens to be a new game for it out this week. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/707704/donkey-kong-bananza-review-nintendo-switch-2"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a>’s arrival isn’t at all a surprise because <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641537/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo told everyone exactly when it would be available</a>. Being made to wait a bit might have rubbed some folks the wrong way, but in a world where we <em>all</em> have a back catalog of games that we’ve yet to finish (or even start in some cases), a measured release schedule kind of feels like a good thing.</p><p>Back in April when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641985/nintendo-switch-2-every-game-announced-direct">Nintendo first announced all of the Switch 2 games</a> slated to come out through the end of 2025, you could see that the company was loosely following a monthly release schedule for its new exclusives. June would go to <em>Mario Kart World</em> and <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em>. And <em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>would drop in July amid the releases of a couple Switch 2 editions of older games. At the time, Nintendo said that <em>Drag x Drive </em>would debut at some point in “the summer,” but it has since pegged the game to a firm August 14th release date.</p><p>Currently, there’s nothing on the docket for September, but the month could easily go to <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>, which is supposed to come out this year. And after <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>’s release in October, the “winter” will belong to <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em> (and maybe <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/640231/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-2-enhanced-edition-beyond"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a>, which is also due out sometime in 2025).</p><p>Looking at Nintendo’s roadmap for the rest of the year, it feels as if the company is trying to pace things in a way that gives people time to really sit with and enjoy its exclusives. For every hardcore gamer who prides themself on speeding through a title and being the first to uncover or unlock all of its surprises, there are far more casuals who prefer taking their time. Nintendo could have opted to flood the zone with more exclusives from the jump — a move that probably would have made the Switch 2’s launch seem like a splashier beat in <a href="https://kotaku.com/console-wars-are-over-ps5-xbox-forza-switch-2-sony-1851752956">the console wars’ twilight hours</a>. But by spacing things out, the company is guaranteeing that there will be a steady stream of new stuff for people to dig into, and giving people ample time to decide if they’re <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642143/nintendo-switch-2-games-price-expensive">willing to pay the games’ higher prices</a>.</p><p>The Switch 2 is Nintendo’s new flagship, which is to say it’s not going away anytime soon and there will be plenty more games for it in due time. Had <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/703468/donkey-kong-bananza-developer-interview-switch-2"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a> dropped alongside <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interview/678097/mario-kart-world-nintendo-switch-2-interview-kosuke-yabuki"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a>, neither game would have been able to take up so much space and command attention they way they could with some distance between them. Releasing new titles at a steady pace was a major part of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/20/17478950/nintendo-switch-structure-success-shinya-takahashi-interview">Nintendo’s vision for the original Switch</a>, and that strategy paid off through the console’s life cycle. Now it looks like Nintendo’s sticking to its guns, and the Switch 2 will probably be better off for it.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/708909/nintendo-switch-2-donkey-kong-bananza-exclusive-release-schedule]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Sucker Punch's upcoming PlayStation 5 exclusive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a> is getting its own official popcorn bucket, but it's proven so popular it has already sold out online.</p>
<p>The bucket itself was available to pre-order from <a href="https://t.co/Kre862VVjF">AlamoMart</a>, and is shaped like a traditional Japanese rice basket. It was released for pre-order to coincide with Alamo Drafthouse's "curated" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/way-samurai">Way of the Samurai</a> film programme, which will showcase five films that helped define the genre. This series of films will <a href="https://x.com/alamodrafthouse/status/1945892543234805970/photo/1">be hosted in August</a> at select Alamo Drafthouse theaters.</p>

<p>Anyway, the hand painted Ghost of Yōtei Popcorn Bucket, as it is known, itself retailed for $40. That's around £30 here in the UK, though not factoring in any shipping costs. It was designed by Sony's own artists, and has a 100oz capacity.</p>
<p>"Elevate your movie snack game with the limited-edition Ghost of Yōtei Popcorn Bucket," the description reads, with Alamo Drafthouse calling it "the perfect keepsake for any aspiring warrior".</p>
<p>A perfect keepsake it may well be, but even though the popcorn bucket was only revealed last night, it has already sold out online. Sorry for any of you who were looking forward to reaching into a Ghost of Yōtei-themed food vessel, but that chap just simply isn't available any more. I have popped my email address into the 'Notify Me When Available' tab, so will let you know if this changes.</p>

            <p>The next round of Everdark Sovereigns will be added to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> on 31st July, with four enhanced Nightlords available to beat.</p>
<p>In a nod towards live service updates, these <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-update-brings-new-challenges-and-a-welcome-live-service-twist">extra challenging Everdark Sovereigns were added to the game on a rotating basis last month</a>, with three added individually over three weeks. Then, last week, FromSoftware announced these would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-worry-nightfarers-youll-get-another-chance-to-beat-elden-ring-nightreigns-sovereign-super-bosses">rotate again before new additions arrived</a>.</p>
<p>Now we know the enhanced Tricephalos, Augur, Equilibrious Beast and Fissure in the Fog will arrive on 31st July - so that's immediately after the current rotation concludes.</p>

<p>While not confirmed, presumably these will be added to the game one at a time on a rotating basis over the course of four weeks. And after that? Perhaps they'll come round again.</p>
<p>Still, what players are really after is a duo mode. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-two-player-mode-confirmed-as-fromsoftware-celebrates-35m-players">FromSoftware confirmed at the start of last month the mode is on the way</a>, but no further details have been provided.</p> <div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sucker Punch Productions is one of the longest-standing PlayStation Studios teams, with a storied history and more than a few series and characters who've taken the PlayStation spotlight over the years. During the PlayStation 3 era, that series was Infamous, a series of games that spilled over into the PlayStation 4 era, but has been dormant since the release of a main game and a shorter DLC title that both arrived at the beginning of the PS4 generation. </p>



<p>Infamous was followed up with<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-tsushima-duty-heavier-than-a-mountain-death-lighter-than-a-feather/"> Ghost of Tsushima,</a> a decision that very few, if any, would question, considering how successful Ghost of Tsushima has been, both as a commercial product and as a game that is beloved by players and critics alike. But that hasn't stopped players who loved Infamous from wondering out loud if Sucker Punch would return to the series. </p>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/2025/07/17/ghost-of-yotei-directors-share-philosophy-on-balancing-freedom-with-story">GameInformer</a>, where creative directors Nate Fox and Jason Connell were talking all things Ghost of Yotei ahead of the game's October release, Fox was asked if he'd be open to going back to the Infamous games. </p>



<p>"<em>I would love to work on more Infamous</em>," Fox began. "<em>I would love to see a trilogy rerelease, but Sucker Punch is a one game at a time shop, and right now we are very focused on finishing Ghost of Yotei.</em>"</p>



<p>For as long as Sucker Punch has been making games for PlayStation consoles, the studio has focused on one series at a time. On the PlayStation 2, that series was Sly Cooper. It made three Sly Cooper games for PS2 before the series spilled over into the PS3 generation with another developer at the helm. Then it was Infamous with two games made for PS3, one for PS4, and one shorter, expansion-sized game, also for PS4.</p>



<p>Ghost of Tsushima was undoubtedly the studio's main game for the PS4 generation. The 'Ghost' series is only the second time in the studio's history that it has worked on games in a series that has straddled two console generations, but what Sucker Punch has never done so far is look back. As a fan of Infamous myself, I would love to see them return to the series, rerelease the trilogy and make a proper fourth installment, but I can't say that feels likely. </p>



<p>Who knows, though. Perhaps Fox, I, and many players around the world who still have a love for the Infamous games will get our wish.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remedy Entertainment has revealed what's coming next to multiplayer-focused shooter&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>, and there's a major update incoming in September, plus more.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/536607976683733002" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Steam, Remedy says its upcoming "cadence" for communication, as well as updates for&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>in general, will "slow down" as the studio focuses on work for a major update that's coming in September.</p>

<p>Remedy goes on to say that while it wants to tell players what's coming in the update, "the nature of game development is that things change frequently", and promising certain features only for them not to end up in the final update would "get [the studio] into trouble".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fbc-firebreak-whats-next-monster.jpg?itok=9a9Tg80V 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fbc-firebreak-whats-next-monster.jpg?itok=Mto3x_dH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>is getting a big update in September.</figcaption></figure><p>With that said, Remedy does reveal some of the things it's working on for the update, including an improved "onboarding" experience that will include a narrative video setting up the game's story, as well as a playable tutorial level.</p>

<p>Gunplay is also being improved; Remedy says that while it doesn't want&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>to become a conventional shooter, it does recognize the need to improve the game's arsenal, so three new heavy guns will be added in September.</p>

<p>Generic upgrades for weapons will also be removed, and they'll be replaced by a mod system that will let you "tweak how you want your guns to work and the ways in which they become more powerful over time".</p>

<p>There's tons of other stuff coming to&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>in September as well, although as Remedy says, some of what's being worked on may not make it into this update, and you may well see other features that haven't been teased yet as well.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2272540/FBC_Firebreak/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10012303" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/fbc-firebreak/9pdcn8z4hkrn" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and it's available on PS Plus and Game Pass as well.

    <p><span>Escape the sizzling heat with seaside adventures.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 5.8 update for <em><a title="Games > Genshin Impact [125 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a></em>, dubbed “Sunspray Summer Resort,” will launch on July 30, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [200 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-979181"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>With salt in the air and waves frothing on the breezy shores, a new permanent summer adventure map—Easybreeze Holiday Resort—awakens in Natlan, bringing a variety of laid-back, colorful events. Meanwhile, Ineffa, the first Nod-Krai character, will introduce the new Lunar-Charged reactions and begin the prelude to the Nod-Krai storyline.</p><p>Starting with Version 5.8, Travelers will be invited to explore Easybreeze Holiday Resort—a vibrant new island region located off the west coast of Natlan, now open for its trial phase. Familiar faces will return for the adventure, including Bennett, Chasca, and Mualani. Even Venti makes an appearance, seemingly here to visit an old friend—more of which will unfold in the new Story Quest, “Sunspray Summer Resort.” Joining the fun is the resort’s cheerful mascot, “Asha,” who grants Travelers special exploration powers similar to those of the Saurians—making it easy to glide across water and hover briefly in midair across the layers of the resort. The Asha buddies are also master spray painters, and the color they scatter along the way can solve puzzles and unveil more secrets of the resort. Yet, beneath the cheerful resort lies the secrets of Mare Jivari, where Bakunawa, the ageless monster, awaits new challengers.</p><p>Hidden throughout the resort are a variety of seasonal events offering generous rewards. Whether by guiding Kau Kau and Akamai in “Travels Are Fuller With Friends,” aiming at opponents in “Strikers Through the Storm,” joining energetic music parties, or spray-painting objects as Asha, Travelers can earn Sunspray Spirit through these mini-games. Collect enough, and Travelers can unlock exciting rewards, including the event-exclusive 4-star Claymore “Flame-Forged Insight” and Bennett’s new outfit, “Adventures in Blazing Hue.”</p><p>The story of Nod-Krai is about to unfold in the new version series “Song of the Welkin Moon.” In the prelude chapter, “The Journey Home” in Version 5.8, Ineffa, Travelers will meet your very first companion from the region: Ineffa, an all-purpose household robot created by the Whiz-Kid Mechanic Aino of Nod-Krai. Together with Ineffa, Travelers will set off on a journey across Natlan to uncover the secrets of her origins—mysteries that appear to be closely linked to the ancient dragon civilization.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_979183"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Ineffa, a capable fighter when her combat module is activated, will join the playable roster as a 5-star Electro polearm user who introduces the all-new Lunar-Charged reaction. When she is in the team, any Electro-Charged reaction triggered by party members will instead become a Lunar-Charged reaction. Upon activation, a Thundercloud appears on the battlefield, continuously dealing Electro DMG to enemies simultaneously affected by both Electro and Hydro, even with the possibility of triggering CRIT Hits. In combat, Ineffa can deploy a shield and summon the Multipurpose Smart Assistance Unit “Birgitta.” Birgitta can periodically dash toward enemies to deal AoE Electro DMG, and will launch an additional attack if a Thundercloud created by Lunar-Charged reactions is present nearby.</p><p>In the first phase of the Version 5.8 event wishes, Ineffa will make her debut alongside a rerun of Citlali. In the latter half of the banners, Mualani and Chasca will return.</p><p>In addition, Yelan, our old friend from Liyue, embroiled in a tricky case in Fontaine, keeps a low profile by donning a new Fontaine-style outfit and equipping a special photography device to capture traces invisible to the naked eye. For a limited time, Travelers can also pick up Yelan’s fresh outfit, “Tranquil Banquet,” at a special discount.</p><p>This breezy summer update also comes with a range of streamlined system optimizations. New short, cloud-streamed tutorial videos are now available on Trial and Talent screens for newly released characters, making it easier for Travelers to learn how to use them effectively. Quest time management has been simplified too—just press “Navigate,” and the in-game clock will automatically adjust to the correct time. Additionally, improved material tracking now helps Travelers quickly identify which characters can detect local specialties in each region.</p></blockquote><p><em>Genshin Impact</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,922 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,543 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [28,171 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [23,692 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://ys-api-os.mihoyo.com/event/download_porter/link/ys_global/genshinimpactpc/default" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">client</a> and <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/p/genshin-impact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/genshin-impact/id1517783697" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Play</a>.</p><p>Watch a new set of trailers below.

Whether you love socializing, adventuring, or simply enjoying a laid-back lifestyle, there’s warmth and happiness waiting for you here. This island embodies our vision of an ideal life, and we look forward to creating a unique dream world together with you.”</p><p>Seed Lab technical director Goltan Gao added, “We want to make sure players are the true stars of their <em>Starsand Island</em> story. We’re building a game where they will have the freedom to decide how their character looks, how they travel and explore the island’s beautifully tranquil landscapes, and whether they go on their exciting <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,406 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>s solo, with a pet, or with a friend. <a title="Genres > Crafting [38 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">Crafting</a> their dream island life is at the heart of every decision we’re making as we continue to create <em>Starsand Island</em>, and we’re excited to share more of the journey as BitSummit begins.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the vehicles and exploration, via Seed Lab:</p><blockquote><p>Players will be able to skate, ride, drive, and fly a range of vehicles, including skateboards, rollerblades, cars, scooters with (and without) sidecars, and even a paraglider, across the island’s lush pastures, green- and amber-hued woodlands, glistening sandy beaches, and the surrounding azure seas. Amphibious craft will also be available, enabling seamless land and water traversal, further expanding players’ horizons.</p><p>Exploring the island won’t have to be done solo: a number of vehicles have passenger seats, allowing NPC pals and pets – and even real-life friends via <em>Starsand Island</em>‘s <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [555 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer game</a>play – to go along for the ride, while the game’s photo mode will allow players to capture memories and moments from every part of their adventure.</p><!-- AD: content -->

                <p>In 2012, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/lollipop-chainsaw-review/1900-6383166/" data-ref-id="1900-6383166">Lollipop Chainsaw</a> introduced players to Juliet Starling, a zombie-hunting cheerleader who used a chainsaw and other over-the-top weapons to destroy the so-called walking dead. Aside from the modern remaster, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lollipop-chainsaw-remake-delayed-to-2024-officially-titled-lollipop-chainsaw-repop/1100-6516795/" data-ref-id="1100-6516795">Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP</a>, that was released in 2024, there hasn't been much happening with the franchise. Now, Lollipop Chainsaw is poised for a comeback with "new projects" thanks to a deal between Dragami Games and Nada Holdings.</p><p>The two companies jointly announced that they plan to "jointly launch multiple new projects" based on Lollipop Chainsaw. Neither Dragami nor Nada offered any details about what those projects might entail, but a new game or a potential film adaptation could be among the options explored.</p><p>Dragami Games president and CEO Shohei Sato thanked Lollipop Chainsaw fans for their support and praised Nada for giving the company a chance to revisit the franchise.</p><p>"The team at Nada Holdings shares a deep affection and enthusiasm for the title, along with a proven track record in IP investment and development," said Sato. "Through this partnership, we look forward to working together to create new projects that carry on the spirit and charm of the original while bringing fresh value to the franchise."</p><p>James Gunn--the co-CEO of DC Studios and the director of the recently released Superman reboot--co-wrote the story for Lollipop Chainsaw, which was co-directed by Goichi Suda aka Suda51. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suda51-and-james-gunn-wont-be-involved-in-the-lollipop-chainsaw-remake/1100-6505128/" data-ref-id="1100-6505128">neither Gunn nor Suda51 had any involvement with the 2024 remaster</a>. If another game moves forward, it's unclear if either Gunn or Suda51 will be willing or able to contribute to it.</p>

While Steam only counts for a portion of the game's audience--it's also available through the Epic Games Store, as well as on Xbox Series X|S and PS5--the numbers haven't been too encouraging lately. The game peaked with 1,992 players on launch day, and since then, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2272540/charts/#max" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">those numbers have fallen</a> to well under 100 concurrent players on average.</p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/536607976683733002" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">In a blog post</a>, Remedy says that one of the issues it looks to address is the opening of the game, as that crucial first hour has become a point of criticism amongst the playerbase. "We've seen many players come into the game and leave within the first hour. And that's because our first hour can be frustrating; you feel ineffective and confused as to what to do. This needs to be improved," Remedy explained.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> FBC: Firebreak GameSpot Review</p>
      </div>
<p>The company says that it plans to improve the narrative onboarding experience by placing an introductory video into the game and improving the tutorial section with better pop-up tips. In effect, this should help players figure out "where they are, who they are, and what they are trying to achieve" as members of Firebreak.</p><p>In terms of gameplay, Remedy explained that it wants to strike a fine balance between using old-fashioned first-person shooter gunplay and Crisis Kit tools to triumph, giving players more control over their growth. This will involve adding three new heavy guns, dropping all "generic" upgrades from equipment and replace it with a Mod System that lets players tweak how their weapons function.</p><p>Other changes on the horizon include tweaks to the Jobs system and a dynamic series of objectives to keep players on their toes. "We're bringing in a new handcrafted level, three Zones, a new status effect, two more enemies to deal with, and all the rest you've come to expect from a new Job," Remedy added.</p><p>The studio stressed that its plans aren't set in stone and could change over time, but overall, it expects the first Major Update to introduce a significant number of improvements to FBC: Firebreak.

                <p>Netflix plans to "ramp up" its investment in gaming after the company previously <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-boss-explains-why-company-killed-the-aaa-multiplayer-game-from-halo-veteran/1100-6530293/" data-ref-id="1100-6530293">pulled back from its grand ambitions in the AAA space</a> and shut down a studio from Halo veteran Joe Staten.</p><p>As part of <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2025/q2/Netflix-Inc-_Earnings-Call_Transcript.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Netflix's latest earnings briefing</a>, co-CEO, president, and director Greg Peters commented on Netflix's vision for gaming, saying Netflix's investment thus far has been relatively small in comparison to the money it puts into film, TV, and live sports programming. The opportunity to grow is significant, he said.</p><p>"We look at the near-term monetization opportunity with games very similar to how we've looked at other new content categories. You can think in scripted or film or on and on. And that's essentially, if we deliver more value to our offering, we get increased user acquisition, we get increased retention, we get increased willingness to pay," he said. "So it drives all of the sort of core fundamentals of our business."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4534463-games.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4534463" data-ratio="0.61573033707865" data-width="890" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4534463-games.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4534463"></a><figcaption>Netflix Games is growing.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4534463-games.jpg"></figure><p>Peters said Netflix has already observed "positive effects" of investing in gaming. However, he reminded people that Netflix's investment in gaming remains "small" relative to the company's overall business and that the number of people playing games on Netflix is small as well. In 2022, findings found that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/8/23296545/netflix-games-1-percent-subscribers" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">99% of Netflix users did not play Netflix's games</a>, though this was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-is-bringing-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-to-mobile-devices-next-month/1100-6519544/" data-ref-id="1100-6519544">before Grand Theft Auto came to Netflix. </a></p><p>Peters said Netflix is aiming to be "disciplined" with regards to its investment in gaming. The goal, he said, is to not invest too much before Netflix can demonstrate that it can create "value for our members."</p><p>"We've seen good progress, as you know, with licensed games like GTA. We've seen good progress with the games we developed like Squid Game: Unleashed. So you'll see more from us in both of those categories, as well as a whole new set of interactive experiences that we think that we're either in a unique or differential position to deliver," he said. "So we're super excited to roll those out over the next year."</p><p>Currently, Netflix's games are included with a subscription to the streaming service, and Netflix's games do not have ads or microtransactions. Some have theorized that Netflix might seek to monetize games in different ways in the future, but nothing is confirmed yet. Peters said Netflix is "open" to "evolving our monetization model" for games, but he said the company needs to "get to a lot more scale before that becomes a really materially relevant question. So we're going to do that work first."</p><p>Finally, Peters said people should remember that the TAM, or total addressable market, for gaming is "very, very large" and thus has significant potential upside in terms of growth and revenue. "We remain convicted about our strategic opportunity and excited to make more progress," Peters said.</p><p>Also during the briefing, Netflix management said the company continues to invest in "immersive, narrative games based on our IP." For Black Mirror Season 7, Netflix launched the game Thronglets, which was also featured in the "Plaything" episode. The Squid Game: Unleashed game, meanwhile, received new content themed around the recently released Season 3.</p><p>Netflix is now focused on four main areas for its upcoming games slate, including party games, kids games, narrative games, and "mainstream" games. These titles will be made for phones and to be beamed to TVs via Netflix's own streaming systems--and won't come to Xbox or PlayStation consoles.</p><p>For years already, Netflix has been <a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/132197" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">testing streaming games directly to your TV or computer</a>, in addition to launching games for mobile.</p><p>"It's a little bit like a musician, we start copying a few things and then at one point we're going to find our voice," Netflix gaming boss Alain Tascan said. "I don't know how long it's going to take exactly, but I'm very bullish about us finding our voice."</p><p>As for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-boss-explains-why-company-killed-the-aaa-multiplayer-game-from-halo-veteran/1100-6530293/" data-ref-id="1100-6530293">why Netflix shuttered its AAA studio and canceled the new game from Staten</a>, Tascan said this wasn't a signal that Netflix doesn't want to make "big ambitious games." Instead, he said the genre of what the studio was building was not "matching the platform."</p><p>"This team was really good at what they were doing, but we wouldn't have been the best partner for them to express their skills and their expertise," he said.</p><p>In other Netflix news, it was just recently announced that Netflix had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflixs-assassins-creed-tv-series-moves-ahead-with-halo-sons-of-anarchy-veterans/1100-6533232/" data-ref-id="1100-6533232">greenlit a live-action Assassin's Creed TV series that has been in the works for a half-decade already.</a></p>

            <p>Valve boss Gabe Newell spends his days scuba diving and hanging out on a boat as well as working, but is effectively retired at this point.</p>
<p>Newell was interviewed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ZALKAR.SALIEV">YouTube channel Zalkar Saliev</a>, which is dedicated to "powerful interviews and lifestyle stories with successful men across the US", but with just a handful of videos so far - certainly an odd choice for Newell. Valve confirmed to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/gabe-newells-daily-routine-is-get-up-work-go-scuba-diving-says-hes-been-retired-for-a-long-time-but-works-7-days-a-week-the-things-i-get-to-do-every-day-are-super-awesome/">PC Gamer</a> the interview is real.</p>
<p>While the full interview is yet to be published, a couple of shorts have been released, including one where Newell discusses his daily routine.</p>

<p>"What is the daily routine for Mr Gabe?" he's asked.</p>
<p>Newell replied: "My daily routine: I get up, I work, I go scuba-diving, then work some more. Then either go on a second scuba dive or I go to the gym and work out. I live on a boat so I just hang out with everybody on the boat. Then I work."</p>
<p>He continued: "I work seven days a week: I'm working from my bedroom as you can tell." Indeed, the interview alternates between a view of Saliev's computer and the direct video call feed. Newell appears to be sat at the end of a bed.</p>
<p>Newell added: "I like working, it's fun, to me it doesn't feel like work. The kinds of things that I get to do every day are super-awesome."</p>
<p>He then admitted he's effectively retired at this point. "I've said it before but, when you retire, you want to stop doing your horrible job and go do what is most fun and entertaining," he said. "In that sense I've been retired for a long time."</p>
<p>So what exactly is he up to? He's working on "AI stuff" and "Steam stuff", but with one company he's working on an aerosol pathogen detection device. He added: "Brain-computer interfaces are incredibly cool and all of the associated neuroscience is incredibly cool."</p>
<p>Newell concluded: "I just work all the time, but it's not like 'oh my god I'm up late at night slaving away on stuff.' It's more like 'I can't go to sleep because I'm having fun', you know?" Lucky for some!</p>
<p>In <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/aCgxGfVM_d0?si=DsHRmA-WgwIlSLPD">another video</a>, Newell discusses his thoughts on using AI as a tool. He predicted: "I think we'll be in this funny situation where people who don't know how to programme could use AI to scaffold their programming capabilities [and] will become more effective developers of value than people who have been programming for a decade."</p>
<p>It's unknown when the full interview will be published, but expect more to come.</p>
<p>Over at Steam, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-introduces-vague-new-rules-banning-certain-kinds-of-adult-content-to-appease-credit-card-companies">Valve has introduced new guidelines around adult-only game content</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-boss-gabe-newell-reveals-daily-routine-in-bizarre-new-interview-i-get-up-i-work-i-go-scuba-diving-then-work-some-more]]></content:encoded>

Could a new <em>Dark Souls</em>, <em>Dark Souls III </em>remaster, or <em>Armored Core VI</em> spin-off be less than a year away?</p><p>That’s the speculation now, given that this unannounced project is multi-platform, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/duskbloods-switch-2-nintendo-fromsoftware-exclusive-1851774242&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/duskbloods-switch-2-nintendo-fromsoftware-exclusive-1851774242">unlike <em>The Duskbloods</em></a></span>, FromSoftware’s multiplayer exclusive coming to Switch 2 in 2026. <em>Mp1st</em> also suggests that the studio’s DLCs often reuse codenames, so it’s likely any big new expansions for <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> are separate from this as well. Given that multiplayer spin-off’s strong sales and room to grow, we’re likely to see meaningful ongoing support for it at least through the next year. </p><p>Coupled with the fact that FromSoftware director Hidetaka Miyazaki seems intent on never revisiting <em>Bloodborne</em>, fan speculation has turned to <em>Dark Souls III </em>and <em>Armored Core VI</em>. <em>Dark Souls II</em> is the least-loved entry in the series and already received a next-gen port for PS4/Xbox One. <em>Armored Core</em>, meanwhile, has a history of getting expansions spun-off into standalone games not long after release. If <em>Armored Core VI</em> didn’t get something along those lines, it would be the first game in the mech fighting series not to see a direct follow-up within a couple years of release. </p><p>What we can confidently say FromSoftware isn’t working on is <em>Elden Ring 2.</em> “We’re not really considering developments such as an <em>Elden Ring 2</em>,” Miyazaki <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gateway/nintendo-switch-online-playtest-program-secret-mmo-1851786542&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gateway/nintendo-switch-online-playtest-program-secret-mmo-1851786542">said at the PlayStation Partner Awards last year</a></span>. He said the studio is instead exploring new types of genres, which is clearly reflected in both<em> Nightreign</em> (online PVE) and <em>The Duskbloods </em>(online PVP). But the studio hasn’t abandoned single-player games either. </p><p>“As previously mentioned, [<em>The Duskbloods</em>] is an online multiplayer title at its core, but this doesn’t mean that we as a company have decided to shift to a more multiplayer-focused direction with titles going forward,” Miyazaki <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-duskbloods-elden-ring-hidetaka-miyazaki-switch-2-1851774753&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-duskbloods-elden-ring-hidetaka-miyazaki-switch-2-1851774753">said earlier this year</a></span>. “We still intend to actively develop single-player focused games such as this that embrace our more traditional style.”</p><p>My money’s on this reportedly new, nearly complete project being <em>Armored Core</em>-related, but we’ll have to wait and see. Given the hot streak FromSoftware is on, I trust them to deliver on whatever they’re making. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/dark-souls-3-remaster-armored-core-6-fromsoftware-1851786550]]></content:encoded>

This coincides with Microsoft also closing the curtain on its longrunning operating system, with Square Enix adding that players will still be able to "likely" play the game after this date.</p><p>"We have found that continuing support for this operating system is a difficult proposition," <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/news/detail/e260c504b32d4dfd8be14d582f54b14664e9d8d0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Square Enix said in a statement</a>. "You will likely be able to play Final Fantasy 14 on Windows 10 systems even after the end of support. However, after we discontinue support, we will, as a general rule, no longer be able to provide support for problems arising as a result of the operating system."</p><p>The publisher says that it may still respond to requests for technical support, but on a case-by-case basis. Final Fantasy 14 first launched for PC in 2013--PS3--back in 2013, which was when Microsoft's Windows 8 operating system was still in its infancy. Due to its long shelf life, it has naturally been updated for multiple Windows OS versions since then, and its recent Dawntrail expansion provided the game with a graphical update.</p><p>Regarded as one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-mmorpgs/2900-5436/" data-ref-id="2900-5436">best MMORPGs of all time</a>, the game was ported to Xbox Series X|S last year.

            <p>FromSoftware is reportedly in advanced development on a project it's yet to announce, which could be out as early as next year.</p>
<p>That's according to <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/fromsoftware-i-development-unannounced-project-codenamed-fmc">mp1st</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/fromsoftware-reportedly-has-another-unannounced-game-that-could-release-next-year/">VGC</a>), which has information suggesting the Japanese studio has a multiplatform game with the codename FMC in development.</p>
<p>Due to "the nature of the source these details come from", mp1st believes this project is in an advanced stage and should be out next year. The fact it's a multiplatform game confirms FMC is not the codename for the already announced The Duskbloods, which will be exclusive to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>.</p>

<p>So what could this game be? That's where things get speculative.</p>
<p>Mp1st has noted that previous Dark Souls games - and 2023's Armored Core 6 - had codenames with abbreviations beginning with F.</p>
<p>For instance, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a> was FDP, Dark Souls Remastered was FHD, and Armored Core 6 was FNR. By contrast, Sekiro was NTCG/NTC, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> was GR (short for Great Rune).</p>
<p>The suggestion, then, is that FMC could be related to either the Dark Souls or Armored Core series.</p>
<p>Nick "Shpeshal Nick" Baker, co-host of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/Mmo392kpNoA">XboxEra Podcast</a>, reported last year Dark Souls 3 Remastered was in development. Series creator <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hidetaka-miyazaki">Hidetaka Miyazaki</a> previously told <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dark-souls-3-interview-it-wouldnt-be-right-to-cont/1100-6432425/">Gamespot</a> he considered Dark Souls 3 to be "the big closure on the series". But would this rule out a remaster?</p>
<p>Armored Core 6, meanwhile, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/armored-core-6-fires-of-rubicon-review">a successful revival of the series for FromSoftware</a>, selling 3m units in under a year. It seems likely the studio would want to build on that success.</p>
<p>All we officially know for sure is that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-is-bloodborne-meets-sekiro-meets-dark-souls-with-jetpacks-and-dinos-thrown-in">The Duskbloods will be heading to Switch 2</a> and will combine vampires with jetpacks and dinosaurs. Miyazaki has also stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftwares-focus-hasnt-shifted-to-multiplayer-miyazaki-says-despite-elden-ring-nightreign-and-the-duskbloods">FromSoftware's focus hasn't shifted to multiplayer</a>, despite this year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> and The Duskbloods.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-reportedly-in-advanced-development-on-an-unannounced-project-alongside-the-duskbloods]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
British video game composer and sound designer Peter Connelly, known for his work on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a> alongside the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/watch-dogs">Watch Dogs</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-island-2">Dead Island 2</a>, has been jailed for 16 months after being found guilty of fraudulently claiming a second Covid loan.
</p>
<p>
The news was <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/tomb-raider-video-game-composer-jailed-for-covid-loan-fraud">announced on the UK government's website</a> by its Insolvency Service agency, which appears to have embarked on a flashy series of press releases in recent months featuring dramatic ink-stamp graphics with words like "JAILED", "LOAN FRAUD", and "BANNED".
</p>
<p>
According to the agency's announcement, Connelly overstated his company's turnover to obtain a second Bounce Back Loan of £37,500 in 2020. Bounce Back Loans were provided to businesses who might otherwise have struggled to access finance during the Covid pandemic, but companies were only entitled to one. Connelly is said to have secured his first loan, for £22,000, at a different bank just a month earlier.
</p>
<p>
"Peter Connelly blatantly disregarded the rules of the Bounce Back Loan Scheme, designed to support small and medium-sized businesses during the pandemic," the Insolvency Service's chief investigator David Snasdell said in a statement accompanying the news.
</p>
<p>
In interviews with the Insolvency Service, Connelly told investigators he had been given the potentially lucrative opportunity to re-imagine the music for the Tomb Raider soundtrack, and had taken out personal loans and sold his car to complete the project. Things then "stalled" at the start of the pandemic, and Connelly's company, Peter Connelly Limited, went into liquidation in August 2021 without repaying either loan.
</p>
<p>
Connelly, who previously signed an Individual Voluntary Arrangement agreeing to repay his debts, was found guilty of fraud and was jailed for 16 months by Durham Crown Court on Thursday, 17th July. The 52-year-old is also banned from being a company director for six years.
</p>
<p>
Connelly composed soundtracks for a number of Tomb Raider games while the series was under <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/core-design">Core Design</a>'s stewardship in the 1990s and early 2000s, including The Last Revelation, Chronicles, and The Angel of Darkness. He's also provided sound design work for the likes of Watch Dogs, The Crew, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole">South Park: The Fractured but Whole</a>, and 2023's Dead Island 2.

No, this isn't a wind-up, and he can do what he wants. He created the series. Jeez.</p>
<p>Now, as revealed in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/jul/16/top-bananza-donkey-kongs-long-awaited-return-is-a-literal-smash-hit">The Guardian</a>'s interview with Bananza's producer, Kenta Motokura, (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/donkey-kong/nintendo-icon-shigeru-miyamoto-spent-his-time-testing-donkey-kong-bananza-smashing-and-digging-in-one-spot-which-tracks-following-his-hour-long-breath-of-the-wild-playtesting-stint-just-climbing-trees/">GamesRadar</a>), it seems "Shiggy" has an equally unique and stylish way of playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, which involved simply smashing and digging instead of doing anything that would further the campaign along whilst playing a pre-release version of the game.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4onqyph&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Motokura let slip (thanks) that whilst the team had the legendary creator check the unfinished adventure occasionally:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Instead of progressing through the game, he just stuck to one point, smashing and digging around a lot. It was a good thing to see him playing that way … it proved that there are a lot of things that players could potentially be curious about in the game.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hmmm. We're gonna be honest, this is how we play, too. Not quite sure what the issue is.</p>
<p>Of course, by having the man transfixed like this on one spot, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> team was able to ascertain that they <em>were</em> onto something good with the basic mechanics at the very least, which, with something as freeform as Bananza and all the voxel-based destruction presented therein, could be a challenge to keep track of.</p>
<p>As Kazuya Takahashi, the game's director, explained in the same interview:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“For this sort of game, where you can destroy anything, there was no precedent...So in that sense, we did struggle with various things. Developing the levels was quite challenging. For each stage, we wanted to make sure that the level would be fun even without that destruction element.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even when he's just messing around, it seems, Miyamoto can't help but be useful.</p>
