            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/677300/dotemu-ceo-games-retro-ninja-gaiden-marvel-absolum<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Dotemu is on a pretty good run. The video game studio and publisher has been around since 2007, and much of its history is largely working on remakes and remasters of older games. But it’s also been involved with major hits in the form of sequels and new games that are in the spirit of older classics, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21242538/streets-of-rage-4-review-ps4-xbox-steam-switch"><em>Streets of Rage 4</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/18/23172898/tmnt-shredders-revenge-classic-arcade-game-interview"><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge</em></a>.</p><p>All of that work is culminating in what looks to be a promising 2025, with three new but classics-inspired games: <em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em>, a new side-scroller for the series; <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em>, an arcade-y beat-’em-up; and <em>Absolum</em>, an original beat-’em-up with roguelike elements. </p><p>“We’re open to everything,” CEO Cyrille Imbert tells <em>The Verge</em>. Despite his title, Imbert says his job involves acting like an executive producer to bring together concepts that answer specific needs for franchises.</p><p>Before <em>Shredder’s Revenge</em>’s 2022 release, for example, there hadn’t been a good side-scrolling <em>TMNT</em> game for “a while,” he says. (<em>Turtles in Time</em>, which helped inspire the game, came out in 1991.) “We were convinced that there was a need for that.” There was: the game sold 1 million copies in its first week, <a href="https://x.com/TributeGames/status/1547248576467722243?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1547248576467722243%7Ctwgr%5Eb8d322e893ca98cd09185a69abca6879f7701a81%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fventurebeat.com%2Fgames%2Fteenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-shredders-revenge-sells-1m-in-its-first-week%2F">developer Tribute Games said</a> at the time.</p><p>Dotemu takes on “most of the risk” of a project based on an existing franchise, Imbert says, meaning that while the company needs to convince a franchise owner to get on board, Dotemu typically finances everything and is responsible for finding a studio to execute a concept.</p><p>“From A to Z, we are in control of the project, but we take the risk from A to Z as well,” explains Imbert. “Sometimes the studio will also participate financially, but it’s fairly rare, or it’s usually a minority of the total spending.” </p><p>With the new <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> game, for example, Imbert says he was familiar with the 3D iterations of the franchise on Xbox, and he also saw the success of recent action-platformers like <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F764790%2FThe_Messenger%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>The Messenger</em></a>. So, he started conversations with Koei Tecmo, and then worked with The Game Kitchen, the developer of <em>Blasphemous</em>, on a pitch. “That’s the story, basically,” Imbert says.</p><p>For <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em>, Imbert says that following <em>Streets of Rage 4</em>, “lots of people” had been asking for a new <em>X-Men</em> game that was like what you used to find in arcades. “We knew there was a need and that people would really like it,” he says, especially if it got a similar treatment as <em>Streets of Rage 4</em> or <em>Shredder’s Revenge</em>. The idea was “very obvious” to the Tribute Games team as well, so Dotemu and Tribute made a pitch to Marvel Games.</p><p><em>Absolum</em>, as a fully original game, is different from its other titles. From a pure business perspective, it’s a way for Dotemu to diversify its lineup so that the company doesn’t rely entirely on licensed games. Internally, the Dotemu team felt like they could do their own thing, and by making it inspired by classics, it would still fit in Dotemu’s lineup, Imbert says. They also wanted to work with Guard Crush, which worked on <em>Streets of Rage 4</em>, on another beat-’em-up.</p><p>It all adds up to what’s going to be a busy year for the company. It has three games that show the different approaches it has to making these kinds of experiences, and all of them were chosen for a specific reason. “That’s how we’re going to be proud of what we do.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford has double-doubled down on comments about the cost of Borderlands 4, by inviting "cost sensitive" fans to download <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tiny-tinas-wonderlands">Tiny Tina's Wonderlands</a> from the Epic Games Store for "FREE".</p>
<p>These latest comments come after Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford made headlines when he told a X/Twitter commenter that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/80-for-borderlands-4-too-costly-randy-pitchford-says-if-youre-a-real-fan-youll-find-a-way-to-make-it-happen">"real fans" would find a way to get their hands on a copy of the game, even if it came with a $80 price tag.</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4s-randy-pitchford-seeks-to-justify-80-real-fans-comment">He later tried to justify it</a>, all the while saying pricing was "not [his] call".</p>
<p>In this latest social media post, Pitchford wrote the word "free" four times, each time in blockcaps.</p>

<p>"For our real fans who may be cost sensitive, the very awesome and incredibly fun smash hit videogame Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands is FREE this week on the Epic Games Store," Pitchford <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1928506669996134705">wrote</a>. "Please enjoy this FREE gift by grabbing your FREE copy here, FREE."</p>
<p>Aforementioned real fans were quick to respond to this comment, too.</p>
<p>"You don't get to just walk back being incredibly tone-deaf to the world around you. We are out here struggling, Randy," <a href="https://x.com/Bungied2theTree/status/1928507212567097682">said</a> one player, while another <a href="https://x.com/TastyThumbs/status/1928512933576781858">wrote</a>: "Dude you need to shut up already. No reason games should be $80 especially if its anything like 3 or that shit ass excuse of a movie."</p>
<p>"I'm afraid the industry is moving in that direction and it’s just reality that we'll have to accept," Pitchford <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1928518680968634658">insisted</a>. "The price for Borderlands 4 is going to get announced by the publisher soon. My wish, having worked my ass off on the game, is for as many people as possible to get to play it."</p>
<p>When <a href="https://x.com/Lt_Frost935/status/1928508928851325080">another</a> commented: "So Randy, you think making backhanded comments towards your consumers about them being 'cost sensitive' is the plan? Wtf happened to you," he <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1928517946726396351">responded</a>: "Backhanded? There are literally people who want to play great video games, have a game-ready PC, but may not be able to spend enough to buy a new AAA game for awhile and this week there’s a free offer for one of the best shooter looters to come out over the last five years…"</p>
<p>"Saying 'cost sensitive' as the CEO of a company (In lieu of criticism of an $80 price tag for BL4) when a lot of your fan base is struggling to even pay for the roof over their heads and food on their tables is a crazy sentence to utter," said another <a href="https://x.com/Frost2dd/status/1928514727023411472">player</a>.</p>
<p>Just a week before the "real fans" kerfuffle, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/play-borderlands-4-first-and-understand-the-choices-weve-made-randy-pitchford-tells-fans-querying-minimap-removal">Pitchford implored we "play the game first and understand the choices [the development team has] made"</a> before passing judgement on changes Gearbox has made to the shooter's head's up display, including the removal of the mini-map.</p>
<p>Borderlands 4, as we learned a couple of weeks ago, is now arriving earlier than expected on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-release-date-moves-forward-perhaps-because-2k-knows-exactly-when-gta-6-is-coming-out">12th September</a>, and developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-some-new-borderlands-4-gameplay-to-go-with-that-revised-release-date">Gearbox recently shared more of its latest looter shooter in a new PlayStation showcase</a>. It showed off a couple of new Vault Hunters, some of its new weapons, new traversal mechanics, its new planet, and more all to whip-up enthusiasm for what creative director Graeme Timmins called "hands-down our best Borderlands ever".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
The next <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a> update, Chronicle, is due out next month with a newly revealed June 24th release date, and developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/kinetic-games">Kinetic Games</a> have offered up some details on what it calls one of the game's "biggest updates" so far. So, let's have a look at what that entails! The key addition with this update is the arrival of sound evidence, which as you can probably guess is a new haunting paranormal proof type that you'll acquire by using the newly added sound recorder.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
In turn, the journal has been completely redesigned. The photos tab will now be the media tab, which organises evidence into photos, videos, and those aforementioned sound recordings. You'll need to fill your book up with unique media to achieve a perfect investigation, and there's some new events like EMF spikes, interactions like rocking chairs, and different ghost forms to help you do this.
</p>
<p>
The media quality system has been revamped too. Now whenever you capture your first bit of evidence of any media type, it'll be marked as unique, so you'll get some bonus dosh and experience once you've wrapped up a contract. Plus, there are some bug fixes coming with this update too.
</p>
<p>
Following the release of Chronicle, a rework of Grafton Farmhouse will be coming too. Kinetic explained in a <a href="https://www.kineticgames.co.uk/blog/phasmophobia-dev-preview-19">blog post</a> that the whole map has been overhauled, namely some re-themed rooms, certain spaces increasing or decreasing in size, and there's a new "crowded attic, complete with sheet covered old furniture."
</p>
<p>
Earlier this year Kinetic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/phasmophobia-is-getting-a-new-haunted-location-but-wont-be-getting-any-more-big-maps">outlined the future of Phasmophobia</a>, promising more (but not big) maps, more map reworks, and Horror 2.0, the long awaited full release of the, uh, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game.

            <p>
Developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/rebellion-developments">Rebellion Developments</a> revealed a first look at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/atomfall">Atomfall's</a> first DLC expansion yesterday. Titled Wicked Isle, it unsurprisingly brings you to an island called Midsummer Island that is, in fact, a bit wicked, but like, in the bad way, not in the something a teen in the 2000s would say about something they like kind of way. Specifically it'll have a bit more of a folk horror vibe to it, which I'm certainly into conceptually. Lots of great folklore in the UK, as long as it's not stepping over frequently trodden upon territory.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Rebellion head of design Ben Fisher explains that the island is "close to the Windscale Atom Plant and as a result the levels of infection in both the people and environment are higher than on the mainland." It'll feature new enemies like pirate bandits and infected druids to fight, though you'll get some new weapons to fend them off in kind. That includes things like a blunderbuss shotgun, a cutlass, daggers, a new bow, and a beekeeper's staff. You know, the typical kind of things you find on a creepy island.

<p>
The completionists amongst you might also like to know (or dread to hear depending on how much you liked the game) that some of the new storylines can lead to new endings in the base game. No details on what those are, obviously, but I suppose the joy of experiencing things for the first time is just that!
</p>
<p>
There's a release date for the expansion too: June 3rd, just a few days away at the time of writing. Let's all see how it shapes up, as our own James found himself left wanting a bit with a lot of what Atomfall had to offer in his own <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/atomfall-review">review</a> of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/switch-2-couldnt-manage-4k60-in-nobunagas-ambition-awakening-complete-edition/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/switch-2-couldn%E2%80%99t-manage-4k-60-in-nobunaga%E2%80%99s-ambition-awakening-complete-edition.1203645/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/switch-2-couldnt-manage-4k60-in-nobunagas-ambition-awakening-complete-edition/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>There's a lot of speculation about what the new Nintendo Switch 2 console, due to debut next week in stores globally, can achieve in terms of system performance. The system supports up to 120 frames per second in handheld mode and up to 4K and 60 frames per second in docked mode, and complex open world games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-new-comparison-videos-highlight-how-the-game-and-technology-have-come-a-long-way-since-1-0-version/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and Star Wars Outlaws are being ported to the hardware.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-nobunagas-ambition-awakening-complete-edition-qa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">speaking to Koei Tecmo</a> in an interview about the launch title NOBUNAGA’S AMBITION: Awakening Complete Edition, we learned that the Japanese team tried to run the game at 4K resolution and 60FPS but had to scale down to just 1080P@30FPS. Here's what game producer and director Michi Ryu told Wccftech:</p>
<p><em>We are not using NVIDIA DLSS. The game runs at Full HD and 30fps. We also experimented with 4K and 60fps, but the power required to render the Japanese archipelago with these graphics is more than you can imagine and difficult to keep stable, so we had to give up. We hope to revisit this challenge in the future if the opportunity arises.</em></p>
<p>NOBUNAGA's AMBITION: Awakening isn't exactly the most taxing game, as you can see from its recommended requirements for PC:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>OS: Windows 10, Windows 11, 64bit</em></li>
<li><em>Processor: Intel Core i7-3770 or over (Windows 10), Intel Core i3-8350K or over (Windows 11)</em></li>
<li><em>Memory: 8 GB RAM</em></li>
<li><em>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060(6GB) or over, AMD Radeon RX580(8GB) or over</em></li>
<li><em>DirectX: Version 11</em></li>
<li><em>Network: Broadband Internet connection</em></li>
<li><em>Storage: 25 GB available space</em></li>
<li><em>Sound Card: 16-bit stereo, 48KHz WAVE file can be played</em></li>
<li><em>Additional Notes: 1920 x 1080 Display required</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Still, owners of the Nintendo Switch 2 will at least see a major graphics improvement, according to Ryu:</p>
<p><em>Thanks to the hardware evolution of Switch 2, the graphics have been significantly improved. Elements like the sea, sky, and ground look much more real, enhancing the immersive experience of the game. Being able to have this level of graphics in a portable format is a major point to be enjoyed by players. Additionally, with mouse operation via Joy-Con 2 and USB mouse support, intuitive controls are now possible. We have also included some game content that was previously only available in Asia, so we hope players will enjoy those as well.</em></p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on Thursday, June 5. Check out our info roundup article <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know-about-nintendos-new-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

            <p>Kinetic Games has confirmed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a>'s next content drop, Chronicle, will release on 24th June, and it'll be its "biggest update yet".</p>
<p>As well as introducing a "total overhaul" of how evidence is collected, the team said Chronicle will expand investigations with three new evidence types, a completely redesigned Journal, reworked levelling and progression, a refreshed Main Menu UI, and "many eerie surprises still lurking in the dark".</p>

<p>But at the "heart" of the Chronicle update is the debut of the all-new Sound evidence. An entirely new haunting paranormal proof type can be captured through the new Sound Recorder, bringing "a new dimension to gameplay, revealing subtle clues that might otherwise be drowned out by terrified screams". Available in the customary three upgrade tiers, players will be able to record audio from ghost events, Spirit Box responses, and Paranormal Sounds like those detected by the Parabolic Microphone.</p>
<p>It's this new evidence type that's necessitated a Journal upgrade, too. The Photo tab will be rebranded as "Media", and keep all your photos, videos, and new sound recordings in one place. Importantly, you'll have to fill your journal with all these unique media types, including "EMF spikes to ghostly interactions and fleeting glimpses of otherworldly forms", to complete a "perfect" investigation.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Kinetic Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"Chronicle will also introduce a revamped media quality system," Kinetic teased. "The first evidence capture of any media type will be marked as 'Unique', granting extra cash and XP rewards at the end of each contract. Any subsequent captures of the same evidence type will be classed as 'Duplicates', offering smaller rewards. The new system will also add tier bonuses based on the equipment used and adds all media captures into the Reward Multiplier, making every shot, sound, and sight count even more toward player’s final payouts."</p>
<p>Don't forget that this year, Phasmophobia will also rework Grafton Farmhouse, following Bleasdale Farmhouse's recent overhaul. Before then, though, we'll also get to see the new levelling and progression system and Main Menu UI when Chronicle arrives at the end of June.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phasmophobia-marks-22m-total-sales-with-its-2025-roadmap-and-changes-to-maps-kit-and-our-humble-journal">The ghost-hunting sim has sold two million copies on console</a> since it came out of early access last October, bringing the total sales across all platforms to 22 million. The development team recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phasmophobia-marks-22m-total-sales-with-its-2025-roadmap-and-changes-to-maps-kit-and-our-humble-journal">outlined the road ahead for the spooky sim in 2025</a>, confirming map reworks, new ghost-hunting equipment, "thrilling seasonal events", and a brand-new location, too.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Yesterday, ZeniMax Workers United-CWA, the union made up of more than 300 quality assurance workers at Microsoft via its subsidiary <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/zenimax-media">ZeniMax Media</a>, reached a tentative contract agreement with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/microsoft">Microsoft</a>. The union was formed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-qa-workers-just-formed-the-largest-union-in-video-games">back in 2022</a>, and has been bargaining with Microsoft in the intervening years since. Last month, the union was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/union-workers-at-fallout-and-elder-scrolls-company-ready-to-strike-against-microsoft-after-two-years-of-haggling">preparing to potentially strike against Microsoft</a>, but now it seems like this may be avoided.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
If fully agreed to, the contract will bring in "substantial across-the-board wage increases as well as new minimum salaries for workers", according to a <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-workers-reach-historic-tentative-contract-agreement-microsoft">press release</a> from the CWA. On top of that, there would be protections against arbitrary dismissal, grievance procedures, and a "crediting policy that clearly acknowledges the QA workers’ contributions to the video games they help create." The press release notes that the agreement would also include an agreement made in 2023 in relation to how AI is used in the workplace.
</p>
<p>
To be clear, this contract isn't set in stone just yet. Explanation meetings need to be held for members over the coming weeks, and according to the CWA a ratification vote should be completed by June 20th. If it goes through, it will be a huge win for the workers, and should set a big precedent for game workers employed at a Microsoft-owned studio.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, a union made up of almost 200 <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> devs <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/overwatch-devs-have-formed-an-almost-200-person-strong-union-with-the-cwa-called-the-overwatch-gamemakers-guild">was also formed alongside the CWA</a>, called the Overwatch Gamemakers Guild. Microsoft have already recognised this union as well. If things continue to go well for ZeniMax Workers United-CWA, perhaps we'll see wins at other unions further down the line. I for one have my fingers deeply tied for such results.

            <p>The Communications Workers of America (CWA) says it has reached a "historic tentative contract agreement" with ZeniMax Media staff at Microsoft.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-workers-reach-historic-tentative-contract-agreement-microsoft">statement</a>, the union calls the deal a "first for the video game industry", and revealed it had been negotiating for a first contract for "nearly two years".</p>
<p>"QA workers from across the country continue to lead the charge for industry-wide change," said Page Branson, Senior II QA Tester and ZeniMax Workers United-CWA bargaining committee member. "Going toe-to-toe with one of the largest corporations in the world isn’t a small feat. This is a monumental victory for all current video game workers and for those that come after."</p>

<p>The new contract is said to set "new standards for the industry" and includes "substantial across-the-board wage increases as well as new minimum salaries for workers". It also includes protections against arbitrary dismissal, grievance procedures, and a crediting policy that "clearly acknowledges the QA workers' contributions to the video games they help create", as well as a <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/zenimax-workers-reach-agreement-microsoft-contractors-and-ai">previously announced agreement</a> on how artificial intelligence is introduced and implemented in the workplace.</p>
<p>"Workers in the video game industry are demonstrating once again that collective power works. This agreement shows what's possible when workers stand together and refuse to accept the status quo," added CWA President Claude Cummings Jr. "Whether it's having a say about the use of AI in the workplace, fighting for significant wage increases and fair crediting policies, or protecting workers from retaliation, our members have raised the bar. We're proud to support them every step of the way."</p>

            <p>
Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/ea">EA</a> did the thing they oh so frequently loves to do, which is making a bad decision. This time, it was cancelling <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-panther">Marvel's Black Panther</a>, alongside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-shut-down-studio-they-opened-less-than-two-years-ago-cancel-black-panther-game">shutting down the two year old studio that was making it, Cliffhanger Games</a>. As every single announcement like this over the past few years has been, it was an incredibly frustrating one that can't be justified. Now, a new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-05-30/why-ea-canceled-a-new-black-panther-video-game-and-closed-cliffhanger-studios?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0ODYyODA1OSwiZXhwIjoxNzQ5MjMyODU5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWDM2MEFEV1JHRzAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.5NJqkn46ldc6n5M7d2faM7HRVe-P6bpFT21kj1vHHl8&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a> has shed a bit of light on why it was cancelled, as well as what the game might have been like.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
For starters, according to the report, the announcement came as a shock to Cliffhanger staff. This was in part because the studio was actively hiring, and Black Panther had passed a "gate", a term EA use for when executives look at how a game is doing and decide whether production should continue. 
</p>
<p>
Some sources did also say that EA executives were still frustrated it hadn't left pre-production despite being in the works for four years. That slowness was apparently due to the fact that a lot of now laid off staff were hired within the last year, even just the last few weeks and months.
</p>
<p>
The game itself sounded interesting too. Cliffhanger were being led by former Monolith head Kevin Stephens, the same studio behind the Middle-earth: Shadow series of games. Monolith's beloved (and patented) Nemesis System was apparently going to be the basis of a new system in Black Panther expanding on those ideas. This included things like being able to play as T’Challa, Killmonger and Shuri, all of which would be competing for the Black Panther role.
</p>
<p>
You'd be able to play as one of them, with the other two becoming rivals that you could form relationships with. There would be Skrulls, shapeshifting aliens, that would have been trying to overtake Wakanda, some of which might pretend to be allies, others acting based on previous things you as the player might have done. You can see the similarities to the Nemesis System.
</p>
<p>
However, showing off this feature to executives was apparently difficult; building a game and a studio side by side was part of the struggle here, reportedly. On top of that, Cliffhanger were based in Kirkland, Washington, an expensive city that meant staff would need appropriate (and deserved) wages. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-employees-upset-and-confused-at-return-to-office-mandate">EA also recently put in a return to office mandate</a>, so it all seems to add up to the game not being far enough along with a studio that costs too much to run, in their eyes. Probably worth a reminder that EA CEO Andrew Wilson and EA Entertainment president Laura Miele <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-execs-earned-60-million-in-2024-despite-layoffs-and-office-closures">took about $40 million home last year</a>.
</p>
<p>
The whole thing is just tremendously unfair, and a massive shame. I would have loved to have seen a studio build upon the Nemesis System, easily one of the most interesting gameplay systems in the past decade locked behind something as stifling as a patent. As always, big solidarity to those affected by the layoffs.

I want you to throw everything at them, make them wish they'd never tested us. Welcome to the Line of Fire, Burnt Moon.</i></p>

<p><em>Line of Fire Burnt Moon</em> is a new deck-building lane battler from Osprey Games. We've covered the full range of their <em>Undaunted</em> series on the site, from the recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/undaunted-2200-callisto-old-mechanics-new-tricks" rel="nofollow"><em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em></a>&nbsp;to the original <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/undaunted-normandy-north-africa-and-reinforcements-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Undaunted Normandy.</em></a></p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/line-of-fire-burnt-moon-4.jpg?itok=4uFZhHV1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/line-of-fire-burnt-moon-4.jpg?itok=Ov5S5dG4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Line of Fire Burnt Moon</em> includes 4 different types of units.</figcaption></figure><h2>Send In The Drones</h2>

<p><i>Line of Fire Burnt Moon&nbsp;</i>is listed as a card game, deck-building lane battler. It uses some mechanics from the awesome <em>Undaunted</em> series, but in a more compact package. It takes place in the same setting as <em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em>, with the LFA batting a group of hackers, rather than a group of protesting miners.</p>

<p><em>Line of Fire Burnt Moon</em> keeps the deck-building elements, action, and damage elements of <em>Undaunted</em>, meaning that you play each turn using the cards in your hand. 1 card is played each turn for its initiative value, and the remaining 3 are used for actions, either to place a drone on one of the 5 lanes, activate a drone already in a lane that matches the card being played, or gain an effect from a personnel card.</p>

<p>When a unit is damaged in <em>Line of Fire</em>, as with <em>Undaunted</em>, you remove a matching card from your hand, discard pile, deck, or board in that order, meaning that taking damage also affects your ability to activate a unit in the future, possibly that turn. You start the game with a set deck, and certain cards allow you to draw from your supply to your discard pile, waiting for your current deck to run out so they can be shuffled in. This allows you to tailor your deck as you play, drawing in the units that will be the most useful to you.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/line-of-fire-burnt-moon-3.jpg?itok=v0embd7Y 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/line-of-fire-burnt-moon-3.jpg?itok=PVnup-bp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Rather than on a game board,&nbsp;<em>Line of Fire Burnt Moon</em> takes place in lanes.</figcaption></figure><h2>Pick A Lane</h2>

<p>The deck-building elements are where the similarities to <em>Undaunted</em> end. Rather than taking place on a map with tokens, each player has 5 lanes that they are trying to control. <em>Line of Fire</em> is won when either player has 8 control points on the 5 lanes, or if their opponent has no MOSS-type units on the board. This changes the style of play from <em>Undaunted</em> dramatically, removing the strategic movement of the map and replacing it with lane control. This makes the board space a lot more compact for <em>Line of Fire</em>, but also means that you're going to be in your opponent's face, right from the start.</p>

<p>This immediacy has an effect on game length too, and games of <em>Line of Fire</em> can be extremely fast compared to <em>Undaunted</em>. There's also no randomness in the attacks, with attack and defence values fixed to the units and zone, and modified by controlling the zone, having certain types of units in the lane, and having fortifications present. This means that you always know in advance if your attack will be successful or not, and puts a focus on the activation order that you will take each round.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/line-of-fire-burnt-moon-6.jpg?itok=sJ9L5-sI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/line-of-fire-burnt-moon-6.jpg?itok=b8cNX7S_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Lanes in&nbsp;<em>Line of Fire Burnt Moon </em>can be controlled, and have fortifications built and destroyed on them.</figcaption></figure><h2>Choose a Side</h2>

<p><em>Line of Fire Burnt Moon</em> has 2 different factions, the corporate LFA and the POSIWID hackers. They both come with identical decks and a set of 5 identical lanes and are identified by unique artwork and the icon colors (blue for the LFA and pink for POSIWID). I initially felt like I wanted a difference in the forces, the different troop types in <em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em> gave each force a unique feel, but after a few games, the tighness of play and the ability to tailor your deck as you play means that an initial deviation in forces could have a signification impact on balance.</p>

<p>The short length of <em>Line of Fire</em> games means that every turn counts, and poor draws can have a big impact. There's a balance to be found in going first (which is a big advantage as you can decimate your opponents' turn by removing cards from their hand), with high initiative cards usually having the best abilities, and once used for initiative, they can't be used that round, and saving that card for a big effect, if you get a chance to after your opponents turn.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/line-of-fire-burnt-moon-2.jpg?itok=1hCytoQo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/line-of-fire-burnt-moon-2.jpg?itok=5Bc5CWl2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I'm a huge fan of how compact and tidy the&nbsp;<em>Line of Fire Burnt Moon </em>components are.</figcaption></figure><p>The game length also means that if you are decimated, draw poorly, or make some bad supply draw choices, the game is usually over quickly, and you can jump straight back into another game. The quick setup and play also mean that you don't get heavily invested in a game, and losing and starting again isn't as painful as an evening-long strategic masterpiece.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting how well all the components fit together in the small box. Both forces have their own colored box to keep them separate, which also fits the fortifications and site tiles. The only other components are an initiative card, 4 player aid cards, and two tiny rulebooks, which makes the components as tight, clean, and compact as the table space it takes up, and the gameplay itself.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/line-of-fire-burnt-moon-5.jpg?itok=rZpqeI_B 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/line-of-fire-burnt-moon-5.jpg?itok=ADbaJq6Q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Personel cards in&nbsp;<em>Line of Fire Burnt Moon </em>have an ingame effect but aren't played into the lanes.</figcaption></figure><h2>Line of Fire Burnt Moon Final Thoughts?</h2>

<p>My first thought was, 'Why is it not called <em>Undaunted</em>? I love <em>Undaunted</em> and this is <em>Undaunted</em>, right?' But I think that the <em>Line of Fire</em> name makes it clear that while there are <em>Undaunted</em> elements, this is new, and while players of <em>Undaunted</em> will feel comfortable, players who find <em>Undaunted</em> too complex, random, or too large on the tabletop shouldn't approach this expecting any of those things.</p>

<p><em>Line of Fire Burnt Moon</em> has gameplay as light and tight as the components that fit perfectly into the small box, but gameplay that well outgrows the small package. Games are fast and can be brutal, but the small play time means that if your opponent decimates you, you can get right back in for another quick game. The deck-building element means that small changes can have a big impact (good or bad), but the short game lengths mean that poor picks won't affect you for long. Players who like long-term deck-building strategy won't find it here, but players looking for a quick and sharp deck builder will love it.</p>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> is, to the surprise of no one, <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1928451382111052101">off to a bit of a flying start</a> (even if not everyone is completely in love with it just yet). I have no intention of diving into it just yet, in part because the solo experience doesn't interest me all that much, and I don't really want to be matched up with two other randos that would surely abandon me the moment I forget what my character can do. There isn't a duos option either, the thing I'm actually after, something that was a bit forgotten about during development, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/couples-afraid-of-being-third-wheeled-rejoice-fromsoftware-might-add-in-a-duos-option-to-elden-ring-nightreign">but might be coming further down the line</a>. The power of modding always comes through however, as despite only launching yesterday, there's already a seamless co-op mod that allows for duos.

<p>
Aptly titled <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenringnightreign/mods/3">Seamless Co-op (Nightreign)</a>, those of you that have previously indulged in a bit of seamless co-op in other <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/fromsoftware">FromSoftware</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-soulslike-games">Soulslikes</a> won't be surprised to hear that it comes from none other than Yui. She made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-seamless-co-op-mod-lets-you-play-the-entire-game-with-a-friend">the original Elden Ring Seamless Co-op mod a few years ago</a>, alongside a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-the-duskbloods-who-needs-them-now-that-dark-souls-seamless-co-op-mod-is-here">Dark Souls Remastered one last month</a>.

Much like those two mods, this one allows you to play online with a friend without all of the usual faff you'll find in FromSoft's games, even if it is easier to play with others in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-best-character-tier-list">Nightreign</a> than usual.
</p>
<p>
Right now, the mod is pretty simple. You can either create two or three player lobbies, and play online with them. Yui says that "there will be more to come, but whilst the current game lacks 2-player modes, this mod will be available in this state." Don't worry about it banning you from regular online either, as it prevents your game from even connecting to any matchmaking servers in the first place. What more could you ask for!

            <p><strong>UPDATE 6.07pm:</strong> FromSoft has issued a follow up suggestion for players still struggling with matchmaking on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> Neightreign.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1928822575318126753">In a post on X/Twitter</a>, the developer said: "If you have difficulty matchmaking on PS4 &amp; PS5, please check your NAT type. NAT type 3 may affect matchmaking on PSN.</p>
<p>"Check your NAT type with the following steps: Home &gt; Settings &gt; Network &gt; Connection Status &gt; Check Connection Status.</p>

<p><strong>ORIGINAL STORY: </strong> If you're jumping into <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> this weekend and are struggling to find a Player 2 - and/or a Player 3 - you're not alone.</p>
<p>In a brief statement posted to official Elden Ring social media accounts about an hour ago (Saturday, 31st May), developer FromSoftware is recommending players "restart the matchmaking process" if they're struggling to find a co-op partner.</p>

<p>"Nightfarers. If you encounter issues finding other players when launching an expedition in<a href="https://x.com/hashtag/ELDENRING?src=hashtag_click"> </a>Elden Ring Nightreign, please try restarting the matchmaking process," the brief message suggested.

<p>It may not quite fix the issue for all players, however; as one commenter asked in the replies: "How often am I supposed to restart it? Yesterday I spend [sic] several hours restarting it on PS5 to not even play one match…"</p>
<p>Finding a co-op partner is pretty important for Nightreign players. As Ed wrote yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/should-you-play-elden-ring-nightreign-solo">he wouldn't recommend Nightreign as a solo game</a> at this point as it's clearly not the intended way to play. However, it seems FromSoftware is aiming to respond to the current backlash to make solo play more feasible, with the studio previously stated it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-could-receive-two-player-mode-post-launch">considering a two-player option post-launch</a>, acknowledging it was "something that was overlooked during development".</p>
<p>"FromSoftware's multiplayer spin-off is an exhilarating rush and a celebration of the studio's prior achievements Souls veterans will devour," Ed wrote in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-review">Elden Ring Nightreign review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Sony is also offering a range of accessories at a discount, including the high-end <strong>DualSense Edge</strong>.

The premium gamepad lets you effortlessly switch between up to four personalized profiles, each of which lets you customize things like stick sensitivity and rear button controls. It’s just as easy to swap out stick modules, too, allowing you to quickly replace the stick tops should they ever wear out. What’s more, the rear triggers feature adjustable stops, so you can control how far they can be pressed and fine-tune your response time in shooters and other competitive games.</p><p>Additionally, the Edge offers the same haptics and adaptive triggers found on Sony’s standard DualSense controller, along with two styles of rear paddles, each suited to a different grip preference. Its charging cable also features a handy locking mechanism to ensure it won’t get yanked out while gaming; however, the Edge is limited to approximately eight hours of battery life when used wirelessly, meaning it doesn’t last quite as long as the OG DualSense. I guess that’s the price you pay for souped-up components and software, at least with Sony.</p><div><p id="more-ways-to-save-this-weekend"><h2>More ways to save this weekend</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>Now through tomorrow, June 1st, you can grab the last-gen <strong>Oura Ring Generation 3</strong> at Wellbots in the <a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1264455&amp;u=1225169&amp;m=83747&amp;urllink=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wellbots.com%2Fproducts%2Foura-ring-gen3-heritage" rel="sponsored">Heritage configuration</a> for $195 ($104 off) or the <a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1264455&amp;u=1225169&amp;m=83747&amp;urllink=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wellbots.com%2Fproducts%2Foura-ring-gen3-horizon" rel="sponsored">Horizon config</a> for $210 ($90 off) when using coupon code <strong>OURAVERGE25</strong>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/677301/the-switch-2s-promising-start-hides-an-uncertain-future<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>With the Switch 2 launch days away, analysts and consumers are watching to see how well Nintendo can follow-up the best selling home console in its history. Judging from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/655361/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-sold-out-walmart-gamestop-target">the pain of trying to secure a Switch 2 pre-order</a>, it seems like Nintendo has nothing to worry about – at least at launch.</p><p>Down the line, however, concerns about tariffs, a steadily rising cost of living, and a saturated market might cast a shadow on the Switch 2. <em>The Verge</em> talked to analysts, journalists, and normal video game playing people to put the Switch 2 launch in perspective. The key takeaway? While the console will assuredly have another blockbuster debut, its future looks much less certain.</p><p>The Wii U gets brought up a lot in the conversation surrounding the Switch 2, as it’s the most famous example of a Nintendo failure. “The Wii U, with its confusing controller-screen gimmick, sluggish user interface, and lack of a great <em>Custom Robo</em> game, was one of Nintendo’s worst flops,” <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/"><em>GameFile</em></a> author Stephen Totilo explained in an email to <em>The Verge</em>. </p><p>It sold less than 14 million units, a dramatic drop from the Wii, which sold over 100 million. And while Nintendo expects to sell one million more Switch 2 units in its first year than the Wii U sold in its life, that’s not necessarily indicative of long-term success. “The Wii U nevertheless sold out at launch back in November 2012,” Totilo said, “pulling in sales that <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/arts/nintendo-wii-u-hardware-sales-411119/">reportedly</a> topped the US launch sales of the Xbox 360 and PS3.”</p><p>When looking at launch sales projections and predictions, Mat Piscatella, video game analyst for Circana, warned that what a console does during its launch period is no indication of what it’ll do overall. </p><p>“Sales around the launch period are more reflection of available supply than anything,” Piscatella said. Another, more important factor for a console launch is the audience. “With anything regarding gaming right now, we have to separate the enthusiast market from the mass market, because they’re behaving very differently,” Piscatella added. </p><p>According to Piscatella, it’s the enthusiasts driving most of the Switch 2 hype we’re seeing, particularly since the last major console launches – the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S – happened five years ago. “We haven’t had new hardware designed for the masses in a long time,” he said. “So we have a big pent up demand just for something new.” </p><p>We’re seeing part of that demand satisfied by the Switch 2 pre-order frenzy. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643616/nintendo-switch-2-us-preorders-date">day pre-orders opened in the US</a> (after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643483/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-delayed-tariffs">a few weeks’ delay</a> because of President Donald Trump’s tariff chicanery) they sold out within hours. GameStop held in-store pre order events that saw people <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/655949/switch-2-in-person-preorder-gamestop">lining up outside storefronts</a> for hours to secure one.</p><p>But what will really determine the success of the console is how the bigger, mass market reacts, the same one that made devices like the Wii and original Switch such hits. Piscatella says this group is biding its time right now, “leaning into free-to-play and the content they already have.”</p><p>It’s a tricky time for the industry. New blockbuster titles are getting ever more expensive to make. Consumers, in turn, are buying fewer of them in favor of spending their time and money in established games, all while persistent layoffs three years running are making it harder for new games to come out on time. Add that to 2025’s unique and volatile US tariff situation and the associated price increases, and now is one <em>hell </em>of a time to launch a video game console.</p><p>“A games console is for a lot of people [...] an unaffordable luxury, especially for families,” said <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/keza-macdonald">Keza MacDonald</a>, video game editor at <em>The Guardian </em>and author of a forthcoming book about Nintendo’s history. MacDonald believes that most people who want a Switch 2 will have already pre-ordered one and that Nintendo’s real work will be to convince everyone else they want one too – a job the company doesn’t seem to be doing that well.</p><p>Silvie Krekow, a gamer who works at Vox Media as a creative director, says she knows “almost nothing” about the Switch 2. She doesn’t frequent gaming websites or consume gaming media, but she noted it was odd that “a 33-year-old gamer with disposable income who owns a Switch, PS4, and Xbox One” didn’t casually come across at least <em>some</em> Switch 2 information.</p><p>Other colleagues and self-described “gaming casuals” I spoke to expressed similar sentiments. According to MacDonald, Nintendo is handling this launch period very conservatively. “It’s like, ‘We know everyone’s going to buy this anyway. We don’t have to sell you on it,’” she said. “But I’m not sure if that’s true.”</p><div><p>At the Switch 2 Direct in April, Nintendo showed off a console with some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">slight quality-of-life and performance upgrades</a>. That may work for the enthusiasts – <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24344511/nintendo-switch-2-features-specs-handheld-dock-upgrade-comparison">they get more of what they already liked about the original</a>. But without something more to entice consumers beyond the diehards, the Switch 2 may struggle to find its audience.</p></div><p>“As for the [Switch 2 features] I’m not particularly excited,” said Kushal Raval, an operations manager at Vox Media. “The rolling controller sounds interesting, but the voice chat feature seems a bit pointless.” </p><p>Kushal owns a Switch, which he said didn’t run games like <em>Fortnite</em> as well as he wanted. And while the Switch 2’s technical upgrades will likely improve this, Kushal said, “With a $450–$500 price tag, I’m leaning much more toward getting a Steam Deck.”</p><p>The Switch 2 also has to compete against people content with its predecessor. “I have a Switch Lite that I bought during the pandemic,” said Jackie Noack, a video producer at Vox Media. “My husband has the Switch 1, and I don’t think we use them quite enough to justify replacing them.” For Noack, the console’s price is also a major factor. “$500 does seem steep to me!”</p><p>The Switch 2 will not be a dud like the Wii U, but it likely will not reach the heights of the original Switch. The price and lack of defining new features are two reasons, but perhaps the biggest is that the circumstances that fostered the OG Switch’s success were incredibly unique.</p><p>“The Switch really picked up <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22188452/animal-crossing-new-horizons-coronavirus-pandemic-year-2020">during the pandemic with <em>Animal Crossing</em></a>. That was an enormous hit,” MacDonald said. “And obviously that was such a unique combination of circumstances, I’m not sure that could happen again.” Piscatella agrees: “The Switch is an outlier success. I think [the Switch 2] is unlikely to do Switch numbers in the long term.”</p><p>The lead up to the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 has been filled with so much built-up pressure from the anticipation of hungry gamers eager for any news, which was exacerbated by prolific leaks and Nintendo’s typical propensity for silence. With the console’s official reveal and the enthusiastic response from dedicated fans, that pressure could not be higher – and with launch coming next week, the release valve is finally about to open.</p><p>“Simply because of the logo on the box, it’s safe to say that the Switch 2 is too Nintendo to fail,” said Totilo. “At least in the early going.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
