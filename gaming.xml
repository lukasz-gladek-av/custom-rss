			<p>Konami has debuted the launch trailer for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, showcasing the game one last time ahead of its long-awaited release one week from today, on August 28, 2025.</p>



<p>It's one last hurrah for the remake that Metal Gear Solid fans might have, <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-mgs3-remake-original-trilogy-returning/">prior to its announcement</a>, hoped for, but never really believed would happen, since it seemed like Konami was letting its biggest series, like Metal Gear Solid and Silent Hill, rest for years without a new entry. Sure, leaks like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-responds-to-geforce-now-database-leak-says-list-included-speculative-titles/">NVIDIA GeForce Now list</a> provided hope, but until we all saw it with our own eyes, it was tough to believe.</p>



<p>Which is what makes the fact that we're a week away from its launch all the more exciting and unbelievable, and adds to the excitement around the fact that this launch trailer makes it seem like fans of what many believe to be the best game in the iconic Metal Gear Solid series will not be disappointed by the remake.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>There's even more to look forward to after its launch, with the revised <a href="https://wccftech.com/konami-debuts-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-multiplayer-mode-fox-hunt/">Fox Hunt multiplayer mode</a> that will be out this fall. It's unfortunate that it <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-fox-hunt-multiplayer-fall-no-crossplay/">won't feature crossplay between devices</a>, but we don't live in a perfect world.</p>



<p>If you've never played the original Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, you officially have one week to get through it if you want to experience it ahead of the remake's launch, and if you decide to go on that journey, you're in for a treat, since MGS3 is arguably one of the best videogames ever made.</p>



<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater arrives on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on August 28, 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Earlier this month, the actual play phenomenon </span><i><span>Critical Role </span></i><span>announced a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-internet-reacts-to-critical-roles-big-shakeup-2000614488"><span>pretty big shakeup</span></a><span> for its upcoming fourth campaign. Matt Mercer, who had led each of the group’s previous stories as the game master, will instead take on a player role, and </span><i><span>Dimension 20</span></i><span>’s Brennan Lee Mulligan will step up to lead the next campaign in October. Now, we know what campaign four will entail, and it sounds much more complex than anything </span><i><span>Critical Role </span></i><span>has done before.</span></p> <p><span>In a 17-minute presentation, Mulligan outlined his plans for the campaign, and it sounds pretty ambitious. Rather than being set in Exandria, the world where </span><i><span>Critical Role</span></i><span>’s first three stories took place, this season will see the players enter a new world. Mulligan is dividing the 13 cast members into three distinct groups: Soldiers, Schemers, and Seekers, with each tackling the new fantasy setting and story from a different angle. As such, not every cast member will be present for each episode as it jumps between different perspectives. The announcement didn’t confirm which cast members would be in each group, but it did solidify that </span><i><span>Critical Role</span></i><span>‘s founding members will all be returning. The full cast is as follows:</span></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Laura Bailey</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Luis Carazo</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Robbie Daymond</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Aabria Iyengar</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Taliesin Jaffe</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Ashley Johnson</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Matthew Mercer</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Whitney Moore</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Liam O’Brien</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Marisha Ray</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Sam Riegel</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Alex Ward</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Travis Willingham</span></li> </ul> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="What Is Campaign Four?" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nY1JaWT-CKo?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Now that it’s confirmed the founding members will return for campaign four, some of </span><i><span>Critical Role</span></i><span>’s fans are</span><a href="https://x.com/fearnexcalloway/status/1958579478914863255"><span> more optimistic about all the changes on the way</span></a><span>, though others are still </span><a href="https://x.com/jordancates/status/1958579250627584376"><span>skeptical about the structure</span></a><span>, given that the entire crew won’t be playing together. At least, not at first. It’s entirely possible the story goes in a direction that sees all these disparate groups end up together down the line, which sounds like it would make for a sick finale, but will likely not happen until years from now. The first episode is set to premiere on October 2.</span></p>

<p>All of Stardew Valley's past collaborations have been one-sided, with Stardew Valley content showing up in other games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/balatro-update-adds-stardew-valley-cyberpunk-2077-crossovers/1100-6527387/" data-ref-id="1100-6527387">like Balatro</a>. The one exception was the Stardew Valley crossover with Terraria, for which both games received collaborative content with each other. Of this partnership, <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1958584766850375682" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Barone said</a>, "It was great.

The game goes for $15, but it's also gone on sale multiple times over the years. In any event, Barone--the game's sole developer--has likely made a small fortune from the game's sales.</p><p>Although Barone is not taking direct payment for any collaborations, he and Stardew Valley do benefit from the increased exposure.</p><p>Barone is now making a new title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/haunted-chocolatier-will-feature-a-world-larger-than-stardew-valley/1100-6532350/" data-ref-id="1100-6532350">Haunted Chocolatier</a>, in which players run a confectionary and interact with people and ghosts.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Borderlands 4 is set to be released worldwide on September 12, and it’s the broadest and most ambitious iteration that Gearbox has ever created. In Borderlands 4, players are set to explore a seamless open world and be presented with more choices and options for gameplay styles than ever before.</p>



<p>I sat down with Randy Pitchford at Gamescom to learn all about Borderlands 4, from what it took to create it to where it goes post-launch. He made a bold statement about the sales of the series and how impactful Borderlands 4 will be.</p>



<h2 id="h-we-re-now-expert-at-making-borderlands">‘We’re Now Expert at Making Borderlands’</h2>



<p>When I caught up with Randy Pitchford at Gamescom, I came away with a wealth of information about Borderlands 4, the upcoming open-world shooter from Gearbox. As the CEO and creator of the franchise, Pitchford has been pivotal in pushing the brand forward for the last 20 years, working with a dedicated and talented team to make this series something legendary.</p>



<p>Pitchford reflected on that and looked to the future of the series beyond Borderlands 4:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re just now beginning to dig into what our post-launch is, and we’ve got some <strong>extremely exciting plans </strong>that I cannot wait to share and talk about.</p>



<p>We’re now expert at making Borderlands 4, and when you’re making a game, you kind of figure out how to make it as you ship it. That’s one of the reasons why our post-launch content tends to be so good.</p>



<p>Thinking about Borderlands ‘beyond the game’, it’s so wild to me. I remember I came to Gamescom with Borderlands 1, just trying to scream from the tallest mountain to get anyone to pay attention to it and nobody cared.</p>



<p>A lot of people predicted that Borderlands wasn’t going to work.</p>



<p>Now, here we are with the game franchise, <strong>we will break 100 million units with this launch, easy</strong>, all in with the franchise.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Borderlands is more than 15 years old as a series, and as Pitchford explained, he’s spent the last 20 years of his life building it and pushing it out to the masses. With each iteration, the franchise becomes more explosive and energetic, and Borderlands 4 represents the (for now) pinnacle of the series.</p>



<p>The last numbers suggested that the series was sitting at around 92 million units sold, which means that Gearbox is anticipating at least 8 million sales with Borderlands 4.</p>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> what you’re most looking forward to about Borderlands 4.</p>

The game places players in control of a single dwarf miner, who can assume one of four classes: Driller, Engineer, Scout, and Gunner. Each class gives the dwarf different abilities and options as he explores Hoxxes IV, a procedurally generated planet filled with hostile aliens and riches beyond imagining.</p><p>Ghost Ship Games set the date for Survivor's release earlier this year, while noting that the decision to launch forced the publisher <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-1-0-launches-in-september-minus-one-mode/1100-6530779/" data-ref-id="1100-6530779">to drop Endless Mode from the game</a>. The devs at Funday Games noted that keeping Endless Mode posed several technical challenges that would have bogged down the game's release. However, there is still a plan to add Endless Mode to Survivor at a later date.</p><p>This isn't the only spin-off from the popular shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/deep-rock-galactic/" data-ref-id="5000-460551">Deep Rock Galactic</a>.

<p>Ys X: Proud Nordics is the "<em>definitive edition</em>" of Ys X: Nordics, according to NIS America, which launched <a href="https://wccftech.com/ys-x-nordics-is-out-october-25-in-western-countries/">last October outside Japan</a>. The most recent Ys release was <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ys-memoire-the-oath-in-felghana-review-a-classic-reborn/">Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana,</a> which arrived earlier this year. </p>



<p>Ys X: Proud Nordics follows Adol, accompanied by Norman Karja, standing against an undying force called the Griegr. It's then up to Adol and Karja to bring a group of adventurers together to defeat the Griegr, and save the Obelia Gulf.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Proud Nordics will also launch with "<em>improved graphical performance and quality of life updates</em>," and include "<em>new mechanics and content"</em> not previously available in the original version of the game from last October.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ys-x-nordics-one-more-memorable-adventure/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo reviewed Ys X: Nordics</a> last October, he called it "<em>one more memorable adventure</em>" in the long-running series. </p>



<p>"<em>While some of the changes made to the formula the series employed for 15 years may not sound too exciting on paper, they come together really well in Ys X Nordics, making it the first proper step forward for the franchise in quite a while. The increased focus on the narrative may put some long-time fans of the series off, as may the slight increase in complexity of its system, but if they manage to look past these non-issues, they will find an extremely solid ARPG and a worthy continuation of the long-running series by Falcom."</em> </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam</em> was on at least one fan’s Gamescom 2025 bingo card. “Hear me out: ‘Hell let loose Vietnam,'” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HellLetLoose/comments/1i4cqmp/hear_me_out_hell_let_loose_vietnam/">they wrote</a> on the Hell Let Loose subreddit at the start of 2025. Now that fan has fished their wish, as the game’s announcement trailer delivers the sequel that <em>Battlefield</em> players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/114rpnm/we_can_all_agree_that_we_need_a_battlefield/">are still waiting for</a>.</p> <p>Set during the years of the Vietnam War, between 1965 and 1973, the next <em>Hell Let Loose</em> will be a big departure from the first game’s WWII battlefields in Europe. In addition to the shift to dense jungle terrain, <em>Vietnam</em> will also feature aerial vehicles with players ferrying supplies by helicopter between camps, as well as river patrols by boat. North Vietnamese forces, meanwhile, will have access to sprawling networks of tunnels for bypassing enemy patrols and launching ambushes.</p> <p>It’s set to come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC sometime in 2026, with the publisher promising that both the new and existing games will continue to be maintained and updated alongside one another. Here’s the trailer:</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Hell Let Loose: Vietnam | Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JzYzYNVWZ_A?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><em>Hell Let Loose</em> blew up on Steam when it launched in 2021 despite being borne of a Kickstarter project years earlier by Australian studio Black Matter. Unlike recent battle royale free-for-alls or modern <em>Call of Duty</em>-style deathmatches, <em>Hell Let Loose</em> leans into the military simulation genre with 50v50 battles, in which players designated as officers share commands over priority voice channels and victory requires prioritizing communication and coordination over individual KDA ratio heroics.</p> <h2><em>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam</em> won’t replace the original</h2> <p>The new game will introduce six maps at the start focusing on key moments in the war like Operation Starlite and Operation Piranha. It will also transition the franchise to Unreal Engine 5, hopefully with all of the visual bells-and-whistles that allows and none of the PC performance issues we’ve seen so frequently in other games. But even while this entirely new campaign is being built out across multiple game modes, the developers swear post-launch support for the original <em>Hell Let Loose</em> will continue.</p> <p>“Our World War Two-based&nbsp;<em data-prosemirror-content-type="mark" data-prosemirror-mark-name="em">Hell Let Loose</em> is incredibly important to us and our players. We can reassure you all that Team17 remains fully committed to the franchise,” they <a href="https://www.hellletloose.com/blog/introducing-hell-let-loose-vietnam">write in an FAQ</a>. “<span id="34957365-b1f1-4f27-9533-d9421215840b" data-mark-type="annotation" data-mark-annotation-type="inlineComment" data-id="34957365-b1f1-4f27-9533-d9421215840b" data-prosemirror-content-type="mark" data-prosemirror-mark-name="annotation" data-hsprotectannotationtype="inlineComment">To bring </span><em data-prosemirror-content-type="mark" data-prosemirror-mark-name="em"><span id="34957365-b1f1-4f27-9533-d9421215840b" data-mark-type="annotation" data-mark-annotation-type="inlineComment" data-id="34957365-b1f1-4f27-9533-d9421215840b" data-prosemirror-content-type="mark" data-prosemirror-mark-name="annotation" data-hsprotectannotationtype="inlineComment">Hell Let Loose: Vietnam </span></em><span id="34957365-b1f1-4f27-9533-d9421215840b" data-mark-type="annotation" data-mark-annotation-type="inlineComment" data-id="34957365-b1f1-4f27-9533-d9421215840b" data-prosemirror-content-type="mark" data-prosemirror-mark-name="annotation" data-hsprotectannotationtype="inlineComment">to life, Expression have built a second team in order to </span><span id="34957365-b1f1-4f27-9533-d9421215840b" data-mark-type="annotation" data-mark-annotation-type="inlineComment" data-id="34957365-b1f1-4f27-9533-d9421215840b" data-prosemirror-content-type="mark" data-prosemirror-mark-name="annotation" data-hsprotectannotationtype="inlineComment">support both titles simultaneously. </span>One game will never come at the expense of the other.

We’ll see how the formula fairs and whether the sequel can live up to its premise. If you’re interested in checking out <em>Hell Let Loose</em> for yourself, it’s currently available on Game Pass on both console and PC. The game continues to get new updates with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HellLetLoose/comments/1je8esl/upcoming_roadmap_hell_let_loose/">a March road map</a> pointing to additional maps, vehicles, and cosmetics coming in the future.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/crisisx-preview-not-the-day-before-not-good-gamescom/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/crisisx-preview%E2%80%94it-isn%E2%80%99t-%E2%80%98the-day-before-2%E2%80%99-but-it%E2%80%99s-really-not-good.1277541/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>As I wandered the show floor at Gamescom, I stumbled upon an enormous booth for CrisisX, an all-new open-world, post-apocalyptic survival shooter from HK Hero Entertainment (Hero Games). This title popped up on my radar a couple of weeks ago when it was dubbed ‘The Day Before 2’ by sceptical gamers worried about ambitious promises and the ‘too-good-to-be-true’ image of CrisisX.</p>



<p>Let me preface this by stressing that CrisisX boasts one of the largest open maps ever made, promises to accommodate 5,000 players per server, is <strong>free to play </strong>(with microtransactions), and comes from a developer that hasn’t released anything major <strong>ever</strong>.</p>



<p>I played CrisisX at Gamescom, and I’m here to give you the full rundown.</p>



<h2 id="h-who-the-hell-is-toby">Who The Hell is Toby?</h2>



<p>I started playing CrisisX and was presented with a diverse selection of characters to choose from. At first, I was pleased to see a super detailed character customization screen, but things turned sour <strong>as soon as the game began</strong>. I was walked through a brief tutorial stage that introduced me to weapons and basic mechanics, and then I quickly uncovered how rough CrisisX is.</p>



<p>I’m sure the voice acting was AI-driven, and it was riddled with grammatical errors and nonsensical lines. The animations and visual platter were straight out of a mobile game from days gone by, and the enemies were low-IQ cannon fodder, presenting no real challenge.</p>



<p>At one point, while looking for a mode of transport (a poorly designed horse), I came across a hulking, stronger zombie enemy named ‘Toby’. Why he was named Toby, I’ll never know.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="CrisisX - Official Trailer | Gamescom 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mcAGdnjm64U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>CrisisX has a huge focus on the massive game map that can be explored at will. Within seconds, I’d opened this map, which is reportedly more than <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/the-day-before-2-everyone-is-skeptical-about-this-survival-game-promising-a-map-five-times-the-size-of-dayz-and-5-000-players-per-server/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">five times the size</a> of DayZ’s map, and been <strong>utterly overwhelmed </strong>by all the icons and possibilities of this gargantuan environment.</p>



<p>Where the map is complex and packed with markers, the gameplay loop is numbingly basic and uninspiring. You kill things, you loot things, you build things, and you collect things. The version of the game I played had no other users around, but the full product should have servers that accommodate 5,000 players.</p>



<p>Sure, you’ll need a huge map for that, but 4,999 other players vying to destroy my enjoyment of the already drab CrisisX is <strong>not an encouraging thought.</strong></p>



<figure><figcaption>Here’s a snap of the CrisisX map… Or a small part of it, at least.</figcaption></figure>







<p>I’m certainly not going to agree with anyone dubbing this ‘The Day Before 2’, though. That was a rug pull at best and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/signs-the-day-before-was-a-scam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nothing short of a scam</a> that lasted a matter of hours on the open market before being pulled and decimated by the shady developers who have since disappeared into the abyss.</p>



<p>For starters, <strong>I’ve played CrisisX</strong>, which is much further than I (and most other people) got with The Day Before.</p>



<p>CrisisX doesn’t have a release date yet, but it’s supposed to drop next year. Perhaps it’ll be sharpened by the developer before then, and we can enjoy whatever the finished product looks like.</p>



<p>Let me know if you’ve had your eye on CrisisX on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">NIS America has revealed that Ys X: Proud Nordics will arrive on Switch 2 and PC early next year in the US. The company calls this the definitive edition of the RPG, as it boasts a new storyline, mechanics, and dungeon.</p><p dir="ltr">Ys X: Proud Nordics launched on Switch 2 last month in Japan. Originally, the RPG came out in 2023 in Japan before NIS America <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ys-x-nordics-making-its-way-to-the-west-later-this-year/1100-6521078/">brought Ys X: Nordics to the West in 2024</a> for PC, PS4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch. So far, there haven't been any details about a possible upgrade path for Ys X: Proud Nordics on Switch 2 or PC. There have been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-free-nintendo-switch-2-game-updates-changes/2900-6591/">paid Switch 2 upgrades</a> for Nintendo's new system as well as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-free-nintendo-switch-2-game-updates-changes/2900-6591/">free patches</a> for the hybrid system since it came out in June.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjgJnBtV-j4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TjgJnBtV-j4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Per usual, Ys X follows Adol Christin (the protagonist of every Ys game), though this time he's joined by a sailor named Karja. The game sees the duo dealing with the "looming threat of an undying horde known as the Griegr," per a press release. "Aboard their ship, the Sandras, Adol and Karja gather a trusty crew of friends and allies as they go head-to-head with the Griegr in one unforgettable journey!"</p><p dir="ltr">Intriguingly, Ys X actually takes place after Ys II and features naval combat for the first time in the franchise. No previous knowledge is needed with Ys X, however, since it's a standalone story. In addition to Switch 2, Ys X: Proud Nordics can be found on three different PC storefronts: Steam, Epic Games Store, and GOG.</p><p dir="ltr">For those who don't want to wait, the original Ys X: Nordics is on sale for $30 on PS5 and $35 on Switch.</p><p><strong>Ys X: Nordics Deluxe Edition</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Ys+X%3A+Proud+Nordics+Coming+To+Switch+2+And+PC+In+2026&amp;fnauthor=evancampbell&amp;fndate=2025-08-21+11%3A33%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-08-21+11%3A54%3A06&amp;fnarticle_id=6534185&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Standard+News&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-100770772-13142092%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fys-x-nordics-deluxe-edition&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fys-x-proud-nordics-coming-to-switch-2-and-pc-in-2026%2F1100-6534185%2F&amp;event_type=click" rel="nofollow ">PS5</a> -- $30 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Ys+X%3A+Proud+Nordics+Coming+To+Switch+2+And+PC+In+2026&amp;fnauthor=evancampbell&amp;fndate=2025-08-21+11%3A33%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-08-21+11%3A54%3A06&amp;fnarticle_id=6534185&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Standard+News&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-100770772-13142092%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fys-x-nordics-deluxe-edition&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fys-x-proud-nordics-coming-to-switch-2-and-pc-in-2026%2F1100-6534185%2F&amp;event_type=click" rel="nofollow ">Switch</a> -- $35 (<del>$60</del>)</li></ul>

<p>NIS anchors another Game-Key Card release</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>NIS America is bringing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ys-x-proud-nordics">Ys X: Proud Nordics</a> to Switch 2 in the West in <strong>early 2026</strong>, the publisher has announced. But, like its other Switch 2 releases in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/disgaea-7-complete">Disgaea 7 Complete</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-heroes-trails-beyond-the-horizon">Trails Beyond the Horizon</a>, it'll be a Game-Key Card (as per the <a href="https://eustore.nisaeurope.com/products/ys-x-proud-nordics-deluxe-edition-nintendo-switch-2">store listing</a>).</p>
<p>Now, if you're confused and thinking that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ys_x_nordics">Ys X</a> is already out on Switch, you're not wrong — this is an expanded version of the 2023 (2024 in the West) action RPG. Proud Nordics has been out in Japan since 25th July, so we won't have to wait too long.</p>
<p>As well as being a Switch 2 release, meaning there will be a bump in performance and visuals, Proud Nordics adds additional quality-of-life improvements, new mechanics, and new challenges.</p>
<p>But the biggest draw is Öland Island, a brand new map that "seamlessly" adds in new story elements to the game. So it's a much more expanded rerelease than just a 'bump', from the sounds of it.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game from NIS:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Experience Adol and Karja's unforgettable journey across Obelia Gulf with new quality of life improvements, then discover the new story centering around Öland Island, and the mysterious newcomers Canute and Astrid. And once you're ready, challenge yourself in the devious, time-trial dungeon of Muspelheim, where every second counts. Your new adventure awaits!</p>
<p>As the definitive edition of this critically acclaimed entry in the <em>Ys</em> series, <em>Ys X: Proud Nordics</em> offers all of the fast-paced combat and enthralling narrative of the original release, with new mechanics, a high-difficulty dungeon, and a brand-new storyline seamlessly integrated throughout the game.</p>
<p>After a tense encounter at sea, the young red-haired adventurer Adol and the proud Norman Karja find themselves bound together by shackles of Mana, and by the looming threat of an undying horde known as the Griegr, who seek to pillage the vibrant Obelia Gulf. Aboard their ship, the Sandras, Adol and Karja gather a trusty crew of friends and allies as they go head-to-head with the Griegr in one unforgettable journey!</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>


<p>We <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/ys-x-nordics">were fans of the original Switch version</a>, despite some issues with the sailing — and we've seen online from those who've played the Japanese release that the boat mechanics have been tweaked in Proud Nordics. So if you haven't yet picked up the game on Switch, maybe hold out for this one.</p>

			<p>James Gunn, who has been leading the comeback for DC alongside Peter Safran, spends most of his time focused on upcoming DC films, like the recent Superman movie he directed. His role does also involve him overlooking upcoming DC games, and on that subject he's admitted that there is "<em>one thing in particular</em>" that he's excited about, but the biggest projects all remain in "<em>early stages</em>."</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/dc-tv-shows/after-years-of-silence-dc-boss-james-gunn-teases-dcus-gaming-plans-theres-one-thing-in-particular-im-excited-about-but-it-does-take-time/">GamesRadar</a>, Gunn vaguely spoke about what's to come for DC games, which is one of the four pillars along with <a href="https://wccftech.com/wb-games-has-restructured-into-divisions-focused-franchises-harry-potter-game-of-thrones-mortal-kombat-and-the-dc-universe/">Harry Potter, Mortal Kombat, and Game of Thrones that WB Games</a> is focusing its efforts on.</p>



<p>"<em>There's been some slight movement on different things,</em>" Gunn began. "<em>We have a couple of little DC games coming out. But we also have talked about – and in early stages of planning – some bigger things. One thing in particular I'm excited about, but it does take time. There's been some changes in Warner Bros Games, and so we're dealing with new people.</em>"</p>



<p>Of course, some of the changes Gunn is referring to include the restructuring of WB Games to focus on just four major franchises, along with the closing of <a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/">Monolith Productions, Player First Games, and the cancellation of the Wonder Woman</a> game that was previously in the works.</p>



<p>At the time of this writing, the next major game featuring a DC character is <a href="https://wccftech.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-tt-games-gamescom-onl-2025/">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a>, which was announced earlier this week during <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom ONL 2025</a>, and will arrive on PC and consoles sometime in 2026.  </p>

			<p>Pearl Abyss has announced Edania, a new region for Black Desert Online that's available across all servers right now, at Gamescom 2025.</p>



<p>Edania's launch adds a new main story questline titled The Society of the Equilibrium, which will be available only to players at level 60 or higher. It'll also introduce seven branching questlines with the Edania Adventure Log, for players to further map their journey into the demon realm.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>There are also new PvE weekly challenges and a new PvP challenge that players can earn after they've defeated a regional boss. The update also adds new gear, enhancements, artifacts, consumables, and new enemies to fight across new lands to explore. The Azure Battlefield, Nymphamaré Castle, and Orbita Castle are the three new lands, each with unique enemies to fight and a regional boss to defeat.</p>

<p>"<em>Edania is a high-risk, high-reward destination for the boldest of Adventurers," </em>Pearl Abyss writes in a press release. "<em>Whether you're a master of combat, a skilled craftsman, or a sovereign in the making—your legacy in the Demon Realm awaits.</em>"</p>



<p>Pearl Abyss added <a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-reveals-black-desert-march-content-roadmap-including-games-first-hardcore-server/">Black Desert Online's first hardcore servers</a> earlier this year. Beyond Black Desert Online, Pearl Abyss is also working on Crimson Desert, which it recently delayed into <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-delayed-to-q1-2026/">Q1 2026</a> ahead of the studio making an appearance at Gamescom 2025 with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-crimson-desert-gameplay-gamescom-2025-demo/">Crimson Desert demo</a> for attendees at the convention to try for themselves, just like they did last year.</p>



<p>The next major update for Edania will arrive on September 11, 2025.</p>

        <p>Hang on, they're talking about us!</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Time for your weekly helping of legal Subnaughtiness. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> developers Unknown Worlds are suing recently departed director Charlie Cleveland, CEO Ted Gill, and studio co-founder Max McGuire for, amongst other things, stealing a bunch of game design files shortly before <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-suddenly-replace-three-subnautica-2-leads-with-one-of-the-execs-behind-callisto-protocol">they were fired</a>.
</p>
<p>Or at least, an external legal firm acting on behalf of Unknown Worlds have filed suit. The firm in question - Richards, Layton, and Finger - are also representing parent company Krafton as they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-claim-former-subnautica-2-leads-have-resorted-to-litigation-to-demand-a-payday-they-havent-earned">defend themselves</a> against <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paying-the-subnautica-2-team-their-promised-bonus-would-be-embarrassing-kraftons-ceo-allegedly-told-the-games-chief-over-lunch">an earlier lawsuit</a> brought by Cleveland, Gill and McGuire, who are accusing Krafton of dismissing them unfairly and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-plan-to-delay-subnautica-2-and-deny-the-studio-a-250-million-bonus">delaying Subnautica 2's release</a> to avoid paying out a timed $250 million bonus.
</p>
<p>Krafton 100% own Unknown Worlds, and are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a>'s publisher. So why isn't this lawsuit coming from them? As PCGamer's Andy Chalk <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-subnautica-legal-dispute-takes-a-surprise-twist-as-unknown-worlds-not-krafton-sues-its-former-bosses-for-stealing-confidential-material-on-their-way-out-the-door/">suggests</a>, the suspicion is that the lawyers have picked Unknown Worlds as plaintiff, rather than Krafton, because they think they'll get more sympathy that way from Johnny Average Gamer. After all, everybody knows publishers are stinkheads.</p>
<p>A Krafton spokesperson has justified the situation as follows to Chalk: "While Krafton is the parent company, the contracts, intellectual property and confidential information at issue belong to Unknown Worlds. The defendants were executive leadership at Unknown Worlds, and their obligations, including confidentiality and fiduciary duties, were owed to that entity."
</p><p>The lawsuit itself broadly reiterates Krafton's earlier claims that the three banished executives shirked their responsibilities toward Subnautica 2, and that they were only pushing to get the game released this year for the sake of that $250 million bonus (Cleveland, McGuire and Gill stood to receive 90% of it personally, but claim they planned to distribute most of their earnings to the rest of the Unknown Worlds team).
</p>
<p>The document is full of redacted bits, excerpts from internal correspondence, and a bunch of screencaps from Reddit that are offered up as evidence that regular Subnautica players think the departed studio executives are at fault. Congratulations, redditor Plebius-Maximus - when they turn all this into a movie, you are probably going to be played by Justin Timberlake.
</p>
<p>Cleveland is accused of being first to "stray" by leaving video game development in 2023 to "learn how to produce movies and explore other interests". The lawyers say that by 2024, he had abandoned "all creative or other leadership roles with the Company". As for McGuire, he's said to have "spent 2022 and 2023 buried in the passion project of a new game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moonbreaker">Moonbreaker</a>, even well past the time that it became clear that Moonbreaker was a commercial failure". The lawsuit accuses Gill, the CEO, of doing nothing about these "functional departures from game development of leadership". It alleges that development "stalled" as a result, resulting in projected release date delays and a "degraded" project scope. 
</p>
<p>With regard to the much-ballyhooed $250 million "earnout", the lawsuit accuses the three of trying to "publish whatever they could under the Subnautica 2 name on a timeline" that would ensure they received the money, despite the game falling "far short of the Company's internally-set expectations for the early access release". It claims that when Krafton rejected their proposals, the three executives threatened to self-publish Subnautica 2. It was this conversation, the lawsuit claims, that led to Unknown Worlds terminating their employment.
</p><p>That much, we've approximately heard before. But the accusations of stealing documents from the company are new. On June 2nd and June 30th- shortly before he was fired - Gill allegedly exported his entire Unknown Worlds email account, triggering an IT alert. McGuire is said to have downloaded 99,902 company files shortly before his own termination, including documents from Moonbreaker's development. Cleveland supposedly "downloaded 72,140 Company files" between June 26th and his termination on 1st July, only to be interrupted when Unknown Worlds cut off his access to the system in the course of his firing. 
</p>
<p>When the mass downloading of files was reported, Unknown Worlds apparently sent a cease &amp; desist letter to the three, demanding that they return any confidential info in their possession. According to the lawsuit, the fired executives at first refused, and then proposed to delete files rather than turn over their devices for inspection. The lawsuit alleges that Gill, Cleveland and McGuire are both using this confidential information in their lawsuit against Krafton, and have also "improperly used or disclosed Confidential Information to members of the press".</p>
<p>It's not clear what this last part refers to, but it could be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-leak-is-authentic-say-publishers-who-benefit-the-most-from-that-leak">the internal Subnautica 2 planning document</a> that appeared online in July. Krafton were happy to confirm that as authentic, which is understandable given that the document's mention of stripped-out features supports their case for delaying the game.</p>

<p>You can read all 74 pages of the redacted Unknown Worlds lawsuit on <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/904055347/Unknown-Worlds-Entertainment-v-Cleveland-McGuire-and-Gill-Verified-Complaint?secret_password=tUP1182XR5apSqla4qJM">Scribd</a>. All of this is going to chug along for a while longer, I expect. For the moment, I will close by noting that the lawyers accuse Gill, Cleveland and McGuire of carrying out a "trifecta of mischief", which is a magic phrase and also, sounds like the title of a Bond film. Perhaps they should cast Idris Elba as Plebius-Maximus - on reflection, I'm not sure Timberlake has the starpower for something this high octane. He can play Johnny Average Gamer instead.</p>

<p>EA Sports NHL 26 is just two weeks away from release, and more details about the game’s Be A Pro mode have surfaced ahead of launch.</p>



<p>After the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nhl-26-be-a-pro-features-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deep dive on the mode</a>, fans still had some questions about various features of the mode. While not all questions have been answered, there are some additional details about what will—and won’t—be in the mode.</p>



<p>On the <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/nhl-26-general-discussion-en/nhl-26-be-a-pro-reveal/12488006?after=MjUuNHwyLjF8aXwxMHwzOToxfGludCwxMjQ4Nzk4NSwxMjQ5NjMzMg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EA forums</a>, community manager Aljo answered a few questions about tunnel walkouts, junior hockey, contracts, and more. </p>



<p>Regarding how your career starts, after the World Juniors kicks things off, you’ll be able to play in Euro leagues or the CHL. Once you are drafted, however, you can only play in the NHL or AHL, depending on your performance.</p>



<p>When it comes to tunnel walkouts, something that fans have been waiting to see come back, NHL 26 only has them in Be A Pro at the game’s launch. What’s more is they will only happen for specific moments, not every game. </p>



<p>The mode also won’t feature contract negotiations for your player nor can you view league injuries or transactions.</p>



<p><strong>“Be a Pro is more about the journey of your own player so that’s where the focus is,” </strong>Aljo said regarding injuries and transactions.</p>



<p>Lastly, Be A Pro will support custom rosters provided they are created before you start the mode.</p>



<p>NHL 26 releases on September 5—if you buy the Deluxe Edition—for Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5. Those who buy the Standard Edition get the game on September 12.</p>



<p>What do you think of what will and won’t be in NHL 26 Be A Pro? Let us know down below, and take the discussion even further in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1030300/Hollow_Knight_Silksong/"><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></a> will be <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/11xf7azcuebhybgossfhdc0mphiqbs-en88t-53h3w">released on September 4</a>. It will come out simultaneously on Windows, macOS, Linux, Xbox, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, the Nintendo Switch, and the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>On paper, "game gets release date" isn't particularly groundbreaking news, and the six-year wait between the game's announcement and release is long but nowhere near record-breaking. People have waited longer for&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4</em> (announced 2017, releasing this fall),&nbsp;<em>Duke Nukem Forever</em> (announced 1997, released 2011), the fourth&nbsp;<em>BioShock&nbsp;</em>game (in development for a decade at a studio that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-20/take-two-guts-bioshock-studio-after-a-decade-of-development">just got ravaged by layoffs</a>), and <em>Half-Life 3&nbsp;</em>(never actually announced, but <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/fresh-leaks-suggest-half-life-3-development-may-be-nearing-completion/">hope springs eternal</a>), just to name a few.</p>
<p>But fans of 2017's&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight</em> managed to make the wait for&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em> into a meme. It's hard to explain&nbsp;<em>why</em> if you haven't already been following along, but it's probably got something to do with the expected scale of the game, the original <em>Hollow Knight</em>'s popularity, and the almost total silence of the small staff at Team Cherry, the game's developer.</p>
<h2>Why does this game make people act this way?</h2>
<p><em>Silksong</em> began development as <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/11662585/hollow-knight/posts/1088384">downloadable content for <em>Hollow Knight</em></a>, a gloomy Metroidvania about a silent, unnamed protagonist battling their way through the fallen insect kingdom of Hallownest. <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/11662585/hollow-knight">Funded via Kickstarter</a>,&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight </em>became&nbsp;a huge hit thanks to its distinctive 2D art style, atmospheric soundtrack, sharp and satisfying gameplay, memorable boss fights, and worldbuilding that gave players just enough information to encourage endless speculation about Hallownest's rise and fall.</p>
<p>The expansion, first mentioned all the way back in 2014, would focus on Hornet, who fought her battles with a needle and thread. She had been an NPC in the main game but would become a fully playable character in the DLC.</p>
<p>By February of 2019, Team Cherry <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/hollow-knight-silksong-revealed">announced</a> that the Hornet DLC had become "too large and too unique to stay a DLC" and would instead be "a full-scale sequel to <em>Hollow Knight</em>."</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>And then, silence.&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight</em> had been developed mostly out in the open, with <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/11662585/hollow-knight/posts">a steady cadence of updates posted to Kickstarter</a> about the game and its DLC. But whatever was going on with&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em> was happening behind closed doors. Status updates came, at best, once or twice a year, and usually amounted to "<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/five-years-after-it-was-announced-hollow-knight-silksong-devs-assure-rabid-fans-they-are-still-hard-at-work-on-the-game/">they're still working on it</a>."</p>
<p>Since then,&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight&nbsp;</em>has only become a bigger hit, and&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em> has only gotten more anticipated. Team Cherry said&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight</em> had sold 2.8 million copies as of early 2019 when the <em>Silksong</em> announcement went out. As of today, that number is over 15 million, and almost 5 million people have come together to <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/silksong-has-48-million-steam-wishlists?r=55fzef&amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;triedRedirect=true">make&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em> into Steam's most-wishlisted game</a> by a margin of nearly 2:1.</p>
<p>The first game's popularity, sky-high expectations for the second game, and the near-total information vacuum meant that every single scrap of <em>Silksong</em> news, no matter how small, was pored over and picked apart by a constellation of Reddit threads and SEO-friendly news posts. People spotted and speculated about the significance of tiny <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/hollow-knight-silksong-gets-steamdb-updates-and-at-this-point-i-cant-tell-if-the-end-is-nigh-or-if-im-just-hope-poisoned/">Steam database updates</a>, <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1774892537263583386?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1774892537263583386%7Ctwgr%5Ee8e807ee8f5ca38d1acc2a28135b182c1d1db15a%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redditmedia.com%2Fmediaembed%2F1btf5t3%2F%3Fresponsive%3Dtrueis_nightmode%3Dtrue">new listings in digital game stores</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/helyearelyea/status/1775032825386832238?lang=en">purported ESRB ratings</a>, trying to divine whether the game was getting any closer to release.</p>
<p>People could even make news out of a&nbsp;<em>lack</em> of news, an art form perfected by a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DailySilksongNews/videos">DailySilksongNews channel on YouTube</a> with hundreds of videos and 220,000 subscribers ("There has been no news to report for <em>Silksong</em> today," host Cory M. deadpans in one of the channel's typical update videos).</p>

<p>This cottage industry's collective frustration hit a peak in mid 2023. At an Xbox game showcase in June of 2022, <em>Silksong</em> gameplay footage was included in a reel of games that were meant to be released "<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-release-window-next-12-months">within the next 12 months</a>." In the 11th month of that 12-month wait, an update <a href="https://x.com/griffinmatta/status/1656106351184199680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1656106351184199680%7Ctwgr%5Edeee5d75bec36d2332b802e948a5995decb3a96a%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fhollow-knight-silksong-has-been-delayed%2F1100-6513963%2F">came down from Team Cherry</a>: the game wouldn't be out in the first half of 2023 after all, and there would be no updated estimate about its release window.</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p>Since then, <em>Silksong</em> fans have descended upon every livestreamed game announcement that could possibly include a <em>Silksong</em> reveal, <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/hollow-knight-silksong-fans-in-clown-makeup">spamming clown memes</a> and joking about how the game is just around the corner. I myself changed my Discord avatar to a picture of the Knight in a clown wig and red nose, temporarily, just until&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em> came out. This was over three years ago, and at this point I worry that changing the avatar to something else will confuse the people in my servers too much. The mask has become my face.</p>

<h2>What took so long?</h2>
<p>Patient and impatient&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>fans alike will find some denouement in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NTc4NjYzOSwiZXhwIjoxNzU2MzkxNDM5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMUNMTUpHUFdDUFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.oTN8q1m9pNWFv7oW-n3vzq-hRWAxrDx9B7iF80RdTzk">Jason Schreier's Bloomberg interview with Team Cherry</a>, in which the game's developers break their silence on why the game took so long and why they communicated so little about it.</p>
<p>The prolonged development apparently didn't come down to a lack of enthusiasm, or burnout, or staffing problems, or the pandemic, or any of the other things that have delayed so many other games. Team Cherry co-founders Ari Gibson and William Pellen say that the delay has been for the most wholesome reason possible: they were having so much fun making&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em> that it was hard to stop.</p>
<p>"You’re always working on a new idea, new item, new area, new boss,” Pellen told Bloomberg. "That stuff’s so nice. It’s for the sake of just completing the game that we’re stopping. We could have kept going."</p>
<p>"I remember at some point I just had to stop sketching," said Gibson. "Because I went, ‘Everything I’m drawing here has to end up in the game. That’s a cool idea, that’s in. That’s a cool idea, that’s in.’ You realize, ‘If I don’t stop drawing, this is going to take 15 years to finish.'"</p>

<p>In addition to over 200 distinct enemies and an all-new map,&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em> will build on&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight</em>'s progression and exploration by adding a new quest system that will encourage re-exploration of different areas of the map. The team had conceived of this as a way to add depth to what they originally expected would be a smaller world map than&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight</em>'s—but instead, they added that depth and then built a huge game around it anyway. Tying all of these ideas together and applying a consistent level of polish to them also added time to the process.</p>
<p>The game's katamari-like growth apparently made it difficult to estimate when it would be done, and a desire to avoid spoiling the game for its future players meant that the team just ended up not talking about it much.</p>
<p>"There was a period of two to three years when I thought it was going to come out within a year," said Pellen.</p>
<p>In the last few months, there's been a growing sense that the game's release was finally coming, for real this time. An Australian museum announced that it would be showcasing the game as <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/silksong-got-a-release-date-for-an-australian-museum-exhibit-before-anything-else-and-i-wish-i-was-kidding/">part of an exhibit starting in September</a>.&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em> was listed as a playable game for Microsoft and Asus' Xbox-themed handheld ROG Ally PC, which itself <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/asus-and-microsofts-xbox-handhelds-arrive-october-16-but-pricing-remains-a-mystery/">just got a mid-October release date</a> yesterday. News of a "special announcement" about <em>Silksong </em>went out on August 19, and we finally got our release date today.</p>
<p>Gibson and Pellen have mostly ignored the weird Internet subcultures that have developed around the game, though they are aware that those intense slices of their fanbase exist.</p>
<p>"Feels like we’re going to ruin their fun by releasing the game," said Pellen.</p>
<p>Fans who have engaged in the sport of Waiting For <em>Silksong</em> will still have something to look forward to. Gibson and Pellen said that they plan to keep working on the game, and&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em> should see a fair amount of post-release DLC just like&nbsp;the original&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight&nbsp;</em>did. But some of those plans are "ambitious," and Team Cherry isn't ready to talk about timing yet.</p>
<p>That means that even the game's release isn't going to stop a certain type of person on the Internet from asking their favorite question: <i>Silksong</i> when?</p>

                <p>High on Life 2 continues the absurd tendencies of the original and will feature a playable version of Sega's Bible Adventures game.</p><p>Creative director Mikey Spano from developer Squanch Games <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/P45cJ2HdFh4?si=-VPiOXZCpOCcU6LD&amp;t=15141" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed at Gamescom</a> that Richard Kind's character, Senator Muppy Doo, can factory reset your game, prompting a Bible Adventures takeover. The three games included with Bible Adventures--Noah's Ark, Baby Moses, and David and Goliath--are playable during this takeover. You can see how this unfolds in the video below.</p><p>Spano said someone at Squanch Games has "great connections" in the video game industry and helped get the rights sorted out to make this happen. When the idea came up to have this kind of in-game takeover with another game, Spano said it was his "dream" for Bible Adventures to be that game, but he didn't imagine it would work out. It did, and Spano said he's floored.</p><p>"A terrible video game based on the Bible is like the best thing I've ever heard in my life. It sucks so bad to play. It's great," he said.</p><p>In the original High on Life, the 1990 movie Demon Wind was watchable from start to finish, and Spano said the team at Squanch Games wanted to find a way to up the ante with the sequel.</p><p>High on Life 2 launches in February 2026 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, and it'll also be available on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Xbox Game Pass</a>. It's been a busy week for Game Pass announcements, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-new-xbox-game-pass-day-one-releases-announced-this-week/2900-6897/" data-ref-id="2900-6897">many more games announced for the service as day-one releases.</a></p><p>One of the big changes in the sequel is that players can move around levels with a skateboard instead of a standard sprint option. This new component offers more than just a speedy way to move about, as players will be able to perform tricks and turn levels into skateparks, or use the board as a makeshift weapon in fights.</p><p>The idea for the original High on Life was conceived by Rick and Morty co-creator Justin Roiland, who later left the studio amid domestic violence allegations.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/review-turtle-beach-airlite-fit-for-nintendo-switch-2-a-no-frills-all-round-solid-bargain-headset.1277472/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Turtle beach airline fit review" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/eb5e60739e4cb/turtle-beach-airline-fit-review.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: PJ O'Reilly / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Between everyone at Nintendo Life, we've already got quite the heady (thanks) collection of gaming headsets for Switch 2 since the new console launched. You can find our in our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-nintendo-switch-2-gaming-headsets">Best Nintendo Switch 2 Gaming Headsets</a> guide.</p>
<p>However, one thing that we don't have a whole lot of choice on, and especially if you're looking for any sort of reasonable level of quality, is a decent budget offering. Until now!</p>
<p>Turtle Beach, who I'm certain you're all familiar with, has just launched its <a href="https://uk.turtlebeach.com/products/airlite-fit-wired-gaming-headset-nintendo-switch-2?Color=Charcoal+Black">Turtle Beach Airlite Fit</a> for Switch 2, a headset that's priced at <strong>£19.99 / $27.99</strong> (although I've already seen it out and about and selling for brand new at £15 on the UK high street, so keep your eyes peeled for bargains if you're interested).</p>
<p>So it's about as budget as you'd really expect, or want, to go with this sort of gear, but does it work well? Is it worth a punt or not? Well, yes. Yes it is. It isn't going to blow your socks off, or your eardrums, which is fair enough at this price, but it is well-made, stylish, <em>and</em> fully officially licensed and branded. I would say it's a really nice shout for kids also. My eight-year-old can wear it comfortably, and so can I. Sorted.</p>
<p>In terms of build quality, the design, as you can see from our pics, is robust and does a good job of making the whole thing feel sturdy and comfortable on your head. There are no thin or easily breakable parts, it's all housed in one solid unit, and the foam strip under the headband keeps things comfy whilst the actual ear-pads are decent. I'm not a huge fan of fully-enclosed headsets like this by default, as they get too warm for me with my big old ears stuffed into those foamy cups, but these ones are fine for the most part; comfy, with no surprises — and the jersey-knit covering feels soft but durable.</p>
<p>To adjust the size, you can move the headband through several satisfying clicks on the appropriately-coloured left and right sides, and again this all feels much more robust than you might expect. The mic is surrounded by a soft rubber cover, and can be adjusted to sit as you like it on its little multi-directional wand. And, for the price, the sound quality of the mic is perfectly adequate.</p>

<p>And "adequate" is how I'd describe the entire aural experience, to be honest. You don't have all the latest tech and modes and fancy stuff here, but the 40mm speakers ensure bass is decent, holding its own in gunfights and explosions without getting muffled or distorted (my usual issue with cheap headsets), and the overall sound levels out of the box (no you can't adjust anything outside of what the Switch 2 console already allows itself), do just fine across the board.</p>
<p>It follows that there are no fancy ways to connect here, either. It's wired via audio-jack or bust, but that's fine. I expect all of this at this price point.</p>
<p>My only major gripe with this headset is that its volume doesn't turn up loud enough. Of course, this is going to vary based on how loud you like things, but maxing out the audio dial on the headset left me wanting more. To be clear, it's nowhere near too low, we don't have that issue at all, but it lacks punch and the top-out volume for me is about 25% too low for what I prefer.</p>
<figure><a title="Turtle beach airline fit review" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f0d5f249228b3/turtle-beach-airline-fit-review.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: PJ O'Reilly / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>And to make that volume change, there's just the one big chunky dial to consider, and to mute your mic you simply lift it up until it clicks into place. Again, nothing fancy, but this makes for a clean design, as there aren't buttons and lights and things to accidentally press everywhere. Silver linings! At 228g it's super light on the head, too.</p>
<p>All that said, Turtle Beach has given us a very sturdy, tidy and nicely designed budget headset. It 100% isn't going to set the world alight, but that's not its point, as the sound here gets the job done. Where it elevates itself beyond other budget sets for me is in its official branding and stylish shaping, which really does give off the air of a more expensive set of cans. It's also a really good option for kids, as the robustness ensures they won't break it after just ten minutes.</p>
<p>Judged purely on its sound quality and features, this is a very solid headset that gets done what's needed. Throw in the better-than-expected design, and that budget-price point and, for folks looking a bargain buy, the Airlite Fit for Switch 2 creep up into highly recommended territory.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">In a shake-up for TT Games' LEGO series, the newly-announced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a> features just a handful of playable heroes, even if many more DC Comics characters will appear in the game as enemies or NPCs — something that is prompting plenty of fan debate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Typically, TT Games' LEGO adventures include hundreds of characters to unlock and play as, with character collection a fun part of fully completing a LEGO game. TT Games' previous project LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga offered one of the biggest rosters yet — with around 400 characters depending on whether you owned the base game or all of its DLC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight is taking a different approach, however, with an official Q&amp;A page for the game confirming just seven heroes will be playable — and no supervillains.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight will feature seven playable characters, including Batman, Jim Gordon, Robin, Nightwing, Batgirl, Catwoman, and Talia al Ghul," reads the game's official <a href="https://legogamessupport.wbgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/43979623023123-LEGO-Batman-Legacy-of-the-Dark-Knight-FAQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Q&amp;A</a>. "Each character is equipped with unique skills, combos, and gadgets — like Batman's Batclaw, Jim Gordon's foam sprayer, Robin's line launcher, and Catwoman's whip."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This makes it sound like the game's focus is on providing a smaller number of distinct characters, rather than hundreds of options with many gameplay similarities. Indeed, speaking to IGN at Gamescom, TT Games Head of Production Jonathan Smith said Legacy of the Dark Knight had been designed to focus more squarely on the story of the "Bat Family."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This is wholly a Batman game to focus on that character, to really bring that character," Smith said. "That means you'll still play as and with other playable characters, Jim Gordon, Catwoman, Robin, Batgirl, to round out the bat family. But we think we really need to focus on Bruce Wayne and his story for that player journey, that player experience in Gotham."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, for collectathon fans, the game's seven characters will have multiple costumes to unlock. For example, Batman's suit options include his look from 2022's The Batman movie, the animated Batman: The Brave and the Bold series, Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight, Batman's original Golden Age comics appearance, plus well as his colorful Rainbow Batman suit.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/21/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-gameplay-00-02-59-1755792967121.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Batman's Suit Options screen includes numerous unlockable appearances.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On stage at Gamescom this week, Smith confirmed the appearance of multiple characters from DC Comics within the game, including Bat-Mite and Condiment King — though to be clear, these will not be playable. Bat-Mite sounds likely to pop up as a friendly NPC, while Condiment King feels most likely to be another non-playable villain.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">(As a side-note, Smith also said that Superman and Peacemaker would not appear in Legacy of the Dark Knight, and gave a "no comment" to Harley Quinn, Bob the Goon, Terry McGinnis, "Nice Coat Guy from Batman Begins," and amusingly, Warner Bros. Discovery boss David Zaslav.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If it’s only seven in the whole game then I’m not buying lol," one fan wrote in a lengthy <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/legogaming/comments/1mur2go/lego_batman_will_have_only_7_playable_characters/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a> thread discussing the seven character limit. "Honestly shocked by this," wrote another, adding that "part of the fun of LEGO games is the big rosters."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Controversial opinion: I prefer seven completely different characters to play than 200 that only change their appearance," countered another fan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Said another: "I understand what made the huge minifig rosters cool and neat but I don't think it made for a better game over more refined play patterns that are super character specific instead of a handful of interchangeable abilities and tools."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some fans have said this approach better fits a more story-led game, though others remain of the opinion that more LEGO characters should be playable in the game's open-world version of Gotham. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight is set to launch on Nintendo Switch 2, PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

In Beastro, the idea of saving the world begins with preparing the perfect meal.</p><p>Set to launch in 2026 on Steam and Xbox Series X|S (available day one with Xbox Game Pass), Beastro follows Panko, a young fox and chef who suddenly finds himself in charge of a village eatery after his mentor mysteriously disappears.</p><p>As Panko, players will manage the restaurant, grow ingredients on the farm, forage in the wild, and serve local patrons. But there's more to Panko’s new role--he also must feed the Caretakers, adventurers who are the last line of defense against looming threats beyond the village walls. You can check out the trailer below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZ3NM3hZD1Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fZ3NM3hZD1Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Each Caretaker comes from a different "flavor region" that influences their taste preferences and battle style. Some prefer sweet dishes, while others crave something bitter or spicy. By mastering a variety of cooking minigames and carefully crafting meals to match each adventurer's palate, players can boost their strength, unlock new cards for their deck, and prepare themselves for the battles ahead. The better the meal, the more effective the Caretakers become in combat against the monstrous threats.</p><p>After every expedition, the action continues in the form of a puppet show that reenacts the Caretakers' adventures. These turn-based battle sequences require tactical thinking and showcase the impact of the meals prepared earlier. From there, the Caretaker brings back the spoils of victory, which Panko can use for future meals.</p><p>Players can wishlist the game or register for updates on the <a href="https://www.beastro.game/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official site</a>.</p>

<figure><a title="Hollow Knight" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5f313d46b13da/hollow-knight.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure><p>It would come as no surprise to hear that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a> is one of the most successful indie games of all time, right? An immensely popular Switch launch (a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/06/hollow_knight_sold_over_a_quarter_of_a_million_copies_on_switch_in_two_weeks">quarter of a million sales</a> in its first two weeks) and six years of waiting for one of the most hyped-up sequels ever is bound to do that. But it turns out that the melancholic metroidvania has sold even better than we expected.</p>
<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make">Bloomberg</a> (paywalled), studio co-founders Ari Gibson and William Pellan stated that Hollow Knight has sold around <em>15 million copies</em> since it launched back in 2017. 2.8 million of these sales came before <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a> was announced in 2019, and an additional 12 million have come in the years since, the devs stated.</p>
<p>For reference, that puts Hollow Knight's sales numbers roughly in line with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_arceus">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a> (which had amassed 14.83 million units sold by the last official count in 2023). Of course, not all of Hollow Knight's purchases will have come from Switch, but still, it's in line with a <em>Pokémon game</em>.</p>
<p>According to the Bloomberg feature, the game's continued success has meant that the team has been able to continue to work on Silksong without having to worry about finances. “We’re very lucky in that regard,” Gibson told Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, “I don’t ever really think about it that much. Maybe that’s the privilege of it”.</p>
<p>Compare that to the development of Hollow Knight, where the team was reportedly living off leftover office sandwiches and the odd $20 top-up from parents, and it's plain to see just how far the studio has come between games.</p>
<p>Just in case you missed it, Hollow Knight: Silksong will launch on Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>4th September</strong>.</p>
