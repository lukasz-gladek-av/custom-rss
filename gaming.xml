            <p>CES 2026 is underway in Las Vegas, and while Nvidia have passed on the opportunity to announce any new RTX 50 Super <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-graphics-card">graphics cards</a> – perhaps in the knowledge that they’d be hurled directly into the raging vortex of an ongoing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/predicting-steam-machine-prices-would-be-a-lot-easier-if-ram-costs-hadnt-gone-horribly-wrong">component pricing snafu</a> – the tech show has yielded some interesting GeForce news. Namely, there’s a new version of Nvidia DLSS, 4.5, launching today, that promises to sharpen up and boost performance on any RTX GPU.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Its Super Resolution component is a second-generation upgrade to the 'Transformer' upscaling model introduced with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-dlss-4-explained">DLSS 4</a>, and on top of the improvements that version made over ye olde Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) of dee-ell-ess-esses past, it supposedly benefits from "greater contextual awareness" of the image it’s upscaling at any given moment. Nvidia say this produces higher-res frames with sharper detailing, less ghosting on moving images – a DLSS classic, that one – and generally cleaner, smoother anti-aliasing.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nvidia</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Yah, like that.</p>
<p>No details on performance yet; DLSS 4’s Transfomer model was slightly less effective than CNN at jacking up framerates, but then the picture quality upgrade was arguably worth it, so you won’t catch me sobbing into my keyboard so long as DLSS 4.5 keeps the pace. Compatibility doesn’t sound like it’ll be much of a problem, either, as over 400 games will be compatible with DLSS 4.5 via the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-new-nvidia-app-is-out-now-justly-banishing-geforce-experience-to-history">Nvidia App</a>’s DLSS Override tool. The new Transformer model works on all current RTX-branded graphics cards, too – not just the latest RTX 50 series.</p><p>What you <em>will</em> need a 50 series card for is DLSS 4.5’s other major feature, Dynamic Multi Frame Generation. This won’t be out until Spring 2026, so it’s even less of an issue if you just want the new upscaler right this second, but in short, this builds on DLSS 4’s Multi Frame Generation (MFG) by allowing you to set a target FPS – likely one that syncs with the max refresh rate of your monitor – and only producing enough AI-hewn frames to meet that target. Instead of, as in DLSS 4 MFG, sticking to a flat 2x, 3x, or 4x multiplier, though Dynamic MFG can apparently stretch as high as 6x.</p>
<p>While the more widely known (if still Nvidia-supported) flavour of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-need-to-reclaim-softwares-wishing-well-from-the-cruelty-of-generative-ai">generative AI</a> has thus far been a litany of unfulfilled promise, intellectual property theft, and weirdly, RAM prices going haywire, the very specific application of artificial intelligence and/or machine learning in DLSS – and its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amd-fsr-redstone-explained">AMD rival, FSR</a> – is relatively benign. Instead of sending a prompt to a power-hungry data centre, where images or text are aggregated from potentially stolen original works, DLSS is trained on a single supercomputer, and its actual generation work is done entirely on your own, probably sub-1000W PC, merely to create frames from data provided by the game it’s currently rendering. Which, obviously, requires the developers’ permission, given they’re the one who integrated DLSS in the first place. I don’t know how widespread confusion between the two genAI styles actually is, but there’s my reckoning, in case you ever wonder why I’m moaning about one while accepting the other.</p>
<p>Still, as a performance tool per se, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dlss-3-how-it-works-how-it-performs-and-when-you-should-use-it">frame generation has issues</a>, including ones I fear may be exacerbated by a 6x multiplier. MFG has already shown us that the more generated frames your GPU shoves out, the lower your supply of 'real', traditionally rendered frames. These are the ones you want to truly keep high, as they determine how fluid and responsive a fast-paced game feels in your mousing hand – generated frames only add visual smoothness, not tactile improvements, and in fact increase input lag. I’m not sure I’d ever want to engage 4x, 5x, or 6x frame gen unless I was already getting at least 70-80fps in normal frames to compensate for the reduced responsiveness, at which point, even a 240Hz monitor wouldn’t need such hefty multipliers to max out.</p>
<p>The new upscaler sounds good, though.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NYT Connections Hints Today (#940)—Clues and Answers for Tuesday, January 6]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-january-6-940/</link>
            <guid>1398016</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We’re getting our heads into January, and by association, into 2026. What’s ahead are hundreds of NYT Connections puzzles for you to solve before we get into <strong>the next year</strong>, but that’s far too long into the distance to be concerning right now. All that matters today is that you decimate the NYT Connections puzzle presented <strong>right now</strong>.</p>



<p>With that being said, I’ve got the NYT Connections hints and solutions you need below. Have fun!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-january-6">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (January 6)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will prompt your brain to take action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #940:</p>



<ul>
<li>DIGS</li>



<li>CLEAR</li>



<li>FLAT</li>



<li>DEEP</li>



<li>PAD</li>



<li>FULL</li>



<li>RICH</li>



<li>QUARTERS</li>



<li>BOAT</li>



<li>BALLOON</li>



<li>FLUSH</li>



<li>PACK</li>



<li>QUADS</li>



<li>PARTY</li>



<li>STUFFED</li>



<li>STRAIGHT</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Slang or casual terms for where you live.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Think about how something might sound.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>THands you might make at a card table.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Add “animal” after each</em> <em>word</em>.</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, January 6:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-explained-for-today-january-6-940">NYT Connections Answers Explained for Today, January 6 (#940)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– DIGS, FLAT, PAD, QUARTERS</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – CLEAR, DEEP, FULL, RICH</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BOAT, FLUSH, QUADS, STRAIGHT</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – BALLOON, PACK, PARTY, STUFFED</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Escape from Tarkov’s Ending Was ‘Changed’, But Not How Players Were Expecting]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-ending-change-unexpected/</link>
            <guid>1398010</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlestate Games pulled a bit of a sneaky on players looking for an easier ending in Escape from Tarkov following the arrival of the 1.0 release midway through November. In the closing chapter of the game, players must navigate the Terminal map, slaying hundreds of AI enemies, to make it to a boat that marks their ultimate escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>However, a trickery in the design meant that, in a group, not <strong>everyone </strong>could get a seat on the boat. In a post on social media, one streamer asked to alter the number of seats available on the boat to get out of Tarkov, to which Battlestate said, ‘It’s changed already.’</p>



<p>But the nature of that change has players perplexed.</p>







<h2 id="h-solo-or-no-go">Solo or No Go</h2>



<p>Under <a href="https://x.com/Velion/status/2007488455002206273" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Velion’s post</a> asking for ‘everyone’ to be able to escape together, Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Its changed already</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This prompted many to believe that, as a group, all comers could escape from Tarkov together, no longer needing to sacrifice themselves or kill their friends at the ultimate exfiltration point.</p>



<p>However, the change that Battlestate Games implemented was something pretty drastic and <strong>not </strong>what fans were anticipating. Instead of allowing a group to escape from Tarkov, Battlestate has ensured that just <strong>one seat </strong>is available on the ZUBR boat, regardless of squad size.</p>



<p>That means if you make it through Terminal as a five-man squad, you’ll be left choosing which solo player gets to complete the game at the final post.</p>



<p>This was <a href="https://x.com/Pestily/status/2008264876163228137" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">detailed by Pestily</a>, arguably the most recognizable Escape from Tarkov streamer, in a post on social media:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Hey I watched multiple runs of Terminal yesterday and even with 5 people getting to the end it’s always 1 seat now? I understand “changed” can mean multiple things but only 1? Bruh…</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fans were quick to comment on the change, and as always, feedback was dramatically mixed and divisive. One user wrote, ‘If this isn’t fixed soon, I’m done with this game.’ Another wrote, “I like the 1-seat change – it forces an actual decision instead of defaulting to the 5-man safety net.”</p>



<p>One Tarkov player suggested a dynamic seating structure that changes according to the ending the players have. The ‘nicer’ their ending, the more seats are available on their boat.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a recent <span>social media release, VR-first developer Cloudhead Games announced a massive restructuring that will result in the&nbsp;<strong>layoff of 70% of its employee base,</strong>&nbsp;effective</span> January 7th. The post, penned by the company’s CEO, Denny Unger, revealed a series of issues that had landed the studio in an <strong>impossible position</strong>.</p>



<p>These included a lack of platform funding in the VR space, ‘still nascent challenges’ preventing the widespread success of VR, and the ‘general downturn of the gaming industry.’</p>







<h2 id="h-cloudhead-still-wants-to-transform-humanity">Cloudhead Still Wants to ‘Transform Humanity’</h2>



<p>The post on <a href="https://x.com/CloudheadGames/status/2008316673774715195" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a> from Cloudhead’s CEO was an emotional one:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The team leaving us are consummate professionals and wonderful people in general. We took great collective pride in creating a culture that was as caring about VR content as they were working to support each other.</p>



<p>Each and every one of them shared a true sense of ‘give a damn’ as we worked through still unseen projects, and they will be deeply missed at our studio. And although we have done our best to pad the landing with supports, if you have room on your team, please see the link below to our ‘Reverse Recruiting’ spreadsheet and contact them directly.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The release went on to explain that the studio can’t achieve immense things alone, and referenced a drop in investment in VR technology and software as a leading contributor to mass redundancies.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Cloudhead has weathered many storms in our 14 years in Virtual Reality. Our belief remains in the power of VR as a medium, as a shared dream machine that will one day <strong>transform humanity</strong>. We have no doubt VR’s mainstream relevance is predestined, with future devices that do ‘everything’, but it will take studios like ours to be there when that time comes.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Cloudhead is working on an unannounced game, but previously produced Pistol Whip, Aperture Hand Lab (in collaboration with Valve), and The Gallery series.</p>



<p>Cloudhead Games is one of the earliest studios to announce a wave of mass layoffs in 2026. As the studio points out, there’s still a general downturn and a global restructuring across the gaming industry, so it likely won’t be the last.</p>

<p>That isn’t some fictional, dystopian headline; this is where we’re at right now in gaming peripheral technology. At CES 2026, HyperX and Neurable revealed a collaboration that has given way to an AI-powered, sensor-fitted <strong>neurotechnological gaming headset.</strong> It uses ‘non-invasive sensors’ to read brainwaves and encourage gamers to boost their performance.</p>



<p>The combination of HyperX’s peripheral technology and Neurable’s cognitive monitoring solutions endeavours to give players insights into their real-time brain performance and reduce their reaction times.</p>







<h2 id="h-would-you-let-a-headset-monitor-your-brain">Would You Let a Headset Monitor Your Brain?</h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260105973259/en/Neurable-Introduces-Neurotechnology-Powered-Gaming-Wearable-Headset-With-HyperX?utm_source=neurable&amp;utm_medium=newsroom" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release</a> detailing everything you’d want to know about the HyperX x Neurable gaming headset, some telling tidbits of data were handed out. It was claimed that testing participants resulted in an ‘improved reaction time’ of around 43 milliseconds on average, a number that was made ‘even more pronounced’ by testing the headset with pro esports players.</p>



<p>The CEO of Neurable, Ramses Alcaide, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>HyperX allows us to bring neurotechnology to gamers at a scale we’ve never been able to reach before.</p>



<p>We look forward to the excitement of this strategic relationship, which represents a promising future of gaming, one where understanding your mind becomes as natural as understanding your mechanics. By making brain-computer interfaces (BCI) intuitive and invisible inside the tools players already use, we’re proving that neuroscience can meaningfully elevate performance and transform the way people play.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>HP’s Josephine Tan echoed the sentiment:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’ve always been about empowering power players with the best technology to play, and now with our strategic collaboration with Neurable, we look forward to giving more insight into how one’s cognitive skills and focus impacts their gameplay to ultimately make them as competitive as possible.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s not clear when the HyperX x Neurable headset will make it to market, and it hasn’t been suggested how much such a device would cost.</p>

			<p><strong>Creative Assembly's</strong> <strong>Total War: PHARAOH</strong>, the latest game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/total-war-pharaoh-sands-of-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released over two years ago</a> in the iconic real-time strategy series, will soon feature <strong>an in-game AI advisor powered by <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-ace-kairos-npc-demo-shown-in-exclusive-ces-24-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NVIDIA ACE</a> technology</strong>.</p>



<p>The news was <a href="https://wccftech.com/watch-nvidia-ces-2026-ceo-jensen-huang-live-here/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled by NVIDIA at <strong>CES 2026</strong></a> today. This updated version of the in-game advisor reimagines the traditional strategy game guide by using on-device AI to provide real-time, context-aware assistance.</p>



<p>Total War: PHARAOH players <strong>can engage with the advisor via natural language prompts</strong> (voice or text), rather than searching through menus or FAQs. The advisor has been trained on the specific mechanics of Total War: PHARAOH and has game-state awareness (as well as using a historically appropriate tone and lore-driven mindset). For example, <strong>it can analyze why a settlement revolted</strong> or offer strategic advice based on the player's current campaign situation. The AI processes player prompts, the current game state, and data retrieved from the game's complex database, which contains up-to-date information on units, the economy, resource management, faction traits, buildings, and status effects.</p>



<p>Behind the scenes, the Total War: PHARAOH AI advisor <strong>is powered by a small language model that runs locally on the user's GPU</strong>. The studio used NVIDIA ACE developer tools to build the pipeline connecting Total War's extensive game data to the model.</p>



<p>This new feature is part of a program to <strong>investigate how Creative Assembly can make Total War more approachable, dynamic, and ultimately more accessible</strong> to players of all skill levels, without compromising any of the depth that has defined the franchise over the past 25 years. The CES 2026 announcement also included confirmation that an upcoming playtest program for this AI advisor is scheduled to launch for select community members in 2026. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>During the CES 2026 NVIDIA ACE update, we also received an update on the <strong>PUBG Ally</strong> in-game companion that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-ace-to-power-dynamic-ai-characters-companions-and-bosses-in-pubg-naraka-bladepoint-inzoi-and-mir5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally announced at last year's Consumer Electronics Show</a>. PUBG Ally will initially be tested in the first half of 2026 via a limited-time event in <strong>PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS Arcade</strong>, and will be available for players using English, Chinese, and Korean. These <strong>CPC</strong> (<strong>Co-Playable Characters</strong>) are powered by small language and speech models via <strong>efficient on-device inference</strong>. An automatic speech recognition model understands the player's voice, while a small language model (SLM) combines these instructions with PUBG Ally's perception of the game state for strategic planning and real-time reactions. A text-to-speech model then generates dynamic voice lines to communicate with the player.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>At CES 2026, it was also confirmed that PUBG Ally will include a <strong>long-term memory system</strong> that lets Co-Playable Characters recall previous performances and gameplay interactions, allowing the AI to draw on these memories while interacting with the player. This definitely opens up to more immersive interactions, although it will be interesting to see how the gaming community reacts to it, given the growing anti-AI sentiment.</p>



<p>In other Total War news, Creative Assembly is working on two big games: <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/total-war-medieval-iii-is-in-early-development-warcore-engine-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Total War Medieval III</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/total-war-warhammer-40000-announced-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Total War: Warhammer 40,000</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Nintendo is regularly renewing its video game trademarks, and with this in mind, some trademarks have apparently been spotted for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/legend_of_zelda_tri_force_heroes">The Legend of Zelda: Tri Force Heroes</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/mario_tennis_ultra_smash">Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash</a>.</p>
<p>The multiplayer Zelda title originally made its debut on the 3DS in 2015. We found it to be a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/3ds/legend_of_zelda_tri_force_heroes">"mixed bag" compared to its illustrious predecessors</a>. As for Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash, this game arrived on the Wii U in 2015. It featured <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/wiiu/mario_tennis_ultra_smash">some enjoyable gameplay</a>, but there wasn't quite enough there to keep us interested.</p><div><figure data-videoid="SFfvavDRTdA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SFfvavDRTdA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytSFfvavDRTdA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SFfvavDRTdA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SFfvavDRTdA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed405340uomsvw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Here's a look at these trademarks <a href="https://x.com/MikeOdysseyYT/status/2007002500906279007">courtesy of Mike Odyssey on social media</a> (<a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/56376-nintendo-renews-for-trademarks-zelda-tri-force-heroes-and-mario-tennis-ultra-smash">thanks, GoNintendo</a>):</p>

<p>When it comes to video game trademarks, there is no guarantee games and filings spotted will neccessarily lead to an announcement or reveal.</p>
<p>For Nintendo, renewals are often just part of everyday business operations to protect its intellectual properties. In saying this, some trademark renewals from publishers in recent years have led to the revival of certain games and series, such as Bandai Namco's IP <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/klonoa_phantasy_reverie_series">Klonoa</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/once_upon_a_katamari">Katamari</a>.</p>
<p>If we hear anything related to these renewals, we will provide an update. Although there's no sign of Nintendo's multiplayer-focused Zelda series returning, you can always get a co-op fix in the recently released title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>. A new Mario Tennis game called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a> is also coming to the Switch 2 next month.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nvidia-rtx-remix-logic-soon-add-dynamic-fx-responds-to-in-game-events/</link>
            <guid>1397980</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today at <strong>CES 2026</strong>, <strong>NVIDIA </strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/watch-nvidia-ces-2026-ceo-jensen-huang-live-here/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> <strong>RTX Remix Logic</strong>, a new feature that will soon (later this month via an update available through the <strong>NVIDIA app</strong>) introduce dynamic visual effects capable of responding to in-game events.</p>



<p>The RTX Remix Logic system identifies <strong>over 30 common in-game events</strong> and offers <strong>more than 900 triggers</strong> that modders can use to transform visuals in their remastered classic PC games mods. The visual aspects of those games, such as lighting, materials, and volumetric effects, can now respond to gameplay. For example, opening a door might trigger changes in weather or light properties.</p>



<p>The modders can even inject dynamic particles or post-processing effects, such as chromatic aberration or vignettes, as stress signals when a player is in danger. Large-scale effects like snow or rain can be selectively applied so they appear only in specific environments and are automatically excluded from indoor areas.</p>



<p>RTX Remix Logic features an <strong>intuitive, no-code, node-based user interface</strong> that enables easy connection of various (900+) triggers. According to NVIDIA, the system is highly versatile and can be used in a multitude of ways. It is also extensible, enabling the RTX Remix community to add more game event triggers and actions over time. In a demonstration, NVIDIA showed that a door in Half-Life 2 RTX could open up to very different looking Ravenholms, as if the door connected to a multiverse. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="NVIDIA RTX Remix | Remix Logic: Dynamic Lighting &amp; Weather" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wl4wSU1S9us?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Modders can even use RTX Remix Logic to <strong>introduce new gameplay systems</strong> to old PC games. For example, modder <strong>xoxor4d</strong> (the same one who's behind the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-4-rtx-remix-compatibility-mod-publicly-available-enjoy-path-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stunning GTA 4 path traced remaster</a></strong>) came up with the idea of adding a night vision effect to Half-Life 2 RTX that is automatically triggered when the user has equipped the crossbow and activated the zoom. You can check a showcase below.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="NVIDIA RTX Remix | Remix Logic: Crossbow Night-Vision" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4ABCXS4P-_8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The RTX Remix Logic system is compatible with <strong>over 165 classic games</strong> supported by NVIDIA's remastering, but that's not all that NVIDIA plans to add with the update slated for later this month. Modder xoxor4d has contributed a new look for the <strong>Remix Runtime menu</strong> and also made further customization possible, allowing users to resize it, retheme it, and change its transparency.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Overall, NVIDIA boasted that 2025 was <strong>a breakthrough year for RTX Remix</strong>, with over 50 new mods released and more than 20 community tools, including open-source contributions and plugins, now available to help expand compatibility.</p>

And while you certainly can't refer to a $150 controller as "budget-friendly," it is priced lower most of the controllers listed above.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4629882-8bitdoultimate3emodular.png" data-ref-id="1300-4629882" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4629882-8bitdoultimate3emodular.png" data-ref-id="1300-4629882"></a><figcaption>8BitDo Ultimate 3E Controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4629882-8bitdoultimate3emodular.png"></figure><p>The Ultimate 3E is only the second wireless 8BitDo controller for Xbox, following last year's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FHQ6P7TQ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FHQ6P7TQ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ultimate 3-Mode 40th Anniversary Edition</a>, which is on sale for $80 (was $90) at Amazon.</p><p>The Ultimate 3E has numerous features that are brand-new to 8BitDo's popular controller line. It's slightly wider than the Ultimate 2 and has textured, silicone handles to improve comfort and control. Like the Elite Series 2 and other officially licensed third-party gamepads, the Ultimate 3E comes with a hardshell carrying case and a set of swappable components.</p><p>Modular components include the right and left joysticks, D-pad, ABXY buttons, and the front faceplate. Two magnetic ABXY button modules--one standard, one microswitch--are included with the controller. This is the first time we've seen swappable face buttons utilized to switch between traditional membrane inputs and rapid, clicky microswitches. The magnetic faceplate needs to be removed before switching the ABXY modules.</p><p>Like the Ultimate 2 and Pro 3, the Ultimate 3E has TMR anti-drift joysticks with customizable RGB light rings. Stick movements are registered by electromagnetic sensors and offer a smoother, more precise feel than Hall Effect sticks. In addition to a pair of traditional sticks, the accessory kit comes with four alternative options: two tall, one dome, and one with a thicker metal ring to increase resistance.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4630224-8bitdoultimate3e.png" data-ref-id="1300-4630224" data-ratio="0.534" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4630224-8bitdoultimate3e.png" data-ref-id="1300-4630224"></a><figcaption>The Ultimate 3E is the second wireless 8BitDo controller for Xbox.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4630224-8bitdoultimate3e.png"></figure><p>You can also quickly swap between two styles of directional pads. The default is a newly designed eight-way D-pad with a circular shape. If you prefer the classic style, the alternative is a four-way D-pad similar to the ones found on other 8BitDo controllers. Both D-pad modules have magnetic connectors.</p><p>The modular design doesn't extend to the extra remappable buttons. Like the Ultimate 2, the Ultimate 3E has two built-in back buttons and two extra shoulder buttons (R4 and L4). The shoulder buttons can be remapped on the fly on the controller itself, while the back buttons and other inputs are remapped using 8BitDo's free Ultimate Software app. Other settings such as RGB lighting effects and stick/trigger sensitivity can be adjusted using the app. Just like other editions of the Ultimate, you can create and store up to three custom control layouts that can be cycled through by pressing the Profile button on the controller.</p><p>The Ultimate 3E is 8BitDo's first licensed Xbox controller with trigger stops. It has Hall Effect Impulse Triggers with the haptic feedback found in official Xbox Wireless Controllers. You can toggle the switches on the back of the Ultimate 3E to actuate the triggers faster. If they work like the Ultimate 2, the trigger stops essentially turn RT and LT into shoulder buttons.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4630242-8bitdoultimate3ebumpers.png" data-ref-id="1300-4630242" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4630242-8bitdoultimate3ebumpers.png" data-ref-id="1300-4630242"></a><figcaption>R4 and L4 shoulder buttons can be remapped without Ultimate Software X.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4630242-8bitdoultimate3ebumpers.png"></figure><p>8BitDo says the 1400mAh battery offers up to 18 hours of play and takes 4-5 hours to fully charge. The controller is bundled with a wireless charging dock that has "zero contact points." Outside of the charging pins/contacts, no part of the controller touches the charging stand. The 2.4GHz USB-C dongle is stored inside the charging dock's bottom compartment.</p><p>Though the Ultimate 3E is an Xbox controller, it has a couple of PC-only features. Competitive players will be interested to hear the Ultimate 3E is rated for up to 1,000Hz polling rates in wireless and wired modes. PC players can also use customizable 6-axis motion controls when synced to the wireless dongle.</p><p>The Ultimate 3E is the latest entry in 8<a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FHQ6P7TQ,B0DMTLLSBN,B0DP9B2WYY,B0DP991SPL,B0DMVLD2HC,B0DZ6CRSFC,B0F18T675W,B0D1VHH4C5,B0D1VHT3S6,B0F9L7L7CJ,B0F9L7Q3VG,B0929K9W4N,B0C4YRJHGB,B0C4YKQ7ZF,B0F7XFH9V1,B0F7RMB4RH,B0CNPST9GY,B0D7P5M1Q3,B0D1T96W4L,B0D3HHZK8D,B0D1TV3HGB,B0D3HJ8T3C,B0D1TDYNPS,B0CX52RYR4,B0CSPFFVRT,B0CX4YP82L,B0CYZKNSS1,B0D3HHCK4F,B0CYZH52ZY,B0DNQ9FXJW,B0DNQBQNG7,B0DNQD9HPS,B0DNZFCJ5S,B0BXSV78R6,B09B2R2GRM,B0CX44F4QJ,B0CMH7DR3Y,B0D5LPJ2NN,B0BGPX25FP,B0BGPTPSCM,B0BGPQSCMM,B0BGNYXKBK,B0FM7V4T31,B0FLDC4TBQ&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FHQ6P7TQ,B0DMTLLSBN,B0DP9B2WYY,B0DP991SPL,B0DMVLD2HC,B0DZ6CRSFC,B0F18T675W,B0D1VHH4C5,B0D1VHT3S6,B0F9L7L7CJ,B0F9L7Q3VG,B0929K9W4N,B0C4YRJHGB,B0C4YKQ7ZF,B0F7XFH9V1,B0F7RMB4RH,B0CNPST9GY,B0D7P5M1Q3,B0D1T96W4L,B0D3HHZK8D,B0D1TV3HGB,B0D3HJ8T3C,B0D1TDYNPS,B0CX52RYR4,B0CSPFFVRT,B0CX4YP82L,B0CYZKNSS1,B0D3HHCK4F,B0CYZH52ZY,B0DNQ9FXJW,B0DNQBQNG7,B0DNQD9HPS,B0DNZFCJ5S,B0BXSV78R6,B09B2R2GRM,B0CX44F4QJ,B0CMH7DR3Y,B0D5LPJ2NN,B0BGPX25FP,B0BGPTPSCM,B0BGPQSCMM,B0BGNYXKBK,B0FM7V4T31,B0FLDC4TBQ&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">BitDo's impressive collection of controllers and other peripherals licensed by Xbox</a>.

<p>The Hundred Line team says it will "consider" it</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="52b23e2f21658"><a title="The Hundred Line" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/52b23e2f21658/the-hundred-line.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Aniplex / XSEED Games</em></figcaption></figure><p>One Switch release we didn't think enough people spoke about in 2025 was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">The Hundred Line - Last Defense Academy</a>. Fortunately, there might be a chance of it returning to the spotlight in the future.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/interview/19255-the-hundred-line-interview-kodaka-dlc-new-characters-routes-uchikoshi-switch-2">recent interview with RPG Site</a>, the title's co-director Kazutaka Kodaka mentioned how the team at Too Kyo Games would definitely consider a Switch 2 Edition upgrade, similar to what fans saw with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shuten_order">SHUTEN ORDER</a> in November. Here's the full exchange:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>RPG Site:</strong> It made sense to prioritize Switch and Steam for this one. Are there any plans for a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition upgrade like we just saw for Shuten Order? I ask this because the game is a bit rough on Switch compared to PC and it would benefit a lot from faster loading with better visuals and performance on Switch 2.</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067rxlpmy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p><strong>Kazutaka Kodaka:</strong> We’d like to consider that as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, while there's nothing concrete just yet, there appears to be a serious chance a Switch 2 upgrade could be considered for the future.</p>
<p>When The Hundred Line originally arrived in April last year, we gave it an "excellent" nine out of ten stars and praised it for its blend of tactical RPG and visual novel gameplay. We also gave it a spot in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/games-of-the-year-2025-nintendo-life-staff-picks">our Nintendo Life 2025 Games of the Year list</a>. The success it had also seemingly helped <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/the-hundred-line-dev-no-longer-sees-bankruptcy-as-a-serious-future">Too Kyo Games avoid bankruptcy</a>.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, the paid upgrade for Shuten Order on Switch 2 included a performance update and mouse controls.</p>

Much like a modern laptop, these new monitors have a built-in light sensor that measures the brightness and color temperature of an environment to enable a screen to automatically adapt to different times of day.</p><p>“In bright daylight conditions it increases brightness and shifts to a color that’s cooler in temperature,” says Michael McSorley, product marketing manager at Nvidia, in a briefing with <em>The Verge</em>. “At night, or in darker rooms, it reduces brightness and uses warmer tones to minimize glare and eyestrain.”</p><p>While the process is automatic, much like a laptop display, you’ll still be able to fully control how this feature works so you can fine-tune it or disable it altogether directly through the monitor’s onscreen display.</p><p>The first displays that include G-Sync Ambient Adaptive Technology will be available on January 7th, starting at $599. Acer, AOC, Asus, and MSI all have new G-Sync Pulsar monitors with this automatic brightness feature, and they’re all designed more for professional esports players. Each model is a 27-inch IPS display running at 1440p and up to 360Hz refresh rate.</p><p>Nvidia first introduced its G-Sync Pulsar monitors last year, as part of a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224270/nvidia-g-sync-module-mediatek-partnership">partnership with MediaTek</a> to integrate its current and future G-Sync features into MediaTek scalers and eliminate the need for dedicated G-Sync modules. G-Sync originally required a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/introducing-nvidia-g-sync-revolutionary-ultra-smooth-stutter-free-gaming/">dedicated module in 2013</a> to allow it to synchronize display refresh rates to a GPU, eliminate screen tearing, and reduce display stutter and input lag.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/854662/nvidia-g-sync-pulsar-monitors-abmient-adaptive-technology-auto-brightness]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nvidia is announcing its next major update to its Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) feature at CES today. DLSS 4.5 includes Nvidia’s second-generation Super Resolution transformer model and a new 6x Multi Frame Generation mode for RTX 50-series GPUs that uses AI to generate up to five additional frames for every single rendered one.</p><p>DLSS 4.5 will be available for all RTX GPUs today, but will run the fastest on Nvidia’s latest RTX 40- and 50-series cards. The latest transformer model is designed to improve image quality overall and reduce some of the artifacting that we saw with DLSS 4.</p><p>“This second-generation model is our most sophisticated yet,” says Henry Lin, director of product management at Nvidia, in a briefing with <em>The Verge</em>. “It utilizes 5x the compute power over the original transformer model, it’s trained on a significantly expanded high-fidelity dataset, and it also takes full advantage of our GeForce RTX 40- and 50-series GPUs, which benefit from faster and more advanced Tensor Cores.”</p><p>Nvidia has updated its DLSS model to better understand scenes in games so it can use game engine data to improve lighting, finer edges, and motion clarity. In a briefing, Nvidia demonstrated improvements to DLSS 4.5 in a variety of games. Ghosting is reduced in <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em>, anti-aliasing is improved in <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>, and there is less shimmering in certain scenes in <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em>.</p><p>While the AI model improvements to DLSS 4.5 will benefit all RTX owners today, Nvidia is also launching a new 6x Multi Frame Generation mode for RTX 50-series owners in spring. Targeted at 240Hz 4K gaming, the 6x mode will generate five additional fake frames for every single rendered one, instead of the maximum of three additional in DLSS 4.</p><p>Nvidia is also launching a Dynamic Multi Frame Generation mode that automatically switches between different Multi Frame Generation levels depending on when you need more or less fake frames. “When things are really graphically intense, it upshifts and increases the Frame Generation required to bridge the performance dips, ensuring that your high refresh rate monitor remains buttery smooth,” explains Lin. “When the workload lightens, it seamlessly shifts the multiplier down to compute only what’s needed.”</p><p>DLSS 4.5 will be available for more than 400 games and apps through Nvidia’s app today, allowing RTX owners to force 4.5 on in games that haven’t been updated yet. Nvidia is only committing to a vague “spring 2026” timeframe for its 6x Multi Frame Generation and Dynamic Frame Generation modes for RTX 50-series owners.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/854610/nvidia-dlss-4-5-announcement-multi-frame-generation-6x-specs]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/intel-launches-core-ultra-series-3-cpus-made-using-its-long-awaited-18a-process/</link>
            <guid>1397947</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>Like past Core Ultra generations, the Core Ultra 3 chips use a chiplet-based approach, combining several distinct silicon tiles on a foundational “base tile” using Intel’s Foveros packaging technology. The compute tile houses the CPU cores and the neural processing unit (NPU), and it’s the piece that’s built using 18A—there are two version of this tile, one with a maximum of 16 CPU cores and one with 8. The platform controller tile, which handles most I/O, is still being built at TSMC, as is the high-end 12-core version of the graphics tile. A simpler four-core version of the graphics tile is being made using an older Intel 3 process, which to date has mostly been used for Intel’s Xeon server CPUs.</p>


<p>The chiplet-based approach allows Intel to mix-and-match these tiles to offer three distinct iterations of Panther Lake: the 16-core CPU and the 12-core GPU, the 16-core CPU and the 4-core GPU, and the 8-core CPU and the 4-core GPU. Versions of these chips with some CPU and GPU cores switched off fill out the rest of the Core Ultra Series 3 lineup.</p>
<p>Intel is making big performance claims about the highest-end Core Ultra Series 3 processors: up to 60 percent faster multi-core CPU performance compared to the outgoing Core Ultra 200V chips, and up to 77 percent faster integrated GPU performance. Intel also says a “Lenovo IdeaPad reference design” using a Core Ultra X9 388H was able to stream Netflix at 1080p for 27.1 hours, though how battery life shakes out in real-world laptops is going to vary widely based on other specs and settings.</p>
<p>All Panther Lake chips will also include the same neural processing unit (NPU), capable of up to 50 trillion operations per second (TOPS). This puts it well above the 40 TOPS requirement for Microsoft’s Copilot+ PC label, if a bit short of the 60 TOPS that AMD is claiming for its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/amd-reheats-last-years-ryzen-ai-and-x3d-cpus-for-2026s-laptops-and-desktops/">Ryzen AI 400 series</a> and the 80 TOPS that Qualcomm says its Snapdragon X2 chips are capable of. Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6.0, and up to four Thunderbolt 4 ports round out the most important connectivity features.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether Core Ultra Series 3 chips are a turning point for Intel’s fortunes or a temporary rebound in between years of missed deadlines (Panther Lake is a month later than Intel <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/intels-next-generation-panther-lake-laptop-chips-could-be-a-return-to-form/">said it would be in October</a>, though by its recent standards that isn’t bad). But their launch later this month suggests that the company’s 18A facilities are up and running, opening the door to the kind of third-party chip manufacturing that former CEO Pat Gelsinger <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/07/intels-foundry-roadmap-lays-out-the-post-nanometer-angstrom-era/">began pursuing nearly five years ago</a>.</p>

            <guid>1397944</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Intel, AMD, Nvidia, and other chip companies usually have some kind of news to announce at CES to kick off the year, but some of those announcements are more interesting than others. Sometimes you see new chips with significant speed boosts and other new technologies, and sometimes you get rebranded versions of old silicon meant to fill out a lineup or make an existing architecture seem newer and more exciting than it is.</p>
<p>AMD’s Ryzen CPU announcements this year fall firmly into the latter camp—these are all gently tweaked variants of chips that launched in 2024 and 2025.</p>
<h2>“New,” for certain values of “new”</h2>


<p>Let’s start with the Ryzen AI 400 series. Officially the follow-up to the Ryzen AI 300 chips <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/amds-ryzen-ai-300-series-laptop-cpus-are-its-first-for-new-copilot-pcs/">announced in June 2024</a>, these processors offer some modest clock speed improvements and faster memory support. The new Ryzen AI 9 HX 470 has a peak boost clock speed of 5.2 GHz and support for LPDDR5x-8533, for example, up from 5.1 GHz and LPDDR5x-8000 for the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370, and its built-in neural processing unit (NPU) is capable of 60 trillion operations per second (TOPS) rather than 50 TOPS.</p>
<p>But beyond those modest tweaks, Ryzen AI 400 chips are constructed from the same building blocks as Ryzen AI 300. They use a combination of high-performance Zen 5 CPU cores and smaller, more efficient Zen 5c cores, between 4 and 16 integrated GPU cores based on the RDNA 3 GPU architecture, and a 4 nm TSMC manufacturing process.</p>
<p>This isn’t new behavior from AMD. A couple of processor generations ago (and one processor naming scheme ago), the company did the same thing with the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/12/amds-new-ryzen-8040-laptop-chips-look-a-lot-like-the-ryzen-7040-cpus/">Ryzen 8040-series laptop chips</a>, sprucing up the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/amd-is-ready-to-launch-its-twice-delayed-ryzen-7000-chips-for-lightweight-laptops/">older 7040 series</a> with marginally higher clock speeds and not much else. The upshot is that if you can get a decent discount on a Ryzen AI 300 system because it’s “old,” you can buy it without missing much.</p>

There aren’t many details right now, as Alienware is only sharing some basic renders, and the behind-glass nonworking prototypes I saw for myself were barred from being photographed.</p><p>But the basics are that the ultra-slim model will come in 14- and 16-inch versions and be around 17mm thin, and while its performance will be limited, it’ll feature discrete Nvidia graphics. Alienware is sharing even fewer details about its upcoming entry-level model, aside from its head of product Matt McGowan saying in a media briefing that it’s targeting a price hundreds cheaper than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/662857/alienware-aurora-16-16x-gaming-laptop-nvidia-rtx-price-specs">current offerings</a>. That should put it in sub-$1,000 territory.</p><p>Speaking of current Alienware laptops, the 16-inch Area-51 and Aurora 16X models are getting new anti-glare OLED panel options. Alienware claims they “reduce gloss by 32 percent” and minimize fingerprint smudges (granted, these aren’t touchscreens). The new displays feature HDR True Black 500, peak brightness of 600 nits when displaying HDR content, and have built-in pixel protection to reduce chances of burn-in.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NDQ2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Antonio G.

The new Ryzen 7 9850X3D offers up the same 8-core / 16-thread CPU as the 9800X3D, running at even faster boost clocks.</p><p>“We’ve fine-tuned our best gaming processor in the world and have increased the boost clocks to 5.6GHz,” says Rahul Tikoo, the head of AMD’s client CPU business, in a briefing with <em>The Verge</em>. The boost clock on the 9850X3D is 400MHz higher than the standard 9800X3D, and it maintains the same 120-watt TDP. It’s essentially a better-binned version of the 9800X3D, and how much faster it is over the existing chip will vary on a game-by-game basis.</p><p>“We are seeing in the ballpark of about 7 percent performance delta between the 9800X3D and the 9850X3D,” says Tikoo. “When you look at frequency-sensitive titles like many esports games, we’ll see 5 percent plus uplift in performance,” while AAA games won’t see much of a difference at all.</p><p>Naturally, AMD couldn’t resist also comparing the 9850X3D to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24278407/intel-ultra-9-285k-benchmarks-performance-hands-on">Intel’s Core Ultra 9 285K</a>, which not only failed to beat the latest Zen 5 X3D chips but also didn’t compare well against Intel’s own previous 14900K flagship in gaming.</p><p>“The Ryzen 7 9850X3D unlocks performance, delivering an average of 27 percent uplift versus our competitors across a subset of more than 35 games,” says Tikoo.

            <title><![CDATA[Lego Is Launching An Evolutionary 2x4 Smart Brick Featuring A Tiny Computer]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/lego-is-launching-an-evolutionary-2x4-smart-brick-featuring-a-tiny-computer</link>
            <guid>1397929</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Lego has officially announced a new 2x4 "smart brick" at CES 2026 this week. It's apparently the "most significant evolution" in the Lego system since the release of the Minifigure in 1978 and is part of the company's "smart play" initiatives.</p>
<p>This brick, which will be featured in new Star Wars sets launching this March, is expected to expand to other sets. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/854556/lego-announces-smart-brick-the-most-significant-evolution-in-50-years">According to The Verge</a>, there are supposedly already rumours about how it could be included in the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-champions">Pokémon</a> line, due out this year. So, what's all the fuss about?</p>
<p>As reported by the tech site, this is "the most ambitious brick" Lego has ever made, with a "tiny computer that fits entirely inside a classic 2x4 Lego brick". It's a custom ASIC chip and is "smaller than a single Lego stud" with firmware that can be updated via a smartphone app.</p>
<p>It's got a built-in battery that will "still perform after years of inactivity" and can be wirelessly charged on a pad that can recharge multiple bricks at once.</p>
<p>When it detects NFC-equipped smart tags inside smart Lego tiles and minifigures, it will be able to interact with these sets and bring them to life. For example, the new Star Wars sets now support humming lightsabers, light-up blasters, and the roar of TIE Fighters and X-Wings.</p>
<figure data-uuid="6bfd6128cba40"><a title="LEGO Smart Brick" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6bfd6128cba40/lego-smart-brick.large.png"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: LEGO</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The source goes into more detail about this new smart brick (originally piloted in a Lego City set in 2024) and how it can enhance play:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"They have light and sound, light sensors, inertial sensors to detect movement, tilt, and gestures, and they form a Bluetooth mesh network with other Smart Bricks, so they’re aware of each other’s position and orientation — so Lego Star Wars ships and figures can do battle, for example, or so <em>The Imperial March</em> plays when you sit Emperor Palpatine on his throne. When built into Lego cars, the bricks could detect which one crosses a finish line first, or change from engine noises to crashing sound effects if the vehicle is flipped over."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lego Group spokesperson Jessica Benson also told the outlet how the new brick contains a microphone, which acts as a "virtual button" and sensor point for play functions - like blowing out candles on a cake (rather than recording anything). It has also been confirmed there is "no AI" or camera in this product, so don't expect the Lego Mario titles to be recognised.</p>
<p>As you might have already guessed, these smart bricks will bump up the costs of sets. Nintendo has also expanded its Lego line in recent years with IP such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda</a>, so there's a chance future sets could utilise these new bricks.</p>

        <p>The dramatic tale of ambition, betrayal, and honor will come to life with an updated and enriched script with fully voiced dialogue, alongside improved graphics that bring a new level of immersion and playability to the battlefield. Additionally, the enhanced version brings quality-of-life updates like new difficulties, a revamped UI, auto save, and more that make the game more accessible to newcomers. The game features strategic, turn-based combat and an elaborate character progression system that makes every battle exhilarating and filled with unexpected twists.</p><p>Hailed as one of gaming’s greatest stories, in this standalone game, players will step into the Kingdom of Ivalice—a medieval world steeped in political conflict—in which players uncover the truth behind the young noble Ramza Beoulve, whose role on history’s stage has been buried from view.</p><p>The new key art of Ramza and Delita, the two heroes of this story, is drawn by Akihiko Yoshida. The art depicts the complex relationship of the two individuals—whether they stand together to protect one another, or the start of a departure as they walk divergent paths. Above them, Ovelia and Alma, both of whom have strong ties to Ramza and Delita, solemnly look into the distance, foreshadowing the direction that fate will lead them.</p><p>Legendary developers from the original game will make their return in <em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em>, including Kazutoyo Maehiro (director), Hiroshi Minagawa (art director), and Yasumi Matsuno (original script, scenario writer and editor).</p><p><em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em> will include both enhanced and classic versions of the game. The enhanced version features modern upgrades and quality-of-life changes, including fully voiced characters, a ground-up graphical overhaul and an updated user interface that make <em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em> the perfect entry point to the tactical <a title="Genres > RPG [17,923 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a> classic for new players. The classic version is a nostalgic recreation of the game, developed for players who want to experience the original <em><a title="Games > Final Fantasy Tactics [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/final-fantasy-tactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a></em> from 1997.</p><p><em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em>‘ voice cast featuring an all-star lineup of new and returning <em><a title="Series > Final Fantasy [146 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/final-fantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em> cast members, including Joe Pitts (Ramza), Gregg Lowe (Delita), <a title="Games > Hannah" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/hannah">Hannah</a> Melbourn (Agrias), Timothy Watson (Cidolfus), Harry McEntire (Mustadio), Ben Starr (Dycedarg), and cameos by Cody Christian (Cloud Strife from <em><a title="Games > Final Fantasy VII Remake [107 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a></em> series) and Briana White (Aerith Gainsborough from <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> series).</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Challenging, Tactical Turn-Based Battles</strong> – <a title="Companies > Experience [212 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> the addictive tactical turn-based combat and deep character progression system that made the game an instant tactical RPG classic.

The classic version faithfully recreates the 1997 release of <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> alongside the acclaimed War of the Lions translation—perfect for fans who wish to relive the original experience.</li></ul></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-shipments-and-digital-sales-top-one-million]]></content:encoded>

		<p>It's funny. This is the kind of week where it would be very easy to find myself sipping on a beer each night before bed, scrolling through hype videos about the upcoming Chicago Bears playoff game. Instead, I gotta work off some of my overindulging over the holidays with daily treadmill runs. I usually run in the morning, but maybe I should start running at night and swap an IPA for burning a couple hundred calories? I mean, it'll make the IPA taste better this weekend. Literally as I'm typing this out, StubHub sent me a notification informing me Bears tickets are available for the game this weekend, but thankfully, a family party in the early afternoon will prevent me from making a poor financial choice and trying to attend said game. If they win and play at home again? <em>Stop it.</em></p><p>-pk, who is already laying out reasons for this year's Bears season to be a success no matter what happens, preemptively guarding his heart</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>Sports!</em> – I promise we'll do an emergency pod about next week's game, regardless of outcome, but I don't know that we'll do a full Sports! pod. It's a lot of football and, in theory, this publication should do other things, too. (I have a podcast idea I'm hoping to start rolling out in February? Stay tuned.)</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Steam Vent </em>– It's been a minute since Chia and I went scrolling down Steam's new releases category looking for gems. Time to dive back in.</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>RV There Yet?</em> – I guess we're not done with this? For some reasons that will be disclosed on a later <em>HOA</em>, this might shift days and/or become something else, depending on Rob's schedule. Second stream will still happen.</li><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>Remap Radio</em> – The final "normal" Remap Radio podcast for a minute, before we switch over to our Game of the Year podcast recordings. Someone's homework assignment may or may not have done a number on me.</li><li><strong>ARTICLE:</strong> <em>Letter Series</em> – Topic to be determined. </li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a></p>

        <p>From IzanagiGames, the creators who challenged the boundary between games and movies with <em><a title="Games > Death Come True [24 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/death-come-true">Death Come True</a></em>, comes a new live-action multi-angle ensemble suspense game—<em>AKIBA LOST</em>—developed in collaboration with Nippon TV, one of Japan’s leading broadcast networks, and the drama production company AX-ON.</p><p>Switch between the protagonist Shinjo and six female characters to uncover the truth of the story in this zapping-style <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,805 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure game</a>.</p><p>The stage is Akihabara, Japan’s iconic subculture town. Game creator Shinjo has gathered six unique actresses who each embody the spirit of Akihabara.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>13 years ago, six girls mysteriously vanished in Akihabara—an unsolved case known as “Akiba’s Spirited Away.”</p><p>At the annual Game Show, Daiki Shinjo (played by Hiromitsu Kitayama), once hailed as a “genius creator,” boldly announces the development of a new game inspired by this very incident: AKIBA LOST. But the moment he does, strange disappearances begin again.</p><p>The cast of the game includes his sister Aoi Shinjo, who works at a maid cafe, underground idol Kokone Nagato, food writer Moe Kurosu, shrine maiden Chihiro Jimbo, cosplayer Wakana Yusa, and game streamer Yukimi Kurahashi—each a colorful icon of Akihabara’s vibrant subculture.</p><p>Yet, the story they were supposed to perform soon begins to bleed into reality.</p><p>It all begins with a threatening phone call—and the sudden disappearance of Aoi.</p><p>“Cancel the game’s development—or the tragedy will repeat itself.”</p><p>Can Shinjo finish developing the game? Can he protect his friends? Who is behind it all? And what really happened thirteen years ago?</p><p>The choice that determines the ending of this story is now in your hands.</p><p><strong>Characters</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Daiki Shinjo</strong> (portrayed by Hiromitsu Kitayama) – Game creator. Founder of “Shirosawa Games.” His debut title was a major hit, earning him the reputation of a “genius creator,” but his later works failed to replicate that success. He has two younger sisters; the youngest, Ruri, was one of the six girls who vanished in Akihabara 13 years ago in an unsolved case known as the “Akiba Disappearance.” Struggling with stagnation in his daily life, he declares that he will make a comeback by creating a game based on the very incident that took his sister away. Its title: AKIBA LOST.</li><li><strong>Aoi Shinjo</strong> (portrayed by Sayuri Matsumura) – Maid. The younger sister of Shinjo, she works as the manager of a maid café in Akihabara. Since the disappearance of the youngest sibling, Ruri, she has often clashed with her brother, who immersed himself in game development, and they have barely seen each other over the past 13 years. After graduating high school, she has continued to live in Akihabara, the site of the incident. While usually somewhat aloof, she occasionally reveals a tsundere side that captivates many of her customers.</li><li><strong>Yukimi Kurahashi</strong> (portrayed by Momoko Tanabe) – Game streamer. Working as a designer at “Shirosawa Games,” she is also a popular game streamer, having gained a following through his streaming, which began out of his love for games. A huge fan of Shinjo’s debut work, White Crash, he moved to Tokyo and boldly joined Shirosawa Games. He looks up to Shinjo and co-founder Takasawa like older brothers. His occasional Tohoku accent that slips out during streams adds to his charm and draws in viewers.</li><li><strong>Moe Kurosu</strong> (portrayed by Misato Ugaki) – Gourmet writer. A gourmet writer specializing in Akihabara, known for exploring the district through its food. Originally a generalist writer, she became fascinated with Akihabara’s subculture about three years ago and now introduces everything from long-established restaurants to the latest trend cafés and unique eateries with her own unique perspective. While her casual outfits are accessorized to match her style, her tough, tomboyish personality is reflected in her rugged car.</li><li><strong>Kokone Nagato</strong> (portrayed by Yui Oguri of AKB48) – Underground idol. An underground idol active mainly in small live houses in Akihabara. She belongs to the group “Baby☆Macaron.” While exuding the full charm of a classic idol, her ambition to succeed is unmatched. She switches clearly between on- and off-stage life, often wearing high-end brand clothes and accessories outside of performances.</li><li><strong>Chihiro Jimbo</strong> (portrayed by Azusa Ohara) – Shrine maiden. A shrine maiden working part-time at Kanda Myojin, the guardian deity of Akihabara. After an event in her childhood, she came to believe in the existence of gods and developed a deep gratitude for the city of Akihabara. She is also an avid gamer and easily clears even difficult <a title="Genres > Action [3,315 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action games</a>. Calm and gentle, her catchphrase is “Kami desu…” (“It’s divine…”).</li><li><strong>Wakana Yusa</strong> (portrayed by MINA) – Cosplayer. A cosplayer based in Akihabara. She has dedicated over ten years to cosplaying Ririka from the legendary game Magical <a title="Companies > Elementa [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/happy-elements/elementa">Elementa</a>ry Student Ririka, fully embodying her love for the character. As a returnee from overseas, she is fluent in English and interacts easily with foreign tourists. Her cheerful personality and excellent communication skills keep her going full speed along the “Ririka cosplay path.”</li></ul><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Zapping: Character Switching System</strong> – Freely switch between characters to experience the same timeline from multiple perspectives. One character’s single choice may change another’s fate.</li><li><strong>Select: Choice System</strong> – The story branches according to the player’s decisions. A single choice can ripple across characters — and alter the ending.</li><li><strong>360-Degree View: Immersive Camera System</strong> – Step into each character’s point of view. Look around freely through their eyes for a deeply immersive, cinematic experience.</li><li><strong>Buddy Characters</strong> – Meet colorful partner characters who accompany you throughout the story.</li></ul></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/akiba-lost-launches-september-17]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Asus ROG Zephyrus Duo is back, but for CES 2026 both its screens are going full edge-to-edge — like a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24140334/asus-zenbook-duo-vs-lenovo-yoga-book-9i">Zenbook Duo</a> built for gaming. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21431381/asus-rog-zephyrus-duo-15-review">original Zephyrus Duo</a> was a quirky keyboard-in-the-front-club member, with a 15.6-inch main display and a 14.1-inch-wide, skinny touchscreen crammed between the hinge and side-by-side keyboard and trackpad. The new model features two full-size 16-inch 3K 120Hz OLED HDR displays that can reach 1,100 nits of peak brightness and a detachable keyboard / trackpad you can use wirelessly or over the bottom display.</p><p>And since this multi-screen monster is a gaming laptop, it offers Intel Panther Lake and Nvidia RTX 50-series GPUs (up to the RTX 5090). Pricing isn’t finalized, but it’s expected to launch in mid-to-late Q2 2026.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->4</strong><span><figcaption><em>The new Zephyrus Duo (center) beside its predecessor (right).</em></figcaption> <cite>Photo: Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></span></p></section><p>The new Zephyrus Duo is basically a double Zephyrus G16, so it’s a little chunkier at 0.77 inches / 19.6mm thick, and it weighs 6.28 pounds / 2.85kg. The detachable keyboard deck allows you to use its dual screens in two-up or side-by-side dual-screen positions, tent mode, flat mode, or as a normal single-screen laptop. Like the G16, it has a plethora of ports including HDMI 2.1, USB-C / Thunderbolt 4, USB-A, and a full-size SD card slot.</p><p>I got a glimpse of the new Zephyrus Duo at an early preview event, and holy hell am I excited for this thing. We’ve long been big fans of Asus ROG Zephyrus laptops here at <em>The Verge</em>, because they’re so versatile as travel-friendly laptops that are great for both work and gaming. The thought of taking that same formula and turning it into a multi-display setup for new levels of multitasking sounds incredibly compelling. (<em>Battlefield 6</em> on one screen and WordPress and Slack on the other, anyone?)</p><p>As for the conventional ROG Zephyrus G14 and ROG Zephyrus G16 gaming laptops, they’re getting a modest but nice-sounding refresh with Intel Panther Lake chips. The design remains mostly unchanged, with RTX 50-series GPUs on offer, but the slash lighting on the lid is now 35 LED segments instead of just seven — and it can now show the battery level. The hinges are easier to open, the OLED displays are now factory-calibrated and HDR-compatible (reaching up to 1,000 nits of brightness), and the bottom panel is redesigned for better cooling that Asus claims enables improved performance.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->4</strong><span><figcaption><em>Yep, those look like ROG Zephyrus G14 laptops.</em></figcaption> <cite>Photo: Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></span></p></section><p>Also, the G14 now sports a full-size SD card slot (hooray for us photographers) and will be available for the first time with Intel as well as its usual AMD options. The new G14 and G16 don’t have official pricing yet, but they’re both expected in mid-to-late Q2 2026 like their dual-screen cousin.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NDQ2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Antonio G.

The Asus ROG Flow Z13 x Kojima Productions edition takes last year’s excellent AMD Strix Halo-equipped gaming tablet and dresses it up in a Yoji Shinkawa design, complete with a two-tone metallic gold and black color combo and carbon fiber rear panel cover.</p><p>The tablet and its kickstand are decked out in angular geometric lines reminiscent of the gritty mechanized future tech seen in the <em>Death Stranding</em> games, as well as the design language of Kojima Productions mascot <a href="https://www.kojimaproductions.jp/en/welcome_to_kojima_productions">Ludens</a>. It’s also got military tech-style warnings and mottos printed on it, ranging from “Heat vent do not cover” to “For Ludens who dare” — a play on the ROG motto, “For those who dare.”</p><p>The KJP edition includes a white attache hard case, and there’s also a matching white headset, mouse, and desk mat sold separately (or bundled in some countries). The ROG Flow Z13-KJP will launch in mid-to-late Q1 2026. There isn’t a price yet, but that should be finalized closer to availability. Asus reps tell me that exclusive variants are being made for the Kojima Productions team, which will feature a special keyboard with metallic keycaps.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->13</strong><span><figcaption><em>The keyboard cover has a new faux-leather material to complement its multicolor keys.</em></figcaption></span></p></section><p>I didn’t touch either <em>Death Stranding</em> game, but part of me wants this tablet.

The 2026 Crosshair has a bit of RGB on the keyboard, but otherwise keeps the design fairly low-key, with an MSI logo and subtle mecha-style accents on the lid.</p><p>The Crosshair 16 Max HX is expected to launch as early as April 2026 starting at $1,649.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6ODAzMzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Stevie Bonifield</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/850944/ces-2026-msi-crosshair-16-max]]></content:encoded>

He joined in 2018, and after a two-year stint at Polygon, he rejoined <em>The Verge</em> in May 2025.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>HP’s branding is missing on its new gaming laptops (and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/845706">gaming monitors</a>) announced at CES 2026 — HP-owned HyperX has gotten a <em>big </em>promotion in its place. This swap is the biggest aesthetic change in the Omen lineup (the logo is on the lid and on the screen’s bottom bezel). In other words, not much is different on the outside compared to 2025’s models. But there are some spec strides worth noting across the lineup.</p><p>The Omen 15, which replaces the Victus 15, has a 15.3-inch 16:10 aspect ratio display that starts at 1,920 x 1,200 but can be configured with up to a 3K 120Hz OLED screen. Every configuration has a four-zone RGB backlit keyboard that boasts an 8K polling rate (all new models announced today can be configured with this keyboard for an added cost), and you can opt for the latest Intel or AMD-based processors. The Omen 15 sports two user-accessible RAM ports and ships with 8GB DDR5 RAM by default. As for graphics, this model starts with Nvidia’s RTX 5050 but can go up to the 5070 (8GB VRAM for each GPU option).</p><p>The Omen 16 can also be configured with Intel or AMD processors (only the AMD units offer two slots of user-serviceable RAM), with the option of Nvidia’s RTX 5060 or 5070 (both are 8GB VRAM variants). This model boasts a 16-inch 16:10 aspect ratio screen that has the same starting resolution as the Omen 15, but can be configured with up to a 2.5K 165Hz OLED screen (it has a slightly lower screen-to-body ratio compared to the 15, at 87 percent compared to 91 percent). This model is available in black or white.</p><p>Lastly, there’s the Omen Max 16 that has supercharged specs compared to the base Omen 16. Its top-end 2.5K OLED screen can go up to 240Hz, and the graphics card offered starts at the 5070 Ti and includes the 5090 for those who want the highest level of performance possible in the lineup. You can opt for AMD or Intel here, but your choice impacts overall RAM speed and quantity possible. The priciest Intel models support up to 64GB of DDR5-6400 RAM, while the AMD models support up to 48GB DDR5-5600, but both models allow for user-replaceable memory. Like the Omen 16, this one’s available in black or white.</p><p>HP hasn’t announced pricing or an expected launch window for any of these laptops.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/845774/hyperx-omen-15-16-max-specs]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The next generation of HyperX’s Origins wired keyboards debuted at CES 2026, and the company has focused on adding more performance and customization. For example, its new Origins 2 and Origins 2 Pro are both 65-percent options with high-profile keys that boast a PCB with hot-swappable switches that doesn’t require soldering to tweak.</p><p>The Origins 2 features HyperX’s pre-lubed linear red switches (this model is compatible with most three- and five-pin mechanical switches), while the Pro model has Hall effect switches (HyperX claims that most two-pin magnetic switches are supported, if you want to hot swap them). The Hall effect switches support all of the features that gamers have come to expect, including rapid trigger, adjustable actuation points that can be set within HyperX’s Ngenuity software, and simultaneous opposing cardinal direction (SOCD), the latter of which is a controversial feature used in competitive gaming.</p><p>Moving beyond the switches, if you prefer a different color to the default black housing surrounding the keys, you can snap it off with a built-in tool and install another option that HyperX will soon sell — or you’ll be able to find the official 3D files at <a href="http://printables.com/@HyperX">Printable</a> to print your own.</p><p>Both compact options have O-ring mounts for each key to give them what HyperX calls “a light bounce and deeper sound,” but they can be removed if you’d prefer to not have them. Also, they have plate-mounted stabilizers installed out of the box to reduce wobble, but they support aftermarket screw-in stabilizers, too.</p><p>In terms of performance, the Origins 2 and Origins 2 Pro feature 8K polling rate, which tells your PC to register inputs 8,000 times per second as opposed to 1,000Hz, the standard among cheaper gaming gadgets that registers inputs 1,000 times per second. For most people 1K is still perfectly fine, and the jump to 8K may not even be noticeable.</p><p>HyperX is also launching a wired mechanical keyboard in the 1800 form factor called the Origins 2 1800. Its specs are similar to that of the Origins 2 65-percent model, and it offers a similarly deep level of customization, both to its aesthetics and to the PCB itself. You can replace the switches and stabilizers as well as the plastic housing covering the keyboard’s chassis.</p><p>HP, which owns HyperX, hasn’t shared pricing or release dates for these keyboards.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/846558/hyperx-origins-2-gaming-wired-keyboard-customization-specs]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Among HP’s many announcements for CES, its biggest overall change is for its gaming division. HP’s Omen line of gaming laptops, monitors, and desktops are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/845774">dropping the HP name entirely</a> and instead will henceforth be branded as HyperX. The HP Omen 16 Max laptop becomes the HyperX Omen 16 Max. HP Omen monitors will become HyperX Omen monitors. And even the HP Victus 15’s spiritual successor will be a HyperX Omen 15.</p><p>This all strikes me as odd, and all these new computers and monitors with the spelled-out HyperX or shortened Hx logos look a bit low-rent to my eyes. There’s just something about that logo on a computer that seems chintzy.</p><p>HyperX was a gaming brand that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298904/hp-acquires-hyperx-kingston-announcement">HP acquired in 2021</a>. At that time, it was well-known and regarded for its gaming headsets, mice, microphones, and keyboards, but it started <a href="https://hyperx.com/pages/about">back in 2002</a> under Kingston making DDR1 RAM sticks. Omen, on the other hand, has a pedigree based in making actual computers. It stems from the lineage of another HP acquisition, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VoodooPC">VoodooPC</a>, a Canadian company founded way back in 1991 that made unique desktops.</p><p>If you’ve never experienced lower-back pain and are therefore too young to be familiar with VoodooPC, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1933275/the-hp-firebird-was-a-revolution-in-desktop-pc-design.html">PC World’s look back at the 2009 HP Firebird</a> gives a good glimpse into the company’s ingenuity. And HP’s own <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/8/16/12508720/hp-omen-x-desktop-gaming-cube">cube-shaped Omen X desktop</a> from 2016 was another example of the bold design it inherited (and also squandered) with Voodoo / Omen.</p><p>I may not have the love for HyperX like some folks do, but I’ve got nothing against its products or the darling status it had among gamers pre-HP acquisition. It made nice accessories, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22686476/hyperx-cloud-iii-wireless-features-price-release-date">headsets that were beloved</a> for their lightweight comfort and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297466/audio-gear-headphones-earbuds-speakers-mics#:~:text=HyperX%20QuadCast%20microphone">streaming-focused microphones</a> known for their iconic RGB lighting. Even recently, under HP, it introduced some interesting <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24336191/check-out-these-colorful-modular-mouse-shells">mice with novel ideas about customization</a>.</p><p>But it was always an accessory brand and often a “bang for your buck” one at that. So it’s super weird to me that the accessory brand now has its name elevated to laptop, desktop, and monitor status instead of the higher-level Omen name trickling down to some keyboards, mice, headsets, and mics. (Not that I’m rooting for the HyperX name to go away.)</p><p>When I see that logo on a laptop I can’t help thinking of no-name brands sold by the likes of Amazon and Newegg — the types I tell family and friends to stay away from in favor of established ones like HP Omen / Victus, Lenovo Legion, and Asus ROG (to name a few). I know that’s not the case with HyperX, and I’ll get used to recommending them the same I do with the equivalent HP models now. But this feels like an unforced error.</p><p>As HP reps were excitedly telling me about their new unified branding, it took me right back to a year ago, watching Dell execs willfully shoot themselves in the foot when they <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24325799/dell-pro-max-premium-plus-ces-laptop-pc-rebrand-announcement">announced the death of their XPS brand</a> in favor of lesser-sounding laptop names. 364 days later, Dell is doing an about-face and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/851047">XPS laptops are back</a>. When Dell COO Jeff Clarke recently announced that reversal to a room full of media members and analysts, he capitulated, “Marketing matters.” Now, HyperX-ing all the things feels like a similarly bad omen for HP.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NDQ2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Antonio G.
