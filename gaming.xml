                <p>In 2018, as part of the promotion for Avengers: Infinity War, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/thanos-arrives-in-fortnite-for-avengers-infinity-w/1100-6458760/" data-ref-id="1100-6458760">Thanos was added to Fortnite</a>, complete with the Infinity Gauntlet and some dance moves that would make John Travolta blush. But it may not have ever happened if Infinity War directors Anthony and Joe Russo hadn't directly lobbied Epic Games to bring Thanos into the world of Fortnite.</p><p>During <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/how-a-nearly-six-hour-phone-call" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business Live</a>, Pete Wanat--the president of interactive technology for the Russos' AGBO--revealed that Epic's former chief creative officer, Donald Mustard, wasn't initially on board with having Thanos in Fortnite. That's why Anthony and Joe Russo spent hours convincing him go forward with it.</p><p>"Originally it was like, 'No, we are not interested in putting outside characters into Fortnite,'" recalled Wanat. "And Joe and Anthony got together and had a phone call with Donald. It was supposed to be a half-hour call, but five-and-a-half hours later, they were still talking about it. And Donald basically changed his mind. He said, 'Hey, you know what, we're going to do this.' And after that, the world exploded about what kind of integrations you could have between film and TV and games."</p><p>Mustard ultimately went on to work directly for the Russos at AGBO, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-dancing-thanos-in-marvel-movies-is-better/1100-6458841/" data-ref-id="1100-6458841">dancing Thanos</a> became a meme that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-josh-brolin-responds-to-dancing-thanos-i-/1100-6458915/" data-ref-id="1100-6458915">confused his MCU actor</a>, Josh Brolin.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FldbEoG6fpo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FldbEoG6fpo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Once Thanos paved the way for outside characters to appear in Fortnite, it opened the floodgates.

                <p>Charles Martinet--once the voice actor for one of gaming's most iconic characters and now <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-will-no-longer-be-voiced-by-longtime-actor-charles-martinet/1100-6517020/" data-ref-id="1100-6517020">Nintendo's official Mario Ambassador</a>--has had to clarify his stance on voicing Mario for fans. After a viral post claimed Martinet was no longer allowed to do Mario's voice, Martinet posted to explain that he simply won't improvise lines for Mario.</p><p>After meeting with Martinet at a convention, YouTuber Ricky Berwick <a href="https://x.com/rickyberwick/status/1931740018596585814" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted to X</a> claiming the actor "wasn't even allowed to do the voice of Mario or any of his iconic character's voices." In the replies, another user <a href="https://x.com/MEBJR1001/status/1931859944938078582" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted</a> a similar story claiming Martinet couldn't do the voice because he was "under a contract." Berwick later clarified in a reply to his original post that Martinet did the Mario voice for him off camera, but "wasn't allowed to" on video.</p><p>While fans were concerned about the possibility of a restrictive contract with Nintendo, Martinet replied to the post directly, explaining that what he will and won't voice for fans at conventions is due to his own choices.</p><p>"I do the voice for every fan I meet," Martinet promised in a reply. "I just don't improvise non-Mario phrases or dialogue. That's my choice to be sure. I always maintain the integrity of the character."</p><p>Martinet first voiced Mario for 1996's Super Mario 64, and has reprised his role for countless games since. Martinet was replaced as the character's voice actor as of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-mario-bros-wonder/" data-ref-id="5000-591688">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a>, but has been given the official--if <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/charles-martinet-has-no-idea-what-a-mario-ambassador-does/1100-6517466/" data-ref-id="1100-6517466">somewhat vague</a>--title of Mario Ambassador. The role of Mario has now been taken up by voice actor Kevin Afghani, and Nintendo didn't make a big fuss about the recasting--telling fans they could find out who the new actor was in the end credits for the game.</p>

			<p>Have you ever played a video game that you could objectively discern was very good, and yet you just didn’t like? That’s The Alters for me, a clearly excellent game, though one I found so unpleasantly stressful I slightly resented playing it.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Alters | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/965Km7t6KwM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Jan Dolski is having a very bad day. He’s just crash-landed on a hostile planet, and while he’s initially grateful to have survived, that’s before realising the rest of his crew have clearly not. Nope, they are all very dead, and Jan is stranded and alone. As he explores the planet from a third-person perspective, he – and you – discover a huge-wheeled mobile base that landed on the planet prior to the crew’s arrival. So, things are looking up then? Nope. Day is about to dawn, and the scorching flames of the nuclear-like sun will evaporate everything in its path, including Jan. Cue a desperate escape in The Alters’ thrilling prologue.</p>


<p>Jan has one hope: Rapidium. This badly named element that has some mysterious properties, the primary one being that it allows Jan to clone himself. The Quantum Computer aboard the mobile base allows Jan to see his own life branch, all the crucial moments of his existence that made him, him. His relationship with his father, his decision to leave University, his divorce from his wife, all the variables led to Jan being where he is today. Thing is, using quantum gubbins, Jan can see alternative life branches, the version of him that would exist if he’d committed to university, or perhaps stood up to his abusive father. Those alternative versions – those Alters, if you will – can then be cloned.</p>


<p>They awake with memories of their imagined lives, confused and afraid, but eminently helpful in keeping Jan alive. Each Alter is the same – they are clones of Jan, after all – but entirely unique due to their differing life experiences. One’s a scientist who can research new tech, another a miner who can gather resources from the planet, another a gardener who can grow food to eat, you get the idea. They can also be an unruly bunch, and a huge part of the game is keeping everyone happy. Telling them what they want to hear, guiding them, comforting them, fulfilling side-tasks for them. Fail to keep them on side and they’ll become rebellious and distant. Lose your the support of your Alters and you’ll be doomed to a fiery death when you fail to escape the sun’s path.</p>
<p>It’s a fascinating sci-fi concept, and one that is elegantly and intriguingly explored by developer 11 bit Studios. There’s philosophical navel-gazing aplenty, but things never drag, thanks to a sharp script, engaging characterisation, and sterling voice acting from Alex Jordan who manages to provide each of Jan’s clones with a distinct personality. Indeed, the emotional beats really deliver, as Jan learns about himself, and perhaps, ultimately, maybe even learns to love himself too. The narrative is punchy, fascinating, and deeply compelling. It even kept me going through all the stress of the rest of the game.</p>

<p>Other than all of the cloning and getting to know yourself – both literally and figuratively, I guess – your time will be spent surviving. There are numerous resources to gather from the planet’s surface by setting up mining rigs, you’ll need these to keep constructing all the items that keep your mobile base rolling to safety, radiation filters, repair kits, all that stuff. You’ll also need to make food, construct new rooms, and overcome numerous obstacles that you’ll meet on your travels. Just when you think you’ve got a handle on the game, more demands are placed on you, more systems to balance against each other. 11 Bit Studios demand you make a house of cards before repeatedly and masochistically blowing at it.</p>
<p>It’s all incredibly tense and claustrophobic, in latter stages of the game, one wrong choice – perhaps one you made hours ago – can mean disaster. It is, of course, intended to be that way, and is no doubt an authentic take on surviving on a hostile planet. Indeed, the game is built to be replayed, and it even reminds you which dialogue choices you made in a previous play through so you can try something different.</p>

<p>I found myself feeling increasingly harassed. Managing dwindling resources, making difficult choices, trying to keep your Alters happy, the sun getting closer and closer and closer, never being able to quite get on top of things, despite how hard you try… it was all a bit too much like being a mid-level manager for my liking. Perhaps I was just having flashbacks to my time as a retail manager in a popular UK shop, but playing The Alters was more stressful than an enjoyable undertaking. The pressure keeps on getting cranked up and up until it’s all too much.</p>
<p>Now, don’t get me wrong, The Alters is brilliant. Finely balanced gameplay mechanics and an engaging narrative are to be celebrated. In fact, other than a few silly glitches, such as Jan getting stuck on scenery exploring the environment, this is something of a masterpiece. It’s just an unrelenting masterpiece that you’ll be happy to have survived.</p>

With new titles always on the horizon like nDreams' Action-Adventure title <em>Reach </em>always coming out I see continued evidence or rapid development, features to allow for more comfortable gameplay, and experiences that you just wouldn't be able to replicate on a 2D screen.</p>

<p>At this years' Summer Game Fest I not only got to play through a demo of the first level of <em>Reach</em>, but then got to talk with the development team and Shuhei Yoshida, their games' ambassador, about creating <em>Reach </em>as an experience for all to enjoy, how Yoshida became involved, how VR titles all lift each other up, and how the indie VR scene is a good place to be.</p>

<h2>Experiencing <em>Reach </em>Firsthand</h2>

<p>As my appointment began, I got strapped into the Quest 3 headset that was connected to a nearby computer. Having been asked if I'd worn a VR headset before, luckily, I was able to reference my early VR experience with a DK2 and original Vive, as well as my experience playing <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d21d65a5-4b5d-4746-8132-7a248cc992b2" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/deadpool-vr-pushes-vr-automotion-while-creating-fun-and-frantic-experience" rel="nofollow"><em>Deadpool VR</em></a> just the day earlier.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/reach-sgf-2025-opening-door.jpg?itok=BoRCMC4V 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/reach-sgf-2025-opening-door.jpg?itok=5Om32LCC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>From the getgo of the demo, I was impressed, after receiving options to play standing or sitting down I appeared at a terminal with a wide variety of visual and locomotion options. Did you want a quick pivot when turning, or a smooth glide? Would you like added effects over your view to help with motion sickness? Etc</p>

<p>Incredible care had gone into making sure no matter how new or old you were to VR there was a way to make the experience most comfortable to you, something we discussed further after the demo.</p>

<p>Once I was through the settings screen and into the game, I hit the ground with a running start. Starting in a warehouse, <em>Reach </em>began by teaching me the basics of movement, navigating between boxes, and climbing, at first with ladders before progressing to boxes and rivets, before I graduated to bricks jutting out of walls.</p>

<p>Something that was incredible during my experience was just how intuitive everything was. At first I was noticing the obvious 'climb up this' style objects, but it wasn't long that I was clambering all over the place for fun, then on a whim I tried to fling myself up with both hands… and it worked.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/reach-sgf-2025-climbing.jpg?itok=qKjRMlXR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/reach-sgf-2025-climbing.jpg?itok=jptPcbwY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The mobility is Reach is going to make it very interesting to watch (or attempt) speedruns</figcaption></figure><h2>VR That Makes You Want To Push Yourself</h2>

<p>Every time I thought to myself 'this is probably possible', I would attempt it and it would work. Whether it was the movement, interacting with random world objects, or creeping around corners to get the drop on guards everything was as I might expect from a gamified version of the real world. Honestly, the only thing holding me back from going full Star Wars kid in there was the fear of punching the TV I was positioned next to, or a nearby developer.</p>

<p>After locomotion was locked down I got to experience combat. The first item you obtain is a magical bow that crackles with energy as you draw back the string. Doing some experimentation, I found out arrows embed themselves in certain rock walls (that I assume you encounter more of in the full game), trying to pull the arrows out I instead learned that I could climb on them.</p>

<p>Firearms are also present in <em>Reach</em>, but nDreams developers liken it more to the firearms of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="101b22f0-d591-4997-8ea7-836f16709d24" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/mirrors-edge-catalyst-review-conflicting-ideas" rel="nofollow">Mirror's Edge</a>, they're a bit of a power up but very limited in their use so don't get too used to them.</p>

<p>The demo ended with a long chase sequence that had me dodging falling buildings amid explosions, flinging myself around obstacles, and leaping across massive gaps before sliding into a large blue crash pad.</p>

<p>Coming out of <em>Reach</em>, I had a blast playing, could immediately see the potential in the movement and combat, and watching the trailer for the full game and what it incorporated, I just wanted to hop right back in.</p>

<p>An Action-Adventure in PC/PS5 powered VR was fun, smooth, and functioned just as I'd expect a video game world to perform.</p>

<p>This is definitely going to be a reason for me to borrow, if not purchase a VR headset to be able to get the full experience.</p>

<h2>Yoshida Has Watched <em>Reach </em>From The Start</h2>

<p>Having completed my demo, standing around and talking with the developers at nDream and Shuhei Yoshida, I was interested to learn how he'd come on as an ambassador for the project.</p>

<p>Yoshida began by explaining that Synapse, nDream's 2023 VR title, was one of his favorite VR games. When the team began working on <em>Reach </em>three years ago, he had already seen samples of it while working as the Head of PlayStation Indies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"If [Yoshida] is excited then we know we're onto something"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When he retired, nDreams reached out to him to see if they'd be interested in continuing to work together and he agreed.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/reach-sgf-2025-parkour.jpg?itok=UZW59m17 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/reach-sgf-2025-parkour.jpg?itok=7I7rZd0n 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>From there I was interested to know what it was that Yoshida saw in <em>Reach </em>that made him so confident in it. He explained to me that he knew when trying out the movement that it was going to be something that people enjoyed. "It was clear they're trying to do what no one has done before, I really want them to be successful."</p>

<p>With a history of working with a variety of indie developers, and with the indie scene becoming more and more competitive as the number of games that release on digital platforms like Steam continue to ballon year after year I asked what indie developers could do to increase discoverability in a competitive scene.</p>

<p>Keeping the conversation close to <em>Reach </em>Yoshida highlighted that "for VR, unides are a huge part of the scene. nDreams started working on<em> The Assembly</em> on Oculus Rift and that for people who really want to make VR games, it's a passion."</p>

<p>Referencing popular VR titles and developers like <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3eee44f9-cebd-4ac0-9341-842a86cd69d4" href="https://techraptor.net/games/superhot-vr" rel="nofollow"><em>Super Hot</em></a> and Owlchemy Labs, Yoshida highlighted that "each of these games generated so much noise and experience." He also pointed out that as VR headsets increase in power and fidelity that "in the indie space, if you're passionate about VR there's less competition."</p>

<p>At that time nDreams developers lent their voice to the discussion explaining how "when a great game comes out it helps everyone out." explaining how things like locomotion controls improving over the years from the simple teleport to full action is a direct response to VR developers trying out other game's movements and taking what works to uplift them all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"In VR it's fun to watch good players play" - Shuhei Yoshida</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another developing aspect of VR is just how much work is going into the hardware side of assisting players who have various comfortability in VR.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/reach-sgf-2025-merged-worlds.jpg?itok=MaLRb3tN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/reach-sgf-2025-merged-worlds.jpg?itok=aBn4l3b3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Realities merging and trying to fix it will be the focus of <em>Reach's</em> story</figcaption></figure><h2>How Long Will <em>Reach </em>Be, And Where Can We Get Our Hands On It?</h2>

<p>Returning to watching the <em>Reach </em>trailer at the booth, I asked how long a player might expect the experience to take. I was told that it would be a "double-digit campaign," referencing how there's a linear story, but for those who want to challenge themselves with advanced platforming or combat, there will be all kinds of alternate paths.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Will be a double digit hour campaign [...] completionists could be several more hours"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the story segment I played I got a light tease of the story, learning that after establishing yourself as a well known stunt actress there would be an event that would cause multiple realities to merge. From there you get the strange mix of ancient and modern day architecture that you can see in the trailer.</p>

<p>Not much else was spoiled about the story, but they would be focusing on revealing more about it this Summer ahead of it's launch later this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/alters-review-narrative-driven-survival<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ac4be3c6-fcbb-4f7e-b561-de64225371b0" href="https://techraptor.net/games/alters" rel="nofollow"><em>The Alters</em></a>&nbsp;is a story driven, survival game where the main character, Jan Dolski, is stranded on an unhospitable planet alone during Project Dolly. Looking for a way to survive, he ends up using the ship's quantum computer to produce alternate versions of himself. These Alters are clones, yet not quite. They made a different decision that led them down a completely new life path from Jan, gaining the skills he needs in the harsh environment.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><em>The Alters</em>&nbsp;Review | Surviving in Space</h2>

<p>Taking a look at the survival aspect of&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em>, you have to mine resources from the planet either by hand or using a mining station. These mining stations, the main resource collectors, are connected by pylons to your moving base and unlock fast travel points around the map. The other resources are grown, crafted, or refined in the base itself. Once you have Alters, you'll assign them to specific rooms, referred to as modules, and give them tasks to complete. When finished, they'll ask to jump to another location that has something queued.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-alters-mobile-base-management.jpg?itok=G1vhTwae 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-alters-mobile-base-management.jpg?itok=p1NMyTCn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>The Alters</em> is much closer to a colony or resource management game than a full-blown survival title. You can mine resources, refine ores, and grow food, but that's about it. There are items to craft, but most of them just improve your ability to explore the different areas the base stops at, as well as the efficiency of your resources. You can automate most of these processes and be completely hands-off on resource gathering by the endgame and even the midgame, depending on how you unlock research.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These are fairly basic mechanics when it comes to surviving. There are three different mining stations, only five resources to mine, and one resource to grow. You'll get reminders when levels of certain things, like storage or food, are low, but you can typically restock your reserves quickly. Throughout my initial playthrough, I never felt like I was in danger of losing due to a lack of resources. The typical pressure of a survival game just wasn't present for me as I played.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-alters-mining-organics-outpost.jpg?itok=2-mWZWLt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-alters-mining-organics-outpost.jpg?itok=G_W7FGK6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>On top of the basic mechanics, you only have a certain number of days in each location. Changing locations isn't voluntary, but forced. If you stay until Sunrise, everyone is charred to a crisp, and the game ends.&nbsp;The moving base can be continuously changed, expanded multiple times, and have new modules added, but you cannot make any exterior location your permanent home.</p>

<p>Additionally, there is a definitive end to the title.&nbsp;This is quite different than the majority of games in the survival genre. While the story will have an ending, you're able to keep exploring, building your base, and crafting new items. That isn't the case in&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em>. When the story ends, so does the game.</p>

<p>You can go back an infinite number of times to replay days, change your dialogue choices, or use different Alters, but the game will always end. Being able to redo days increases the replayability. It's also necessary to do at least a second playthrough to select different Alters to create or pick a different major decision. This will reveal new endings, new lessons, and new cutscenes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even with the replayability aspect, there's only a certain number of times you can adventure with Jan and his Alters before exhausting all new content. A definitive end, combined with limited time in each region, cuts down on the investment I have in the game. If there were more areas where you could farm without having to move locations, that would vastly increase my interest in&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em>&nbsp;as a survival title. At this moment, I view it as a well-written complex narrative adventure that merely uses the basics of survival to move the story along when there's no dialogue to delve into.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Morality and Ethics in&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em></h2>

<p>Where&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em>&nbsp;really shines is in the way it presents morality in life-threatening survival situations. The narrative journey you experience is well written, emotionally evocative, and showcases the consequences of difficult choices, especially when both options are less than ideal. I wasn't ready for all the thinking I ended up doing. It compelled me to think over the different aspects of surviving, how those decisions could effect the crew, and what I was willing to do as the leader to ensure survival for as many people as possible.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-alters-technician-birth-womb.jpg?itok=UHZKjSHd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-alters-technician-birth-womb.jpg?itok=7EOBysxA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The story is incredibly profound, but it's not laid on you all at once. It's crafted in a way that you build up to the moral dilemmas. The story has joy and fun woven with the larger complexities, so it doesn't end up bogged down by the choices you face. The complexity of the situation and the drama that accompany it are balanced with breaks to play beer pong or watch movies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Morality is an angle not often explored in the survival genre. In games that I've played, you kill anyone who stands in your way, take resources no matter what, and do whatever it takes to stay alive. Having a character take the time to cognizantly mull over the potential consequences of his actions is a really unique take on the genre.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This struggle over the morality of key decisions to ensure survival is what sets&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em>&nbsp;apart from other titles. The narrative is the best part of the game, hands down. It is what you'll recall when thinking about the title and what will draw you back to playing.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-alters-morals-values-decision-making.jpg?itok=f_0oKet6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-alters-morals-values-decision-making.jpg?itok=i603dlhW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>The Bad and the Bugs in&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em></h2>

<p>While most of the game works extremely well, there are some aspects that detract from the experience. Being unable to skip certain cutscenes or dialogues is one of the design choices I don't personally agree with. Even though the scene in question is a key one, it doesn't dramatically change when going through a second playthrough or replaying the day. Having to sit through it can be frustrating, especially if you're rewatching it multiple times back to back.</p>

<p>Acts 1 and 2 were relatively bug-free, with the major issue involving Jan getting stuck on terrain elements. The frequency of this increased in Act 3, along with issues seeing Interal Veins. The veins were missing or the core was missing in multiple instances of the mechanic. This also affected the Interal animations added to other locations outside of the veins. I ended up wandering around and almost blacking out from Radiation due to not being able to find the core.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-alters-glitched-alx.jpg?itok=jdFlGPnb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-alters-glitched-alx.jpg?itok=a9wYQVto 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Another issue was ALX getting stuck in places, such as the sky, that made collecting them impossible. Sometimes they rolled into the environment, or became stuck between items that made them inaccessible.&nbsp;Though these were relatively small in number of occurrences, they still negatively impacted gameplay.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><em>The Alters&nbsp;</em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>The Alters</em>&nbsp;is a solid narrative entry wrapped in basic survival mechanics. The focus of the game, and the highlighting feature, is the storyline. It has some replayability, but comes with a definitive ending and some restrictive base building that brings it closer to a colony management title than a true survival game. A single playthrough can take anywhere between 12-30 hours, depending on how often you redo days. If you're like me and played until the end without going back in time, you can finish the game in a single weekend.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With few bugs to get in the way of your experience,&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em>&nbsp;is a well executed meshing of survival and story. Though the forced base movement and definitive ending make it less of a survival game, the narrative makes up for those shortcomings.&nbsp;</p>

<hr><p><strong><em>The Alters</em></strong>&nbsp;was reviewed on PC via <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="taxonomy_term" data-entity-uuid="827230dc-a00f-4d18-aa49-a4193dce9421" href="https://techraptor.net/topic/steam" rel="nofollow">Steam</a> over the course of 35 hours with a key provided by the publisher.

<p>Suspension of the strike comes just a few days after SAG-AFTRA <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-and-video-game-employers-reach-tentative-agreement-interactive-media-contract-national" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">revealed</a> said "tentative agreement". In a new <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-video-game-strike-suspended-noon-pt-today" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, SAG-AFTRA says its members should "return to work on productions under the IMA, including work promoting or publicizing projects produced under the IMA".</p>

<p>It's worth noting that the "tentative agreement" reached today hasn't been finalized yet. The union says it intends to "meet in special session" later today in order to consider the agreement, so it hasn't yet been approved.</p>

<p>Companies included in the agreement include Activision, Insomniac Games, and EA, and SAG-AFTRA's original statement on the commencement of the strike claims that these employers refused to "plainly affirm, in clear and enforceable language" that actors would be protected from AI-related abuse of their work or image.</p>

<p>We don't yet know what the new "tentative agreement" contains, but I think it's safe to assume the companies have given at least some ground when it comes to AI, since this was referred to as the "sticking point" by SAG-AFTRA last July.</p>

<p>The union will release details of the agreement on its approval, and at that time, the agreement will also be "sent out for ratification by the union's membership in accordance with established policy".</p>

<p>Companies like&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>publisher <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-generative-ai-characters-pubg-inzoi" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Krafton</a>, as well as industry giants&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-partners-with-generative-ai-company-to-enable-dynamically-generated-stories-quests" rel="nofollow">Microsoft</a>&nbsp;and the aforementioned <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-hopes-to-use-generative-ai-to-drive-more-monetization-and-make-development-30-more" rel="nofollow">EA</a>, have expressed enthusiasm about generative AI, despite lingering issues regarding <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/11/disney-universal-ai-lawsuit" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">copyright infringement</a> and <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/explained-generative-ai-environmental-impact-0117" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">environmental impact</a>.</p>

<p>In particular, though, SAG-AFTRA's concerns appear to revolve around the use of actors' likenesses, whether that be appearance or voice, to "hire" them without actually paying them, as well as other potential AI abuses of their work.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see whether the new agreement contains satisfactory protections for union members. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

			<p>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt may get a new story DLC early next year from the studio that's working on the remake of the first entry in the series.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1l9gnje/new_witcher_3_dlc_may_be_coming_in_2026_before/">PC Gaming subreddit,</a>&nbsp;well-known Polish game industry commentator Borys Nieśpielak revealed during a recent podcast hosted by Remigiusz Maciaszek that the third entry in the series by CD Projekt Red may get an additional story DLC that is being developed by Fool's Theory, the studio that is working on the remake of the first entry in the series, early next year. According to the commentator, this could be the unspecified project from the studio that was mentioned during one of CDPR's earnings calls. Unfortunately, no other information is currently available on this potential story DLC, so it could be a single additional questline, similar to that released for free to celebrate the launch of the horrendous, in my humble opinion, Netflix show, or a longer, paid expansion.</p>

<p>Even if The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt won't get any more content from CDPR, some amazing modding projects in the works will allow players to return to the Continent to experience more stories, or to play through some of the most important events in the life of Geralt of Rivia, before the launch of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-new-trailer-ps5-60-fps-ray-tracing/">The Witcher IV</a>. Among these projects is The Last Wish project, which aims to recreate the book written by Andrzej Sapkowski that includes some fantastic stories, such as the titular The Last Wish. The project's alpha is now available for <a href="https://www.thelastwishproject.com/">download</a>, allowing players to experience the first video game adaptation of The Lesser Evil story and learn why Geralt is called The Butcher of Blaviken. You can check out the alpha before downloading in the video put together by xLetalis.</p>

<p>The Witcher 3 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

            <p>Mob Entertainment has announced that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/poppy-playtime">Poppy Playtime</a> Chapter 4 will be making its unsettling way onto consoles later this month.</p>
<p>The latest chapter in the series is set for release on Nintendo Switch, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10012036">PlayStation</a> and Xbox on 25th June. It will retail for $19.99, the PR has said. I have asked for clarification on its UK pricing, though the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/games/store/poppy-playtime-chapter-4/9n31k5cww4k8">Microsoft Store here in Blighty</a> has it listed for £16.74, so assume this will be the same on other platforms.</p>
<p>"Brace yourself for the darkest chapter yet in the epic Poppy Playtime saga," reads the official blurb, adding that players will be "pushed deeper into the undiscovered depths of the Playtime Co. factory, far below anything the world knew". You can check out a trailer for Poppy Playtime Chapter 4 below.</p>

<p>The latest chapter in the Poppy Playtime series promises players "terrifying" new threats, along with "shocking" revelations.</p>
<p>"Can you outwit the unnatural new creations lurking in the shadows? Can you survive here long enough to eventually unravel the mysteries behind the experiments? Every step will test your courage, every puzzle will challenge your mind, and every corner may be your last," the studio teases.</p>

<p>"When we first started this journey, we followed our passion and created a series of games and brands with the purpose of inspiring and entertaining.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a> has received an update that offers visual improvements when played on the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a>, a nice bonus for fans who want to pick up and play the RPG on the new console.</p>
<p>These improvements include graphic enhancements such as new shadow and reflection efforts, as well as an extension to the distance objects are rendered at. For example, you can now see a forest off into the distance clearly, whereas before it may have looked like a low-poly blur of green shrubbery.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/patchnote/ver_1_3_0/">In the official update blog post uploaded to the games' official website</a>, we see that exact example in a side-by-side comparison, as well as a pair of screenshots showing water effects on the Switch vs the Switch 2. Water now has lovely reflections of light on it. A little thing for some, but a little boost for those willing to make the leap to a new console, cosy RPG in hand.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a> has been updated to version 10.0.0, bringing with it a whole bunch of new content, but also improving the game's visuals and performance for those playing on Switch 2.</p>
<p>But how has it been improved, exactly? Well, the above video should clear things up quite nicely for you. We're mainly looking at bumps in resolution and frame rate, and this is perhaps most obvious within the Splatsville hub area, which notably at a stable, albeit sluggish 30fps on the Switch.</p>
<p>This has been increased significantly on the Switch 2, and the smooth gameplay looks like a real treat on Nintendo's new console.</p><p><figure data-videoid="Z3qjATCE2dk" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z3qjATCE2dk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3qjATCE2dk"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>821k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3qjATCE2dk">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>We also see gameplay from the standard Turf War battle along with the Salmon Run mode, so there's plenty to dive into here to see exactly how the game has been improved from Switch 1.</p>
<p>In other news, it's also been confirmed that a Splatoon spin-off game, titled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/splatoon-raiders">Splatoon Raiders</a>, will be making its way to the Switch 2. Very little is known about the project so far, but it looks to be a single-player story-focused experience in which you take on the role of a mechanic investigating a mysterious island alongside Deep Cut.</p>

"Do you remember the taste of strawberries?" Sam whispers. I do not want you to remember the taste of strawberries. I want you to remember how good it felt to sneak a ball behind the blocks in Breakout. It is the only thing that will save you now.

Ball X Pit isn't just a roguelite hybrid, but a Vampire Survive 'em up to boot. The setup is that a meteor has wiped out the city of Ballbylon (*smiles wanly at camera*) and left a massive hole full of monsters and treasure. You are a treasure-hunter, and the way you gather treasure is to proceed down a slowly scrolling shaft against a wall of block-shaped undead, shooting cannonballs that ricochet from foe and terrain alike.</p>
<p>After breaking enough monsterblocs, you get to choose from power-ups that include weirder, more powerful kinds of ball and a few shmuppy supporting acts, such as little gun-toting NPC statues. There are bosses too, some of which take things in almost a bullet hell direction, with arrows all but filling the screen.
</p>
<p>
I played the now-available Steam demo at a Devolver joint in London the week before last, in a desperate bid to claw back some precious naptime from my SGF schedule. I was dismayed by the rogueliting at first - in case I haven't sufficiently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-train-2-review">spelled it out by now</a>, I am really ready for this trend to be over. It's not that Ball X Pit in itself is badly made, it's that everytime I read the word "roguelite" in a press release, I can feel the very substance of my soul dribbling through my fingers. I'm naked in the dark, with nothing, no veil between me and the gameloop of fire.
</p>
<p>
But then I successfully snuck a ball behind the tide of four-cornered fiends, and was Samwisely suffused by recollections of shareware Breakout clones on Apple Macintosh in the 90s. Watching the ball bounce repeatedly between the blocks and backwall, racking up a high score without you having to lift a finger, is the nearest many of us will ever get to nirvana. It may not be enough for me to play/recommend the full thing, but it's enough for me to suggest that you <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3651790/BALL_x_PIT_Demo/">try the Ball X Pit demo yourself on Steam</a>.

<figure><a title="Hershey Pokémon 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/89426dbe74728/hershey-pokemon-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Hershey Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>Hershey, the American confectionary company, has teamed up with The Pokémon Company to launch <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/hersheys-and-pokemon-team-up-for-collectible-chocolate-bars-and-kisses">a new range of Hershey's Kisses</a>.</p>
<p>Based on the original 151 Pokémon from the days of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/pokemon_red_and_blue">Red and Blue</a>, the Kisses will be wrapped in special collectable foil that kind of, sort of look like Pokéballs. Underneath, you'll find an image of one Pokémon from the original line-up per chocolate.</p>
<p>Ashley Reeb, Senior Associate Brand Manager at The Hershey Company, said the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Our collaboration with Pokémon combines the timeless appeal of <em>Hershey's Kisses</em> chocolates with the joy of discovery and collecting — making it more than just a treat. The special-edition foils may spark a little friendly competition but also unite fans around their love for milk chocolate and Pokémon."</p></blockquote><blockquote>

<p>So what's the deal here, exactly? Is Hershey essentially encouraging folks to keep the chocolates as they are, fully wrapped and never to be eaten? Or can you carefully unwrap them and keep the foil intact? Hmm... Quite bizarre, if you ask us.</p>
<p>Well, it sounds like some might like to keep the chocolates completely unopened, as Hershey is also launching a special, limited edition case in which to house your collection. These are to be sold on a first come, first served basis, and it sounds like you'll need both a 'Hersheyland' account and Pokémon account to nab one (because we need accounts for everything these days, right?).</p>

<p>If the Kisses don't appeal, Hershey is also launching Pokémon-themed chocolate bars, with 12 designs available for the full-size bar, and 18 available for the snak-size bar.</p>
<p>Over on the new Switch 2, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</a> received a free update to bring the games' performance up to a more acceptable standard. One could argue that it still looks a bit rubbish, but they at least run much better now.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Sony have confirmed the cancellation of a live service project amid mass layoffs at Sony Bend, the team behind open world zombie biker <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, Bloomberg <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lrbil2zvis2q">reported</a> that Sony Bend were doing away with about 40 people, following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playstation-put-the-axe-in-a-live-service-god-of-war-game-alongside-a-project-from-the-days-gone-studio">the nuking of an unannounced live service game</a> earlier in the year. Amongst the people affected is former senior animator Robert Morrison, who <a href="https://x.com/RobertAnim8er/status/1932522033335906343">announced</a> his departure on Xitter. </p>
<p>The studio's social media account acknowledged the layoffs, without sharing exact numbers, adding that Sony Bend "remain committed to building the future of Bend Studio with creativity, passion, and innovation in the titles we craft."</p>
<p>Now, Sony have confirmed the departures in an email to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/days-gone-studio-sony-bend-announces-layoffs-following-live-service-cancellation">Eurogamer</a>. "Earlier this year, Bend Studio wrapped development on a live service concept," it reads. "After careful consideration, we chose not to move forward with it. As the team shifts focus to its next project, we've made strategic changes to better position the studio for long-term success." </p>
<p>"As part of this transition, a workforce reduction has taken place at the studio," the statement goes on. Again, no hard numbers. According to Bloomberg, Sony Bend now have a new game in the works.</p>
<p>All this continues Sony's on-going <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/despair-at-prospect-of-new-playstation-live-service-game-lifted-by-mysterious-mention-of-frogs">partial</a> retreat from blockbuster live service productions, which has seen them cancel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/naughty-dog-cancel-the-last-of-us-online-while-teasing-new-single-player-projects">The Last Of Us Online</a>, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alleged-leaked-spider-man-the-great-web-trailer-shows-off-insomniacs-cancelled-co-op-spin-off">co-op Spider-Man</a> and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playstation-put-the-axe-in-a-live-service-god-of-war-game-alongside-a-project-from-the-days-gone-studio">new God Of War game</a> despite 2022-era plans to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">launch more than 10 of the things by March 2026</a>. As Brendy wrote in January, when news of the Bend project's abandonment first surfaced, Sony appear terrified by the failure of last year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a>, which they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hero-shooter-concord-taken-offline-as-sony-say-its-initial-launch-didnt-land-the-way-wed-intended">shut down mere weeks into its shelf life</a> after it failed to accrue figures of sufficient bigness at launch.

</p><p>To quote Arrowhead Games Studio CEO Shams Jorjani from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-ceo-slams-the-games-industry-layoff-wave-saying-that-bosses-are-making-regular-devs-pay-for-their-screw-ups">an interview in April</a>: "Who among these executives is stepping down? Or slashing their salaries?" Best of luck to all affected.</p>

            <p>The PlayStation published <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> made its way onto PC last night, and has got off to a very good start indeed.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/?compare=1151640,1659420,1817070,1817190,1888930,2322010,2531310,2561580,2651280,3489700">SteamDB</a>, Stellar Blade has already welcomed a peak player count of 99,980, less than 24 hours since its release on PC. This means it currently has the highest peak concurrent player count for a PlayStation published single player game on the platform.</p>
<p>To compare, Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered has a peak player count of 66,436, while <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> Complete Edition has a peak of 56,557. Meanwhile, The Last of Us Part 1 has a peak of 36,496 and its sequel - The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered - has a peak of 30,690.</p>

<p>As for what players are saying, right now Stellar Blade is sitting quite happily with an "overwhelmingly positive" Steam review average. "In a world full of unoptimised slop it really is great to see a game run so smoothly," reads one such review.</p>
<p>So, yes, things are going well for Stellar Blade's PC release. Back in February of this year, Shift Up stated in a financial report it expects <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blades-pc-sales-expected-to-exceed-console-says-shift-up">the PC version to exceed console sales</a>.</p>
<p>"In the AAA game market, PC devices have a higher market share than consoles, so we expect the performance of the PC version to exceed that of the console version," the company said at the time. "We are particularly observing trends such as the significant expansion of the single-player action game market in the Asian gaming industry."</p>

In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-review">Eurogamer's original Stellar Blade review</a> we noted it "has a fair bit of weirdness", but " its killer tunes and vibey, flow-state combat - plus a transformative hard mode - are enough to leave you entranced".

            <link>https://wccftech.com/asus-explains-why-the-rog-xbox-ally-doesnt-have-an-oled-screen/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/asus-explains-why-the-rog-xbox-ally-doesn%E2%80%99t-have-an-oled-screen.1216272/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/asus-explains-why-the-rog-xbox-ally-doesnt-have-an-oled-screen/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During the Xbox Games Showcase 2025, Microsoft and ASUS finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-powered-by-amd-ryzen-revealed-for-a-holiday-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> their joint Xbox handheld projects: the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X. However, neither of the handhelds is equipped with an OLED screen, much to the chagrin of those who'd love the infinite contrast provided by the cutting-edge displays.</p>
<p>Why, though? Well, ASUS Senior Manager of Marketing Content for Gaming Whitson Gordon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6j1TYbHggfk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> that clearly in a recent stream: essentially, it has to do with drawing more power when coupled with variable refresh rate, a tradeoff the company wasn't willing to make.</p>
<p><em>We've gone hard on OLED with our desktop monitors. It is no secret that we love OLED at ROG, right? But on the Ally, the calculus is different. We talked about this in more detail last year in our Q&amp;A and so I won't go quite as deep today, but we're in a similar boat. We did look at OLED again this year. We did some R&amp;D and prototyping with OLED, but it's still not where we want it to be when you factor VRR into the mix and we aren't willing to give up VRR. I'll draw that line in the sand right now. I am of the opinion that if a display doesn't have variable refresh rate, it's not a gaming display in the year 2025 as far as I'm concerned, right? That's a must-have feature, and OLED with VRR right now draws significantly more power than the LCD that we're currently using on the Ally and it costs more.</em></p>
<p><em>When we look at what people are buying in the handheld market right now, both in terms of the sales of our devices and what we see from competitors, it's pretty clear what price bands people are willing to buy a device like this in, because remember, it's a secondary device for a lot of people. It's not their primary device. I see a lot of people in feedback saying that they want this exact thing. They say, "I don't want to pay an arm and a leg for this." Well, yeah, we don't want that</em><br>
<em>either. That's why we're trying to avoid having it cost an arm and a leg by not putting things in that the vast majority of users don't need. We're trying to hit a reasonable price point on these.</em></p>
<p><em>That's all I'll say about price. You have to align your expectations with the market and what we're doing here. Adding 32GB, OLED, Z2 Extreme, and all of those extra bells and whistles would cost a lot more than the price bracket you guys are used to on the Ally, and the vast majority of users are not willing to pay that kind of price.</em></p>
<p>When it comes to specifications, the display is identical between the ROG Xbox Ally and the ROG Xbox Ally X: a 7-inch FullHD IPS screen with a 120Hz refresh rate and AMD FreeSync Premium. However, the ROG Xbox Ally X has more storage (1TB versus 512GB), more RAM (24 vs 16GB), a more powerful processor (the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-z2-extreme-apu-next-gen-handhelds-16-rdna-3-5-gpu-8-zen-5-cpu-cores/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ryzen Z2 Extreme</a> vs the Ryzen Z2), and the impulse triggers for controls. The pricing of each model hasn't been revealed yet, but we do know that ASUS is planning to launch both handhelds this holiday, so more details are forthcoming.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/epic-games-sues-fortnite-cheat-maker/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/epic-games-sues-fortnite-cheat-maker/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A couple of days ago, Epic Games <a href="https://www.pacermonitor.com/public/case/58476593/Epic_Games,_Inc_v_Atas_aka_Sincey_Cheats_and_Vanta_Cheats_et_al" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed</a> a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the eastern district of North Carolina against Ediz Atas, also known as Sincey Cheats and Vanta Cheats, a maker of Fortnite cheats.</p>
<p>Epic Games alleges that Ediz Atas, also known as Sincey and Vanta Cheats, has made money from developing and selling cheat software for Fortnite since at least January 2023. According to the firm, the software gives players an unfair advantage over those who don't cheat and is therefore in violation of its EULA due to its circumvention of Fortnite's anti-cheat software. Epic also claims widespread cheating could put legitimate players off, potentially translating into a loss of sales of season passes and cosmetics. In its lawsuit, Epic said it was forced to ban tens of thousands of Fortnite accounts using Sincey Cheats software, including over 15K bans against accounts in the United States alone.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the lawsuit claims that, after Epic Games submitted DMCA takedown notices to YouTube to remove videos featuring the offending cheating software, Sincey Cheats sent multiple emails to YouTube's designated copyright agent, impersonating an Epic employee and falsely claiming that Epic wanted to “formally reverse its claim of copyright infringement” by spoofing Epic Games email addresses. You can see an example <a href="https://x.com/SinceyCheats/status/1872973112892928458" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>The lawsuit also targets five unnamed defendants who have been reselling Sincey Cheats's software through various channels. Predictably, Epic Games is seeking compensatory and statutory damages, as well as covering attorney costs and other lawsuit-related costs.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time a game developer has sued a cheat maker. Bungie did it a few times recently against Destiny 2 cheat makers and even won against both <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-cheat-seller-lavicheats-is-hit-by-6-7m-lawsuit-from-bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LaviCheats</a> (getting a multi-million dollar compensation) and <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-wins-lawsuit-against-destiny-2-cheat-makers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AimJunkies</a>. Whether that will be enough to discourage cheat makers remains to be seen.</p>

		<p>The launch of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> has brought a smattering of new exclusives, but it’s also relied on a raft of ported hits to fill out its roster. Chief amongst them, and sitting just behind <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> as the game of choice for new Switch 2 owners, is Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition. This release brings the immense futuristic open-world, and its stark hyper-violence and decidedly adult content to Nintendo’s brand new handheld, and in a lot of ways, this is the technical showcase for the console and its impressive abilities.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cyberpunk 2077 on Switch 2 is a handheld marvel" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GS_gxBWLuak?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is an interesting title to show off your new console, not least because of the way the original game launched back in 2020. The original console versions of the game, particularly the PlayStation 4 edition, performed so poorly that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/12/18/cyberpunk-2077-psn-refund-form-remove-psn-cdpr-ps4-ps5/">Sony pulled the game from the PlayStation Store</a>, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/06/21/cyberpunk-2077-is-back-on-the-playstation-store-base-ps4-performance-issues/">CD Projekt Red spent the next two years rebuilding their brand</a>, while having to work to regain gamers’ trust.</p>


<p>That trust seemed to be wholly won back by the time <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/02/14/cyberpunk-2077-ps5-xbox-upgrade-release/">the upgraded PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S version arrived</a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/09/06/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-dlc-not-on-ps4-xbox-one/">Phantom Liberty expansion</a>, which only launched for the more powerful hardware. The fact that the Nintendo Switch version is launching with the entire base game and its DLC is a statement of intent, for both Nintendo and CDPR. The new handheld can be considered a true current gen console, and this is the game to prove it.</p>
<p>We’ve spent the past week revisiting Night City, and exploring just how impressive this port is. Where the original Switch managed a number of ‘impossible’ ports, including CDPR’s own <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/10/14/the-witcher-3-switch-review-switcher-performance-analysis/">The Witcher 3</a>, these were heavily compromised visually in order to run on the hardware. Straight away, the Switch 2 version of Cyberpunk 2077 impresses with just how good it looks and performs on the console, both in docked and handheld mode.</p>


<p>Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition boasts a choice of graphical modes, with Quality targeting 1080p and 30fps, while Performance mode increases the frame rate target to 40fps at the cost of graphics fidelity and resolution – this works natively on the Switch 2’s screen, but requires a 120Hz display when docked. You can set your choices separately for handheld and docked mode, which is a nice touch, as well as alter the graphical effects like Film Grain and Chromatic Aberration.</p>
<p>We’re sticking to the Quality mode for our comparison and capturing the game docked, putting the Switch 2 up against the most recent version on PS4 – which is missing numerous gameplay overhauls at this point – and the Xbox Series S (note: we seem to have captured XSS with HDR turned on, tonemapped via to elgato with some unusual colours from this).</p>

<p>Going back to PS4 and… well, there’s a reason that the game was so maligned at launch in 2020, and while CDPR did improve things, it’s still pretty bad with performance that can’t ever really hang on to 30fps and looks pretty shonky in the process. The Nintendo Switch 2 easily outstrips the base PS4 in every way, there’s just no two ways about it.</p>
<p>Xbox Series S, meanwhile, provides a much more intriguing point of comparison. Microsoft’s budget console is able to top out at 1440p30 with its dynamic resolution, and even offers a 60fps mode, albeit at a 1080p target and with a significant number of graphical compromises to get there.</p>
<p>Nintendo Switch 2 strikes a good middle ground when docked with its 1080p30 target. This game looks genuinely good on the new generation hybrid and performs very, very well in holding to that 30fps target.</p>
<p>The secret sauce, though, is DLSS. The Switch 2 version of Cyberpunk 2077 is able to use Nvidia’s machine learning model to provide temporal anti-aliasing, instead of the version that CDPR shipped for PS4 and Xbox Series S. This isn’t Nvidia’s latest DLSS model, and it’s dealing with low internal resolutions, but the results are still impressive. There is some minor shimmer to background details, but DLSS completely stamps out the ugly ghosting that could trail behind motion in the game on PS4 and Series S, the latter of which currently uses FSR 2.1 on consoles.</p>

<p>Handheld mode is similarly excellent – it’s genuinely remarkable to have this game in your hands like this. I thought Quality Mode was a great way to play, offering a near-seamless experience in both docked and handheld modes, with very few noticeable dips in performance below 30fps.</p>
<p>Handheld Performance Mode is the one place where you really start to feel the limitations of the Switch 2, as the chipset steps down to a lower power mode. This can only target 720p while the 40fps comes with the help of VRR, and through this it feels much more like a classic Switch port, where the compromises are very clear to see. The world and its visual design is still deeply impressive,</p>

<p>Yes, you’ve been able to play this title on Steam Deck and other PC handhelds, but this is a version that just works out of the box. Choose your graphical setting and off you go. Being able to dip into the story, complete a few missions, or even just work your way through some of the different dialogue and interactions, is brilliant, and there’s zero sense that you’re getting a cut-rate experience when you’re playing handheld.</p>
<p>While Cyberpunk looks fantastic here, the Nintendo Switch 2’s other features have also been used, most importantly the all-new mouse mode, which brings the experience closer to PC than any console has before. Besides that, there’s a Joy-Con aiming option, reminding me of the incredible Resident Evil 4 port on the Wii, and you can also use the gyro motion controls to fine tune your aiming. This is really helpful, because I genuinely suck at shooting in Cyberpunk 2077.</p>

<p>All of this combined makes Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition an incredible package for Nintendo Switch 2, letting console players experience the game in a way they never have before, and highlighting just how special Nintendo’s new platform is.</p>
