            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/blade-runner-replicant-rebellion-coming-to-kickstarter<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Free League Publishing has announced a new expansion is coming to their official <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/blade-runner-roleplaying-game-preview"><em>Blade Runner</em> TTRPG</a>. This licensed game, based on Ridley Scott's critically acclaimed sci-fi film, will explore a different perspective of its universe with<em> Blade Runner Replicant Rebellion</em>.</p>

<h2>The <em>Blade Runner Replicant Rebellion</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, <em>Blade Runner Replicant Rebellion</em> is a supplement that massively expands the scope of the <em>Blade Runner</em> RPG. Overall, this new book remains focused on the main setting of Los Angeles in the year 2037, but with one major twist.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blade-runner-replicant-rebellion-graffiti-artwork.jpg?itok=X3a-XHl1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blade-runner-replicant-rebellion-graffiti-artwork.jpg?itok=Bk-U9gF3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you know where to look, you'll find shelter.</figcaption></figure><p>The twist is that players aren't Blade Runners, but Replicants. You can join the Replicant Underground, get into intense cat-and-mouse chases with Blade Runners, and oppose the establishment.</p>

<p>In <em>Blade Runner Replicant Rebellion</em>, players will run their own independent crew. That crew can undertake various operations while maintaining their covers and keeping their records clean. Those operations can include helping fugitive Replicants escape, sabotaging Replicant trade, weeding out moles, or just fighting with warring crews and syndicates.</p>

<p>Naturally, this set-up flips the script on the Blade Runner experience. You aren't investigators shutting down rogue synthetics; you are the prey striking against unjust institutions. It's an expansion that asks players how much they will lose for a righteous cause, a question most <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/cyberpunk-2077-uncanny-tone">cyberpunk sci-fi explores</a> in one form or another.</p>

<p><em>Blade Runner Replicant Rebellion</em> will contain the following resources:</p>

<ul><li>An overview of the history and organization of the Replicant Underground, charting its presence throughout the entire <em>Blade Runner</em> setting</li>
	<li>Guidelines on how to play a Replicant Underground campaign. This includes several new player character archetypes and various new rules like maintaining a cover and sweating Heat as the law closes in.</li>
	<li>Several complete prewritten Operations set within the Replicant Underground</li>
</ul><p><em>Blade Runner Replicant Rebellion</em> will be <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1192053011/blade-runner-rpg-replicant-rebellion-and-asset-pack" rel="noopener" target="_blank">coming to Kickstarter May 28</a>. The campaign will include an Asset Pack. GMs can use this pack to create their own Case Files and Operations.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/internet-goofballs-are-having-a-field-day-with-king-charles%E2%80%99-portrait.873357/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24158329/king-charles-portrait-meme-jokes-red<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="UnUJGN">The purpose of art is to inspire and incite discourse, and the recently unveiled portrait of King Charles has certainly done that. The current monarch of the United Kingdom was coronated last year, and it’s a common tradition for painters to sit down with heads of state to create a personalized portrait of them. On May 14, King Charles’ portrait by artist Jonathan Yeo was revealed to the public, and while some art critics wanted to debate the heavy use of red in the portrait and the symbology therein, other people decided to just make some banger memes out of the painting. </p>
<p id="vIKP9e">There’s the very obvious comparison to Soulsborne games. FromSoftware designers seem to love nothing more than decorating a crumbling castle with massive, ominous portraits. (Actually, some members of FromSoftware might love <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/elden-ring-has-multiple-poison-swamps-because-i-cant-help-myself-miyazaki-says/">poison swamps</a> <em>slightly </em>more than ominous paintings, but it’s debatable.)</p>

<div id="C9YONs">
<blockquote>
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">this the type of shit you see hanging on top of a guy's throne in Elden Ring and then the dude's called 'Morgorem, Bloodrot Baron' and he lives in the 'Sanguine Temple of Decay' <a href="https://t.co/jUn0Fs77wk">https://t.co/jUn0Fs77wk</a></p>— RED  (@DemonfireTanto) <a href="https://twitter.com/DemonfireTanto/status/1790499913379324250?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 14, 2024</a>
</blockquote>


</div>
<p id="Kwpmc1">Of course, a painting this ominous can fit into a whole smorgasbord of settings. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/dishonored/mods/99/?tab=videos">Consider this mod for Dishonored,</a> which allows you to steal King Charles’ portrait in-between murdering Corvo’s many enemies. The image would also fit nicely in the original <em>Doom, </em><a href="https://twitter.com/senn_twt/status/1790518505634480157">as this mock-up proves</a>. </p>

<p id="ZjwrSU">Personally, I’m a fan of this <em>Disco Elysium</em> interpretation of the portrait created by Stivkun on X.</p>

<p id="LRh4My">The portrait is also easily substituted into movies. <em>Ghostbusters </em>2<em>’s </em><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kronethjort.bsky.social/post/3kshsscrspo2t">painting of Vigo the Carpathian</a> is an easy example here. Or the painting could fit neatly into the environment of <em>The Shining</em>, which is a notoriously unsettling hotel. Some artists are even taking the portrait’s style — which I personally find striking and evocative — and applying it to other fictional characters. </p>

<p id="7FZr0Y">The painting has inspired a lot of genuine critical discourse about its style, the message, and the monarchy itself. But I’m an easily amused magpie, and I love seeing how moments like this are re-interpreted through a goofy lens. These memes are brief, and fleeting, but for a moment they are beautiful. </p>

One is an original character named Naoe, a ninja who bears the Hidden Blade weapon synonymous with the <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>series. The other is Yasuke, a Samurai who is based on the historical figure of the same name. <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>tends to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/henry-kissinger-assassins-creed-templar-brotherhood-1851061127&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/henry-kissinger-assassins-creed-templar-brotherhood-1851061127">play with historical events</a></span> and fit its own version of them into the series’ overarching lore, so Yasuke’s story will likely play out differently when <em>Shadows </em>launches on November 15. But you may be wondering who this guy is, and just how <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>might fit him into its alternate history. Let’s run through what we know.<br></p><div data-video-id="196884" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Rise Of The Ronin Hides A Cool Nioh Easter Egg" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="163" data-playlist="196884,196923,196922" data-current="196884"><div><p>Rise Of The Ronin Hides A Cool Nioh Easter Egg</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196884/196884_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196884/196884_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196884/196884_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196884/196884_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22438.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>Yasuke lived in Japan during the 16th century and is believed to be the first African to appear in Japan’s historical records. His story has been adapted into books, manga, and even <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://gizmodo.com/yasukes-intense-first-trailer-is-here-and-its-gory-and-1846602108&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gizmodo.com/yasukes-intense-first-trailer-is-here-and-its-gory-and-1846602108">an alternate-history Netflix anime</a></span> starring <em>Sorry To Bother You</em> and <em>Knives Out</em> actor LaKeith Stanfield. Fictionalized versions of Yasuke have also appeared in video games like <em>Nioh</em> and the <em>Samurai Warriors</em> franchise.</p><p>While some of the specifics of Yasuke’s life are disputed by historians, the commonly understood story is that he arrived in Japan as a bodyguard for Italian Jesuit Alessandro Valignano in 1579, before going on to serve the Japanese feudal lord Oda Nobunaga. The nature of his service is a matter of debate for those who have studied Yasuke, with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://historyofyesterday.com/how-an-african-slave-became-a-samurai/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://historyofyesterday.com/how-an-african-slave-became-a-samurai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some claiming</a></span> he was a slave. Thomas Lockley, co-author of <em>African Samurai: The True Story of Yasuke, a Legendary Black Warrior in Feudal Japan</em>, told <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://time.com/6039381/yasuke-black-samurai-true-story/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://time.com/6039381/yasuke-black-samurai-true-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Time</em></a></span> that he speculates Yasuke was a “free actor” who was likely enslaved as a child and taken from Africa, but that he had possibly been freed by the time he met Valignano and was a working mercenary.</p><p>Ubisoft’s marketing describes Yasuke as a samurai, but it’s unclear just how holistic that label is in <em>Shadows</em>’ take on historical fiction. While the version of Yasuke seen in <em>Shadows </em>clearly wears the armor and uses the Japanese swords commonly associated with samurai, the samurai moniker encompasses <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2127.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2127.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">both an occupation and a social caste</a></span> that became more codified in the 1600s after the last known record of Yasuke. According to Lockley, the concept of a samurai <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/who-was-yasuke-japans-first-black-samurai-180981416/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/who-was-yasuke-japans-first-black-samurai-180981416/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was fluid during Yasuke’s time</a></span>, and if you took up weapons in service of a lord, you could take on the name. So right now, we don’t know how much Ubisoft is playing with history with Yasuke’s samurai status.</p><p>Yasuke served Nobunaga from 1581 to 1582, and his service ended after Nobunaga was betrayed by his general, Akechi Mitsuhide. Nobunaga performed seppuku, a ritual suicide considered a way to retain one’s honor in defeat. Lockley describes it as his “last victory,” and says Yasuke would go on to join Oda Nabutada, Nobunaga’s son, who also fought Akechi’s men the following day and performed seppuku. Lockley says the last known record of Yasuke is of him being escorted to a Jesuit mission house by Akechi’s troops.</p><p>According to <em>Shadows</em>’ associate narrative director Brooke Davis, the team is using what is known about Yasuke and filling in the blanks with its own story. Davis describes the team’s version of Yasuke as a “thoughtful, level head” compared to Naoe, who is more passionate and fiery. The two are meant to contrast in both personality and playstyle, as Naoe will focus on stealth as a ninja, while Yasuke will be a more action-oriented fighter utilizing samurai skills.<br></p><p>Yasuke differs from previous <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>protagonists in that he’s the first character who is based on a specific historical figure. Most of <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>’s heroes have been original characters striving to stay invisible and nudge history from the shadows, hence providing a neat explanation for why little historical record exists for them. They’re still maintaining that in <em>Shadows</em>, of course, as Naoe is an original character in the Assassin faction. But Yasuke’s known history is another wrinkle in the series’ storytelling that will be interesting to watch unfold when <em>Shadows </em>comes to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S on November 15.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It starts with a group of Sims wearing jerseys from every team the Chargers will face this season before an unseen figure is shown removing the ladder, an act that is familiar to <em>plenty</em> <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=a03d90e6355dafdc&amp;sca_upv=1&amp;rlz=1C1RXQR_enUS1097US1097&amp;q=Sims+remove+the+ladder+meme&amp;uds=ADvngMhhDoUiRlghAkhZNdYT43b0oKAf1ITlYzhXy1U_F4LGE6Yc8YjQWdw4ZIu6RBf0GYrHwtFcRNw-0arJg4daX38Mjwt0L0lTbCaRmdg5489EJuOnyBJgqW0wbhM_y0W9kl2oR1sM6xF4L36C4463frAryLG_RS6o2uKfk3TFBANZO_75UEosmP62-BFpcJ08PNFeRU00jK49w54RN1RBwNzkHiFpKC6kVD4wJiNMY_XXsHXj6nhpAxkmTr__7Gkr2SDDiAhAUaWEFhPSNidhajExshdRN71kTCQ7vbpnpT7xOj5kH9ACCW8HVqzZszx8poTr2APKIrCC1azHWNcQ855O-edVsw&amp;udm=2&amp;prmd=ivsnbmt&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiHhrKM1pKGAxVNEFkFHYQ0BG4QtKgLegQIDhAB&amp;biw=1295&amp;bih=1261&amp;dpr=1.5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">of diabolical Sims players</a>. </p><p>From then on, the Chargers announce which teams they'll play for the 2024 regular season, presenting many jokes, memes, pop culture references, and <a href="https://x.com/AustinPlanet/status/1790907064375476578" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/ChargersMuse/status/1791128965962489905" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">few</a> <a href="https://x.com/lindseyyok/status/1790900813176373722" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jabs</a> at several <a href="https://x.com/ChargersMuse/status/1791128965962489905" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">individuals</a> and teams. Some are more upfront and in your face, while others linger in the background. While the Sims gimmick is reason enough to watch, there are so many references that it encourages multiple viewings. </p><p>Here are a few I personally found hilarious: </p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Chargers' Week 4 game versus the Chiefs shows a snippet of Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce recording an episode of <a href="https://www.newheightshow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his podcast</a> before he skedaddles with <a href="https://people.com/travis-kelce-talks-filming-taylor-swift-eras-tour-on-his-phone-8649140" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his girlfriend Taylor Swift</a> on her private jet. </li><li>In Week 8, the Chargers face the New Orleans Saints, showing a Falcons fan picking up a voodoo doll before seeing four prompts appear, mentioning moments in the Saints franchise history, most infamously <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1441646-reviewing-the-complete-timeline-of-nfl-saints-bountygate-scandal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bountygate</a>. </li><li>On Thanksgiving Day, the Chargers' Week 12 opponent is the Baltimore Ravens. The scene shows a young Jim and John Harbaugh, who are the head coaches of the <a href="https://www.chargers.com/team/coaches-roster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chargers</a> and <a href="https://www.baltimoreravens.com/team/coaches-roster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ravens</a>, respectively, playing in a shared room before it fast-forwards to older versions of both in a pillow fight.</li><li>In the second to the final week of the regular season, the Chargers will face the New England Patriots; it depicts a retirement home of many of the Patriot's best players from the team's <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/39260168/bill-belichick-new-england-patriots-legacy-nfl-greatest-dynasty-innovation-tom-brady" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">historic sports dynasty</a>, such as Rob Gronkowski and Julian Edelman, before a pop-up appears saying "Your dynasty has ended, but the town lives on. There's no reason to let this house stay empty. Would you like to restart?"</li><li>It also features a shot of Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker, who can be seen cooking and cleaning in a kitchen - no doubt a knock on Butker's controversial comments in a recent <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/05/16/1251778598/nfl-harrison-butker-commencement-speech-backlash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">commencement address</a>.</li></ul><p>The Chargers never expliclty say which Sims game they're using, but internal discussions between me and my fellow Simmers and colleagues Reb Valentine and Alex Stedman deduce that the Chargers likely back to the Sims 2 for their reveal. A little vintage, but we're not complaining.</p><p>This isn't the first time an NFL team used a video game to reveal its schedule. In 2020, the Detroit Lions used Animal Crossing: New Horizons to unveil its schedule. But The Chargers usually get pretty creative, as the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/los-angeles-chargers-anime-opening-2022-schedule-one-piece-naruto-attack-on-titan">past two</a> <a href="https://www.chargers.com/video/chargers-anime-schedule-release-2023-edition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">years</a>, the organization used anime-themed reveals to announce its opponents for that respective season. </p><p>You can see some of our other favorite pop culture-inspired NFL reveals below.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Chicago Bears (@ChicagoBears) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChicagoBears/status/1790894961199595793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 16, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Do you like schedules? <a href="https://t.co/xxNTeCxFvv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/xxNTeCxFvv</a></p>— New England Patriots (@Patriots) <a href="https://twitter.com/Patriots/status/1790894935471751504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 16, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">To Me, My Jaguars! 💥<a href="https://twitter.com/Dream_Finders?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Dream_Finders</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DUUUVAL?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#DUUUVAL</a></p>— Jacksonville Jaguars (@Jaguars) <a href="https://twitter.com/Jaguars/status/1790896080793616492?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 16, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The next generation of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Vikings?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Vikings</a> schedules is here!<a href="https://t.co/UeiFxRs60a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/UeiFxRs60a</a> <a href="https://t.co/RTpkaEmlLF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/RTpkaEmlLF</a></p>— Minnesota Vikings (@Vikings) <a href="https://twitter.com/Vikings/status/1790895432576471202?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 16, 2024</a></blockquote> <p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.

                <p dir="ltr">Activision has released a <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1791166606640545883" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new teaser trailer</a> for the upcoming Season 4 update for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-597446">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Warzone</a>. The season is confirmed for May 29, and the big update brings the return of Warzone's popular Kar98k bolt-action rifle.</p><p dir="ltr">The brief video clip doesn't give much away, with quick images of clocks, timers, and keypads. These teasers could be referring to the bunkers in Warzone, which haven't been unlocked yet, and they could be preparing to open in Season 4. The images could also be teasing an upcoming reveal for Call of Duty 2024. The new game reveal may or may not be tied to the Warzone bunkers, which is something we've seen in the past with Call of Duty in-game reveal events.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to the Season 4 clip, Activision also <a href="https://twitter.com/FaZeScope/status/1791155295189701030" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sent packages to Call of Duty influencers</a> that contained teasers to reveal the popular Kar98k rifle is returning. It's uncertain if this will be the marksman-rifle version seen in Modern Warfare 2019 or Call of Duty: Vanguard's sniper-rifle version, but it was described in the teasers as being a bolt-action rifle, which makes sense, seeing as it's a real weapon used by Germany in WW2.</p><p dir="ltr">More details will likely arrive in the coming days leading up to Season 4's launch. In other Call of Duty news, Warzone's recent update has added a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-how-to-unlock-the-black-ops-6-sally-weapon-blueprint/1100-6523521/">secret "Sally" pistol weapon blueprint</a>, which seems to be teasing Treyarch's rumored Black Ops 6.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/ffxiv-live-letter-details-on-benchmark-ddos-attacks/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=ffxiv-live-letter-details-on-benchmark-ddos-attacks<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="222" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">During today’s Live Letter update stream, director and producer Naoki Yoshida sat down to discuss the recent string of DDoS attacks aimed at <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, along with more changes planned for the<em> Dawntrail</em> Benchmark.</p> <p data-characters="378" data-current-count="378" data-injectable="false">On the subject of the DDoS attacks, Yoshida acknowledged that the recent string of attacks against <em>Final Fantasy XIV </em>has been not only the largest scale attack in the game’s history but also the longest. Despite this, Yoshida reassured that there is a dedicated and talented infrastructure team working around the clock in shifts to protect players during these attacks.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="344" data-current-count="722" data-injectable="true">Not only is this team working internally within Square Enix, but also with external vendors to figure out the best way to deal with these attacks moving forward. Although there is massive packet loss at times, occasionally with more than 2,000 players losing connection at a time, there has been no critical damage as a result of these attacks.</p>
 <p data-characters="175" data-current-count="175" data-injectable="false">He went on to thank players for their kind and encouraging comments on social media during these attacks, apologizing for any inconvenience experienced due to disconnection.<br></p> <figure data-current-count="475" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot via Final Fantasy XIV YouTube</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="382" data-current-count="382" data-injectable="false">Moving on to the <em>Dawntrail Benchmark</em>, Yoshida shared some rather impressive screenshots detailing what the development team is trying to achieve. In these screenshots, it’s clear to see that the lighting effects are looking better over the current game and even the current version of the Benchmark, with shadows falling much more naturally and character details shining through. </p> <p data-characters="391" data-current-count="773" data-injectable="true">Yoshida also took a moment to discuss Miqo’te canine teeth. Well, more than a moment, if I’m honest, but the news was definitely welcome. Previously, in the current Benchmark, Miqo’te players had noticed that their characters’ canines were much smaller than they were used to. This, we were informed, has been rectified and Miqo’te players are looking vampire-esque once again.&nbsp;<br></p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Final Fantasy XIV YouTube</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="357" data-current-count="657" data-injectable="true">In further detail, Yoshida said that while all Miqo’te characters will benefit from this change, certain face types will have to have slightly smaller canines due to the shape of the face. Keeper of the Moon females, mostly, will suffer from this issue, with face types 1 through 3 having longer canines and face type 4 having slightly shorter ones.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="224" data-current-count="224" data-injectable="false">Lalafell players are also receiving a small tweak to their teeth. After feedback from the community, Lalafell teeth will now fit the shape of the mouth much better, rather than sitting bizarrely in the middle of the jaw.&nbsp;<br></p> <figure data-current-count="524" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot via Final Fantasy XIV YouTube</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="402" data-current-count="402" data-injectable="true">Smile lines have also been addressed. With the new lighting update, players were noticing that their characters had newly developed smile lines. While these, I’m reliably informed, are a sign of a life well lived, many players were unhappy with their sudden appearance. Yoshida stated that the development team has made slight adjustments, essentially giving characters some filler in the area.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="399" data-current-count="399" data-injectable="false">There’s still no set date for the release of the updated Benchmark, though Yoshida tentatively stated that they’re aiming for May 31, or sometime around that point. We were promised that as soon as they have a set date, they’ll make an announcement. Until then, Yoshida is making his final checks of both the Benchmark and <em>Dawntrail</em> itself, all while undertaking a Media Tour at the same time.</p>

  <p id="CrVMSw"><em>Minecraft</em> is turning 15 years old. Somehow, it feels like it’s been around for much, much longer, which speaks to the ubiquity of the game. Despite its age, <em>Minecraft</em> is still wildly popular due its its sandbox-style gameplay — you can do or make almost anything. You can already play it on your computer, console, or mobile phone, but Microsoft’s added one more platform: Google search.</p>

<p id="UmFO8Q">To celebrate the game’s 15th anniversary, <em>Minecraft </em>is playable in Google Search — sort of. Head over to Google and search for <em>Minecraft</em>. You’ll see a little grass block at the bottom of the screen. Hit that, and it’ll turn into a pickaxe. Then just click away. All over the screen, you’ll uncover a bunch of different <em>Minecraft </em>vignettes. Keep on tapping to bludgeon your way through all sorts of <em>Minecraft</em> bricks and experience the satisfying crunch of breaking stuff.</p>
<p id="O4JFDT">Since I found it, I’ve been breaking my way through wood, dirt, snow, stone, and even clouds. There’s not much — or anything — else you can do in there, as far as I’ve experienced, but it has proved amusing enough for me! I’ll be over here clicking away until I understand <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24022852/minecraft-movie-jack-black-steve">how Jack Black is playing Steve in the upcoming <em>Minecraft </em>movie</a>.</p>

<p data-characters="360" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Final Fantasy XIV </em> is gearing up for its next expansion debut on July 2, though you can begin <em>Dawntrail’s </em>early access on June 28.

Action Change Settings will “allow you to individually choose whether or not specific changing actions will be replaced by their follow-up counterparts upon execution.” </p> <p data-characters="258" data-current-count="656" data-injectable="true">Then there’s the new Jobs, Viper and Pictomancer.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dave-diver-godzilla-dlc-coming-next-week<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The fishing and deep sea exploration hit <em>Dave the Diver</em> is adding one more wonder to its ocean next week, as Godzilla DLC will be joining the game, albeit with a caveat.</p>

<p>The <em>Dave the Diver</em> Godzilla DLC will be completely free to players on all platforms, much like the <em>Dredge</em> crossover of last year, which came not long before Nexon announced that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dave-diver-sales-3-million" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Dave the Diver Sales Break the 3 Million Barrier"><em>Dave the Diver</em> had crossed 3 million sales</a>. If it's like that you'll need to download it separately to add to the game, making this an optional addition to the game for players who want it.</p>

<p>Beyond the king of the monsters himself, several other parts of the <em>Godzilla</em> franchise will be making their way here, as the G-Force is tracking the injured Godzilla, who will see Dave in the depths of the Blue Hole.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dave-the-diver-godzilla.jpg?itok=-eIGMUen 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dave-the-diver-godzilla.jpg?itok=o0nGsXqE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Maybe Godzilla won't be spending all of its time beneath the waves...</figcaption></figure><p>Beyond G-Force and Godzilla, another Kaiju will be making its appearance in <em>Dave the Diver</em> as <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/05/16/dave-the-diver-free-godzilla-dlc-arrives-may-23/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Dave the Diver: free Godzilla DLC arrives May 23">part of the DLC</a>. During the DLC, Dave will be evading pursuit from Ebirah, a sea Kaiju who was featured in the 1966 movie <em>Ebirah, Horror of the Deep</em>.</p>

<p>Finding his trusty harpoon unable to stop Ebirah, Dave will use the G-Force submarine to battle the seabound Kaiju and penetrate its shell. As for what Godzilla will be doing during all this? That is left as a mystery for now, but it's possible he might ally with you against the destructive Kaiju as he has in some of his cinematic appearances.</p>

<h2>When is the Dave the Diver Godzilla DLC releasing?</h2>

<p>The <em>Dave the Diver</em> Godzilla DLC will be released on May 23 for free on PC, PlayStation 4 &amp; 5, and Nintendo Switch. The DLC will only be here for a limited time, so make sure to grab it before it goes away on November 23, as Toho sends it to the depths of removed content. If you are wanting to serve Kaiju sushi, this will be the time to get on board and take action.</p>

<p>For players who are interested in <em>Dave the Diver</em> but haven't picked up the game by Mintrocket, it is currently available as part of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/all-confirmed-playstation-plus-april-2024-games" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" All Confirmed PlayStation Plus April 2024 Games">April PlayStation Plus Extra</a> lineup. Otherwise, you're looking at its normal retail price, and it generally hasn't gone on deep discounts.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-inquisition-game-of-the-year-edition-is-now-free-to-grab-on-epic-games-store/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Starting today through next Thursday, the Epic Games Store is offering a free digital copy of <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/dragon-age-inquisition-game-of-the-year-edition-2f0cbd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon Age: Inquisition Game of the Year Edition</a>. This version of BioWare's RPG includes all the post-launch DLCs: Jaws of Hakkon, The Descent, and Trespasser. The last two, in particular, are absolutely vital to fully understanding the storyline, which is expected to continue in the upcoming Dragon Age: Dreadwolf.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: Inquisition is the third installment in the RPG franchise. It was the first BioWare game to utilize the Frostbite engine when it launched in November 2014. The game earned widespread acclaim, winning over 130 Game of the Year awards and becoming BioWare's most successful release in terms of units sold.</p>
<p>While this isn't the first time the game has been given away (it already happened <a href="https://wccftech.com/prime-gaming-november-drops-include-control-ultimate-edition-dragon-age-inquisition-and-rise-of-the-tomb-raider/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in October 2021 via Amazon's Prime Gaming</a>), the timing of this new promotion is fairly obvious: EA and BioWare are enticing any potential users who still haven't checked out the game to do so ahead of the long-awaited gameplay reveal of the next installment, Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, which will happen at some point next month during Summer Game Fest. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-has-everyone-at-bioware-really-happy-with-how-it-turned-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last rumors</a> suggest that the game's launch will happen this year, and they also hint at a strong level of satisfaction regarding the level of quality.</p>
<p><iframe title="DRAGON AGE™: INQUISITION Official Trailer – Game of the Year Edition" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M2Qsvm_EtkA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Dragon Age: Inquisition Game of the Year Edition is the first freebie of the latest <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/sales-and-specials/mega-sale" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store MEGA Sale</a>, which runs through June 13. The next game is still clouded in mystery, but in the meantime, users can enjoy substantial discounts on many big games. All eligible purchases (including in-game purchases) also provide 5% back as part of the Epic Rewards program.</p>
<p>By the way, the Epic Games Store is not the only place to get free PC games: Amplitude Studios is now giving away 2014's turn-based 4X fantasy-strategy game ENDLESS Legend <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/289130/ENDLESS_Legend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>.</p>

Even so, <strong>Amazon Prime members</strong> can pick up a <a href="https://zdcs.link/GdxoM" target="_blank">Silicon Power 2TB</a> PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 solid state drive (SSD) for only $109.99 shipped. This is one of the lowest prices we've seen this year for a PS5-compatible SSD.</p><h2>Silicon Power 2TB SSD (PS5-Compatible) for $109.99</h2><p><em><strong>Amazon Prime member exclusive deal</strong></em></p><div id="179170"><p><h3>Silicon Power 2TB PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 SSD</h3></p><div><p>Amazon Prime members only</p></div></div><p>The Silicon Power 2TB meets all the requirements for your PS5 SSD upgrade. It supports transfer speeds of up to 7,000MB/s read and 6,500MB/s write which is well above the 5,500MB/s minimum threshold. However, it does not include a heatsink. Compatible <a href="https://zdcs.link/6YE8Z" target="_blank">heatsinks starts at $7</a> and they are very easy to install yourself.</p><p>The PS5 is an outstanding  gaming console, but the 1TB SSD is a real bottleneck. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, for example, can exceed 200GB alone. NBA 2K23 weighs in at 150GB and even older games like God of War: Ragnarok and Horizon Forbidden West  require 90GB of space. Future games like Grand Theft Auto VI will undoubtedly demand even more space.</p><p>If you have a gaming PC, this SSD would make a great boot drive. There are faster drives out there, but for OS and general app performance, you won't notice any real world performance difference compared to this drive, which is already very, very fast. The capacity is also ideal. For most people, a 2TB SSD should be enough to cover your OS, apps, and games. A 4TB would be even better, but it would <a href="https://zdcs.link/Ay34j" target="_blank">run you over $200</a>. Instead, put all of your other files on a bigger, cheaper, traditional hard drive and you're set.</p><h2>A 2TB PS5 SSD with preinstalled heatsink costs $129.99</h2><div id="180988"><p><h3>Adata Legend 960 Max 2TB PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 SSD (up to 7400MBps) with Heatsink</h3></p><div><p>Amazon Prime members only</p></div></div><p>Installing your own heatsink is very, very easy. However, if you don't want to get your hands dirty, there's an A-Data Legend 960 Max 2TB SSD that's currently on sale for Amazon Prime memberes for $129.99. It has a robust aluminum heatsink pre-installed and it's definitely fast enough for your PS5 console.</p><p>If you want more options, check out our picks for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ssd">best SSDs of 2024</a>.</p></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>May 16, 2024 5:55 pm</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Now, some of that feedback has been put to use in the game's first patch, and there are still more adjustments on their way.</p><p>Today, Supergiant Games released the first Early Access patch for Hades II, which includes substantial changes to player movement, encounters, and level design as well as a handful of bug fixes. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/4175477072263852699" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The patch notes</a> are available on Steam.</p><p>"Here's our first patch in <strong>Early Access</strong>!! We're very grateful for all the feedback so far, which inspired this first set of targeted improvements and fixes." the patch notes read.</p><p>Most notably, the patch makes sprinting faster, dashing out of attack recovery animations more reliable, and gathering easier (now, players can get resources from any resource point once they unlock the right Gathering Tool, and Tools can be prioritized to make its respective resources appear more often). The design of several areas has also been altered to make dashing and resource gathering easier.</p><p>It also fixes a few frustrating bugs, including certain Boons not working as expected and foes spawning out of bounds.</p><p>The patch is almost entirely inspired by players, with every item in the notes except for two spurred by community feedback.

<p>Shortly after Carpenter reported that, Phoenix Labs released the following <a href="https://x.com/sweetpotatoes/status/1791161114538987820">statement</a>:&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Today is an incredibly difficult day. After a long period of evaluating how to navigate our economic structure, we have had to significantly restructure the company to pave a path for a strong future. We are reorganizing Phoenix Labs to focus on our best-in-class live service titles, Dauntless and Fae Farm, and serving their communities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This unfortunately means canceling work on all other projects at the studio, which will impact many of our colleagues immediately. We are giving notices to everyone whose roles are affected. This restructure has not come easily, and truly has been the last resort to ensure Phoenix Labs can survive, and thrive in the long term. It's impossible to put into words how deeply we value every talented individual who have contributed their hard work and passion to every project at our studio.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We are doing all we can to help our departing team members in this interim period and encourage any studios looking for incredible talent to speak with the one-of-a-kind people that have been a part of Phoenix Labs' journey."&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BF5C0KohZHI" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Phoenix Labs released its latest game, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/09/13/dauntless-developer-unveils-co-op-fantasy-life-sim-fae-farm">Fae Farm</a>, back in September, and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/dauntless/a-prosaic-peak">Dauntless</a> before that in 2019.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/looks-like-the-kar98k-is-set-to-return-in-mw3-and-warzone-season-4/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=looks-like-the-kar98k-is-set-to-return-in-mw3-and-warzone-season-4<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="196" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Rumors and leaks suggested that the KAR98k would be included in the <em>Modern Warfare 3</em> and <em>Warzone</em> Season 4 update, but Raven Software may have finally confirmed it as part of a marketing campaign. </p> <p data-characters="337" data-current-count="337" data-injectable="false">The <em>Warzone</em> devs sent 98 care packages to content creators ahead of Season 4. On Twitter, JGOD <a href="https://x.com/JGODYT/status/1791152147494731806" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">showed</a> that the box had a letter K, a bolt-into-action label, and a car with 98 on its door, essentially confirming that the KAR98K will be in the new update. Based on the Season 3 Battle Pass, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/when-does-mw3-and-warzone-season-4-start/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 4</a> will likely start on Wednesday, May 29.</p> <figure data-current-count="637" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Activision </figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="602" data-current-count="602" data-injectable="true">Activision usually releases a blog post for <em>MW3 </em>and <em>Warzone</em> with initial details about the next update one week before a new season starts, so players should expect more news soon. In saying that, the Kar98k is already a noteworthy addition worth paying attention to. <em>Modern Warfare 3’s</em> iteration of <em>Warzone </em>improved one-shot sniping by removing the explosive ammunition requirement. Without needing to use the ammunition type that drastically decrease bullet velocity to get a one-shot kill, sniper rifles dominate the battle royale and are capable of taking out enemies from impressive ranges. </p>
 <p data-characters="484" data-current-count="484" data-injectable="false">During <em>Warzone</em> Pacific in 2021, the Kar98k was widely regarded as one of the best, if not the best, weapons to use on Caldera. If the bolt-action sniper rifle can one-shot kill enemies in Season 4, there’s no doubt that the Kar98k will be a must-use weapon. Because even though the MORS is arguably the best sniper rifle in <em>Warzone</em> right now, the KAR98k will have better mobility and aim-down sight speeds. It will all come down to how far away the new weapon can kill enemies. </p>

<p data-characters="399" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Monopoly GO’s</em> Robo Partners event debuted today, with opportunities for players to get wild stickers, an exclusive Penguin board token, and other useful rewards. Following the previous <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/monopoly-go-releases-massive-dice-gift-to-apologize-for-partner-event-mishaps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Parade Partners event’s mishaps and dice gift</a>, Robo Partners looks promising on its first day, with no signs of past point tracking bugs and a sizable currency gift from Scopely to celebrate its launch.</p> <p data-characters="443" data-current-count="443" data-injectable="true">Scopely’s Robo Partners gift, announced earlier today through official <a href="https://discord.gg/officialmonopolygo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">social media channels</a>, includes 1,000 batteries, the event’s currency you use to spin your robot’s points wheel to progress through its reward milestones. Anyone who logs on during the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/monopoly-go-all-robo-partners-event-rewards-and-milestones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robo Partners event</a>, including you and your partners, will receive this currency, allowing you to advance through the event without gaining batteries from other sources.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Monopoly GO Discord</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="492" data-current-count="792" data-injectable="true">Scopely’s May 16 announcement doesn’t dive into why 1,000 batteries were released for this particular event outside of helping you get started. It also doesn’t require you to answer trivia questions or win a giveaway; you can enter <em>Monopoly GO</em> immediately and find your reward as a pop-up message, even as a newer player. Although some community members reported slight delays with receiving the gift, there are no requirements for claiming the Robo Partners event currency.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="381" data-current-count="681" data-injectable="true">While 1,000 batteries isn’t quite enough to complete one of your four partner robots, it can help you progress through the beginning reward tiers, potentially pushing you into later milestone levels if you’re lucky. You can also combine these with tokens you get from any ongoing banner events and tournaments to gain extra points wheel spins or raise your multipliers.</p>
 <p data-characters="251" data-current-count="251" data-injectable="false">It’s&nbsp;currently unknown whether there’ll be any follow-up announcements regarding this partner event or its rewards.&nbsp;However, with the point tracking bug fixed during the last Partners event,&nbsp;you can&nbsp;use them as soon as you claim them. </p>

In fact, you can take advantage of the <em>Fortnite</em> maker’s “Mega Sale” without spending a single dime. In addition to deep discounts on top games, you’ll be able to scoop up one free game each week from the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/sales-and-specials/mega-sale">Epic Games Store</a> through the sale’s June 13th closing date, starting with <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/dragon-age-inquisition-game-of-the-year-edition-2f0cbd"><strong><em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>’s Game of the Year Edition</strong></a><strong>. </strong>It comes with all of the game’s three main add-ons, plus the Deluxe Edition’s bonus mounts, gear, and weapons.</p><p><em>Inquisition</em> features developer BioWare’s patented branching storylines, deep action roleplaying combat systems, an open-world structure, and an evolving diplomacy system that has you, as the so-called Inquisitor, making world-changing decisions that your companions and opponents may or may not like. It’s still worth playing all these years later, especially with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/4/23987808/dragon-age-dreadwolf-trailer-summer-2024-bioware">a new series entrant on the way</a>.</p><div><p>You’ll find many other titles on sale for your coinage in the Epic Games Store Mega Sale, including newer hits like <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/alan-wake-2"><em>Alan Wake 2</em> down to $39.99</a> ($10 off), <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/ea-sports-fc-24"><em>EA Sports FC 24</em> for $13.99</a> ($56 off), and Ubisoft’s online pirating adventure <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/skull-and-bones"><em>Skull and Bones</em> for $29.99</a> ($30 off).

The dynamic open-world title puts you in the shoes of the Inquisitor, giving you influence to shape the open-world realm and the lives of the inhabitants within as you protect them from mythical threats.</p></div><div><p><em>Alan Wake 2 </em>is the culmination of everything Remedy Entertainment has been building toward. The inventive third-person survival game is both horrifying and strange, with dual campaigns that are more than a little meta.</p></div><p>If you want the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24155407/apple-ipad-air-review-2024">newest iPad Air with M2</a>, it’s going to cost you at least $599 for the 11-inch model. It’s a less impressive upgrade over its predecessor than the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24155440/apple-ipad-pro-2024-review">well-reviewed iPad Pro</a>, however, and the original still holds up well if you just need a solid tablet that should continue to receive most new iPadOS features for the foreseeable future. You’d get considerable savings, too, as the base <strong>M1 iPad Air</strong> with 64GB of storage is down to $399 ($200 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/2022-Apple-iPad-10-9-inch-Wi-Fi/dp/B09V3HN1KC?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com">Walmart</a>, a new all-time-low price that beats the previous record by a full $100. The 256GB M1 iPad Air also has a new price record of $599 ($150 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/2022-Apple-iPad-10-9-inch-Wi-Fi/dp/B09V3H386P?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> in select colors.</p><p>It’s possible Apple or its retail partners will keep the 2022 Air around as a value buy, so maybe this steep discount reflects a pending permanent price cut. Whatever the case, $399 is a fantastic price for the tablet. Compared to the refresh that launched just yesterday, it’s really only missing out on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24146454/apple-pencil-pro-ipad-stylus-price-availability-features">Apple Pencil Pro</a> support, the M2-exclusive Apple Pencil hover feature, and Wi-Fi 6E (but Wi-Fi 6 is still good). There’s also no option to step up to a bigger 13-inch model. Otherwise, it still has more power than most people will likely ever need in a tablet, with its biggest strengths being a beautiful 10.9-inch Liquid Retina display, a lightweight profile, and support for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MU8F2AM-A-Pencil-Generation/dp/B07K1WWBJK?tag=theverge02-20">second-gen Apple Pencil</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Magic-Keyboard-11-inch-iPad-Generation/dp/B0863BQJMS?tag=theverge02-20">the original Magic Keyboard</a>.</p><p><h5><a href="https://www.theverge.com/22979828/apple-ipad-air-2022-review">Read our Apple iPad Air (2022) review</a>.</h5></p><div><p>The 2022 iPad Air retains the iPad Pro-esque redesign of the 2020 model but does away with the A14 Bionic processor in favor of Apple’s fast M1 chip. It also comes in one of five colors and boasts a 12MP front-facing camera with support for Apple’s Center Stage feature.</p></div><div><div><h2>Verge Deals on X<!-- --> <!-- --> / </h2><p>Join more than 50,000 followers and keep up with the best daily tech deals with @vergedeals</p></div><p><a href="http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud">Follow us!</a></p></div><p><h3>Don’t miss these other great deals</h3></p><div><ul><li>Whether you’re getting the new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24150360/google-pixel-8a-price-specs-camera-best-take-magic-editor">Pixel 8A</a> or have one <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23912370/google-pixel-8-pro-review-camera-assistant-magic-editor-best-take-audio-eraser">of the family’s loftier devices</a> and need a new pair of wireless earbuds, we typically recommend <strong>Google’s Pixel Buds Pro, </strong>which are down to $139.99 ($60 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Buds-Pro-Headphones/dp/B0B1N7SGMZ?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.me/cmgnN6MgbxZ">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=vergeroudupdeals051624&amp;veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoogle-Pixel-Buds-Pro-Wireless-Earbuds-with-Active-Noise-Cancellation-Bluetooth-Earbuds-Lemongrass%2F449765781">Walmart,</a> matching the all-time low.

However, some players have had difficulty adjusting to protagonist Melinoë’s dash, as well as her ability to sprint. Luckily for those folks, Supergiant Games is already on it and <em>Hades 2</em>’s first patch is addressing speed first and foremost.</p><div data-video-id="196539" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Innovative Hades-Like Feels Built For Speedrunners" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="278" data-playlist="196539,196848,195891" data-current="196539"><div><p>This Innovative Hades-Like Feels Built For Speedrunners</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196539/196539_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196539/196539_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196539/196539_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196539/196539_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22094.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>As of today’s patch, Melinoë’s sprint (which did feel a little too slow) has been sped up to make her “innately faster.” Her sprint is also much more responsive, since some players found it a little difficult to turn while they were running, which I’m sure became a pain in the ass in some late-game areas that are positively swarming with things trying to kill you.<br></p><p>Melinoë’s dash has also been ever so slightly tweaked so that players can dash out of recovery animations faster. It isn’t that she would necessarily get stunlocked by damage, but I did find she was a bit too slow to dash away from enemies after being struck. Now, she should have the same urgency I have as I slam on the dodge button so as to not lose one of my death defiances on an otherwise phenomenal run of the game.<br></p><p>Melinoë’s dash in <em>Hades 2</em> has been a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/HadesTheGame/comments/1cm8jc5/melino%C3%AB_taking_her_sweet_time_after_i_press_x/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HadesTheGame/comments/1cm8jc5/melino%C3%AB_taking_her_sweet_time_after_i_press_x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">little controversial</a></span> since it is markedly slower than Zagreus’ from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hades-the-kotaku-review-1845204803&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hades-the-kotaku-review-1845204803">the first game</a></span>. Her dash leaves a trail that she must recover before she can dash again, which is a pretty drastic change from Zagreus, who was able to dash again pretty instantaneously. He was even able to collect boons that granted him multiple extra dashes before he tired. While I wouldn’t mind seeing Supergiant tweak Melinoë’s kit, I think this difference especially makes them unique characters that promote different playstyles. I’d hate to see Melinoë’s footprint stamped out of the game because of the studio’s responsiveness to feedback.<br></p><p>Speaking of faster, <em>Hades 2</em>’s first patch is also speeding up <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-to-get-bronze-hades-2-fishing-rod-1851465960&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-to-get-bronze-hades-2-fishing-rod-1851465960">resource gathering</a></span>.

However, you can only use one resource gathering tool at a time, meaning you have to pick if you are prioritizing plants, fishes, ores, or other materials for each run. In my experience, a good run culminating in a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://v&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://v/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">diabolical showdown against Chronos</a></span> at the very end could take about 40-50 minutes, meaning that’s a hefty chunk of time to not be gathering other materials.<br></p><p>Now, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://v&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://v/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Hades 2</em></a></span><em> </em>players will be able to collect from <em>any</em> resource point that they find during a run so long as they have the associated gathering tool unlocked. So if you’ve unlocked the spade or the pickaxe, you don’t need to have them equipped to dig up seeds or mine ore, respectively. Toggling a specific gathering tool will allow you to gain as much from the resource points as you could prior to this patch, while “resources for tools you do not prioritize will appear far less often,” according to the patch notes.<br></p><p>Elsewhere, Supergiant has issued tiny (but consequential) fixes, like showing your currency when you’re at a Well of Charon, or repeating the tutorial for Grasp upgrades at the Altar of Ashes. Anecdotally, a friend of mine made it to the third region of the game without upgrading their Grasp to have more passive buffs because they just didn’t know how to do it. If you’ve been there, you know that region is hard as hell even <em>with </em>upgrades, and players have reported that the game does a poor job of explaining the system. As of this patch, more players will hopefully know how to upgrade their Grasp and get beefed up for their fight with Chronos.<br></p><p>For the entirety of the patch notes, which are mostly directed at feedback the team’s received since launch, check them out <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/4175477072263852699&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/4175477072263852699" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></span>. Supergiant mentions that with this first patch out of the way, it’ll be working on balance changes next, which tells me that I better fit in a win soon before the team nerfs my favorite boons/builds.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/details-on-new-valve-game-deadlock-leaked/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>New details have emerged about Valve’s new game in development, including that it will officially be called Deadlock. During it’s development at Valve, the game had been known as Neon Prime and Citadel.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://twitter.com/gabefollower/status/1791110448114188557" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gabe Follower on Twitter</a>, there is a lot of new information about the game. </p>



<p>Deadlock will reportedly be a 6 vs 6 third-person hero shooter. The game will feature a large map with four lanes to attack that have tower defense mechanics as well as various items and abilities to utilize. Gabe Follower adds that Deadlock will have a fantasy setting “mixed with steampunk. Magicians, weird creatures and robots.”</p>



<p>Lastly, they say that the game will feature fast travel using floating rails “similar to Bioshock Infinite”.</p>



<p>As of publishing, this information has yet to be confirmed by Valve nor has it been independently verified by Insider Gaming. Because of that, take all information on Deadlock, including the name, with a grain of salt.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Valve for comment. Should a response be received, this story will be updated accordingly.</p>

<p data-characters="316" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Activision has <a href="https://blog.activision.com/activision/2024/activision-announces-new-studio-elsewhere-entertainment-all-new-franchise-development" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced on its blog</a> today that it is forming Elsewhere Entertainment, a new studio that will focus on a new narrative-based “genre-defining” AAA franchise. We don’t know what that franchise will be, nor what genre it will be defining, but we do know it will be headquartered in Warsaw, Poland.</p> <p data-characters="391" data-current-count="391" data-injectable="false">Activision states that the developer will be “built from the ground up” and will establish “an environment that inspires bold and diverse ideas.” The team will consist of “storytelling experts” who have worked on such franchises as “<em>The Last of Us</em>, <em>Uncharted</em>, <em>The Witcher</em>, <em>Cyberpunk</em>, <em>Destiny</em>, <em>Tom Clancy’s The Division</em>, and <em>Far Cry</em>.” That’s a lot of storytelling experts.</p> <p data-characters="227" data-current-count="618" data-injectable="true">It’s hard not to be cynical about a studio established by a company whose parent <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/redfall-and-hi-fi-rush-developers-shut-down-in-another-awful-wave-of-microsoft-cuts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just shut down a handful of talented studios</a>. It sounds like, “Why are you buying a Mercedes when you just defaulted on your last car loan?”</p>
 <p data-characters="178" data-current-count="178" data-injectable="false">“Elsewhere is opening its search for best-in-class talent from across the industry,” the release says. Yeah, I think you might know a few people who are now looking for work.</p> <p data-characters="203" data-current-count="381" data-injectable="false">I know that it’s never quite that simple, but it just seems really galling for Activision to trumpet its founding of a AAA studio so soon while Microsoft keeps <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/microsoft-lays-off-1900-employees-from-activision-blizzard-and-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">making huge cuts</a> across its subsidiaries.</p> <p data-characters="219" data-current-count="600" data-injectable="false">Hopefully, Elsewhere Entertainment will do well. I don’t know what “narrative-based” means to an executive and “genre-defining” is nothing but PR speak, but at least I don’t see the words “live service.”</p>

<p data-characters="235" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Pugstorm and Fireshine Games have announced the official launch date for <em>Core Keeper</em> 1.0 and all console ports. The developer and publisher have confirmed the game will finally leave Steam Early Access and hit consoles simultaneously. </p> <p data-characters="485" data-current-count="485" data-injectable="true">The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/top-games-like-stardew-valley/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cozy sandbox adventure game</a> <em>Core Keeper</em> will leave early access on PC and launch on PS4, PS5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on <strong>August 27, 2024</strong>. After initially releasing in March 2022, the game has been on a long Early Access road to get to this point, with new biomes, mechanics, and bosses added each step of the way. The complete package that forms the final game later this year will contain everything the developer has added and worked on with its community.</p>
 <h2 id="h-core-keeper-s-1-0-and-console-release-will-get-a-final-content-trailer-next-month" data-injectable="false"><em>Core Keeper</em>‘s 1.0 and console release will get a final content trailer next month</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Core Keeper - Console &amp; PC 1.0 Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ga6q6vUluzE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="513" data-current-count="813" data-injectable="true">Since its initial launch on PC in Steam Early Access, <em>Core Keeper</em> has grown with new features, biomes, items, and more in every update. Senior Brand Manager for Fireshine Games Vincent Coates said in a press release with this announcement, “It’s been amazing to see over 2 million players discover the charm, mystery and fun of <em>Core Keeper</em> throughout the game’s time during Steam Early Access, and we can’t wait for even more to discover everything it has to offer with the full launch.”</p>
 <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="254" data-injectable="false">The final trailer for the 1.0 and console launch will be released in June. This will be the biggest launch for the game since its Early Access debut, so there might even be a few surprises lumped in with the new versions to show off when the video debuts</p> <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="633" data-injectable="true">I’ve been playing <em>Core Keeper</em> since its Early Access launch and have thoroughly enjoyed how each update has added more depth to the game, instead of just tacking on a new area with the same tired mechanics. It’s an intriguing title because it forces you to tentatively explore a very alien world underground where you must defeat colossal monsters in order to escape.</p>
 <p data-characters="363" data-current-count="363" data-injectable="false">I’ll never forget the first time I found Ghorm the Devourer, a giant worm that travels in a wide circle around the map, and how I managed to kill it with traps, bombs, and a lot of luck. Each boss defeated opens up a new part of the world and a way to expand your base, the plants you farm, your armor and weapon sets, and the strange magics of this world. </p> <p data-characters="294" data-current-count="657" data-injectable="false">I’ve been longing to play<em> Core Keeper</em> on PS5 for ages. It’s a game I’ve already sunk dozens of hours into and can’t wait to play again, exploring every biome, unlocking every merchant, and building up an arsenal of cheeky weapons to hopefully take down every boss I can.</p>

<p data-characters="275" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">When Nightdive Studios announced that they’d be remastering <em>PO’ed</em>, I <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/im-the-fool-nightdives-poed-definitive-edition-is-actually-real/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thought they were joking</a>. It was April 1st, and they posted a trailer that starts off rather deceptively. But here it is. I’m not sure I really wanted to play <em>PO’ed</em>, but now I’ve played all of it.</p> <p data-characters="406" data-current-count="406" data-injectable="true"><em>PO’ed</em> was initially released in 1995 on the doomed 3DO Interactive Multiplayer before getting a 1996 port on PlayStation. The first-person shooter genre was still in its infancy, and while these early years resulted in classics like <em>Doom, Quake, </em>and <em>Duke Nukem 3D</em>, it’s also a graveyard for countless others that are now largely forgotten. If it isn’t obvious, <em>PO’ed </em>belongs in the latter category.</p>
 <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="373" data-injectable="false">I hadn’t played it before. There was a copy in one of those early-PS1 cardboard longboxes in the basement of the game store I briefly ran, and I didn’t touch it. There was probably a reason it was in the basement (my guess is disc rot), and I wasn’t <em>that</em> curious. However, reviews at the time of its release weren’t <em>terrible</em>. Though, they probably should have been.</p> <figure data-current-count="673" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="203" data-current-count="203" data-injectable="false"><strong><strong><strong>PO’ed: Definitive Edition (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2697470/POed_Definitive_Edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a> [Reviewed], <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/poed-definitive-edition-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0913-PPSA22307_00-0180316664507147" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS4</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0913-PPSA22307_00-0180316664507147" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/poed-definitive-edition/9pcg4c64qh9f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox One</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/poed-definitive-edition/9pcg4c64qh9f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Series X|S</a>)<br>Developer: Any Channel</strong></strong>, Nightdive Studios<strong><strong><br>Publisher: Nightdive Studios<br>Released: May 16, 2024<br>MSRP: </strong></strong>$19.99</strong></p> <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="553" data-injectable="true"><em>PO’ed</em> has enough going for it to separate itself from the pack of FPS games that were coming out at the time. Notably, using the SlaveDriver Engine, it was much better at 3D environments, even though they were incredibly basic. It’s also a lot weirder with the default weapon being a frying pan, a chef protagonist, and walking butts for enemies.</p>
 <p data-characters="277" data-current-count="277" data-injectable="false">The story involves Ox, the protagonist, being stranded out in the furthest reaches of space where the locals are hostile. There isn’t much storytelling within the game itself, so it’s not too far off from many FPS games at the time, right down to the abstract environments.</p> <p data-characters="391" data-current-count="668" data-injectable="true">But the level design is a lot different than much of what you’d see at the time. Environments are often huge, open areas. Much of the time, you get around with the help of a jetpack. It’s actually rather impressive, since corridors were the main locale for a lot of ‘90s gunfights. Nevermind that a lot of the surfaces are just flat-shaded, at least we aren’t looking at dirty walls.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="PO'ed: Definitive Edition Announcement Trailer | Nightdive Studios" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0nLgTVr_JcA?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="232" data-current-count="532" data-injectable="true">Having large environments meant that the developers were delving into some unexplored territory, and while I’d argue that there’s a decent amount of talent on display in <em>PO’ed</em>, it doesn’t really coalesce in an enjoyable way.</p>
 <p data-characters="411" data-current-count="411" data-injectable="true">The goal of every level is to simply find the teleporter out of it, but they needed to make that a challenge <em>somehow</em>. Often, this means that you’re scouring through maze-like environments looking for the damned thing, but then there are others where the goal is not so clear. Sometimes you have to kill all the enemies in the area, and other times you need to activate a series of switches to make it through.</p>
 <p data-characters="500" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true">The maze-like environments are bad enough. As I said, a lot of the textures are just flat colors. This can get extremely disorienting, especially when you add <em>PO’ed’s </em>penchant for verticality. I never really got stuck, but I think that was largely just luck. However, I was often uncomfortable, and regularly very confused. Sometimes I would trip over the teleporter’s location within moments of starting a level and of the game’s three secret levels, I found two of them by complete mistake.</p>
 <p data-characters="214" data-current-count="214" data-injectable="false">I didn’t <em>want</em> to find these secret levels. The normal levels were painful enough, that I didn’t want to extend it any further. They were the first warm teleporters I found to cuddle up to, and they betrayed me.</p> <figure data-current-count="514" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="228" data-current-count="228" data-injectable="false">I found myself comparing <em>PO’ed</em> to <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/william-shatners-tekwar-is-the-technological-future-of-crap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">William Shatner’s TekWar</a></em> for much of the game’s runtime. <em>TekWar</em> also liked to experiment with open environments. But most starkly, they both have the same approach to difficulty balancing.</p> <p data-characters="381" data-current-count="609" data-injectable="true">Since many of the levels are large, open areas, this can mean a lot of enemies are constantly shooting at you from all directions. The worst are any sort of flying foe, because they are extremely difficult to hit on medium settings. Even if you stay mobile and fly around with your jetpack, you’re going to take a lot of hits. There’s not much choice to it, damage will happen.</p>
 <p data-characters="413" data-current-count="413" data-injectable="true">So, to offset this, <em>PO’ed </em>gives you a massive health bar and dumps healing items in stacks all over the place. In order to make later levels more difficult, they just reduce how many stacks of health kits they provide. I mean, that works, it’s just the least well-thought-out and elegant way to do it. It also means that the screen flashes a lot and your dude keeps grunting. It’s not a very fun experience.</p>
 <p data-characters="177" data-current-count="177" data-injectable="false">Speaking of sounds, there’s barely any music. I had to check to make sure it wasn’t just a bug that prevented music from playing during levels, but there really isn’t any.</p> <figure data-current-count="477" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="263" data-current-count="263" data-injectable="false">The <em>Definitive Edition</em> is inarguably the best way to experience <em>PO’ed</em>. Its transition to the KEX Engine means it’s capable of higher resolutions and interpolation to smooth out movement. It also means mouse-look, which wasn’t possible on the 3DO or PS1.</p> <p data-characters="397" data-current-count="660" data-injectable="true">Nightdive did a decent job of upgrading <em>PO’ed</em>. They didn’t go all the way with it like they did with some previous titles. I asked Director of Business Development Larry Kuperman if they updated the art in any way. “Yes, to the art,” he said. “Tweaked more than redone.” He also said, “Not sure I want to compare what we did for <em>PO’ed</em> to anything close to <em>Dark Forces</em>, Zoey.”</p>
 <p data-characters="446" data-current-count="446" data-injectable="true">So, in comparison to the <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-star-wars-dark-forces-remaster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars: Dark Forces</a></em> remaster, it’s not quite as overhauled. Enemy sprites are still low-resolution mashes of pixels. There weren’t really any cutscenes to redo, either. It’s largely “just” a source port, but it still does wonders for the game. But considering that <em>PO’ed</em> isn’t a guaranteed seller like a game with the <em>Star Wars </em>name on it, it’s not surprising they didn’t give it a complete facelift.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="369" data-current-count="669" data-injectable="true">The best thing I can say about <em>PO’ed</em> is that it can be completed in around three hours. Aside from that, I really didn’t enjoy it. It’s not the worst FPS I’ve played. For all its problems, it at least isn’t bland. It has its high points, demonstrates a capable development team with a willingness to experiment, it just didn’t result in a fun final product.</p>
 <p data-characters="518" data-current-count="518" data-injectable="true">I also must commend Nightdive Studios for having the guts to remaster a game that can’t even claim a cult following. <em>PO’ed</em> isn’t notoriously bad, but it would probably be better if it was. I’m not sure I’ve ever heard it come up in conversation. I might never have played it had it not been for Nightdive, and for that, I’m grateful in a very strange way. Even if a game is obscure or outright bad, I always love seeing them get dusted off and restored to working order. I just never want to play it again.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/stardew-valley-concernedape-haunted-chocolatier-interview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The lights temporarily brighten on the stage of The Town Hall, a historic New York City venue, and a crowd of over 1,000 people hushes into anticipatory silence. The conductor of the orchestra has just announced that a special guest is in the building. Moments later, <em>Stardew Valley</em> creator Eric “ConcernedApe” Barone, clad in dark slacks, a yellow shirt, and a plain jacket, takes the stage. The audience goes absolutely bananas. You’d be forgiven for thinking, even after taking in nearly an hour of beautifully-performed music, that the <em>real </em>rockstar has finally arrived.</p><p>This was the scene earlier this year at the New York City stop of Stardew Valley: Festival of Seasons, a worldwide tour featuring orchestral renditions of <em>Stardew Valley</em> songs. Originally released in 2016, <em>Stardew Valley</em> is no longer just a game. It’s an institution, a cozy-game genre progenitor that continues to grow via both community efforts and official updates from Barone, who – despite embarking on a new project in <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Haunted Chocolatier</em></a> – cannot bear to part with it. It’s also more than just a game. There’s now <em>Stardew Valley</em> merchandise, the aforementioned tour, a board game, and as of this week, <a href="https://stardewvalleycookbook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an official cookbook</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Though <em>Stardew Valley</em> did not invent the farming genre – and obviously took a lot of inspiration from <em>Harvest Moon</em> – it certainly triggered the avalanche of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games-like-stardew-valley-the-best-farming-games-on-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">similar farming games that followed</a>. On top of that, numerous games have farming and other life sim elements in them now, regardless of genre. <em>Palworld </em>and <em>Hades 2</em> immediately spring to mind, and that’s just from the past few months. <em>Stardew Valley</em>’s popularity, meanwhile, is enduring, with sales <a href="https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1762195335936627147" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hitting the 30 million mark</a> in February just before the release of the rabidly-anticipated 1.6 patch in March.</p><figure><figcaption>Stardew Valley: Festival of Seasons</figcaption></figure><p>Barone, in turn, has become a singular figure in the world of video games. Once a (largely) solo developer kept afloat by his girlfriend and propelled forward by little more than an ambitious dream, he’s now the captain of a vastly larger and more recognizable ship than the one he started out in. He wrestles with this. On one hand, he appreciates all the praise. He recognizes that people have connected to <em>Stardew Valley</em>’s world and characters on a very deep level. That means everything to him.</p><p>"There's certain aspects to <em>Stardew Valley</em> now that are inextricable from the community that's formed around it,” Barone told Aftermath. “How everyone feels about all the different characters and the interpretations [of them]. … To be in the same room with all of these souls [at the concert], it's a special feeling. It's a reminder that my work does impact real people."</p><p>On the other hand, he doesn’t view himself as that big of a deal, even if fans do.</p><p>"I'm just a dude that made a game,” Barone said. “I was just making the game I wanted to play. What I would say is, I was tapping into a certain zeitgeist that I wasn't aware of, or conscious of, but I wasn't the only one who was feeling that way. We wanted to play games that were a little bit different. ... I think if I hadn't done it, someone else probably would have in a similar timeframe."&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>To be in the same room with all of these souls, it's a special feeling. It's a reminder that my work does impact real people.</p></blockquote></figure><p>On stage at The Town Hall, Barone ran through <a href="https://twitter.com/Vahn16/status/1763416421168533802" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a joke-y version of his origin story</a>. He used to make music that nobody wanted to listen to, he said, but “after many years of failure, I finally discovered the secret: all I had to do was develop an entire video game from scratch, and then you guys would finally listen to my music.” The audience ate it up, laughing and cheering in response.</p><p>There was a kernel of truth to the bit, though. "I wanted to make music and somehow have a career making music,” he explained to Aftermath. “I would have been happy with any form that took, but when I was in high school, my original dream was to be in a band and go on tour and play shows. Little dingy venues – that would have been awesome. But I quickly realized that's not an easy thing to materialize. So then I shifted into electronic music, and I would have been happy if I could have been successful just online doing that. But that also didn't work out. So eventually, I finally got the music out by making a video game. I'm happy now because I still get to make music and have it be part of something that people are interested in and want to listen to."</p><figure><figcaption>Stardew Valley: Festival of Seasons</figcaption></figure><p>Now Barone has many more eyes on him than he ever would’ve amassed playing in a band, but it’s a different kind of fame. Barone does his best to entertain his followers inside the game and out – especially online, where he continues to personally keep them abreast of what’s coming next, something many developers who’ve sold even a fraction of 30 million copies would’ve handed off to somebody else by now. To him, entertaining is just part of the job, whether on stage or on Twitter.</p><p>"It's just yet another aspect of game development. I've always had kind of a scrappy 'If someone else can do it, why not me' type of approach," Barone said. "I kind of see myself as an entertainer. … I feel a pressure to have a presence because there's a million people who decided to follow me. I don't want to just do nothing, you know?”</p><p>But Barone’s hands-on approach to all aspects of <em>Stardew Valley </em>stems from far more than mere obligation. The game began as an extremely personal solo project, and even though it’s grown into a millions-selling multimedia behemoth, he still feels intimately connected to it.</p><p>“I feel responsible for any issues that people have, or if anyone doesn't enjoy the game or has a bad time,” he said. “It's not only with <em>Stardew Valley</em>, but anything related to <em>Stardew Valley</em>: the merchandise, the board game, the concert – anything like that. It's weird because <em>Stardew </em>has grown into something beyond me, but at the same time, I still feel very personally responsible for the brand and the concept of <em>Stardew Valley</em>."&nbsp;</p><p>This, in a way, is how the game’s 1.6 update came about. Barone now works with a team on <em>Stardew Valley</em>’s more technical aspects, and he wanted 1.6 to focus on technical tweaks and nothing more. But then he began to dread what fans might think if he didn’t go all out on yet another update. So he paused work on <em>Haunted Chocolatier</em>, his long-awaited but still mysterious second game, to return to <em>Stardew Valley</em>.</p><p>“It wasn't something that was necessarily planned,” Barone said. “I was like 'I can't just release a technical update, because if I say there's a new <em>Stardew Valley</em> update, and there's literally no new content, I feel like people will be disappointed.' So at first it was just the Desert Festival, but I have this problem where once I start, I can't stop. I'm thinking 'Oh, this isn't enough. It'd be really cool to add this. I would love to add this.'”</p><figure><blockquote><p>I feel responsible for any issues that people have, or if anyone doesn't enjoy the game or has a bad time. It's not only with <em>Stardew Valley</em>, but anything related to <em>Stardew Valley</em>: the merchandise, the board game, the concert – anything like that.</p></blockquote></figure><p>In these moments, Barone isn’t just motivated by a fear of letting down <em>Stardew</em>’s devoted legions. He’s also keenly aware of the impact the game has had on some players’ lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“Once I reopen the book on <em>Stardew</em>, I always have a hard time closing it again because I always want to add more things, make it better, make it cooler, make people happy,” Barone said. “It's exciting. Every single thing I'm adding, I'm thinking about how people are going to play this and talk about it and love it. It's gonna be part of their experience. It could make a memory that they might cherish forever. That's a special thing. It's hard for me to not want to do that.”</p><p>That’s not to say Barone is trapped in an eternal, unchanging loop of returning to <em>Stardew Valley</em>. Version 1.6 was the first time he allowed somebody else to leave their fingerprints on the game’s content – its art, especially – and not just technical and programming elements. Barone added a longtime <em>Stardew Valley</em> modder who goes by the handle FlashShifter to the team <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/how-a-stolen-car-led-the-creator-of-mega-mod-stardew-valley-expanded-to-every-modders-dream-of-working-with-eric-barone-on-update-16/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">after the latter’s car was stolen</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"He had his car stolen, so he was in a bad situation,” said Barone. “He was like 'Hey, do you want to meet up and get lunch? I'd like to ask you something.’ He was wondering if I would take him on to do some work for <em>Stardew Valley</em>. At the time I was neck deep in working on 1.6 stuff, so I was like 'OK yeah, why not?' … He's studied <em>Stardew Valley</em>'s art style so his mod would seamlessly integrate and look like it fit in <em>Stardew Valley</em>'s world. I feel like he's one of the few people on Earth who really knows how to draw stuff in the exact <em>Stardew Valley</em> art style, which is kind of a specialized skill.”</p><figure><figcaption>FlashShifter</figcaption></figure><p>Barone is uncertain where he wants to go from here. For now he’s working on making sure that 1.6 is bug-free and available on as many platforms as possible, but afterwards he’ll have to make up his mind about a particularly bothersome fork in the road. There is of course the option to let <em>Stardew Valley</em> lie dormant while he completes version 1.0 of <em>Haunted Chocolatier</em>, but he also ended up assembling a “cool team” to get 1.6 across the finish line. Perhaps, he figures, they could keep expanding <em>Stardew Valley </em>in his absence. Well, within limits.&nbsp;</p><p>“It would probably be difficult, and it would probably inevitably mean that I would not focus on <em>Haunted Chocolatier</em> because I would feel like I want to weigh in on and contribute to stuff,” he said of letting the team take the wheel on <em>Stardew Valley</em>. “I have some ideas for things that can be done for <em>Stardew Valley</em> that are less content creation and more technical in nature – more straightforward.”</p><p>Potential (though not set in stone) examples include additional maps for the game’s mines, a new farm type, or a new monster. “It's not like coming up with whole new characters and events and stuff like that,” Barone said. “That's the stuff I feel like I 100 percent have to be doing."&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>I don't feel like I owe anyone anything when it comes to<em> Haunted Chocolatier</em>. It's a game that I'm deciding to make. I don't need to make it.</p></blockquote></figure><p>He does want to get back to <em>Haunted Chocolatier</em>, though – not because he feels like expectant fans are breathing down his neck, but because, as with <em>Stardew Valley</em>, this one’s personal.&nbsp;</p><p>"[Fan expectation] definitely puts pressure on me,” he said, “but it's better to have a delayed game that's actually good than a bad game that's on time. When it's ready, that's when I'll release it. I'm not too concerned with the pressure. I don't feel like I owe anyone anything when it comes to<em> Haunted Chocolatier</em>. It's a game that I'm deciding to make. I don't need to make it."</p><p>At this point, Barone doesn’t really <em>need </em>to do anything. <em>Stardew Valley</em> has sold more copies than most developers – indie or triple-A – could ever hope. And while he’s living better than he was when <em>Stardew Valley</em> was just a sprout peeking out of the soil, he says he hasn’t done anything “extravagant.” That’s by design. Barone just wants to keep doing things the way he always has.</p><p>“Before making <em>Stardew Valley</em>, I spent all day hunched over the computer,” he said. “I still spend all day hunched over the computer. … My goal in life isn't about making money. I want to create things and share them with the world. That's what it's all about. That's what I'm doing. That's what I will do, regardless of any other circumstances, as long as I can financially support myself to be able to do that. If I couldn't, I would get a job and spend my free time creating stuff to try to get back to doing that."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
