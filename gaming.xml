			<p>The next game directed by <strong>Cory Barlog</strong>, the Game Director behind 2007's <strong>God of War II</strong> and 2018's <strong>God of War</strong>, wasn't shown at the <a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February 2026 State of Play</a>. However, according to two of the most reliable insiders, it is targeting a <strong>Summer reveal</strong> ahead of a <strong>tentative 2027 release</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>NatetheHate</strong> <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2022409747539071233?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted as much on X</a>, while adding that he will probably be able to share more information about the project in the future:</p>



<p><em>Cory is working on his own project and it remains unannounced. I'll share more when I can. We will hear about it before 2027. My expectation is around Summer.</em> <em>Unless a major delay happens, the game will be out in 2027.</em></p>



<p>Another renowned insider, <strong>Shinobi602</strong>, <strong>corroborated this </strong>on the ResetEra gaming board, where someone surmised that Cory Barlog's game might be targeting 2028 while a smaller team prepares for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-god-of-war-trilogy-remake-is-in-development-while-god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-launches-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">freshly announced <strong>God of War remake trilogy</strong></a>. However, the insider <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot49-hunters-gathering-on-tau-ceti.1433161/page-22#post-151277215" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replied</a>:</p>



<p><em>Not that far (barring any delays, of course).</em> <em>Like I said, given the quarter they're targeting, I do expect that [it will be announced this year]. Probably May State of Play or the summer Keighleys (SGF). As of now, I don't know yet. If not by then, then they've either pushed the release out further or doing a shorter reveal to release.</em></p>



<p>In September 2021, Cory Barlog <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-not-directed-cory-barlog-atreus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> he wouldn't direct <strong>God of War Ragnarök</strong>, leaving that role to <strong>Eric Williams</strong>. He was still credited as Creative Director and Producer for that game, but he also began working on another game that, <strong>several years later, remains shrouded in secrecy</strong>. There have been rumors that it could take place in a sci-fi setting, but it's nothing solid.</p>



<p>The only solid rumor came in July 2025 from Bloomberg's <strong>Jason Schreier</strong>, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-santa-monica-cory-barlog-new-game-going-well-potentially-not-new-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that <strong>the project was going well</strong> and that while it is not technically a new intellectual property, <strong>it might feel like it</strong>. This appears to be a hint that Barlog and his team at Sony Santa Monica are <strong>possibly working on a PlayStation IP that is being revived</strong> after a long slumber. If the insiders are correct, we're only a few months away from the announcement, anyway. Stay tuned.</p>

<p>"What David and Alexandre bring to Dead by Daylight is a rare balance of character driven storytelling and relentless genre intensity," said Jason Blum, Blumhouse's founder and CEO.</p>
<p>"Drawing from survival horror and psychological terror, their work establishes a world where fear is not just experienced, but earned. It is a cinematic blueprint designed to attract a director who can elevate that vision through performance and scale."</p>
<p>Behaviour seem similarly happy with the writers, too.</p>
<p>"Alexandre and David are two modern masters of horror, and their script celebrates a dark distinction, Dead by Daylight is a game, its world is a nightmare," added Stephen Mulrooney, producer and Behaviour's chief product officer.</p>
<p>"We look forward to working with a director who appreciates the depth of their story, and cannot wait to see their visceral vision brought to life."</p>
<p>We found out that Blumhouse - the horror-focused movie production company behind the likes of Paranormal Activity, Sinister, Insidious, and Get Out - had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blumhouse-is-turning-dead-by-daylight-into-a-movie">plans to adapt Dead by Daylight into a film back in 2023</a>.</p>
<p>The project is being developed in conjunction with Dead by Daylight studio Behaviour Interactive and Atomic Monster (the production company run by prominent horror director James Wan), with the latter calling the game's "incredible environment teeming with atmosphere and terrifying villains...perfect for a scary cinematic adaptation".</p><p>Dead by Daylight launched its asymmetrical multiplayer horror - which sees four survivors attempting to escape a powerful killer - back in 2016, and the game's been played by over 50 million people since then and features some of cinema's most iconic horror villains, including Halloween's Michael Myers, Nightmare on Elm Street's Freddy Krueger, Texas Chainsaw Massacre's Leatherface, Saw's Amanda Young, and Scream's Ghost Face.</p>

            <p>Hideki Sato, the designer of most Sega home consoles, has allegedly died.</p>
<p>As announced by Sega history zine Beep21, Sato – known as the "father of Sega hardware" – reportedly died on Thursday, 13th February. He was in his late seventies (some sources put <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/allcityslopshop.com/post/3met6tgjqg22b">him at 77</a>, <a href="https://segaretro.org/Hideki_Sato">others 75</a>).</p>
<p>"Known as the Father of Sega Hardware, Mr. Hideki Sato passed away yesterday," Beep21 announced, as translated via machine. "He was truly a great figure who shaped Japanese gaming history and captivated Sega fans all around the world.</p>
<p>"The excitement and pioneering spirit of that era will remain forever in the hearts and memories of countless fans, for all eternity. Rest in peace."</p> <div>

<p>Sato joined Sega in 1971, led the research and development department in the early 1990s, and served briefly as president at Sega in the early 2000s. He and his team developed most of its hardware systems from the SG-1000 to the Dreamcast, including its arcade machines, until he left the company in 2008.</p><p>"[Our home consoles] sold so well, we started to get stars in our eyes, thinking we might sell half a million!" Sato said, recounting his time at Sega with <a href="https://shmuplations.com/segahistory/">Famitsu</a>, and archived at <a href="https://shmuplations.com/segahistory/">shmplations</a>. "It was a scale completely incomparable with our arcade board sales. And that is how our entire company caught Console Fever, and threw ourselves into that side of game development.</p>
<p>"We had a feeling that before long, consumers would be appreciating video games with the same sense with which they enjoyed music; moreover, since the Megadrive was a machine that you put in front of your TV, our concept was to make it look like an audio player," he added. "So we painted the body black and put the '16BIT' lettering in a gold print. That gold printing, by the way, was very expensive. (laughs) But we really wanted to play up the fact that this was the very first 16-bit home console."</p> <div>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/rainbow-six-siege-snake-david-hayter-voice-metal-gear-trailer-2000669204</link>
            <guid>1436734</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-4-is-finally-getting-a-port-wont-be-trapped-on-ps3-2000668326"><em>Metal Gear Solid</em>‘s bandana-furrowing Snake</a> is teaming up with <em>Splinter Cell</em>‘s Sam Fisher and the rest of <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>‘s roster as the tactical shooter’s newest operator. After teasing the collaboration earlier this year, Ubisoft finally pulled back the curtain with a reveal trailer that has the two heavyweights of video game espionage bro-ing out before taking down some baddies.</p> <p>The Solid Snake Operator arrives in <em>R6 Siege</em> with Operation Silent Hunt in the new season on March 3. One of the big questions facing the crossover was whether David Hayter, the original voice of Konami’s protagonist (created by Hideo Kojima) would be returning for such a weird and unexpected side project. The new trailer reveals that the answer is “yes.” Fans are relieved but wish Sam Fisher could have been voiced by a returning Michael Ironside as well. Still not in the budget, apparently.</p>

 <p>Here’s the<em> R6 Siege</em>‘s version of Solid Snake in action:</p>  <p>The reveal trailer shows Snake doing Snake stuff like hiding around corners and taking enemies out with a silenced weapon before sending in a smoke grenade and handing out takedowns. Sam Fisher pops up at the end, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upsxB_VxWn0">two embrace <em>Predator</em>-style</a>, and Snake quips about “soldiers like us” never getting a moment’s rest as a new alert pops up on his pager.</p> <p><em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> currently has over 70 operators with Sam Fisher, codenamed “Zero,” added all the way back in 2020 as part of Operation Shadow Legacy. Outside of playable characters, the shooter’s past crossover collaborations have included everything from <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> and <em>Resident Evil</em> to <em>Tomb Raider</em> and<em> Halo</em>. It’s not <em>Fortnite</em> levels of branded content but, like the people behind all modern live-service games, <em>Siege</em>‘s developers at some point realized how much <a href="https://kotaku.com/crossover-skins-destiny-2-witcher-halo-rainbow-six-bad-1851039973">more money there is in licensed cosmetics than in-universe kits</a>.</p>

 <p>Snake’s arrival is perfectly timed to take advantage of excitement over last year’s<em> Snake Eater</em> remake and the upcoming <em>Metal Gear Solid 4</em> remaster via the <em>Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol. 2</em>, coming in August. While it’s not clear yet if Konami will ever give Snake a new adventure, the franchise is alive and well on modern platforms. The same can’t necessarily be said for <em>Splinter Cell</em>. A remake is <a href="https://kotaku.com/all-the-biggest-game-franchises-are-going-backwards-2000668403">still MIA</a> and it’s been over a decade since <em>Blacklist</em> came out.</p>

<p>New information concerning the internal hardware expectations of the next Sony PlayStation has surfaced.</p>



<p>Do not expect the next Sony PlayStation console to use only AMD’s upcoming RDNA 5 GPU. During a recent discussion on the <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-xbox-magnus-rdna-5-finalized.1693408/page-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NeoGAF forum</a>, reliable tech leaker KeplerL2 noted that the PS5’s internals are a hybrid of RDNA1 and ray tracing, and that the “PS6 isn’t full RDNA 5 either.”</p>







<h2 id="h-further-hardware-expectations-for-the-next-gen-sony-ps6">Further Hardware Expectations for the Next-Gen Sony PS6</h2>



<p>In another recent post, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-specs-playstation-handheld-impressive-memory/">Kepler claimed</a> that the PlayStation 6 could have up to 30 GB of GDDR7 memory. The often-discussed next-gen Sony handheld could also feature up to 24 GB of LPDDR5X memory. If that is the case, it would be on par with the recently released ROG Xbox Ally X.</p>



<p>The rumored handheld is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-handheld-console-will-be-dockable-its-claimed/">expected to be dockable. </a>It’s also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-portable-can-definitely-run-ps5-games-leaker-clarifies/">expected to run PS5 titles</a>. Still, it’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/portable-ps6-wont-be-as-powerful-as-ps5-its-claimed/">not expected to be as powerful</a> as the current PlayStation 5 console.</p>



<p>However, don’t expect to see the next set of PlayStation consoles on the market <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-to-release-in-2027-its-claimed/">until at least 2027.</a></p>







<p>Speaking of next-generation hardware expectations, AMD recently said that it was preparing to support a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amd-says-next-xbox-console-may-launch-next-year/" id="173908">2027 launch for the next Xbox console.</a> However, Microsoft has since said it is not committing to a hard launch date for its next hardware lineup.

              <p><i><span>Myst</span></i><span> was the first game to show the world what CD-ROMs were capable of. In the wake of its runaway success, countless new teams emerged to capture the public’s enchantment with PC multimedia, including bigwig Hollywood players. From </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg%27s_Director%27s_Chair"><span>Spielberg</span></a><span> to the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Warrior"><span>Shaw Brothers</span></a><span>, they correctly assessed that gaming would have a permanent stake in commercial entertainment, though their FMV-forward approach may have missed the mark. It made the mid-90s’ output of PC gaming a particularly interesting slice. One of the most curious bits of software came from a strange union between Time Warner Interactive and poet William S. Burroughs. It returns this weekend with an official Steam release, albeit under a bizarre new handle.</span></p> <p><span>Originally hitting shelves in 1995, </span><i><span>The Dark Eye</span></i><span> is part point-and-click adventure game, part book report. Visiting your eccentric uncle Edwin, you poke and prod around a drafty manor, uncovering salacious family affairs and playing audience to stop-motion renditions of Edgar Allan Poe’s most famous tales. Not puzzles per se, but navigating around the dreamlike estate is cryptic enough. Add in ashen claymation puppets and narration from Burroughs, whose voice itself is like a gust whirling through the rattling doors of places abandoned, and </span><i><span>The Dark Eye</span></i><span> easily secured a cult status. Like most games from Inscape (such as </span><i><span>Drowned God</span></i><span> or </span><i><span>Bad Day on the Midway</span></i><span>), it is as adored as it is difficult to find a hard copy of.</span></p>

  <p><span>This weekend, GMedia brings about an official Steam release of the gothic gem. Running off ScummVM, GMedia promises an authentic experience. With one noticeable change: the game has been renamed as ‘</span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4289030/Edgar_Allan_Poes_Interactive_Horror_1995_Edition/"><i><span>Edgar Allan Poe’s Interactive Horror: 1995 Edition</span></i></a><i><span>.</span></i></p> <p><span>Why they’d deke around the original title is no mystery. “</span><a href="https://ulisses-us.com/games/tde/"><i><span>The Dark Eye</span></i></a><i><span>“</span></i><span> is trademarked by a long-running and immensely successful German tabletop RPG of the same name. That </span><i><span>Dark Eye</span></i><span> has numerous licensed video games, including a couple from Daedalic Entertainment on Steam. The real intrigue is why GMedia would settle on </span><i><span>this </span></i><span>name in particular. Could have called it <em>Poe’s Dark Mind</em>, <em>The Tell-Tale Heart: A Telltale Games Series</em> or <em>The Cask of A-Supermario</em>. SEO-friendly or not, it’d be nice to say a title ten times fast without becoming the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gzd11GMBONg"><span>Micro Machines guy</span></a><span>.</span><span><br> </span></p>

 <p><i><span>The Dark Eye</span></i><span>’s resurrection is part of an altogether pleasant trend. A surge of oddball bygone PC games have been made more accessible lately through fan translations, patches and even official Steam releases. Only four years ago, Tomomi Sakuba’s notoriously menacing </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1946430/Garage_Bad_Dream_Adventure/"><i><span>Garage: Bad Dream Adventure</span></i></a><span> reemerged on modern hardware with quality-of-life features and multiple new translations.</span></p>

            <guid>1436707</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft has unveiled the full Rainbow Six Year 11 roadmap during the Six Invitational in Paris. On one of the grandest stages in the esports landscape, Ubisoft uncovered the next year of Rainbow Six Siege content, and things are looking great.</p>



<p>The breakdown started with a new trailer that revealed the death of Phobos. From there, the team talked about Ranked 3.0, balancing changes that will update how players enjoy the game (looking first at entry and roaming, and the new cadence with seasonal updates.</p>



<p>Check out everything you need to know below.</p>







<h2 id="h-rainbow-six-siege-year-11-roadmap-is-more-siege-more-often">Rainbow Six Siege Year 11 Roadmap is ‘More Siege, More Often’</h2>



<p>The running theme of Rainbow Six Siege’s Year 11 roadmap is, according to Ubisoft, ‘more Siege, more often’.</p>



<p>That all begins with a hefty array of new seasons coming to the game over the next 12 months. For some reason, the team started by detailing <strong>season four</strong>, dropping at the end of the year.</p>



<p>This update will be all about <strong>teamplay</strong>, and to accommodate better collaboration, a new <strong>social hub </strong>will be implemented. A new ‘testing grounds’ playlist will also drop in season four, with Ubisoft monitoring feedback and seeing what needs to change before Year 12 kicks off.</p>



<p>Towards the end of Year 11, a new strategic option is coming to the test area in the form of <strong>half reinforcements</strong>:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In Y11S4, the Hostage mechanic is also going to get a major rework. Additionally, The Grand Larceny, a limited-time event not seen for almost <strong>six years</strong>, is coming back.</p>



<p>Players will be able to prove their expertise with specific Operators in Y11S4, too, leaning on Operator Mastery tiers. As the team said, this gives your time with these characters ‘more meaning’.</p>



<p>Y11S3, which will drop <strong>before season four</strong> (obviously), introduces a new Defender with a brilliant counter for shield users, codename: <strong>Firework</strong>. The small teaser we got for the unnamed character revealed a gadget that can punch clean through shields.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In Y11S2, the in-game esports tab is getting a huge update, allowing fans of the competitive scene to better connect with and follow their favourite competitors.</p>



<p>This season will also welcome a new Rainbow Six Siege map, pulled straight from Rainbow Six Vegas – <strong>Calypso Casino</strong>. It’s a ‘tribute to the amazing Vegas games from Rainbow’s past,’ said Alex Kaparzis, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-creative-director-stepping-down/" id="173856">former Creative Director of the game</a>.</p>



<p>Y11S2 will also yield a remaster for Dokkaebi, giving her a ‘more personal and targeted approach’ as well as a new primary weapon to broaden her arsenal. It was stressed that the weapon won’t be locked behind a battle pass but will be available to all users when it drops.</p>



<p>But what about what comes in the first season of Year 11?</p>



<h2 id="h-year-11-season-1-welcomes-a-recognisable-face">Year 11 Season 1 Welcomes a Recognisable Face</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/solid-snake-rainbow-six-siege-revealed/">Y11S1 welcomes Solid Snake</a>, the protagonist of the <strong>older </strong>Metal Gear Solid games. He’ll be joining Zero as a new Operator, and he’s coming on board with a standalone story to set him up nicely in the universe.</p>



<p>The first season of Year 11 is themed almost entirely around Metal Gear. There’s a new event named [REDACTED] that brings MGS-themed skins and a limited-time 4v4 mode, a string of cosmetics coming in the battle pass, and, of course, Solid Snake himself.</p>



<p>He’s coming in as a one-health, three-speed Operator with unique voice lines, a new gadget, and a sweet loadout.</p>



<p>The first season, Operation Silent Hunt, launches on March 3rd. It’s set to welcome modernized maps, a 1v1 arcade mode, and a huge balancing overhaul, amongst other things.</p>



<p>For your information and perusal, here’s the full Rainbow Six Siege Year 11 roadmap:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft has revealed that Solid Snake is coming to Rainbow Six Siege in Y11S1, a season dubbed ‘Operation Silent Hunt’. He’s coming into the game as a <strong>permanent Operator </strong>and has unique, new voice lines recorded by the iconic David Hayter. He’s coming to the Rainbow Six world with unique gadgets, weapons, and an immense aura.</p>



<p>During the Six Invitational in Paris, France, Ubisoft debuted a short trailer that saw Solid Snake welcomed to the franchise by none other than Sam Fisher. The team went on to reveal that Konami has provided iconic sounds from the Metal Gear series for his arrival in Rainbow Six.</p>







<h2 id="h-solid-snake-is-rainbow-six-siege-s-new-operator">Solid Snake is Rainbow Six Siege’s New Operator</h2>



<p>The short trailer that was revealed to unveil Solid Snake went down like a storm at the Six Invitational in Paris. Towards the end of January, it was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-rainbow-six-siege/">Solid Snake would be coming</a> to the game as a new Operator by dataminers, which prompted many to fully expect a full reveal at the Six Invitational.</p>



<p>And here it is:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Solid Snake will be a one-health, three-speed Operator, which means he can’t take a hell of a lot of damage, but he’s fast, which is what you’d expect from one of the stealthiest heroes from the gaming world.</p>



<p>His loadout is already iconic and features the F2 assault rifle, the PMR90A2 battle rifle, and the TACIT .45, a powerful and suppressed handgun. His OSP Pouch gadget provides a unique radar and early warning system, which is where the sounds iconic from the Metal Gear series come from.</p>



<p>To welcome Solid Snake to the game, a new event has been set up for Y11S1, now one of the most highly anticipated seasons in recent years. It’s called [REDACTED], and it sees some of the most recognizable characters from the Metal Gear franchise surface as skins in an exclusive 4v4 mode.</p>



<p>And of course, a stack of battle pass cosmetics is coming too:</p>

            <p>TT Games has revised its PC specs for Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight downward after initially recommending at least 32GB of RAM.</p>
<p>In January, TT revealed that players hoping to join the Caped Crusader on PC would require a "recommended" spec of 32GB of RAM and 16GB as a bare minimum.</p>

<p>By comparison, <a href="https://x.com/JakeTheL3mur/status/2012737400544350217">as pointed out by numerous unhappy players</a>, 2022's Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga demanded only 8GB RAM – and that's for recommended, too, not just as a minimum.</p>
<p>In a brief <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2215200/view/509605417596223740">statement</a> posted to Steam, the team now says: "As part of our ongoing testing for LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight on PC, we have revised our recommended hardware specifications from 32 GB RAM down to 16 GB RAM" (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-pc-ram-requirement/">TheGamer</a>).</p><p>To be clear, 16GB RAM is still a hefty ask for some, especially given the well-documented difficulties and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/memory/more-ram-misery-the-bad-news-keeps-coming-as-analyst-firm-warns-of-an-unprecedented-and-record-breaking-surge-with-price-hikes">"unprecedented record-breaking surge"</a> that has seen RAM prices nearly double in the first six weeks of 2026 compared to the last quarter of 2025.</p>
<p>It did, however, ask us to "please note, our PC specs at this stage are not final", but did promise to keep "continuing to optimise and make improvements as we move closer to launch", which means that recommendation could still scale up or down, depending upon that optimisation work.</p> <div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>During the unveiling of the Rainbow Six Year 11 roadmap at the Six Invitational in Paris, Ubisoft’s game leadership team revealed what’s coming next for the game.</p>



<p>In one of the most exciting revelations, fans learned that Bishop is making a return to the Rainbow Six universe. This is a fan-favourite character who hasn’t been seen in the series since Rainbow Six Vegas 2 was released in 2008. As he said in the teaser that unveiled his return, ‘Things must be bad if you’re calling me.’</p>







<h2 id="h-bishop-s-rainbow-return-is-imminent">Bishop’s Rainbow Return is Imminent</h2>



<p>In 2008, Bishop was last seen in Rainbow Six Vegas 2, serving the all-important role as protagonist. While Bishop could have been either male or female <strong>back then</strong>, Ubisoft has confirmed that the character’s return will be solely focused on the male variant.</p>



<p>When the events of Rainbow Six Vegas 2 had wrapped up, Bishop was sent to be the Deputy Director of Rainbow, but then the character faded out of the universe.</p>



<p>This year, Bishop is coming back, resurfacing after almost twenty years away from the franchise. Rainbow Six Vegas 2 is often considered one of the gems of the franchise, having launched way back in 2008.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Bishop has changed a little since 2008, that’s for sure.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Over the years, fans of the series have wondered <strong>why </strong>Ubisoft doesn’t bring back Bishop as an Operator or some kind of starring character, and now those questions have been answered.</p>







<p>Are you excited to see Bishop returning to Rainbow Six with Year 11 of Siege? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <guid>1436659</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s time for a whole new week, and that means seven fresh NYT Connections challenges are waiting to be dominated. Hopefully, you can start as you mean to go on with a big win from today’s NYT Connections puzzle. That’s why I’m here, actually! I’m here to bring you the best NYT Connections hints and solutions for this challenge.</p>



<p>If you want the fastest and clearest tips for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, just read on.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-nyt-connections">How to Play NYT Connections</h2>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words can have double meanings, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty, from least to most.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-february-16">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (February 16)</h2>



<p>Here are the words from today’s NYT Connections puzzle:</p>



<ul>
<li>BUCK</li>



<li>SCREAM</li>



<li>DO</li>



<li>LAUGH</li>



<li>FAWN</li>



<li>DOE</li>



<li>FLIGHT</li>



<li>SQUAWK</li>



<li>HOOT</li>



<li>FIGHT</li>



<li>RIOT</li>



<li>DOUGH</li>



<li>FREEZE</li>



<li>CACKLE</li>



<li>DOH</li>



<li>CLUCK</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– Ways to describe something hilarious</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – Sounds the same but spelled differently</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> –<em> </em>What noises a chicken might make</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – How you respond to stress</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, February 16:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>

            <p>A playable demo for adventure brawler Scott Pilgrim EX is now available.</p>
<p>Currently only available on Steam, you'll be able to take a virtual mid-winter trip to Toronto and sample the brand-new storyline co-written by Bryan Lee O’Malley and the team at Tribute Games, as well as all-new music from Scott Pilgrim alumni, Anamanaguchi.</p>

<p>It's unclear if progress carries over, but I have reached out to Tribute for confirmation.</p>
<p>"Jump into Scott Pilgrim’s wonderfully weird version of Toronto and play through the first two quests of Scott Pilgrim EX either solo or with friends," Tribute Games teases. "Play as iconic heroes and exes from throughout the Scott Pilgrim franchise - with the demo sporting Scott Pilgrim, Ramona Flowers, Lucas Lee, and Roxy Richter from the full game’s seven character playable roster - as you bash the robots, demons and vegans that stand in your way. Each character has their own feel and moveset, so don’t limit yourself to just one playthrough."</p><p>Scott Pilgrim EX isn't a direct sequel to previous Scott Pilgrim stories, or at least that's what creator Bryan Lee O'Malley <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ScottPilgrim/comments/1lbjf5n/scott_pilgrim_ex_is_not_a_direct_sequel_to_any/">said last year</a> when asked by confused fans. The new adventure starts when the members of the Sex Bob-omb band are kidnapped "as the city (of Toronto) is terrorized by demons, vegans, and robots". Scott Pilgrim and Ramona Flowers, plus five allies, lead the effort to save the musicians and the city.</p>
<p>Scott Pilgrim EX will initially release as a digital-only game on 3rd March for Nintendo Switch, PC (Steam), PS4/5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>

		<p>Star Wars Outlaws is a cosy game? I’m sure you may be sat there thinking what are you talking about? After all Star Wars Outlaws follows Kay Vess, Nix, and ND-5 as they complete contracts for criminal syndicates while also working towards pulling off a major heist. Not to mention the masses of gun and space battles against the criminal syndicates, pirates, and the Empire. That all sounds as far from cosy as you can get, doesn’t it?</p>

<p>Yet I will stand by my position that Star Wars Outlaws is also a cosy game at its heart. The term cosy game will probably bring images to mind of games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> or <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>, where you can live the life of a farmer or spend time decorating your home and just hanging out with friends without a care in the world. Star Wars Outlaws doesn’t let you become a moisture farmer on Tatooine or set up a small shop on Toshara, but it does provide other ways to be cosy.</p>


<p>First and foremost is treasure hunting. Getting on Kay’s speeder and just striking out into the worlds to explore places that are off the beaten path to discover new secrets is one of the best things to do in Star Wars Outlaws. Sure, some treasure is guarded and will require sneaking around or getting into a firefight, but there are many more caches that just require a bit of tracking, climbing, and puzzle solving to get the goods. It is these moments when it is just Kay and Nix working together to find treasure which epitomise cosiness to me. There is no stress, you can take your time searching for the treasure, and there is no pressure to get it done. Sure, there is a bigger job out there to complete, yet these times are islands of calm. Couple that with jumping on the speeder and riding across desert of Tatooine or the open water of Akiva and you just get this sense of blissful freedom.</p>


<p>The second cost corner of Star Wars Outlaws is with its galaxy of food. Cooking and enjoying food is one of my favourite things to do, so having specific street foods to try on each planet feels like another cosy thing to do to. Walking up to a food stall, getting the food, and even playing the minigame as Kay and Nix indulge in the meal. Those moments between the two capture how joyful eating a good meal can be, and the companionship it can provide. This part of Star Wars Outlaws has clearly been designed around cosiness while rewarding that cosy moment with rewards. It is the best of both wrapped in warmth.</p>
<p>Third is jumping on the speeder and riding across desert of Tatooine or the open water of Akiva where you just get this sense of calm and freedom. The same applies to flying through space on the Trailblazer, again treasure hunting. Yes, you can get waylaid by pirates or bandits now and again while riding or flying about, but when that isn’t happening and you are just moving with no real destination in mind also has an element of cosiness to it.</p>

<p>Star Wars Outlaws may not be a typical cosy game, but I am coming up to 50 hours in the game and I have found it to be one of best ways to relax after a busy day. I certainly have some complaints about other parts of the experience, but they don’t all detract from those moments of calm and cosiness that Star Wars Outlaws can offer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Enthusiast gaming keyboard tech has made the jump to gaming mice — well, to one gaming mouse so far. The <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Flogitech-pro-x2-superstrike-lightspeed-lightweight-wireless-gaming-mouse-with-customizable-click-haptics-for-pc-mac-laptop-wireless-white%2FJ7H7ZYL6CY%2Fsku%2F6667851" rel="sponsored">$179.99 Logitech G Pro X2 Superstrike</a> is the first to feature analog sensors that use induction to register clicks faster than microswitches used in many mice.</p><p>Those sensors allow for a host of cool features beyond just lower latency. There’s a rapid trigger setting, popularized by Hall effect keyboards, that lets them quickly reset after being pressed to receive another input. The sensors in this mouse also let you customize how much you need to press each of the main buttons to send an input, requiring almost no pressure at all, a click that requires more effort (great if you’ve got an itchy trigger finger), or something in between.</p><p>One of the Superstrike’s most interesting changes is that it has haptics in place of switches under its buttons. They simulate the sound and feel of a click with surprising accuracy, and unlike tapping on an unmoving MacBook trackpad, the mouse’s main buttons move and bounce back up as you might expect them to. If their default click sensation isn’t doing it for you, you can make it more intense (at the expense of battery life), or remove it altogether for silent operation (at the expense of, well, knowing when you’ve clicked at all).</p><p>I’ve felt jaded over the years by numerous features introduced in gaming mice that claim to be more beneficial in competitive games than they feel in real-life use (shrinking weights, 8,000Hz polling rate, optical sensors did nothing for me, personally). But the Superstrike feels like the start of a big change in gaming mice, and Logitech got a lot right here, even though its design isn’t radically different from its past models.</p><p>If you’re wondering whether this mouse is for you, let me put it this way: The Superstrike, with its analog sensors and adjustable actuation distances, is far easier to recommend than a Hall effect gaming keyboard that offers the same features. The difference comes down to Logitech’s haptics; they feel like the real thing, but you can tweak the feel if you’d like to. On the other hand, Hall effect switches in keyboards have a certain feel — quiet, almost no resistance — and that can’t be changed.</p><p>I’ve been using the Superstrike for a few days for my work at <em>The Verge</em> and to play some games. Unsurprisingly, flexing its haptics and analog sensors in Google Chrome isn’t that exciting. They were fun features to tweak in <em>Deadlock</em>, however. With many, many button presses required to defeat creeps and player enemies — not to mention frequently clicking around in menus to buy upgrades — lowering both the haptics intensity and the actuation distance for the left mouse button felt right. With rapid trigger, I could more quickly get locked in to land more shots. The boost in responsiveness felt more noticeable with characters that can quickly burst automatic weapons (like Haze) than those who shoot one round of ammo at a time (like the archer Grey Talon).</p><p>I don’t envision many scenarios when I’d want to increase the actuation distance of the buttons. Although, it seems handy in extraction shooters, where your success can come down to keeping quiet at the right times. I’m prone to misfiring in games due to being nervous about making a play, so requiring more effort to click could aid me there. Regardless, it’s nice to have this flexibility afforded by the analog sensors.</p><p>I’ve watched and read a lot of coverage regarding the Superstrike since it launched, and my favorite was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYp2Yo-7bTg">Dave2D’s video</a> in which he comes to the conclusion that its lower latency and faster sensors de-aged his gaming chops, making him feel like he was in his prime again. As we age, our response time generally worsens, which explains why there are many, many young people in their teens and 20s who play games professionally, but not many who are older than that. The Superstrike is, unsurprisingly, proving to be popular with younger pros, like esports player Yigox, who <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/gaming-mice/haptic-click-sceptics-take-heed-the-logitech-superstrike-has-already-got-a-guinness-world-record/">recently used the mouse to win a Guinness World Record</a> for most clicks in a minute at 760.</p><p>The Superstrike is not a magical youth serum for gamers. It doesn’t help you with aiming or provide unfair shortcuts to success. But its features aren’t gimmicks. Assuming you’re putting in the practice to get better at games, Logitech’s new mouse with its faster, more customizable clicks might help you hang with the competition a little longer.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/879221/logitech-gpro-x2-superstrike-gaming-mouse-pc-hands-on]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bloober-team-rose-teaser-countdown">While the website had spurred all kinds of theories</a> – for instance, taking the capital letters from the word salad on the site "RemosdNeulSerorehsoOvamCeyerd" is an anagram of "Cronos", leading some to speculate that this was a teaser for DLC for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> – Bloober has marked the tenth anniversary of the horror game with confirmation of a third instalment.</p>

<p>Though entitled Layers of Fear 3, this is actually the fourth Layers of Fear game, as the original game was remade for current-gen systems in 2023.</p><figure>

<p>Bloober's been on a good run. It's already released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>, Cronos: The New Dawn, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> version of Layers of Fear called Layers of Fear: The Final Masterpiece Edition, and is also working on Silent Hill 1 Remake and Project M, a horror game published by Broken Mirror Games exclusively on Nintendo Switch.</p><p>While I loved the settings and imagery, I ultimately didn't get on with the previous sequel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/layers-of-fear-2">Layers of Fear 2</a>, labelling it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/layers-of-fear-2-eagerly-anticipated-horror-sequel-falls-flat">a slick psychological horror plagued by poor pacing and infuriating instakills</a> when I reviewed it back in 2019. I similarly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blair-witch-review-lumpy-horror-that-has-its-fair-share-of-scares">struggled with Blair Witch</a>, and though I enjoyed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-medium-review">The Medium's aesthetics and mysterious storyline</a>, its finale contains some, uh, troubling narrative choices. I have, however, very much enjoyed the team's later output, including Silent Hill 2 Remake, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">which received a rare 5/5 from me,</a> and Cronos: The New Dawn.</p>

              <p>Pick ingredients off a conveyor belt. Drag them around a plate. Try to unlock point combos and hope your incredible, edible abominations pass muster with an idiosyncratic cast of anthropomorphic guests. <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/omelet-you-cook"><em>Omelet You Cook</em></a> is a tight, simple, rewarding roguelike with more than enough personality and flare to earn a seat at the table. The only thing I want to do after I lose is fire up the grill all over again.</p> <p><em>Omelet You Cook</em> was really neat when it hit Steam Early Access in early 2025. It’s even cooler now after it’s launched in 1.0. It’s a cooking roguelike in which you select ingredients and get awarded points based on how they’re arranged on top of an omelet according to an ever more intricate cascade of scoring rules. The spatial strategizing and arrangement synergies are where the <a href="https://kotaku.com/luck-be-a-landlord-boycott-bds-xbox-israel-palenstine-indie-dev-2000654628"><em>Luck Be a Landlord</em></a> flavor comes in. Points that blaze more intensely the better you do and an in-game economy for purchasing items that bestow special perks is where the <a href="https://kotaku.com/balatro-poker-roguelike-worth-it-is-it-good-review-pc-1851283124"><em>Balatro</em></a> feel comes into play.</p>

 <p>But like the best games in this RNG triage, min-maxing roguelike genre, <em>Omelet You Cook</em> exists as something more than the sum of its parts that can’t simply be reduced to its obvious inspirations. There are elements of cozy sims and chillout puzzle games here, with unique and finicky patrons reminiscent of <em>Animal Crossing</em> villagers, each with different dietary restrictions and preferences. The emphasis on how food is positioned and empty space is managed reminds me a bit of the calming fiddliness of <em>A Little to the Left</em>.</p>  <p>This is the part where I tell you that if you tried <em>Omelet You Cook </em>last summer and liked it then, there’s a whole lot more to love now. Nearly two dozen updates and seven months later, February’s 1.0 update (released early <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/roguelike/slay-the-spire-2-pulls-a-silksong-scares-indie-devs-into-releasing-roguelike-ahead-of-schedule-in-fear-of-losing-players-to-an-absolute-juggernaut-in-our-own-genre/">to get ahead of <em>Slay the Spire 2</em></a>) includes a bunch of different modes as well as the option to do the whole game turn-based if the conveyor belt continually moving was getting too stressful. There’s a Black Apron difficulty and a final showdown with Principal Clucker himself, the chicken that roasts your chef skills every time you fail.</p>

 <p>While the combo chaos is great for math nerds and the absurd recipes are fun and silly, I think <em>Omelet You Cook</em>‘s greatest strength is its quirky animal characters and light but satisfying conversational bits. There’s a generous spirit that comes through in the hospitality work and sense of community within the game, that games like <em>Luck Be a Landlord</em> and <em>Balatro</em> don’t have. It’s slight but touching, with shades of <em>Donut County</em>. The music is delightful. The visuals are splendid. Every screen and object buzzes with vibrant energy.</p>

 <p>It took over 500 Steam reviews for <em>Omelet You Cook</em> to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cooking-roguelike-game-omelet-you-cook-has-its-perfect-steam-review-record-ruined-by-contrarian-player">get its first negative one</a>, and that was just somebody being a dick. Play it and you’ll instantly understand why.</p>
