            <p>Capcom's Pragamata has popped up on the South Korean classification board's website.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gematsu.com/post/3m5l5wetmus2z">Gematsu</a>, the "action adventure" game - which doesn't currently have a release date - has been rated as suited for players aged 12 and up due to its "mild violence".</p>

<p>Pragmata was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcoms-next-gen-project-pragamata-wont-launch-until-2022">once planned for a 2022 release</a>, having been originally revealed in 2020, and was delayed several times <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcoms-pragmata-coming-2026-developer-promises">until this summer's State of Play</a> confirmed we'll see it sometime in 2026.</p>
<p>Grasshopper Manufacture's action game Romeo is a Dead Man has also been <a href="https://www.grac.or.kr/Statistics/Popup/Pop_ReasonInfo.aspx?f0d05826089a46822d078e3eb6681337a6c813a6a053e8e5ec12581d53453bb0">rated</a>, although I don't suppose it'll come as much surprise that the "ultra-violent" title with "various weapons, frequent large amounts of blood, various expressions of bodily harm, use of vulgar profanity and vulgar language" has been rated as "not for minors". It too has yet to confirm a specific release date.</p>
<p>"The result is a fascinating mix that was only better in its more difficult and more thought-provoking proper hands-on than it was in the two previous proof-of-concept style demos," Alex wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pragmatas-unique-action-and-puzzle-blend-may-grab-the-headlines-but-as-its-creators-explain-its-secret-sauce-is-all-about-rhythm-1">Eurogamer's Pragmata preview</a>. </p>
<p>"Seeing the full 'loop' of Pragmata laid bare has cemented its place in my list of most anticipated games for 2026."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-quietly-unloads-its-t9-4tb-ssds-on-amazon-now-selling-at-a-new-all-time-low.1354609/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The ultimate luxury for anyone juggling big files&nbsp;: <strong>SSDs are faster, quieter, and far more reliable than the old-school hard drives</strong> we all grew up with. Of course, that performance usually comes with a pretty steep price. But not today: Samsung <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4947/">just dropped its sleek T9 Portable SSD 4TB to a new all‑time low of $299, down from $399 on Amazon</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4947/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Speed and Stability</h2>
<p>And that’s exactly what tech enthusiasts like most about SSDs: the speed. The T9 doesn’t just deliver: it dominates <strong>with sequential read and write speeds of up to 2,000 MB/s</strong>. That means heavy 4K videos, raw photos, or huge design projects pop up in seconds instead of minutes. For creators, gamers, and students managing several devices, it’s a serious timesaver without the dreaded transfer delays. Better yet, those speeds stay constant during long tasks-no throttling midway through some big job.</p>



<p>Inside, Samsung marries its <strong>trusted V‑NAND flash memory with a USB 3.2 Gen 2×2 interface</strong> to ensure top performance on modern hardware setups. And unlike older drives that overheat under pressure, <strong>the T9 stays really cool</strong> thanks to its Dynamic Thermal Guard. It automatically regulates temperature to prevent overheating, keeping everything stable even during hours of high‑intensity use.</p>



<p>Durability is another area where Samsung didn’t cut corners: The <strong>T9 has a rugged, textured casing</strong> that helps withstand drops and scratches, making it safe to toss into a laptop bag or camera kit. It’s built for travel, jammed workdays, and unpredictable coffee-shop setups. The design is practical yet premium, with rounded corners and a matte black finish that feels as polished as the tech inside.</p>
<p>Compatibility, meanwhile, couldn’t be easier. The <strong>T9 connects easily to Windows PCs, Macs, game consoles</strong> and even newer smartphones like the iPhone 17 Pro, which now supports direct 4K ProRes video capture directly to the drive. For content creators shooting high‑resolution footage, that alone can justify the purchase. That means no more running out of internal storage mid‑recording and no more waiting for files to move before editing begins.</p>
<p>Making long‑term ownership even smoother is the inclusion of Samsung’s <em>Magician Software</em> suite: It automatically handles firmware updates, security management, and health monitoring in the background, so that performance stays optimal without requiring manual tinkering. Encryption options keep sensitive documents protected if the drive is lost or stolen, while regular checks help to prevent data degradation over time.</p>



<p>And it’s even more exciting because<strong> Samsung is the number-one flash memory brand in the world</strong>. But still, the main reason this model gets attention right now is the price dro: Seeing a 4TB drive of this quality dip below the $300 mark is borderline unheard of. It essentially makes high‑speed, professional grade storage accessible to regular consumers.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kirby-air-riders-release-date-explained%E2%80%94exact-release-date-start-times-confirmed.1354606/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s quite fun for something like Kirby Air Riders to be coming out in 2025, and we’ve got its full release date details, as well as news on its start times and when you can properly wait for the chequered flag to drop.</p>



<p>When you think of racing games on Nintendo Switch, you default to Mario Kart, without question. You might have to rethink this impulse with the launch of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kirby-air-riders-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kirby Air Riders</a>. It’s an unexpected sequel over 20 years in the making, and Kirby has decided to take to the track after a trip through a Forbidden Kingdom.</p>







<p>For all your much-needed Kirby Air Riders release information, you’ve come to the right place.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-kirby-air-riders-coming-out">When Is Kirby Air Riders Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Bombs away. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Kirby Air Riders is expected to release on November 20, barring any last-minute delays or complications.</strong></p>



<p>Switch 2 owners can get suited up and drive off on November 20. Nintendo games are usually very reliable, where release dates due to the company’s persistence in perfection. You never know in this day and age, so brace yourself for any late red flags to interrupt your plans.</p>







<p>You can play the game early, too, through the Kirby Air Riders Global Test Ride demo. It gives you a final chance to try out the game before launch, which will likely boost the game’s sales.</p>



<p>It’s expected there won’t be much DLC, and there might not be another sequel. So, expect a very full and jam-packed Kirby Air Riders to keep you occupied for a while.</p>



<h2 id="h-kirby-air-riders-start-times">Kirby Air Riders Start Times</h2>



<p><strong>Like most Nintendo first-party games, we expect Kirby Air Riders to be added to the eShop at 7 AM PT on November 20. This is when you can download, install, and play Kirby Air Riders.</strong></p>



<p>This information comes from Nintendo itself. Again, not everything is iron-clad, and there could be some changes. We’d say to go on the assumption that the time is accurate.</p>



<p>That said, here are the Kirby Air Riders release dates and times in key regions.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Kirby Air Riders Release Times &amp; Dates</th></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">7:00 AM—November 20</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">9:00 AM—November 20</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">10:00 AM—November 20</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Grenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">3:00 PM—November 20</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">New Zealand Daylight Time (NZDT)</td><td data-align="center">4:00 AM—November 21</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

            <title><![CDATA[The Steam Machine feels like the TV gaming PC I’ve always wanted]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/818606/valve-steam-machine-tv-gaming-pc-wanted</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-steam-machine-feels-like-the-tv-gaming-pc-i%E2%80%99ve-always-wanted.1354600/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The morning of Monday, October 27th, I started my workweek by asking my colleagues at <em>The Verge </em>for advice on buying a gaming PC. I wanted a small, portable, and semi-powerful machine that could easily sit beneath my living room TV and occasionally move over to my desk to play games or even use for work. My dream was to find something as easy to use as the Steam Deck, which has become my primary gaming device due to its simplicity and massive catalog of PC games.</p><p>Just two days later, I walked into Valve’s headquarters and was introduced to the new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/818111/valve-steam-machine-hands-on-preview-specs-announcement">Steam Machine</a>, a gaming PC and console hybrid. It checked basically every box I was looking for.</p><p>The Steam Machine is a 6-inch cube that will comfortably fit into my small entertainment center in the corner of my living room and on my small office desk I’ve squeezed into the bedroom. Valve says its AMD GPU is more than six times as powerful than the Steam Deck, which should be great for me since most of my gaming time is spent playing less graphically intensive indies. It runs SteamOS, which I already love on a big screen when docking my Steam Deck.</p><p>There are some fun perks for the gadget nerd in me, too. The Steam Machine has a customizable LED bar that Valve says will be able to show you things like the status of downloads, which sounds perfect if I want to keep an eye on when I can play my next game while watching a show on a different TV input. It supports Valve’s customizable new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/815061/valve-steam-controller-hands-on-deck-frame-machine">Steam Controller</a> and has a dedicated antenna that offers a low-latency connection for up to four of the gamepads. And because the Steam Machine is a Linux PC, I can also do whatever the heck I want with it — I’m even thinking about installing Windows so I can dual-boot and play games that aren’t on Linux <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24284644/apex-legends-loses-linux-steam-deck-support-anti-cheat">due to anti-cheat</a>, like <em>Fortnite</em>.</p><p>Best of all, the Steam Machine should just work with my quickly growing collection of Steam games. The Steam Deck has totally converted me to the benefits of the Steam ecosystem, like a huge catalog of games to play, a library that follows me across devices and platforms, and cloud saves and multiplayer that aren’t gated behind a monthly fee. And because, like the Steam Deck, the Steam Machine has a microSD card slot, I’ll be able to save games to a microSD card and swap them between the two devices, almost like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/818602/valve-steam-deck-machine-frame-microsd-card-game-cartridges">a souped-up game cartridge</a>.</p><p>Prior to seeing the Steam Machine, I was weighing choices like using the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/761025/framework-desktop-bazzite-linux-steam-machine-pc-game-console-impressions">Framework Desktop</a> (promising, and a handle is an option!), getting <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop#csm3NI">a good gaming laptop</a> (the most portable, but potentially very expensive), or just sourcing parts and building the PC myself (intimidating for <s>a </s><em><s>Verge</s></em><s> reporter</s> me, a DIY newb). But these options aren’t as compelling as a first-party Steam Machine: I want something that is great for TV gaming, as reliable as my Steam Deck, and requires minimal fuss on my end — with an active toddler running around the house, time is a major commodity!</p><p>With the Steam Deck, Valve made PC gaming much more palatable to console crowds by (mostly) being something that just works. Verified games don’t need much fiddling to play great, many less-optimized games can be playable with graphics tweaks or by customizing your controls, and table stakes like a functional UI and reliable sleep and wake are all there. And it’s all wrapped up in a comfortable, ergonomic handheld. If Valve can bring that same console-like experience to a living room device, it would open up the best of PC gaming to even more people.</p><p>Valve is set to launch the Steam Machine sometime next year. It hasn’t said how much it will cost, but instead of shopping for Black Friday deals on some kind of other gaming PC, I think I’m going to save that money for the Steam Machine instead.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/818606/valve-steam-machine-tv-gaming-pc-wanted]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/poll-have-you-had-issues-with-the-ethernet-port-on-switch-2s-dock</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/poll-have-you-had-issues-with-the-ethernet-port-on-switch-2s-dock.1354582/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="61ffe6b0cd8e7"><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 Dock" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/61ffe6b0cd8e7/nintendo-switch-2-dock.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Since the introduction of the OLED model, there's been an Ethernet port built into the dock of Nintendo's flagship Switch, and that continued this year with Switch 2. If you're after the fastest download speeds or you play competitive online games while docked to your TV, you may benefit from wiring up your dock to your router directly.</p>
<p>However, since launch back in June, we've seen reports of players having issues with wired internet connections. Some point to the Realtek port as the culprit, others think it's a specific firmware or software glitch, or a USB-C-related handshake issue where something periodically goes awry. But whatever the reason, there seems to be a group for whom Switch 2's Ethernet port just isn't functioning correctly.</p>
<p>Asking around the NL office, it's blank faces, (un)fortunately. Either a wireless connection is sufficient and we haven't ever bothered wiring up the dock, or we just haven't experienced any issues.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/forums/nintendo-switch-2/ethernet_port_on_switch_2_docks_failing_for_many_people">our forums</a> and <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/some-switch-2-ethernet-docks-are-malfunctioning.14103/">the wider internet</a> are filled with people who have had issues. Some have sent their docks back to Nintendo with varying degrees of success; others have found that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1l6q47u/comment/n1rse3p">connecting their phones via a USB cable</a> somehow resets the chip and managed to get their Ethernet back up and running, if only temporarily.</p>

<p>Naturally, Nintendo has its error codes and <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68592">related pages</a>, but assuming that using a different Ethernet cable doesn't solve your problem, opening up a report ticket with Nintendo is the only option they're offering.</p>
<p>Obviously, this issue will be frustrating if it impacts you, but we're keen to get a sense of just how many people this is affecting. As with any electronic device, there'll be a percentage of failures or manufacturing faults that crop up that'll need attention, and with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/switch-2-sells-over-10-million-units-nintendo-increases-forecast-even-further">10.36 million people</a> (and counting) picking up a Switch 2 in the first few months, there are bound to be some malfunctioning units - but how widespread is the problem?</p>
<p>Let us know in the poll below if you've experienced any issues with a wired internet connection - and if / how you've solved the problem.</p>

		<p>I’ve come down with some kind of malady this weekend, presumably from all the shared spaces that I had on trains to and from Paris a few days ago. That’s making the prospect of battling through the rest of the Black Ops 7 campaign a bit of a tricky one to psyche myself up for, so I’ve booted up Metroid Prime Remastered to get into the groove ahead of Metroid Prime 4. It’s really rather good with the modern controls.</p>
<h2>In the News This Week</h2>
<p>There was a State of Play this week, which brought a bunch of trailers and announcements, but the biggest news of all came from Valve:</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-dual-port-fast-charger-pack-sells-for-peanuts-amazon-prices-each-unit-five-times-lower-than-apple-2000644466</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-dual-port-fast-charger-pack-sells-for-peanuts-amazon-prices-each-unit-five-times-lower-than-apple.1354573/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple’s official 20W USB-C charger is a $19 single-port affair that doesn’t include any cables in the box. Anker’s solution flips that equation entirely, with two chargers <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3718/">sporting dual-ports apiece, plus two included USB-C cables, all for just $12 on Amazon right now</a>. That’s down from the regular $18 price and an all-time low for this bundle. You’re essentially getting five times the charging capability for less than what Apple charges for their basic single-port adapter, and you won’t need to hunt down cables separately since Anker includes <strong>two 5-foot USB-C to USB-C cables</strong> in the package.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3718/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Dual-Port Flexibility Changes Your Charging Setup</h2>
<p>Each charger <strong>has both a USB-C and a USB-A port,</strong> each of which works simultaneously, enabling you to charge two devices from a single wall outlet. The maximum output of 20W is intelligently split when you charge two devices simultaneously, though when charging just one device through the USB-C port, you get the full 20W for fast charging speeds. This dual-port design is very convenient, especially for traveling when hotel rooms never seem to have enough outlets, or when everyone in your family has a different device that they need to charge in the same area.</p>



<p>This means the 20W of power delivery through <strong>USB-C charges an iPhone from zero to 50 percent in roughly 30 minutes</strong> – just like Apple’s own fast chargers-and it works across iPhone 15, 16 and 17 series models, iPad Pro, and other USB-C devices that support Power Delivery protocol. For comparison, it would take older 5W chargers, which used to ship with iPhones, nearly two hours to reach that same 50 percent charge level.</p>



<p>Anker designed these chargers with compact form factors that <strong>keep them from blocking adjacent outlets on power strips or wall plates</strong>. The foldable prongs on the US version further make them more travel-friendly by removing the sharp edges that can snag on clothing or scratch other items in your bag. About the size of Apple’s standard charger, these easily slip into a laptop bag, purse, or jacket pocket without adding bulk.</p>
<p>The included safety features address common charging concerns through Anker’s proprietary protection system. Overvoltage protection prevents power surges or inconsistent electrical supplies from causing any damage and thus is important during international travels or when one has to use the electrical systems of older buildings. Monitoring temperature control means this charger will not overheat during a long session and can throttle power output in case temperatures rise above safe thresholds. Short-circuit protection provides protection against wiring faults that may otherwise damage connected devices.</p>
<p>Those <strong>two included 5-foot USB-C to USB-C cables add a considerable value</strong> as quality USB-C cables usually cost $10-$15 each if you buy them separately. This 5-foot length is long enough to use your device comfortably while charging, unlike those frustratingly short 3-foot cables that make you sit right next to the outlet. These cables support the full 20W power delivery which means you are not bottlenecking the charging speed through some inferior cable.</p>
<p>That comes to $6 per complete charging setup when you buy two dual-port chargers plus two cables for $12, which is less than a third of what Apple asks for its base single-port adapter before cables. It gets even better because, with Apple, you would have to purchase the cables separately which will easily push the price tag north of $25 per charging setup if you were buying from Apple.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-day-one-steam-numbers-compare-badly-to-battlefield-6-and-arc-raiders/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-ops-7-day-one-steam-numbers-compare-badly-to-battlefield-6-and-arc-raiders.1354567/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The first full day of Black Ops 7 is behind us. Its reception has been fairly mixed so far, but one thing that’s not up for debate is how Black Ops 7 has performed on Steam, especially compared to other big-time shooters right now, such as Battlefield 6 and ARC Raiders.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7’s release means Treyarch has had back-to-back launches. Black Ops 6 was quite the success, but Black Ops 7 isn’t being as warmly received. Criticism has come its way due to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-responds-black-ops-7-ai-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI Claims</a> and the fact that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/you-cant-pause-the-black-ops-7-campaign-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can’t pause the Black Ops 7 campaign, ever</a>.</p>







<p>With so many eyes on Battlefield 6 and ARC Raiders, it’s fair to say Black Ops 7 isn’t the shooter in the spotlight like it wants to be.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-falls-way-short-of-arc-raiders-amp-battlefield-6-on-steam">Black Ops 7 Falls Way Short Of ARC Raiders &amp; Battlefield 6 On Steam</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A good start for some. Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Let’s break this down for you. According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, Battlefield hit a 24-hour release day peak of <strong>747,440 players</strong>, whereas ARC Raiders managed a more than respectable <strong>264,673</strong>.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 is part of the whole ‘Call of Duty’ banner under SteamDB, making its numbers slightly inflated if anything. However, its 24-hour launch peak on November 14 hit a high of <strong>86,652 players</strong>.</p>







<p>It’s bad enough if you compare ARC Raider and Black Ops 7. When you do a direct comparison between Battlefield 6 and Black Ops 7, you need to stop the count! Worryingly for CoD, Battlefield 6 is still regularly hitting 200-250K, and ARC Raiders is growing stronger—consistently breaking 300K.</p>



<p>It’s expected that the weekend might give Black Ops 7 a boost, but it remains to be seen by how much. Even with Season 1 expected to be the biggest ever, for a franchise that regularly scoops the award for best-selling game of the year, this year might be a rude awakening for Call of Duty.</p>



<p>Have you bought Black Ops 7? Or are you on either the Battlefield 6 or ARC Raiders hype train this year?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Given the history and prestige of The Legend of Zelda, a proper movie is something that’s needed. There’s also the biggest weight of expectation imaginable on its shoulders. So, anyone desperate for details on The Legend of Zelda movie might be interested to know that the first footage has reportedly leaked.</p>



<p>In 2023, we finally learned that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-legend-of-zelda-is-finally-getting-a-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Legend of Zelda was getting a movie</a>. It received a release date soon after, but it was inevitably <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-delays-the-legend-of-zelda-live-action-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed</a>—as all things are. After wondering where the movie had gone, it was rumored that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-filming-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">movie had seemingly started filming</a> in November 2025. Not long after, secret footage surfaced.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-legend-of-zelda-movie-video-leaks-appear-online">The Legend of Zelda Movie Video Leaks Appear Online</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s a tough ask. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>Instagram account <a href="https://www.instagram.com/josh.and.pine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">josh.and.pine</a> has shared several videos supposedly showing the first The Legend of Zelda Movie set leaks.</p>



<p>The video shows Link on set (in full Green Tunic) speaking to the crew. Soon after, we cut to the actress playing Zelda—and it also reveals that she’s wearing a blue outfit closer to the Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom look. A horse is being prepared, and it’s clearly wearing a patch with the classic Zelda logo in the middle of it.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DRCDMlDDq-q/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="14"></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>If that wasn’t enough to whet your appetite, another leak from what appears to be the sme set has also been revealed. This time, it looks like an actual scene is taking place. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tonyolsenfilm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tonyolsenfilm</a> shared the other video, and it’s an extension of the first clip, only this time Zelda is briefly looking around before speaking to another Hylian.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DRCALkNk0Nl/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="14"></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>There have been some suggestions that the footage is AI. However, the action isn’t consistent with the usual AI tropes, such as scenery inconsistencies, the weird AI effect some videos have, and there aren’t any abnormal occurrences in the footage. This could also be a setup leak to promote the film and gain publicity through alleged leaks.</p>







<p>Either way, unless we hear otherwise, this does look like the first-ever The Legend of Zelda Movie footage. The costumes look good—although this incarnation of Zelda might upset some fans—and we know that filming is likely underway!</p>



<p>Let us know what you think of the videos. Are you excited to see what a full-length, live-action The Legend of Zelda Movie looks like?

            <title><![CDATA[How Long to Beat Call of Duty: Black Ops 7? Game Length And Missions List]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-campaign-length-mission-list/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-long-to-beat-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-game-length-and-missions-list.1354549/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is available to the world and, with a new game mode unlocking after completion of the campaign, it’s natural to ask about the length and how many missions there are to complete—and we have the answer.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 makes some big changes to the campaign this year, introducing four-player co-op and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-campaign-camo-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusive Camos to unlock</a>, giving players more to dig out from the experience.</p>



<p>If you’re wondering what the full length of the Black Ops 7 campaign is and want to know how many missions there are to churn through, we’ve got all the details.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-long-to-beat-call-of-duty-black-ops-7">How Long to beat Call of Duty: Black Ops 7?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Big names. Image via Activsion</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Full completion of the main story in the Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 campaign takes around five hours to complete, though this can be longer.</strong></p>



<p>If you are playing the campaign solo, completion time will be longer as progress will be harder and therefore slower. If you want to blitz through the campaign as quickly as possible, it’s highly recommended that you gather a squad to help push through the hordes of enemies more quickly.</p>



<p>Campaign completion will also take longer if you’re hunting down all of the Intel scattered in the game, or if you’re farming for the exclusive Camos. If you’re doing the latter, however, I recommend you hold off until you complete the campaign and unlock the Endgame mode.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-many-missions-in-black-ops-7-co-op-campaign">How Many Missions in Black Ops 7 Co-Op Campaign?</h2>



<p><strong>There are 11 total missions in the Black Ops 7 Co-Op Campaign, not including the Endgame mode, which you will be automatically entered into for the first time when the campaign is complete.</strong></p>



<p>Each mission is unlocked periodically, fleshing out the main story, though it’s a bit of a fever trip jumping to different locations and years, so don’t worry if you’re struggling to keep up.</p>



<p>Many of the missions begin in an open-world environment in Avalon, but there are markers to follow so you won’t get lost.</p>



<p>A full list of the missions in the Black Ops 7 campaign is below:</p>



<ol>
<li>Exposure</li>



<li>Inside</li>



<li>Distortion</li>



<li>Escalation</li>



<li>Disruption</li>



<li>Collapse</li>



<li>Fracture</li>



<li>Quarantine</li>

<figure data-uuid="1752ef6450e0d"><a title="The Legend of Zelda" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1752ef6450e0d/the-legend-of-zelda.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>If you can turn your attention away from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-release-date-cast-trailers-everything-we-know-so-far"><strong>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong></a> for one moment, it seems we might have the very first leak from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/legend-of-zelda-movie-release-date-cast-everything-we-know-about-the-live-action-zelda-film"><strong>The Legend of Zelda Movie</strong></a> set.</p>
<p>While very little has been revealed about the film so far, it was confirmed earlier this month that the live-action is officially <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-is-now-in-production-in-new-zealand">"in production" in New Zealand</a>. Now, in an update this week, footage has supposedly emerged of the production, including some clips featuring cast members and the film crew.</p>
<p>This is where this rumour possibly enters <strong>spoiler territory</strong>, so if you don't want any surprises ahead of official updates, navigate away from this page now. Right, with the spoiler warning out of the way, the first video that's been uploaded on Instagram shows two characters in a forest, surrounded by horses (with one horse equipped with some gear featuring what looks to be the Hylian Crest).</p>

<p>The first actor is believed to be Bo Bragason as Zelda, who is dressed in an outfit that looks similar to her clothing in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a>, and the second actor (who we haven't heard about up until now) is apparently the Aussie and Tibetan actress Dichen Lachman, known for her current role in the Apple TV+ exclusive, Severance. She's also previously worked with director Wes Ball on Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes.</p>
<p>As for who she is playing? Based on the footage, fans are already convinced she'll be Impa. Long-time Zelda players will know Impa is a recurring character in the Zelda series, who has been depicted as the bodyguard and mentor of the Princess.</p>
<p>The second scene doing the rounds looks to feature an older version of the series' protagonist Link in his green tunic, which he has appeared in across multiple games, including titles such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_ocarina_of_time">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/legend_of_zelda_twilight_princess_hd">Twilight Princess</a>. The footage in this upload even shows him putting on a cloak, and some fans think his horse Epona is also on display in the other clip.</p>

<p>We'd be surprised if the original clips stay up if they are the real deal. Of course, for now, it's probably best to treat this supposed leak as a rumour, but we will say the footage certainly looks the part, and casting someone from across the ditch (<em>aka Australia</em>) would check out, given the location of the production.</p>
<p>Apart from Zelda's casting, the only other actor officially confirmed for the Legend of Zelda Movie is Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as Link. As for the story, some basic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-is-now-in-production-in-new-zealand">descriptions have popped up online</a>, but that's about it. This live-action film is currently scheduled to arrive in cinemas in <strong>May 2027</strong>, and you can find out more about it in our guide here on Nintendo Life.</p>

<p>This week has been surprisingly busy, huh? We've had a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer-reveals-rosalina-bowser-jr-and-more">brand-new trailer</a> for <strong>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong> along with confirmation that Brie Larson and Benny Safdie are joining the cast as Rosalina and Bowser Jr. We also finally received the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> trailer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/metroid-prime-4-beyond-finally-gets-the-trailer-weve-been-waiting-for">we've been waiting for</a>, while the lovely Alex has provided his thoughts on the game so far in our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/metroid-prime-4-beyond-is-great-but-i-want-to-kill-one-of-its-characters">early preview</a>.</p>

<p>Now, with that out of the way, let's see what we're getting up to this weekend...</p>
<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>Still lots of Resident Evil this weekend. I'm playing through <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_5">Resident Evil 5</a> again, which is comfortably one of my least favourite entries. It's still a good time, mind you, if only because the developers basically looked at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_4">Resident Evil 4</a> and said "hey, let's just do that again!". So the basics are solid.</p>
<p>I've been dipping back into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> recently too, and it's really quite fun. I've even grown somewhat fond of free-roam mode. Bonkers.</p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>Well, I finally bit the bullet and bought <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum</a>. I hope you’re happy. I know that I certainly won’t be, when I arrive back on Monday morning having spent 15+ hours getting overly emotionally-invested in a fictional frog wizard.</p>
<p>This game looks like it will scratch such an itch for me, so brace for ‘Jim becoming increasingly insufferable’ in the coming days.</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>The end-of-the-year release rush has begun! This will be my first time with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-2">Yakuza Kiwami 2</a> so I am quite eager to jump back into the streets of Kamurochō. Same applies for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-ball-sparking-zero">Dragon Ball Sparking! Zero</a>. Great progress last week in with both Prometheus and Chronos defeated at long last. But of course Melinöe’s journey is not over yet… and neither is Princess Zelda’s in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> where I hope to clear Chapter 4 over this weekend.</p>
<p>Game of the week is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/inazuma_eleven_victory_road">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a>. I wasn’t quite sure this would ever get out of development hell and despite the lack of physical edition I dived head-first into it. I am rather surprised with the story mode because it is everything a current gen Pokémon game should be. Of course the over-the-top “Captain Tsubasa” style football (“soccer” for our American readers in the audience) action is where its at! Well played Level-5!</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-server-capacity-tripled-for-launch/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlestate-games-has-tripled-escape-from-tarkov%E2%80%99s-server-capacity-ahead-of-1-0-release.1354528/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>One of the biggest issues that plagues Escape from Tarkov players every time there’s a new update is server queues. The game suffers under the weight of incoming players, and those same players feel that burn. From lengthy queue times to network instability, Tarkov’s servers often crumble around a wipe or new major update.</p>



<p>Battlestate Games has well and truly prepared for that ahead of the game’s 1.0 release, dropping later today. In an episode of Tarkov TV, Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio, confirmed that Escape from Tarkov’s server capacity has been <strong>tripled </strong>ahead of the release.</p>







<h2 id="h-tarkov-s-major-networking-issues-eliminated">Tarkov’s Major Networking Issues Eliminated</h2>



<p>It’s a huge time for Escape from Tarkov. The game is finally graduating from the beta state it has sat in for almost eight years, becoming a full release and landing on Steam, amongst other things. The super-sized update introduces a new map, a non-linear campaign, fresh weapons, and more than 1,000 bug fixes.</p>



<p>In the most recent episode <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/battlestategames" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">of Tarkov TV</a>, Nikita also confirmed that a huge investment has been made in the game’s server capacity and infrastructure, and that the server makeup has been <strong>tripled </strong>ahead of launch.</p>



<p>This was preceded by a tongue-in-cheek reference by Nikita that begged players not to ‘overload their servers, please.’</p>







<p>Every time a major update has hit the Escape from Tarkov ecosystem, it has led to massive server queues and instability, placated only by users inevitably drifting away because of those issues.</p>



<p>The 1.0 update of Escape from Tarkov arrives after more than a decade of development, which has seen the face of the spearhead extraction shooter evolve numerous times.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Mark Rubin Said Ubisoft Did NOT Cancel Splinter Cell to Make XDefiant]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/mark-rubin-splinter-cell-ubisoft-xdefiant/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mark-rubin-said-ubisoft-did-not-cancel-splinter-cell-to-make-xdefiant.1354525/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a recent interview, it was suggested that Ubisoft was working on a new Splinter Cell game that was canceled before it saw the light of day. This tidbit came from Nick Herman, the co-founder of AdHoc Studio, the creator of the recent title ‘Dispatch’, starring Aaron Paul. Herman stressed that he left Ubisoft after the project was canceled and opened a new studio, AdHoc, in 2018.</p>



<p>However, Mark Rubin, who is best known as the executive producer on the failed arena shooter, XDefiant, took to social media to refute claims that his team was making Splinter Cell and was ordered to pivot and focus instead on XDefiant.</p>







<h2 id="h-splinter-cell-did-not-become-xdefiant">Splinter Cell Did Not Become XDefiant</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, Mark Rubin stressed that a recent rumor published first by Bloomberg is <strong>not true</strong>. This rumor suggests that Ubisoft was working on Splinter Cell but ‘switched’ to XDefiant. Rubin categorically denies that it was the case, stating that they were working on a game for a year, but the team was ‘struggling to find the fun.’</p>



<p>He then pushed the point again that it ‘was NOT a Splinter Cell game.’</p>



<p>Here’s the <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1989545807247487122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full quote</a> from Rubin:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Saw the rumor from Bloomberg that we were working on Splinter Cell game before switching to XDefiant. I can say that is not true.</p>



<p>When I got to Ubisoft they had been working on a game for a year that was very ambitious but was struggling to find the fun. And it was NOT a Splinter Cell game. </p>



<p>I then canceled that one and let the team pitch any game ideas they wanted. There were some cool ones but I felt the scope/difficulty was too hard on some ideas so we stuck with an arena shooter and we found the fun quickly. </p>



<p>So no we didn’t pivot off Splinter Cell to make XDefiant. Now maybe they were thinking about working on Splinter Cell before I got there but it was never a thing while I was there. My experience with Ubisoft was they are very open to whatever the studio wants to do which is great but I do wish we could have used external engines.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-splinter-cell-ubisoft-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent claim from Nick Herman</a>, co-founder of AdHoc Studios, was that Ubisoft ‘stopped caring about’ the game the team was working on. Herman would leave around a year before Mark Rubin arrived in 2019.</p>







<p>Ubisoft is still working on a remake of the original Splinter Cell title, which is working with a reported release window of 2026.</p>



<p>Do you wish we’d gotten a new Splinter Cell game in the last ten years or so? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

			<p>Valve fans had a field day <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-unveils-steam-frame-steam-machine-steam-controller-launch-early-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the announcements of the Steam Frame, Steam Machine, and Steam Controller</a>, with the notable exception of those who have been pining for Half-Life 3.</p>



<p>The near-mythological third (and <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-last-entry-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supposedly final</a>) installment in the sci-fi first-person shooter franchise was still nowhere to be mentioned by Valve, but that doesn't mean it's not coming. In fact, several insiders have doubled down to reiterate that a dedicated game announcement is on its way in relatively short order.</p>



<p>What they do not quite agree on is the timing of the news. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/comments/1ox4jzk/more_hopium/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Gabe Follower</a>, a Counter-Strike 2 content creator who correctly leaked information on Deadlock (the studio's next third-person multiplayer shooter/MOBA game in early development), Half-Life 3, codenamed HLX, will still be announced before the end of the year. Another Valve insider, Tyler McVicker, who leaked some Half-Life: Alyx details, maintained <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2618496266" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a Twitch stream</a> that he expects the news to drop within the next two to three weeks.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/uwn_XYk8Is8?si=51br6QSKysH8bA3f&amp;t=2122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">On the latest episode of Insider Gaming Weekly</a>, though, the resident insiders shared a different opinion based on their own sources. Mike Straw, who previously mentioned the hardware announcements weren't all Valve had to unveil, said this particular news will not be made official during Geoff Keighley's The Game Awards 2025 event next month.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming founder and renowned leaker Tom Henderson added that he heard there's a big (currently unannounced) game coming in March. With the Steam Machine/Frame/Controller scheduled to launch in early 2026, it makes sense that Half-Life 3 would be a launch title, especially for the new Steam Machine.</p>



<p>After all, Valve publicly <a href="https://wccftech.com/bigger-game-catalogue-steam-machine-success/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> that it believes having more games will be key to the success of the Steam Machine compared to its previous iteration. While they were mainly referring to the massive Steam library, new launches of gaming platforms have benefited from having the so-called killer application since time immemorial in this industry. If Half-Life 3 were only available on Steam platforms, it'd mean the only console-like platform able to play it would be the Steam Machine, thus undoubtedly boosting its initial sales.</p>

<p>Use these Warframe monthly redeem codes for November 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Weapons, Decorations, Glyphs, and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Warframe is a popular third-person online shooter set in a different solar system known as the Origin system. Having originally been released on both PC as well as console in 2013, Warframe has since captured the imaginations of thousands of gamers, with a dedicated player community existing even today. It received ports for the latest generation of consoles in the last few years, and even got an iOS version in 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Being a fully free-to-play game, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warframes-switch-2-port-delayed-by-backlog-of-dev-kits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warframe</a> boasts solid accessibility, with the fast-paced gameplay and combat experience also being praised by passionate fans over the years. Although Warframe, like most F2P games nowadays, does offer microtransactions, all of the key elements of the game can be earned by simply playing and progressing through the various modes and events. Some cosmetic items can even be claimed for free by players, using the various redeem codes that the developers release.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A lawsuit between Bungie and writer Matthew Martineau has been settled. The case, which revolved around possible copyright violations of Destiny 2 from Martineau’s work, has been going on for around a year.</p>







<p>Destiny 2 is one of Bungie’s biggest and most recent games, released in 2017. With several expansions, the free-to-play title is still going <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-confirms-new-details-on-bungie-restructuring-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">somewhat strong</a>. However, last year, a writer named Matthew Martineau <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-being-sued-for-copyright-infringement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed a lawsuit</a> against Bungie for possible copyright infringement. His claim was that the company stole various narrative elements from his work for the Red Legion plot and The Curse of Osiris expansion. Surprisingly, the case survived Bungie’s dismissal and was on its way to court. Now, it seems it has been settled and over with.</p>

<p>Obtained by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/destiny-2-red-war-lawsuit-ends-bungie-full-settlement-author/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Game Post</a>, the lawsuit between Bungie and Matthew Martineau has been settled. The case has been dismissed and will not go to court. In a statement from the court filing, it says,</p>



<p>“The court having been advised that all parties have firmly agreed upon a compromise in this matter; it is ordered that this action be and is hereby dismissed as to all parties, without costs and without prejudice to the right, upon good cause shown, within sixty days, to reopen the action if the settlement is not consummated,” the order reads. “In addition, the court specifically retains jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement if settlement is not consummated within sixty days.”</p>



<p>However, if the settlement is not completed in 60 days, the case will go to trial. As it stands, though, a compromise has been made, and no legal action will occur. Without speculation, a settlement usually means both parties are at fault.</p>



<p>While the claims made by Matthew Martineau do seem a bit much, Bungie isn’t a stranger to copyright infringements. During the alpha of Marathon, the company was caught <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-respond-art-theft-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stealing assets</a> from artist ANTIREAL for several designs. After the controversy, the game was delayed and has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-bungie-befre-march-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yet to be released</a>.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Note: This review specifically covers the Zombies mode in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. For our thoughts on the other modes, see our </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-review"><em>campaign review</em></a><em> or our </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-review"><em>multiplayer review</em></a><em>.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite playing a new one every year, I never know what to make of modern Call of Duty – a first-person shooter so big, so successful that it is no longer a standalone game but a platform with file sizes so large it asks you to choose the other two things you’d like to have installed on your PC or console. This year’s PC release comes with a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/How_to_Enable_Secure_Boot_on_PC_for_BO7"><u>frustrating new anti-cheat</u></a> that seemingly caused my CPU fan to choose death instead, so while I would normally base my playtime on that version, as God intended, I am initially slumming it on PlayStation 5 to bring you some early impressions of this year’s Zombies mode. I still have tons left to see as the community collectively hunts for Easter eggs and solves mysteries, but so far I’m interested in digging into what’s here, even if it may take a bit to get to the vital organs underneath these bones.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zombies is my favorite part of Call of Duty, simultaneously the stupidest, silliest side thing the series has ever done and probably big enough to be a small video game in its own right. I remarked on a similar feeling in last year's review, but remember when this was a serious game series about war, and you were storming the beaches of Normandy, machine gun fire spraying sand in your face? When you died, you used to get quotes about how terrible war was from men who had lived it. Now, I play roulette on a big mystery box covered with skulls for weapons, the best of which is a ray gun, so I can shoot zombies in the face while a disembodied voice who calls himself the Warden taunts me from afar; my character quips about how said voice reminds him of his high school gym teacher. Zombies has been doing this for a while now, but I still don’t know whether to laugh or weep.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is allegedly a story here – Raul Menendez, who apparently has been alive and drinking beer on his porch for the last decade, is back and threatening to cause chaos the world over, there’s a shady security company somehow involved, and massive, violent zombie death, of course. All of it is very well-produced and so goofy that the only thing I could do was watch the introductory cutscene while emulating the face that I imagine a cow would make if you gave it cocaine, chuckle a little, and get on with it. I suppose I answered my own question there, huh?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This year’s Zombies is hard to get a handle on so far because so much of what Zombies does will come down to the community working out the new maps in the coming days and perhaps weeks. Right now, we’re all kind of bumbling about, figuring out what’s what, which is simultaneously fun and frustrating. Many of the pain points from last year remain early on – for instance, you can’t make your loadout until you hit level four, which means if Zombies is all you want to do (and for me, it is), you’re stuck with a pistol and whatever you can earn by buying stuff on the walls after you’ve dispatched enough undead. Remember when games just let you have fun from the outset instead of unlocking it?</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I still love sliding at a group of zombies and firing a shotgun until they’re paste.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Otherwise, the underpinnings of Zombies feel much the same. You’re on a map, you open up new doors and paths with currency you earn, and you’ve got Pack-a-Punch machines to upgrade your guns. There’s additional armor you can apply plastered to the walls, an Arsenal to really crank up specific aspects of your weapons, Gobblegums for a little flavor if your mouth is lonely and you want a mid-battle pick-me-up, and so on. And of course, while you’re managing all of this, the undead rise and hunger for flesh. Ghouls, man. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The gameplay here is similar to last year’s – I still love sliding at a group of zombies and firing off a shotgun until they’re just paste and all that. No, what’s new are the maps. I’ve played both maps in their round-based modes, Ashes of the Damned and Vandorn Farm (the latter seems to be a part of the former, but I haven’t reached it in the standard mode yet), and so far I prefer the farm. Ashes of the Damned seems to be home to what will be the more traditional “find the secrets to finish the map” fare, while Vandorn Farm is more of a “you’re locked in here with the undead, kid, so try not to die too much” deal.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Our run on the former ended when one of my teammates, who didn’t communicate with the rest of us, grabbed a truck and started driving it to the next objective… before he decided it might be more fun to smash into the zombies until it exploded. The rest of us spent most of the map either trying to catch up to the truck or waiting in vain to be revived after we all died. It went about as well as you’d think. I’m interested in seeing what Ashes of the Damned has to offer with a more talkative crew; right now, if you’d told me I’d hallucinated the whole thing, I’d believe you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The farm is more old-school. Zombies hang from the rafters in the big barn, the smaller one houses the Mystery Box where each of my teammates made offerings in the fleeting hope of a Ray Gun, and there was a house with a skeleton family sitting at the dinner table and a roof in desperate need of, well, more roof. It was a much more interesting map than Ashes of the Damned, and I enjoyed navigating its twists and turns, learning where everything was, and spending the in-between time killing the misbegotten horrors that were formerly people.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>As is usually the case, success will largely depend on how the maps shake out.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The problem, once again, was that we couldn’t figure out what to do yet. There was some mysterious infection growing on one of the machines that seemed to power the farm, but after we destroyed it, our objective told us to wait for it to come back. So we did, killing zombies and upping the round count. The issue is the infection never did reappear. Normally, this is a good thing. The antibiotics worked and the patient is recovering well, thank you. In this case, it meant we got to round eight, nothing happened, the four of us spent several minutes looking for any zombies we somehow missed or a way to progress, and then all three of my teammates left the game after we couldn’t figure out what came next. Hard to blame them. The farm’s cool, but I'd prefer something with some warmer colors and fewer rotting corpses, you know?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like I said, I’m never sure what to make of Call of Duty, and that extends to this year’s Zombies. It certainly plays well and you can see the absurd amount of money spent to develop it on-screen – but the ooey, gooey, juicy parts of the mode haven’t revealed themselves to me quite yet. As is usually the case, its success will largely depend on how the maps shake out. I’ll need a bonesaw and a ribspreader to get to the still-beating heart of this thing, but that’s fine. I can’t say I’m not interested in seeing what’s in there. I just hope I don’t get anything on me in the process.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-zombies-review]]></content:encoded>
