			<p>Big changes are underway at Netflix, as the executive who led the streaming giant's foray into gaming has been confirmed to have left the company less than six months after assuming a new role.</p>
<p>As confirmed to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-mike-verdu-exit-gdc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GameFile</a>, Mike Verdu, former Vice President of Netflix's GenAI, has left the company for undisclosed reasons. GameFile asked the executive for comment but did not return the request.</p>
<p>Mike Verdu joined Netflix back in 2021 to help the company launch its gaming division, whose reins he left to former EA and Ubisoft executive Alain Tascan last July, then assuming the role of<a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-investing-in-generative-ai-for-games-after-closing-studios/"> vice president of GenAI</a>, the company's division focused on generative AI. This transition was reportedly planned, although the quick exit from the company as a whole only five months after assuming a new role suggests that other issues may have been ongoing behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Considering how generative AI is becoming more and more prominent, it is unlikely Netflix's plans for GenAI are going to change with Mike Verdu leaving the company. The former vice president highlighted, last year, how he was focused on "<em>a creator-first vision for AI, one that puts creative talent at the center, with AI being a catalyst and an accelerant."</em> This is a vision that is shared among big publishers such as Microsoft, who recently revealed its <a href="https://wccftech.com/xboxs-muse-ai-model-is-a-one-of-a-kind-model-that-can-generate-gameplay/">Muse AI model</a> that is capable of generating gameplay, but it remains to be seen how much they will stick to the idea of generative AI empowering developers, and not use it to take their jobs away.</p>

            <p>
I love a game that features some kind of cooking element, so I was quite pleased yesterday when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/humble-games">Humble Games</a> revealed they're publishing Town Of Zoz, a new action RPG that's all about fighting off rats from eating your crops, taking down baddies to gather up ingredients, and using said ingredients and crops to make some tasty meals. It's got wonderfully vibrant art and animation. The announcement trailer quickly won me over with the choppy, almost stop-motion-like quality of certain character models.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Town Of Zoz is the debut title from Studio Pixanoh, following Ito, a "young shaman chef adventurer" who has to come home to help run his family's farm and restaurant. There's the usual RPG questiness - dark secrets amongst the locals that you have to uncover, you know the drill - but what really sells me is its Breath Of The Wildy cooking format. Kill an enemy and out comes something like an avocado or chicken legs. Once you've got enough ingredients, you head to the kitchen, where it looks like you'll have to fend off more enemies while your food cooks.
</p>

<p>
It looks like a fun, satisfying loop, and the cherry on top is what you do with the food afterwards. As you get to know people around town, you might learn their favourite meal. Making it for them will bring you closer together, and let you learn more about them. Obviously this is just a trailer, but so far Town of Zoz really seems to understand that food is best when it's a communal activity, something to share and bond over. As someone whose family used to run a restaurant themselves, this one's really speaking to me.
</p>
<p>
And if I wasn't sold enough by this game already, some of the score is coming from 2 Mello. His <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jet-set-radio">Jet Set Radio</a> inspired album Memoirs Of Tokyo-To is a banger, and he's done excellent work for games like If Found, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bomb-rush-cyberfunk">Bomb Rush Cyberfunk</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/later-alligator">Later Alligator</a> too. I'll take that release date now please! You can, like I already have, wishlist it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1748110/Town_of_Zoz/">right here</a>.

            <p>Sony has quietly expanded the cloud streaming feature on its PS Portal handheld to include a number of games from its Classics Catalogue.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-portal-update-adds-cloud-gaming-support-in-beta-no-ps5-required">streaming feature launched back in November</a> last year and allows PS Plus Premium subscribers to stream games directly to the handheld without the need for a PS5 console.</p>
<p>Since then, Sony has been quietly adding to the service, which now includes almost every PS1 and PSP game from the Classics Catalogue in the streaming library (thanks <a href="https://www.truetrophies.com/news/ps-portal-ps-plus-premium-streaming-update-march-2025">TrueTrophies</a>).</p>
<p>At its launch, the beta allowed players to access "select PS5 games", with over 120 games included. Now players can dive into the likes of Ape Escape, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken">Tekken</a>, Legend of Dragoon and more.</p>
<p>As it remains in beta, the cloud streaming service is only available in 30 countries, though that does include the UK.</p>
<p>As per the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/19/the-playstation-portal-remote-player-experience-to-evolve-with-new-system-update/">PlayStation Blog</a>, the service can be accessed in: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Cyprus, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and United States.</p>
<p>It's unclear when the service will arrive in full globally, but for now it's clear Sony is keen to add to the catalogue of games - even if it's not including news in its regular PS Plus updates.</p>
<p>If you own a PS Portal, instructions on accessing the beta can be found on the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/support/subscriptions/psportal-cloud-game-streaming/">PlayStation Support website</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-playstation-portal-review-impressive-hardware-but-is-remote-play-itself-good-enough">PS Portal</a> was released in November 2023 - it's impressive hardware but does require a strong internet connection to function well. It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-portal-already-sold-out-as-scalpers-take-advantage">quickly sold out after release</a>, though scalpers took advantage of demand.</p>
<p>The device is also included in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-uk-ps5-rental-scheme-from-11month">Sony's new PlayStation rental service</a>, priced at £6.50 per month. Separately, you can rent PS5 consoles each month, or a PS VR2 too.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Sony announced its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-premium-and-extra-games-for-march-revealed">PS Plus Premium and Extra lineup for this month</a>, including the excellent <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a> and a number of classic Armored Core games from FromSoftware.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>While never officially announced by Bethesda, rumours of an Unreal Engine 5 remake of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a> have been circling the proverbial dialogue pie since 2023, surfacing first via an <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/oblivion-linked-virtuos-is-making-an-unannounced-unreal-engine-5-remake/">alleged developer</a>, then leaked court documents. Edwin wrote about its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-4-oblivions-rumoured-unreal-engine-remake-has-a-new-take-on-stealth-stamina-and-blocking-say-rumours">potential improvements to combat here</a>, while noting that the same leaked documents also mentioned both a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a> remaster and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dishonored-3-is-the-only-exciting-thing-on-bethesdas-leaked-5-year-plan-and-im-worried">Dishonored 3</a>. This might well either prime you with a healthy dose of scepticism, or else have you running around the house shouting "<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a> 3!" at your pets, as I do at least once a week.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/bethesdas-oblivion-unreal-engine-5-remake-could-be-releasing-sooner-than-you-think/">Very Gary Computing</a>, "noted insider" NatetheHate reckons this Oblivion remake is getting revealed "in the coming weeks' - a claim they say they've corroborated. "Nate claims the game will likely release before June, while sources have told VGC it could arrive as soon as next month".</p>

<p>It's reportedly being developed by support n' port studio Virtuous - who've worked on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a>, Uncharted, and most recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Delta</a> - and "fully remade" in UE5, with reworks to stamina, sneaking, blocking, archery, hit reactions, and the HUD.</p>
<p>The armoured elephant in the room here is, of course, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a> - the full fan remake of Oblivion in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>'s engine that's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-oblivion-in-skyrim-mod-still-on-track-for-a-2025-release">still on track for a 2025 release date</a>. It's been in development since 2012, and the team pegged this year for likely release back in 2023. I'm being genuine when I say that the official Oblivion remaster rumours manifesting that year is likely a coincidence - the Skyblivion team have been in dialogue with Bethesda throughout development, so I doubt there's any real tension there.</p>
<p>I do, however, feel that Bethesda could possibly show a bit more respect to their modding community here by not swooping in to steal Skyblivion's thunder, even if I understand the business rational behind not wanting to miss out on potential sales from players that already have a perfectly good modern Oblivion, thank you very much.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I couldn't tell you why <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/nintendo">Nintendo</a> has left Star Fox to rot with the likes of Kid Icarus, while other series like Advance Wars have made a comeback (no shade to Advance Wars fans), but it has. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/chuhai-labs">Chuhai Labs</a> are here to save the day with Wild Blue, an upcoming on-rails shooter just revealed yesterday at the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/humble-games">Humble Games</a> Showcase. The teaser itself didn't show a lick of gameplay, but it's worth noting that Chuhai Labs were founded by Giles Goddard, one of the programmers for the original Star Fox on SNES.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Goddard boisterously introduced himself in Wild Blue's teaser trailer as the "only person that worked on S**r F*x". The redactions are courtesy of the trailer itself - don't worry, I've not somehow convinced myself that the name of a classic Nintendo game is a curse word or anything.

<p>
There's another tongue in cheek moment with a character that definitely isn't Peppy Hare reciting the infamous "do a barrel roll" line, before being cut off by someone else - presumably protagonist Bowie Stray (excellent name) - saying "we don't call them that here". So this really is just legally distinct Star Fox.
</p>
<p>
The game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1921490/Wild_Blue/">Steam page</a> doesn't share all that much either, there's an indication of the kind of locales you'll by flying over like deserts, oceans, that kind of thing, and that there'll be branching paths you can take, but for the most part this is very much an "our game exists" kind of announcement. 
</p>
<p>
Nothing wrong with that, especially seeing as Nintendo haven't given any kind of indication they're working on a new Star Fox. The last official entry was from way back in 2016, so I'm happy for all of you retroheads that will be able to get your "anthropomorphic animal cool spaceships fix" with Wild Blue, whenever it comes out.

            <p>Spectre Divide developer Mountaintop is taking the game offline, and the studio will be "closing its doors" at the end of this week.</p>
<p>The first season of the free-to-play tactical shooter, in which players control two bodies, only began two weeks ago. However, despite optimism during the first week, the developer hasn't "seen enough active players and incoming revenue to cover the day-to-day costs of Spectre and the studio", and Mountaintop is now out of funding.</p>
<p>"We expect to take Spectre offline within the next 30 days, but we plan on disabling new purchases and refunding money spent since Season 1 [launched] via the platforms," Mountaintop's CEO Nate Mitchell wrote, in a <a href="https://playspectre.com/news/letter-to-spectre-fans">post announcing the studio's closure</a>.</p>

<p>"We pursued every avenue to keep going, including finding a publisher, additional investment, and/or an acquisition. In the end, we weren't able to make it work. The industry is in a tough spot right now," the CEO said, calling this a "painful update" to share with the Spectre Divide community.</p>
<p>"This has always been a passion project for us, born out of love for this genre. An indie team of insanely talented individuals who came together from around the world to build a game we believed in," Mitchell continued.</p>
<p>"We wanted to deliver something innovative and original in a crowded genre that would bring friends together around unforgettable moments. We shook up the format, created a fresh art style and universe, and partnered with some of our heroes. All of us knew from the beginning that the odds were against us, but that's what we signed up for.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/after-years-of-complaints-from-rural-pokemon-go-fans-theres-a-new-challenge-that-city-dwellers-may-now-struggle-with<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
It's a fact: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> is much easier to play in a city or large town. There are more gyms and PokéStop locations to interact with, more Pokémon that spawn, more fellow players to battle alongside.
</p>
<p>
For years, rural players have complained the game is harder for them in comparison. Now, finally, it's the turn of those who live in busier areas to complain. 
</p>
<p>
The latest set of challenges to obtain an ultra-rare Shiny Meloetta in Pokémon Go include the requirement to hold a bronze Showcase Star medal, something that means a player needs to have placed first in a PokéStop Showcase. 
</p>
<p>
This is an easy task in remote areas - where essentially you can enter a Pokémon into a Showcase tournament, and be the only person to do so, automatically winning. But in built-up areas, Showcases can attract hundreds of entrants, making your chances of winning much harder.
</p>
<p>
For some players who've already bought the Shiny Meloetta ticket (sold for £4.99 earlier this month), it's proved an unexpected sticking point in their progress. For others, who live in the countryside, it's provided an easy step forward.
</p>
<p>
"Bronze medal only requires one win," wrote a fan on <a href="https://lynn.gamer-network.net/content/eurogamer-net/content-article/new/news/?tab=compose">Pokémon Go reddit TheSilphRoad</a>, "yet some people struggle cause cities like Singapore are so dense and popular with PoGo that Showcases fill up very fast and you can't even enter it."
</p>
<p>
"Well so much for that," wrote another fan. "I have tried for over a year and never won a single showcase."
</p>
<p>
"Just let us rural players have this one win and don't be a sook," said a third. "Literally every other aspect of the game is better in the city."
</p>
<p>
The solution? Over the 21 days it'll take to complete the other steps in this next set of challenges, fans say those wishing to push forward should consider a day trip to somewhere a bit quieter to get that Showcase victory sorted.
</p>
<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-will-be-sold-to-monopoly-go-maker-scopely-niantic-confirms">Niantic confirmed it was selling Pokémon Go to Monopoly Go giant Scopely in a deal worth $3.5bn</a>. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-fans-launch-campaign-to-protect-games-future-as-concerns-mount-over-sale">move has sparked concern from fans over the game's future</a>, something the game's development team has attempted to assuage.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Balatro developer Locathunk has responded to a debate on AI art, stating "I think it does real harm to artists of all kinds".</p>
<p>The debate raged on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1j7nz5q/opinion_from_localthunk_on_ai_art/">Balatro subreddit</a> after one of its moderators posted that AI art would not be banned in the community. Many fans believed both Localthunk and the game's publisher Playstack supported AI art.</p>
<p>As such, Localthunk took to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/localthunk.bsky.social/post/3ljygv23un22v">social media</a> first to respond. "I learned about this a little bit earlier - this is not how I feel about AI 'art'," he wrote. "I normally wouldn't say something about the r/balatro community but this doesn't represent my beliefs nor do I believe it represents how Playstack feels about AI-generated imagery. I don't condone AI generated 'art'."</p>

<p>Then, the developer took to reddit to address the situation once again.</p>
<p>"A mod recently changed the flair in this subreddit for AI generated art making it seem like Playstack condones AI art," he wrote. "This was not due to a direct order from Playstack (a Playstack representative told me this) but from an interpretation of a message about enforcing the rules of the subreddit.</p>
<p>"Neither Playstack nor I condone AI 'art'. I don't use it in my game, I think it does real harm to artists of all kinds. The actions of this mod do not reflect how Playstack feels or how I feel on the topic."</p>
<p>Localthunk confirmed the moderator has been removed from the team and that AI-generated images will not be allowed on the subreddit.</p>
<p>"Please remember to be excellent to each other - this mod doesn't deserve hatred. Please leave them alone," he concluded.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="316"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1j7ocoa/regarding_ai_art/">Regarding AI art</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/localthunk/">u/localthunk</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/">balatro</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>A statement from Playstack followed.</p>
<p>"As LocalThunk points out, we do not support the use of AI art, but perhaps the rules around this should have been clearer so it could not be interpreted as 'acceptable'," wrote communications director Wout van Halderen, confirming the mod team will tighten the rules and FAQ on the topic.</p>
<p>AI art is increasingly being used in game development, from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-dabbled-with-ai-technology-for-foamstars">Square Enix using the technology for Foamstars</a>, to more recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-admits-call-of-duty-includes-generative-ai">Activision acknowledging the use of generative AI in Call of Duty</a> (which likely resulted in that six-fingered zombie Santa).</p>
<p>In an unrelated drama, last month the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-wins-formal-appeal-to-reclassify-poker-game-as-pegi-12">Balatro developer successfully appealed PEGI's decision to classify the game as PEGI 18</a> due to its poker theme.</p>
<p>Localthunk previously commented on PEGI's perceived mishandling of the game's rating. A year after release, Balatro has been recategorised as suitable for players aged 12 and up.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> will in fact be compatible with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>, Ubisoft say, despite a previous <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/4XbPPtFyQEtIMWrA9xVDmZ/assassins-creed-shadows-tech-qa">tech Q&amp;A</a> on the sneaky-stabby ninja sim declaring point-blank that it won’t. Announced on <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1899863156995903687">whatever the fuck Twitter is</a> these days, the confirmation that Shadows will play nice with the Deck comes as a pleasant surprise – even without that prior naysaying, games with a GTX 1070 listed among the minimum specs typically don’t cope too well on the handheld’s frugal hardware.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The only question, suggesteth the tweet, is whether Shadows will get a full-on Verified stamp of approval from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-compatibility-interview">Valve’s compatibility testers</a>, or the Playable classification, which is normally handed to games that run well enough but might have awkward controls or tricky-to-read text. It’ll help, at least, that this particular Assassin’s Creed is launching with a native Steam version, and won’t solely be yoked to Ubisoft Connect (though there are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-and-use-lutris-on-the-steam-deck">other ways</a> of installing that launcher on your Steam Deck too).</p>
<p>Another barrier that Ubisoft have seemingly both erected and cleared is Shadows’ mandatory <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/confirmed-ray-tracing-and-dlss-games">ray tracing</a>. While not slathered in always-on megalighting like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones And The Great Circle</a>, it won’t be possible to entirely switch off ray traced effects, as they’ll always be enabled in the player’s hideout hub at minimum. With <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/doom-eternals-ray-tracing-now-works-on-the-steam-deck">few exceptions</a>, ray tracing will cut down Steam Deck performance like an impertinent daimyo’s neck, but Ubisoft have also created a more easygoing, software-based version of these effects, which will supposedly function adequately on lower-end GPUs. Which would explain why the GTX 1070 is in the minimum specs and not, say, the RTX 2060, with all its hardware-based ray tracing tools.</p>
<p>Whatever you might play it on, Assassin’s Creed Shadows launches next Thursday, April 20th. Ed (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-enjoyed-my-time-with-assassins-creed-shadows-but-i-remain-unconvinced-by-its-split-protagonists">had a play in January</a>, finding it a competent open-world yarn, though was less impressed with the dual-protagonist gimmick that left hulking samurai Yasuke feeling less fleshed-out than stealthy shinobi Naoe.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Parents shouldn't let their children play Roblox if they are worried about their kids' safety in-game, Roblox boss Dave Baszucki has said.
</p>
<p>
Roblox, the gaming and social platform with 80 million daily users, has frequently been criticised for its lax player safety - particularly as the bulk of its audience is under 18. 
</p>
<p>
"My first message would be, if you're not comfortable, don't let your kids be on Roblox," <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yrjkl7dd6o">Baszucki told BBC News in a new interview</a>. "That sounds a little counter-intuitive, but I would always trust parents to make their own decisions."

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-adding-further-parental-controls-as-its-belated-push-to-improve-child-safety-continues">Roblox made a flurry of changes in late 2024 designed to improve child safety</a> with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-announces-policy-changes-for-pre-teen-users-amid-ongoing-accusations-of-child-safety-failures">the addition of basic parental control features</a>, such as the ability to set playtime limits, remotely manage a child's account and view a child's friend list.
</p>
<p>
Parental access is now required for children to access some in-game chat features, and children under 13 have been blocked from social hangout games due to "user behaviour that can potentially pose a risk". 
</p>
<p>
The changes came a month after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/damning-roblox-report-claims-company-inflates-player-numbers-to-investors-by-as-much-as-42">a damning report was published detailing the ongoing safety issues for children in-game</a>, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-exploiting-young-game-developers-new-investigation-reports">had been regularly highlighted for years</a>.
</p>
<p>
"We do in the company take the attitude that any bad, even one bad incident, is one too many," Baszucki told BBC News today. 
</p>
<p>
"We watch for bullying, we watch for harassment, we filter all of those kinds of things, and I would say behind the scenes, the analysis goes on all the way to, if necessary, reaching out to law enforcement."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-reported-13316-instances-of-child-exploitation-last-year">In 2013, Roblox reported 13,316 instances of child exploitation to US authorities</a>, and responded to over 1300 requests from authorities for detail on predatory players. Over the last six years, at least two dozen people have been arrested in the US for abusing victims met via Roblox.
</p>
<p>
During the interview, BBC News showed Baszucki evidence of how easy it was to still set up accounts to chat between a user who was a minor and adults, as well as the titles of Roblox experiences recommended to an account of an 11-year-old, including "Late Night Boys And Girls Club RP" and "Special Forces Simulator".
</p>
<p>
"One thing that's really important for the way we do things here, is it's not just on the title of the experience, it's literally on the content of the experience as well," Baszucki said in response.
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-shares-drop-by-20-as-platform-misses-target-active-users">Roblox shares dropped by 20 percent</a> after the platform's reported daily active users fell short of expectations, something the company blamed on a recent ban of the platform in Türkiye over child safety concerns.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/boulies-master-chair-rex-review.1133097/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/13/boulies-master-chair-rex-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Humanity does a lot of sitting. Sitting when we work, sitting when we relax, and, of course, sitting when we game. A few years back, office chair sales went bananas to accommodate all the extra sitting time when we were all locked in our homes, and bottom comfort and back support has remained in high demand ever since, resulting in keeping people’s posteriors well-propped becoming something of an art form. So, does the Boulies Master Chair have what it takes to make your buttocks and back feel like their ensconced on a cloud, or is it more akin to perching on one of those weird butt-hating blue seats of despair located in bus stops all over the land?</p>
<p>First off, the box the Master Chair Rex arrives in is insanely heavy. The delivery man was literally crying sweat and weeping tears dragging the enormous behemoth along my driveway. Unless you’re an Olympic Power Weightlifter, it’s probably best not to attempt to lift the box on your own. Also, it’s probably worth not trying to lift the weighty chair up the stairs after it’s been built, as I did, promptly sending my back muscles into spasm. This did, however, fill that first time sitting in the chair with relief for my suffering body.</p>
<p>Building such a heavy chair was also a challenge, and not one to undertake without a protein shake and a DIY partner. The instruction book – well, more like a leaflet if I’m being entirely honest – is hilariously unclear. A poor English translation and murky images make for much confusion. Fortunately, I had enough DIY experience to figure things out, but if you’re new to the office chair building game, get ready for some head scratching befuddlement as you attempt to put the Master Chair together.</p>



		
		

<p>The actual individual pieces of the chair feel very high quality, though, with plenty of aluminium, steel, and solid building blocks. When you do figure out which bit connects to what bit, they clunk together in a satisfying manner. Bolts are chunky and robust, ensuring that once the chair is built it’s absolutely going to stay in one piece.</p>
<p>Once you’ve sat yourself upon the imposing chair, it does rather feel like you’re an evil emperor plotting to take over the Universe. Still, you’ll definitely be a <em>comfy</em> evil emperor plotting to take over the universe. The style leans toward the gamer end of the market, with that overall car seat style, instead of the “<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/12/sihoo-doro-s300-chair-review/">lots of floating panels</a>” that’s more common to offices, but it’s a mature take without even a hint of neon orange stitching.</p>


<p>Every aspect of the chair can be tinkered with until you find your optimum set-up. The 4D arm rests can be moved to pretty much any position – up, down, shifting front-to-back and side-to-side, and twisting – and then lock in place, and there’s adjustable lumbar support built into the back that can be increased or decreased using side-mounted knobs to find just the right amount of pressure to keep your back in a good shape. Even just sitting down, there’s 15º of tilt in the base, and then the back can tilt back and lock into position at 15º increments until you’re practically lying down. With the Master Rex variant, you can flip out the leg rest and you can have a little snooze, even.</p>
<p>The material of our review unit, Ultraflex PU leather, is luxurious to behold and is surprisingly easy to clean, as an early accident with a chocolate milkshake aptly demonstrated. You can also opt for a water repellant fabric, or go all-in with Nappa leather (at a cost). While there’s claims that the castors are friendly to wooden floors, I wasn’t able to test this as I have carpets, but they’re simply plastic and the sheer weight of the chair would have me suggesting you still invest in a floor protector.</p>
<p>With a starting price of £370 (currently on offer for £290) for the standard Master Chair, this is great value when stacked up against the similarly featured AndaSeat Kaiser 3 (£400) or Secretlab Titan Evo (£469 after discount). The Master Rex does bump the price up by £40 for the leg rest to £410 (discounted to £330), while larger humans have the Master Max as an option.</p>
<p>The only thing is that it turns out this style of chair just isn’t for me. It’s so heavy and cumbersome to move and so blinking massive that I find myself returning to my old budget priced office chair more often than not.</p>

			<p>Earlier this week, WindowsCentral's Jez Corden <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-release-2027-premium-handheld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published a report</a> detailing Microsoft's plans for the next-generation Xbox as well as the long-awaited Xbox handheld. As for the former, the report said a successor to the Series X is already in the works for a targeted 2027 release window.</p>
<p>When it comes to the latter, Microsoft is allegedly planning its own handheld system (also due in 2027), but the report also mentioned an Xbox-partnered handheld device codenamed Project Keenan due this year with the partnership of a PC OEM manufacturer.</p>
<p>A few hours ago, The Verge's Tom Warren <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/628073/microsoft-xbox-handheld-project-kennan-notepad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared his own (paywalled) report</a> in the latest Notepad newsletter. First, the project's correct codename is Kennan, not Keenan. Second, his sources revealed that the Xbox handheld's manufacturer is ASUS. The device will run on Windows, of course, but it will feature an interface very much reminiscent of the Xbox consoles.</p>
<p>This is reportedly part of a larger project codenamed Project Bayside to unify Xbox and Windows under a unified Xbox user interface regardless of the device being used. Warren also wrote that Microsoft is working to ensure a single store for games and an easier way for game developers to create titles for handhelds, console-like hardware, and PCs.</p>
<p>At CES 2025, Microsoft's Jason Ronald, Vice President of Xbox Gaming Devices and Ecosystem, openly teased this concept when he <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-will-offer-the-best-of-console-and-pc-put-together-says-microsoft-more-info-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that they've worked hard to bring the best of console and PC together, drawing on their long-time experiences on both platforms, as part of their Xbox handheld efforts. Right now, Windows-powered PC handhelds don't really offer the most user-friendly experience, and Microsoft aims to address that with this initiative.</p>
<p>Following Warren's report, Corden <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-project-kennan-gaming-handheld-everything-we-know-so-far" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> another article to admit that the colleague was right on the Project Kennan codename. He also corroborated that ASUS is indeed the chosen manufacturer and offered an estimate on the likely pricing: between $499 and $599. This could hint that the hardware could be using AMD's Z2 Go chipset previously seen on the Lenovo Legion Go S. The Z2 Go chipset is <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-z2-go-slower-than-z1-extreme-lenovo-legion-go-asus-rog-ally-x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slightly slower than the Z1 Extreme</a> and quite a bit slower than its larger sibling, the Z2 Extreme. However, it's still more powerful than the APU currently available in Valve's Steam Deck. The Xbox handheld would, therefore, sit somewhere in the middle of the pack when it comes to performance, although again, this information is not at all assured.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more details.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pocketpair-publishing-warn-not-more-palworld/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pocketpair-publishing-warns-gamers-to-not-expect-%E2%80%98more-palworld%E2%80%99.1133082/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/pocketpair-publishing-warn-not-more-palworld/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Pocketpair Publishing was announced just a few weeks ago, at the tail end of January. As an all-new arm of Pocketpair, the developer behind Palworld, Pocketpair Publishing is dedicated to bringing indie titles to life. However, the brand’s publishing manager, John Buckley, recently issued something of a warning.</p>



<p>He mentioned that while Pocketpair Publishing bears <strong>the name</strong>, it’s not related to the creation of Palworld, nor should it be assumed that ‘more Palworld’ is coming from the games that sign to the publishing label. By that, he means that players shouldn’t expect the vast levels of success seen with Palworld’s 2024 release, which turned heads worldwide.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-they-are-all-bangers">‘They Are All Bangers’</h2>



<p>John Buckley from Pocketpair Publishing recently took to social media to stress how nervous he is about announcing the first batch of games that the team is working on. It was revealed in January that Surgent Studios, the creator behind Tales of Kenzera, has aligned with Pocketpair Publishing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pocketpair-surgent-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to produce a new game</a>.</p>



<p>On Twitter, <a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1899644637826203835" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Buckley wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m very nervous to reveal our first batch of games. </p>



<p>Not because I think the reception will be bad (they are all bangers), but because I worry people will just expect more Palworld. </p>



<p>PPP’s goal is to help cool indies get made so I hope you like our first round of games!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He then pointed out that Palworld’s ongoing development is ‘completely unaffected by PPP’ and that ‘us publishing more games like Palworld’ isn’t on the cards.</p>



<p>It’s a relatively loaded statement that has been taken with a mixed reception. Some feel that Buckley – who goes as ‘Bucky’ online – has immediately soured the line-up of games that PPP is yet to announce, restricting expectations and making us feel as though there’s a lack of faith at the publisher regarding the potential success of these games.</p>



<p>After all, nobody expected Palworld, which was presented as ‘Pokémon with guns,’ to break player count records and secure tens of millions of fans in the blink of an eye, but that’s what happened. If I were a developer aligning with Pocketpair Publishing, I’d perhaps be critical of that post by the brand’s publishing manager.</p>

<p>There’s <strong>another </strong>live-service competitive multiplayer title in the works at PlayStation, but the identity of the game is yet to be revealed. In a recent job posting that was discovered from PlayStation, it was revealed that a studio under the label is working on an ‘unannounced project’ that’s set to feature competitive, esports, and live-service elements.</p>



<p>Because that has worked so well for PlayStation in recent years, right?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-could-it-be">What Could It Be?</h2>



<p>On <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ja1ptk/playstation_next_unannounced_multiplayer_title/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, eagle-eyed users spotted the recently-posted job listing from an undetermined studio, and they instantly started theorising what game the role could be referring to. The consensus was that it could be some kind of multiplayer fighting game, but at this point, it could be anything.</p>



<p>What’s made clear by <a href="https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/sonyinteractiveentertainmentglobal/jobs/5447168004" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the job listing</a> is that it’s set to be a live-service multiplayer game, and the team is eager to introduce a ‘competitive gaming/esports landscape’ into the title. As some one who has been in the esports world for many years, I’d like to point out that you can’t just invent a landscape or a competitive community – that only works when it’s grown, not bought.</p>



<p>The listing goes on to mention that the game will be multi-platform, covering PC, console, and mobile, and that it’ll be developed in Unreal Engine. It might be that the game is <strong>very early in </strong>the development cycle, as the listing says that the successful candidate will help drive the game ‘from prototype to production’. </p>



<p>It <strong>might </strong>be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-sony-studio-la-jason-blundell/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jason Blundell’s new game</a>, too. In 2023, rumours started surfacing regarding Blundell’s appointment to a new PlayStation studio in Los Angeles, and it has been suggested the former Call of Duty legend is working on a game that fits the bill. If the job listing was for a placement in LA, it would offer more credence to that claim, but it’s a remote position, so there’s nothing to go on.</p>



<p>Do you think it’s a safe idea for PlayStation to piece together another live-service multiplayer title given the state of the industry? Hours ago, it was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-spectre-divide-closing-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spectre Divide</a>, another game fitting into that category, is shutting down.</p>

<p>Spectre Divide went live in September 2024, and in March 2025, it was announced that the game – and the developer behind the title – would be shutting down. This news came despite the studio securing tens of millions of dollars in investments while being backed by some of the most prolific streamers in the business.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/spectre-divide-and-mountaintop-studios-to-shut-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The news</a> shocked everyone involved, even if Spectre Divide wasn’t the first shooter released in 2024 to close down so quickly. Let’s take a closer look at the situation and determine why Spectre Divide is closing down in 2025.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-why-did-spectre-divide-fail">Why Did Spectre Divide Fail?</h2>



<p>Spectre Divide was penned as being the next big thing in competitive arena shooters, boasting a unique aesthetic and some innovative mechanics. It was publically backed by Michael ‘shroud’ Grzesiek, one of the biggest streamers and former esports players in the world.</p>



<p>The core USP of Spectre Divide was a ‘duality’ feature that would allow players to split themselves into <strong>two bodies</strong>, controlling each in real-time.</p>



<p>None of this was enough, as ultimately, Spectre Divide fell down the charts relatively quickly at launch, failing to gain traction and secure a healthy base of users.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, the team at Mountaintop Studios revealed that was why Spectre Divide failed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, the Season 1 launch hasn’t achieved the level of success we needed to sustain the game and keep Mountaintop afloat.</p>



<p>We were optimistic about the first week. We’ve had ~400,000 players play, with a peak concurrent player count of ~10,000 across all platforms. But as time has gone on, we haven’t seen enough active players and incoming revenue to cover the day-to-day costs of Spectre and the studio.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is a huge pitfall for free-to-play shooters built around a live-service operating model. If there are no players, there’s nothing to support the studio, and this is something we’re seeing happen increasingly often. Last year, Concord was pulled from stores mere weeks after launch, after failing to secure a meaningful player count.</p>



<h2 id="h-was-spectre-divide-bad">Was Spectre Divide Bad?</h2>



<p>Almost as soon as the game hit the market, people were asking, ‘Is Spectre Divide dying?’ It was an immediate concern for those eager to explore the game, as it looked as though the game was on the rocks from the moment it arrived. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, Spectre Divide was fairly buggy when it was released in September 2024. That kind of thing can cause a game to be DOA, as nobody wants to play a game riddled with glitches – even if it’s free.</p>



<p>It was also determined that the Duality feature was more of a gimmick than anything else and didn’t necessarily add too much to the game’s core makeup. </p>



<p>Many prospective fans of Spectre Divide were also displeased with how Shroud, the game’s main advocate, busied himself with other games like Deadlock and Marvel Rivals, failing to support the game he’d promoted since day one.</p>



<p>Ultimately, this was a masterclass in what not to do when launching a new game, and that’s why Spectre Divide is closing down in 2025.</p>

<p>The in-development remake of Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion appears to be coming sooner than originally expected. This according to a new claim from known leaker Nate The Hate.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1899604247978840406" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, Nate The Hate said that he expects news on the remake to come either this month or in April.</p>



<p>“Release is likely to be sooner than the original June target,” he added. “But still working to get details on an updated release date.”</p>



<p>Previous rumors on the remake suggest that the game is in development at Virtuous Games and is being built in Unreal Engine 5. It’s also expected that the game will feature significant changes to the gameplay, including the blocking system. Earlier rumors suggest that the system will feature elements from the Dark Souls franchise. The games sneaking and stamina mechanics will also be updated for modern day.</p>



<p>It’s currently unknown what platforms the remake will release on. </p>

<p>Bethesda has yet to officially announce or comment on the Oblivion remake. Until something becomes official or Insider Gaming can independently verify the information, please take the claim with a grain of salt.</p>

But as time has gone on, we haven’t seen enough active players and incoming revenue to cover the day-to-day costs of Spectre and the studio.”</p><p>The studio expects to take <em>Spectre Divide</em> offline “within the next 30 days,” and it will refund all money since the game’s first season, which kicked off on February 25th. Mountaintop Studios will also be “closing its doors” at the end of the week, according to the post.</p><p>“We pursued every avenue to keep going, including finding a publisher, additional investment, and/or an acquisition,” Mountaintop says. “In the end, we weren’t able to make it work. The industry is in a tough spot right now.”</p><p>In December, Mountaintop CEO Nate Mitchell and <em>Spectre Divide</em> game director Lee Horn told <em>The Verge</em> that things were already dire, and that the game’s console launch and new season <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24325918/can-spectre-divide-escape-concords-failed-shooter-fate-heres-the-hail-mary">would be its hail mary play</a>. Horn said that the marketing was working going into launch, but that server issues beginning on launch day axed its momentum. “Unfortunately, the game fell over on day one,” he admitted. </p><p>Mitchell told us the game needed thousands of concurrent players if it was going to survive, or else the company would run out of money this year. Unfortunately, the game’s new season peaked <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/2641470#3m">at just over 1,000 concurrents on Steam</a>, and has been downhill ever since; presumably, Mountaintop saw its multiplatform peak of around 10,000 players drop similarly.</p><p>“If the players are enjoying the game... if they aren’t into season one, they way we hope they are, we’ll have to take a hard look at if we should keep going on as we are, or if players are telling us this isn’t what we want,” Mitchell told us in December. Apparently, Mountaintop did have to take that hard look, and this is its decision.</p><div><p>The <em>Spectre Divide</em> shutdown follows the disastrous launch of Sony’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235163/concord-cancellation-live-service-games">forgettable <em>Concord</em> hero shooter</a>. Sony has since <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282900/sony-shutting-down-concord-firewalk-studios">closed down <em>Concord’s</em> development studio</a> and permanently shut down the game.</p></div><p><em>Additional reporting by Sean Hollister</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Ubisoft has some good news for Steam Deck owners looking to sink into <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> later this month: after previously saying the game wouldn't be compatible with Valve's gaming handheld, it's now done a bit of a U-turn.
</p>
<p>
Back in February, as part of a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/4XbPPtFyQEtIMWrA9xVDmZ/assassins-creed-shadows-tech-qa">lengthy tech Q&amp;A</a>, Ubisoft revealed Assassin's Creed Shadows would "not be compatible with Steam Deck [at launch], due to the fact it is below our minimum specs for PC." That, then, suggested it wasn't just a case of Shadows failing to tick some boxes to pass Valve's verification process, but rather that it simply wouldn't run well at all.
</p>
<p>
Now, though, with Assassin's Creed Shadows' release just weeks away, Ubisoft has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1j9og39/assassins_creed_shadows_we_are_happy_to_say_that/">shared an update for Steam Deck users</a> - confirming Valve's device will, in fact, be supported at launch. The publisher didn't explain what had led to the change, but presumably - hopefully - it's managed to eke out a few performance gains in the time since its original announcement.

<p>
Ubisoft adds it's still awaiting the results of Valve's verification process, so doesn't currently know which of Steam Deck's compatibility classifications Assassin's Creed Shadows will receive (Valve <a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/en/verified">grades games</a> as either Verified, Playable, Unsupported, or Unknown on the device) . "More info to come soon," its message concludes.
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed Shadows launches for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (including Steam Deck!) on 20th March, and will also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-details-ps5-pro-enhancements-including-extended-raytracing">receive a range of PS5 Pro enhancements</a>. And if you're looking for more granular release information, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-global-launch-times-detailed-pre-load-live-now-on-xbox">global launch times have also been revealed.</a> As for the game itself, it's "shaping up to be one of the most promising [series entries] so far", as Eurogamer's Katharine Castle <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-hours-with-assassins-creed-shadows-the-biggest-shake-up-of-the-series-in-years">wrote earlier this year</a>.

			<p>Two months ago, the long-running Oblivion remake rumors (which <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">originated</a> from the Microsoft vs. FTC lawsuit 'leak' from two years back) intensified greatly following a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detailed report</a> from MP1st.</p>
<p>That report mentioned Virtuos had been working on porting The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion to Epic's Unreal Engine 5 technology. Virtuos previously worked on Obsidian's The Outer Worlds: The Spacer's Choice Edition and is a co-development partner for Konami's Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater.</p>
<p>According to the report, the remake features improvements in six key areas (other than the visuals, which is a given): Stamina, Sneak, Blocking, Archery, Hit Reaction, and Heads Up Display.</p>
<p>Blocking has reportedly been inspired by Soulslike and other modern action games. Sneak has also been improved and its damage formula has been reworked. The stamina system has also been tweaked to make it less frustrating for players; for example, the knockdown that used to happen when you ran out of stamina should happen less often.</p>
<p>The HUD has been modified to make it more accessible and visually interesting. In combat, hit reactions have been introduced to improve the response to damage inflicted on both the player character and non-player characters (NPCs). Last but not least, the developers have reportedly improved archery so that it feels smoother whether the user is playing in third or first person view.</p>
<p>Now, leaker NateTheHate <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1899604247978840406" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a> that Bethesda could officially unveil this Oblivion remake in March or April at the latest, with a release that could come shortly afterward. The insider added that June was the original target, but the launch could happen even sooner. VideoGamesChronicle has subsequently not only backed Nate's rumor but also <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/bethesdas-oblivion-unreal-engine-5-remake-could-be-releasing-sooner-than-you-think/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added</a> that the remake could be released as early as next month.</p>
<p>Of course, the 2006 open world roleplaying game doesn't need a lot of marketing. Fans are already very excited to be getting not one but two renditions when you factor in Skyblivion, the fan-made recreation of Oblivion in Skyrim's engine, also <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-team-confirms-2025-launch-window-though-dlcs-will-come-later/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slated to launch in 2025</a>.</p>
<p>Are you ready to return to the Imperial City?</p>

<p>The 3v3 tactical shooter Spectre Divide, the first game launched by Mountaintop Studios, will be taken offline within the next 30 days. Mountaintop Studios itself will close its doors at the end of this week.</p>



<h2 id="h-specter-divide-and-mountaintop-studios-to-shut-down">Specter Divide and Mountaintop Studios to Shut Down </h2>



<p>After its August 13th closed beta launch last year, Spectre Divide and Mountaintop Studios are shutting down just months later. In a letter from studio CEO Nate Mitchell, he <a href="https://x.com/SpectreDivide/status/1899943286158336111" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">says</a> the closure is attributed to a lack of “active players and incoming revenue to cover the day-to-day costs of Spectre and the studio.”</p>



<div><article><p><span>A message from our CEO about the future of Spectre Divide and Mountaintop Studios.</span></p></article></div>



<p>“Since the PC launch, we stretched our remaining capital as far as we could, but at this point, we’re out of funding to support the game,” Mitchell continued in his letter. “This means Mountaintop will be closing its doors at the end of the week.” Mitchell said that the team considered all options, including a new publisher, additional investment, and even a possible acquisition. In-game purchasing will be disabled and purchased made since the season one launch will be refunded.</p>



<p>During Spectre Divide’s first week, it attracted roughly 400,000 total players, and hit a concurrent player peak of over 30,000 in September. In contrast to traditional tactical shooters, Spectre Divide stood out with a Spectre clone that players could switch between. But the game fell off dramatically in just a matter of months, never cracking over 4,000 players since that peak. It saw a very small spike in returning players in February with a new season launch, but still fell short of desired player numbers.</p>



<p>What do you think of Spectre Divide’s sudden shutdown? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>
