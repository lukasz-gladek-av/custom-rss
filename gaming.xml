			<p>If you're getting stuck into Zenless Zone Zero and feeling overwhelmed by the number of options for creating a team, don't panic. Some characters are objectively better than others, while others may choose to play simply because you like them. There are no rules to playing Zenless Zone Zero. However, if you need guidance, keep reading for our <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/en-us/main" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zenless Zone Zero</a> best agents tier list.</p>
<p>The higher-tier characters are great if you want to take on some of the more challenging parts of the game, such as Hollow Zero, Notorious Hunt, and Shiyu Defense. While you could probably make it through with the base characters you're given, there are characters on this Zenless Zone Zero tier list that will make your journey significantly easier.</p>

<h2>S Tier Characters</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>Ellen is a powerhouse that uses Slash damage combined with Ice attacks. Even when not leveled up, her damage is significantly better than everyone else's. When she is teamed up with other S-tiers, the damage is immense. When paired with Lycaon and Soukaku, she has a great synergy with them. Using her Roaming state, she can quickly build up Flash Freeze charges, which can help stop an enemy in their tracks.</p>
<p>Lycaon has Ice Stun attacks as well as Strike damage. Not only is Lycaon great as a support character due to their increased Stun duration and Ice Resistance Shredding. Lycaon is a real asset, along with some of the other powerhouses that were in attack. Even if you aren't quite sure how to use this character, you can still output some beefy damage. Learn how to charge correctly and combo his attacks. Lycaon is one of the best characters you can put on your team.</p>
<p>Rina is an Electric support with Strike damage. While she can be challenging to get used to at first due to her slow attack speed, the overall group damage output can be boosted by utilizing her. Using her special attacks and then swapping to another character in the party can boost your damage numbers, and even when swapped, she will continue to do damage to the enemies. While in a support role, she's excellent at adding chip damage to the overall output.</p>
<h2>A Tier Characters</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>Grace is an Electric Anomaly with Pierce damage. Compared to some of the other characters on this list, Grace can be really demanding in learning to play correctly. To be able to play her, you need to be mindful of how many stacks you have built up, as well as how often you are swapping in and out. While she is not a proper DPS, she can have some excellent damage output if she is adequately utilized and works well with other Electric-type characters.</p>
<p>Lucy is a Fire Support that deals Strike damage. Lucy can be a great asset to the team, as she has phenomenal support capabilities and great DPS. When paired with other Fire users, she has some great benefits. You'll have a great time utilizing Lucy on your team with minimal struggle by summoning her guard boars and pulling off successful EX special attacks. The small boars are a great asset as they scale off Lucy's critical strike and damage.</p>
<p>Soldier 11 is a Fire Attack using Slash damage. Soldier 11 is the only Fire attacker in the game, making her the perfect DPS to take into a fight where the enemies are susceptible to Fire. To make the most of Soldier 11, you need to get your timing down for her basic attacks so that she can perform combos that make the most of her Fire buff. While this may sound scary, it's very easy to perform; it just takes a little while to get into the flow.</p>
<p>Soukaku is an Ice Support with Slash damage. Soukaku is probably the trickiest character to learn to play out of the Zenless Zone Zero A-tiers, but she is still a solid pick. You must know how to time her basic attacks to pull off her combos and maximize her support capabilities. After successfully performing her combo, she gives buffs to her fellow agents' next attack, allowing the buffed agent to do much damage. Due to her being an Ice Support, she is best paired with other Ice agents.</p>
<h2>B Tier Characters</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>Anby uses an Electric Stun with Strike damage. She is one of the free characters you get at the start of the game and is incredibly beneficial to have and level up. When paired with either more Electric squad members or members from the Cunning Hares, she has some great synergy with them. Her kit is far from complicated, and her combo is effortless. By utilizing it properly, she has powerful damage and a Daze boost after the third hit of her basic attack.</p>
<p>Ben is a Fire Defense that uses Strike damage. Ben is an excellent asset to the team purely because of the shield he can grant his entire squad after using a follow-up attack during his EX Special Attack. By using this, it also increases the Crit Strike for the team. The biggest downside to having Ben on your team is how slow they are on the battlefield, with other support characters doing a better job than them.</p>
<p>Koleda is a Fire Stun with Strike damage. Koleda comes as one of the most unique characters in the game, as her full potential isn't unleashed unless she is paired with Ben, which then boosts Ben in return. However, they are both incredibly slow attackers, which can make brutal fights extremely long, whereas in Zenless Zone Zero, speed is vital.</p>
<p>Nekomata is a Physical Attacker with Slash damage. If you like fast-paced action, Nekomata is the perfect pick for you. Compared to other agents in the game, Nekomata is top of the tier list for her physical damage output. However, she is very difficult to put on a team, as Piper is the only person she benefits from having on a team with her. To utilize Nekomata, you must have your timing on dodging and attacking down to a T.</p>
<p>Nicole is an Ether Support with Strike damage. Nicole would probably be a great asset if you're curating Ether teams. However, there are no other Ether agents, so it's unsure whether she would excel. While she gains and gives buffs to the other Cunning Hares if you pair them up, they aren't as good as some other team buffs. Once Zhu Yuan is released, Nicole may stand a chance at being helpful, especially with her Energy Fields.</p>
<p>Piper is a Physical Anomaly with Slash damage. Piper is a huge asset to the team as she can quickly build up and apply her Physical Anomaly using her EX Special Attack and boost the rest of the team's damage output. If you also need some stuns, Piper has great stun potential, especially if you're good at swapping out your characters on time.</p>
<h2>C Tier Characters</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>Anton is an Electric Attack with Pierce damage. As it stands, Anton is the only Electric Attacker in the game. On top of that, his kit can be a bit difficult to utilize correctly, as it's hard to get his full damage potential out. He needs to be in Burst Mode to pump the damage consistently. However, as he is in Burst Mode, he loses energy, making tackling challenging.</p>
<p>Corin is a Physical Attack with Slash damage. Corin is most likely one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/how-to-claim-all-180-free-pulls-in-zenless-zone-zero/">first agents you'll unlock</a> outside of the free agents given to you. Despite this, they can be beneficial. When dealing with crowd control situations, Corin is the perfect agent for the job. While her damage output is slightly lower than some of the other Zenless Zone Zero agents on this tier list, she can apply Daze with her assistance and does increased damage to stunned enemies.</p>
<h2>D Tier Characters</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>Billy is the only D-tier character on this Zenless Zone Zero tier list. He uses Physical Attacks with Pierce damage. While Billy excels in crowd control, his overall damage is lacking, and you'd be better off building any other attacker. The further an enemy is away from Billy, the less damage he deals. This is difficult to handle, as he is a ranged attacker, but you must be as close as possible to get any good damage numbers out.</p>
<p>That concludes our Zenless Zone Zero tier list. It'll be updated as soon as new characters are released so you can stay on top of the trends and build the most powerful team possible.</p>

To get one of those you’ll need some gunpowder. And for <em>Once Human</em>’s gunpowder, you’ll need to acquire acid. It’s an endless cycle that will see you grinding resource nodes well into the end game.</p><p>To make your journey easier, here is how to acquire acid using various methods, including a passive farming solution that offers a hands-off approach after initial setup!</p><h2 id="h31420"><a id="early"></a>Where to get acid in the early game</h2><p>You won’t be able to farm acid in bulk until the late game. By then, you’ll have unlocked various technologies that will allow you to sift acid from contaminated water, but more on that later.</p><p><strong>Early on, the best way to acquire acid in the early game is by slaying enemies</strong>. Multiple enemy types in low-level zones drop acid, including:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Gnawer</li><li>Charred Maniac</li><li>Light</li></ul><p>You’re most likely to encounter a Gnawer or Charred Maniac, the former of which will always drop a handful of acid on death.</p><figure id="" data-id="6ead116a62014efd4aab90b6e84894c6" data-recommend-id="image://6ead116a62014efd4aab90b6e84894c6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A gnawer stands outside of a construction site." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A gnawer stands outside of a construction site." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Starry Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6ead116a62014efd4aab90b6e84894c6" data-recommend-id="image://6ead116a62014efd4aab90b6e84894c6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A gnawer stands outside of a construction site." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Alternatively, you will acquire junk items from crates, waste bins, and enemies you can bring back to the base.

A few potential spots can be found near:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Greywater Camp</li><li>Lone Wolf Wastes</li><li>Blackfell</li></ul><p><strong>You’ll typically need to be approximately level 20 before it’s wise to venture into a polluted zone.</strong> Most of the technology you require to farm polluted zones for acid requires tier four and five Memetics.</p><p>[Once-Human-Reverse-Osmosis-Purifiers.jpg]</p><p>To get started farming acid passively, you must unlock the following items:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Water Pump</li><li>Reverse Osmosis Purifiers</li><li>Fermentation (Brewing) Barrels</li></ul><p>First, place your Water Pump in polluted water, then power up the unit to ensure it can feed into the Reverse Osmosis Purifiers. As this process proceeds, impure acid is produced.</p><p>Unfortunately, <strong>impure acid isn’t good enough to craft gunpowder and ammunition</strong>. You must refine the impure acid using the fermentation (brewing) barrels and purified water.</p><p>Once all is said and done, you’ll have a semi-automatic process to farm acid in <em>Once Human</em>. It requires a bit of setup—crafting and grinding—but proves more than worthwhile as you push end-game content with enough ammunition to stave off the apocalypse!</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Recent changes to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft's</a> Classic Era servers are being reverted "immediately," Blizzard has announced, after the developer apologized for failing to discuss "shortsighted" quality-of-life updates to the old-school version of Blizzard's long-running MMORPG.</p><p dir="ltr">The update, released last week, was originally designed for WoW Classic's more experimental <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-classic-season-of-discovery-looks-to-make-a-20-year-old-game-surprising-again/1100-6519561/" data-ref-id="1100-6519561">Season of Discovery servers</a>. However, Blizzard intentionally opted to bring some of the changes to the game's non-seasonal Classic Era servers too. Those changes allowed Druids to wield polearms, granted Alliance players a powerful new world buff on par with the Horde's existing Warchief's Blessing buff, and updated the game's guild interface to match that of the modern game.</p><p dir="ltr">Those changes took the Classic Era community, which generally doesn't enjoy major changes to the (for the most part) 2006 version of WoW, by surprise. Players were so surprised, in fact, that many on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/1e0azwg/new_classic_era_patch_notes/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> believed the changes had simply been a mistake on Blizzard's part, only to later learn that the changes were indeed intended. Now, Blizzard said those changes (minus the guild UI) are being removed, citing a "lack of communication" that "was not in line with our values."</p><p dir="ltr">"For everything it does perfectly, Classic Era is also beloved for its wonderful imperfections," Blizzard community manager Kaivax said in an <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-era-patch-updates/1894672" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official post</a> on the Classic Era forums. "These 'perfectly imperfect' elements make up the texture of the overall experience, and we recognize that making changes to these, even with the intent of adding 'quality-of-life' updates--and particularly without discussing them with the community first--was shortsighted. Thank you, again, for your feedback."</p><p dir="ltr">As for the new guild UI, Blizzard said it recognizes the change is "jarring," even though feedback it received from guild leaders so far indicates the updated UI does help improve guild management. Blizzard said it's discussing "additional options" for the guild UI internally and will be looking to the community for feedback on what should be done next.</p><p dir="ltr">"As it stands now, the Classic team philosophically has very little desire to bring gameplay-impacting changes to Classic Era," Blizzard said. "Moving forward, we will endeavor to discuss any potential community-led desire for changes with the community, well in advance of actually implementing any updates."</p><p dir="ltr">WoW Classic's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-wow-most-iconic-legendary-weapons-is-getting-an-overhaul-in-season-of-discovery/1100-6524252/" data-ref-id="1100-6524252">Season of Discovery servers recently entered its endgame phase</a>, featuring revamps of existing raids as well as new items, abilities, and even a new dungeon. Meanwhile, Blizzard is gearing up for the release of the 10th expansion for the modern version of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-release-date-announced-during-xbox-showcase/1100-6524083/" data-ref-id="1100-6524083">WoW, The War Within, on August 26</a>.</p>

It’s not a <em>Call of Duty</em>, a <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>, or even a big RPG or sci-fi action game. Nope. It’s <em>EA Sports’ NCAA Football 2005.</em> It’s been a <em>long time</em> since that has happened<em>, </em>but the recent college football game from EA—the first in over a decade—is exploding and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ea-college-football-25-ncaa-14-biggest-game-playercount-1851595253&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ea-college-football-25-ncaa-14-biggest-game-playercount-1851595253">might end up at the top of July 2024's best-selling games list</a></span>. </p><p>Meanwhile, <em>Shrek 2</em>—a licensed action-adventure game based on the animated movie—is in the top ten, beating out titles like <em>Red Dead Revolver, Need for Speed: Underground, </em>and <em>Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow</em>. I can’t remember the last time a movie tie-in game cracked the top charts. And hey, look at that! <em>Mega-Man, Driver, </em>and <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> are in the top 20, t00.

It's summer, the season of occasional sun (hello from the UK) and seemingly ceaseless video game discounts - and up next is Sony, promising <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/16/playstation-stores-summer-sale-starts-july-17/">price reductions on over 4500 digital titles</a> during its newly launched PlayStation Store Summer Sale.
</p>
<p>
PlayStation's summer sale is now live and runs for the next four weeks, coming to a close on Wednesday, 14th August. During that time, you'll find discounts - some fairly sizeable - across PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 games, DLC, and other digital products.
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>, for instance, currently has 30 percent off, meaning you can pick it up for £34.99 rather than the usual £49.99. Other big names with decent discounts include Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 (45 percent off), Sea of Thieves (30 percent off), Alan Wake 2 (35 percent off), Resident Evil 4 Remake (25 percent off), Red Dead Redemption 2 (65 percent off), Amored Core 6 (30 percent off), and Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, which is reduced by 35 percent.

If it's first-party titles you're after, you'll find at least a few squirrelled away in the pages of PlayStation's Summer Sale. There's 42 percent off Marvel's Spider-Man, for instance, 50 percent off Returnal and Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart, 77 percent off Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection (meaning you can pick that one up for a very reasonable tenner), and probably a couple more that have eluded my admittedly fairly cursory investigations.
</p>
<p>
For the remaining 4500-ish discounts, just head over to the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/view/7bbceafe-bfa8-11ee-b375-5e45f4e139ac/4ebf500e-3984-11ef-bea7-2625931bc8ce">PlayStation Summer Sale</a> before 14th August. And if anything catches your eye, feel free to share your hearty recommendations / amazing discoveries / stark warnings of potential purchasing misery below.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/video-game-sales-in-the-uk-dropped-by-30-in-first-half-of-the-year/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It comes as no surprise that video game sales have dropped worldwide. The UK isn't the only market to see drastic drops, as Europe also experienced heavy drops in <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-considering-ceasing-marketing-of-xbox-consoles-in-emea-shifting-focus-to-game-pass/">console purchases</a>, especially for Xbox. In the first half of the fiscal year in the UK, video game sales have dropped by a significant 30%.</p>
<p>Many people knew there would be more of a struggle, as there haven't been many "hit" games in the first half of 2024 compared to 2023. According to figures released by the Entertainment Retailers Association, sales of both physical and digital video games have dropped by 29.4%.</p>
<p>Despite the drastic drop in sales, video game sales were still significantly higher than Music sales, which include Vinyls, CDs, and downloads. These sales do exclude the streaming of music, though. While music sales are relatively low, they have risen 7.9% year-over-year to £163.8 million.</p>
<p>Physical game sales have dropped by 40% year-over-year to £111.7 million, with digital downloads dropping by 23% to £263.9 million. Many factors could be causing the drop in sales, with much of it being attributed to video games being too expensive for many people. Additionally, digital games are often cheaper and can be bought on third-party websites for a significant discount.</p>
<p>"It was a tough first half for the games business with a lack of heavy-hitting releases, but we are optimistic for the second half, the traditional time for blockbuster releases," says <a href="https://www.eraltd.org/music-outpaces-video-and-games-in-first-half-of-2024-with-sales-revenues-up-7-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Entertainment Retailers Association</a> CEO Kim Bayley.</p>
<p>With games such as the Silent Hill 2 remake, Super Mario Party Jamboree, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, and Assassin's Creed Shadows all due to be released in the second half of the year, video game sales may pick up once again.</p>
<p>Video game sales have been struggling immensely in the UK due to the cost-of-living crisis, where people can barely afford to survive, let alone purchase video games. Pair this with the lack of major games being released, and annual video game sales have dropped significantly and have fallen behind movie revenues for the first time since 2012.</p>
<p>Overall, the video games industry has struggled recently, with layoffs, studios closing down, and games being scrapped right before release. It's been a volatile time for the entertainment industry as a whole, and we can only hope it improves before it worsens.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/07/17/bioware-on-returning-to-the-dragon-age-series-10-years-after-inquisition<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>With 10 years between 2014's Dragon Age: Inquisition, the most recent release in the series, and the upcoming Dragon Age: The Veilguard, the latter has much riding on it. It's both a follow-up to a beloved game from a decade ago in one of BioWare’s most beloved series, and it's the first BioWare game since the launch of 2019's <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/anthem/grinding-gears#:~:text=Anthem%20should%20have%20been%20all,back%20from%20being%20truly%20engrossing.">Anthem</a>, a live-service multiplayer effort <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/02/24/anthem-20-canceled-by-bioware">EA sunset less than two years later</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Curious about the pressure surrounding the release of Veilguard, I spoke to BioWare about lessons learned from following up on Inquisition and what it's been like returning to this series so many years later.&nbsp;</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="bc45e650-3205-4ae7-b276-95ff203343c7" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>"We start out in pre-production," BioWare general manager Gary McKay tells me when I ask about BioWare's guiding principle for developing Veilguard. "We spent a lot of time iterating, experimenting, and innovating on different things. At one point, it was multiplayer – we did a hard look at multiplayer, but we felt we really couldn't return to our roots. And when we asked ourselves, 'What is the game that we want to develop,' we really wanted to get back to our roots, which is amazing storytelling. It's about those unforgettable characters. And it's about having the opportunity to influence the world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"And we really felt multiplayer wouldn't do that. But single-player RPG is really where we wanted to spend our time, so after spending that time in pre-production, really honing in on what the vision of this game is, and [being] afforded the opportunity to deliver on the creative promise of this game, [now] we're really excited about what's coming out."</p>

<p>McKay says Veilguard blends seasoned veterans with new voices and perspectives, and "that's really important for this game." For example, people like former Dragon Age producer Mark Darrah, who left the studio in 2021 but is now consulting for Veilguard, and creative director John Epler together have decades of experience at BioWare. They work with people like game director Corinne Busche, who joined BioWare shortly after the launch of Anthem (but brings in a love of Dragon Age from the series' 2009 start), every day to develop the game we'll be playing this fall.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"[You] want to have different perspectives, different backgrounds," McKay says. "If you bring a bunch of people together that have only known one thing, that's not where you see creativity. That's not where innovation comes from. Innovation comes when you have [...] that past history and blend it with some new voices and perspectives."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Darrah has been attached to BioWare in some capacity since its early Baldur's Gate days, and when I ask him about the studio's progression from that series to the next Dragon Age, he says it's been amazing. "The thing that is so amazing about Veilguard is this is the game where we finally said out loud that BioWare's greatest strength is telling stories through characters. If you go all the way back to Baldur's Gate 1, Baldur's Gate 2, these games are telling stories through characters, but there wasn't an intentionality behind that. And in this game, we're finally putting that intentionality first and foremost, putting the characters first, building the game around that, around those character moments, which is really the best way that BioWare knows how to tell stories."&nbsp;</p>

<p>I ask Darrah if there's anything Veilguard is doing that BioWare wanted to do on previous games but couldn't, and he says, "Storytelling through animation." In previous games, each character moves in "exactly the same way," and everyone is homogenous in that way, he says. "If you put on a suit of armor, and you put it on Alistair, you looked exactly the same standing right beside each other.</p>

<p>"Now, we're able to keep the character coming through in the visuals and the motion, even as you're customizing them, which just wasn't possible in the past."&nbsp;</p>

<p>He also mentions BioWare's confidence in its game development engine for Veilguard, which, like Inquisition, uses EA's proprietary Frostbite. "Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age II were doing what they could with the technology they had; Dragon Age: Inquisition did a good job of using Frostbite respective of the engine," Darrah says. "But with this game, there's a better understanding of the engines over a lot more time, but also, the technology of the hardware that the game is going to be played on moving forward [is] able to do a lot more stuff [and] execute it visually to a degree that just wasn't possible in the past."&nbsp;</p>



<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y_61F9GBGq4" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>With 10 years between Inquisition and Veilguard, BioWare has to balance satisfying longtime fans of the series with newcomers jumping in for the first time. Epler says the studio worked hard to ensure Veilguard is respectful and referential to previous games without feeling like you need to have played Inquisition, Dragon Age II, or Origins to fully understand what's going on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"So while there are references, there are moments that we have callbacks, it really is its own story, its own continuation with a different cast, with different characters," he says. "Historically, Dragon Age has always had a different cast per game, so that gives us a lot of freedom in terms of what we want to lean on in the past and what we want to really bring in that’s new and forward-facing."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Darrah adds that Veilgaurd's events play out with a storytelling goal for the future of the series. "This is a game which takes the ball that Inquisition had, puts its own spin on it, has its own characters, takes its own direction, but continues the path forward into the future," he says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Dragon Age has always been about change. Every game has had a new protagonist, and it's been exploring its own space all the time, and this game is no different. [Veilguard] does a good job of bridging that gap. The really super fans of Dragon Age have actually made a lot of really educated guesses, and some of them are pretty right about where the franchise is going. The thing we need to make sure is that people who may have only played Inquisition are understanding what the franchise is really about – it's about a new protagonist, it's about change, it's about evolution – and don't come in expecting a direct sequel to a game they played and then are disappointed. This game is something new, something that evolves, something that is greater than what came before, the same as each game [...] before it."&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Busche, balancing newcomers and fan expectations in Veilguard is about managing assumptions. She says Veilguard takes place in a part of Thedas BioWare has only hinted at. The team has hinted at the Grey Warden fortress of Weisshaupt, the depths of Arlathan Forest, the Rivain Coast, the Grand Necropolis of Nevarra, and Minrathous, but now players will finally go to these stories' locations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We have a rich history of world-building within the IP, so existing players will be familiar with these places and very excited to go to them and explore their mysteries," Busche tells me. "But for our new players, we're not assuming you know anything about these locations. I would say that also extends to the characters; we've taken great care in how we introduce each and every single companion and major story figure within the game [with that in mind]."</p>

<p>Epler tells me that Veilguard differs from Inquisition and other Dragon Age games in the way that Rook, the player character, can't save the world without the characters they meet on their journey.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Dragon Age has always been about characters but to some degree, it's almost felt like we've lucked into that," he says. "Inquisition is a story that ultimately, you, the main character [...] have the biggest part to play. We wanted to tell a story this time where you literally cannot save the world without these characters. Beyond that, though, we also wanted to give them their own arcs that can run parallel to the main story and really give them that kind of deep storytelling our fans really enjoy."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Though he's biased for obvious reasons, Epler says Veilguard is his favorite Dragon Age game he's worked on (and he's worked on all of them, starting as a quality assurance tester on Origins). He says one reason for this is the storytelling in the characters, companions, and relationships.&nbsp;</p>

</article><p>"They have their friendships, they have their rivalries, and lean into that concept," he tells me. "You're not just pulling together a bunch of people who will do whatever you say. You're assembling a family, and that becomes the core of what the Veilguard is all about. It's about taking this group, this found family, and saving the world, side by side with them."&nbsp;</p>

			<p>For those who love to explore the world of stealth and assassination, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hitman-3-world-of-assassination-hitman-1-2-content-free/">HITMAN World of Assassination</a> features a brand new mission in which you can see the iconic Conor McGregor in-game. <a href="https://ioi.dk/hitman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The collaboration</a> has been out for a little while now and will be available until July 29. It's become incredibly popular and has drawn over 150,000 players to the game.</p>
<p>Conor McGregor appears in-game as a combat sports fighter and multi-millionaire, The Disruptor. Not only does it have his voice in the game, but the character features his likeness, too. This mission is available to all players for free through the Free Starter Pack and as an Elusive Target.</p>
<p>The Disruptor is incredibly popular compared to other Elusive Targets in the game. As it stands, 150,000 daily players are trying to make their way through the game to take him down. These statistics come from the indie game developer IO Interactive, responsible for the Hitman franchise.</p>
<p>Currently, only 47% of players who have attempted this mission have successfully eliminated The Disruptor. Many of the player base who have completed the mission went for hand-to-hand combat to get the whole experience rather than assassinating him outright. 27% of players chose to participate in the cage duel with The Disruptor, which completes the mission if done correctly.</p>
<p>The fastest runtime for this mission comes at a snappy 15 seconds, barely giving The Disruptor any time to get his speech in before he is taken down for good. Some players are deciding to have a bit more fun with it, though, and some have decided to take over 16 agonizing hours to get rid of The Disruptor.</p>
<p>IO Interactive released an info graphic that includes all of the details you need to know about how The Disruptor has been killed in people's Hitman III experiences. Some of the wackiest ways to kill him include using a pair of headphones, a Battle Axe, and the Pale Duck.</p>
<p><iframe title="HITMAN: World of Assassination - The Disruptor (featuring Conor McGregor) Mission Briefing" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wjc8i5S_Ecc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Today, IO Interactive has released a paid DLC called The Disruptor Pack. This includes The Ostentatious, which grants players permanent access to the Elusive Target, some brand-new cosmetics for the Freelancer Safehouse, and three new items. This also comes The Season of the Disruptor, where new content for HITMAN World of Assassination will be released over the coming weeks, including brand-new challenges and contracts.</p>
<p>For those who want to get their hands on the Disruptor Pack, you can purchase it now for $4.99/£3.99, available on every platform.</p>

It’s a well-deserved nomination for the show, which does an exceptional job of stringing multiple storylines together into a cohesive plot with the signature satirical yet poignant tone of the games. Goggins is equally deserving of praise for essentially pulling double duty as Cooper Howard, a centerpiece in the show’s flashbacks, as well as The Ghoul, a central character in its “current” timeline. Even with these two nominations, it does feel like a snub to leave out Ella Purnell who portrays Lucy, the de facto lead of the show. </p><p>This marks the third year in a row that a video game adaptation has made its way into the nominees. 2022 saw <em>League of Legends</em> show <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/league-of-legends-arcane-is-the-best-show-on-netflix-ri-1848062117&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/league-of-legends-arcane-is-the-best-show-on-netflix-ri-1848062117"><em>Arcane</em></a></span> take home Outstanding Animated Program while <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-tv-review-pedro-pascal-joel-ellie-bill-1849969496&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-tv-review-pedro-pascal-joel-ellie-bill-1849969496">HBO’s<em> The Last of Us</em></a></span> scored 24 nominations (including Outstanding Drama Series) and four wins. This year <em>Fallout </em>should enjoy the honor of being nominated, because there’s a fairly low chance that it (or Goggins) will actually take home an award. That’s because of a little series called <span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CN4HV16N?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/2024-emmy-nominations-fallout-walton-goggins-shogun-1851597281&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="B0CN4HV16N" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20"><em>Shōgun</em></a></span>.</p><p>FX’s truly epic adaptation of the 1975 James Clavell book of the same name earned 25 nominations, and will probably go home with a majority of those come awards night. <em>Shōgun </em>is a masterful drama series full of political intrigue and incredible characters, all tied together by one of the strongest casts of a show in years. It’s led by legendary actor Hiroyuki Sanada, alongside a bombshell performance from Anna Sawai (both earned nominations) and numerous other memorable supporting actors. <em>Shōgun</em> also becomes the second foreign-language program in the history of the awards to earn a nomination for Original Drama Series—the first being <em>Squid Game</em> in 2022. Interestingly, the first television adaptation of <em>Shōgun </em>also garnered a number of nominations at the 1981 Emmys, eventually taking home the award for Outstanding Limited Series. So as good as <em>Fallout</em> is, it doesn’t seem likely that this will be the year a video game adaptation takes home the big prize.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Nothing stimulates the imagination quite like exploring an alien planet as storms gather in the background and blades of grass flutter around in the cool breeze. While some other space games turn take-off and landing into loading screens, breaking the atmospheric barrier in <em>No Man’s Sky</em> is one of the most breathtaking things about it.</p><p>These moments are when <em>No Man’s Sky</em>’s procedurally generated universe makes anything feel possible, and also where its Worlds Part 1 update looks to breathe the most new life into the game’s aging bones. Even if you’ve never played it before, new shots of rolling fog, ash clouds, and ocean tides help <em>No Man’s Sky </em>tug at your weirdest sci-fi dreams in even more ways.

All of the updates since 2016 have also been free, so no paying extra to nuke bugs with mech flamethrowers in this latest update, either. But one of the best things about <em>No Man’s Sky</em> is that you don’t even need to play it to appreciate its cosmic beauty. Here are 19 screenshots from the new update that will inspire your planetary adventurer for free. </p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>EA Sports FC 25 gave <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-sports-fc-25-trailer-and-features-announced/">everyone a first look with its first trailer</a> and features reveal on Wednesday. With all the announcements, however, the biggest might just be the inclusion of a women’s career mode in EA Sports FC 25 for the first time. </p>



<p>“Play an authentic Women’s Career experience using a club or player from the top five women’s leagues,” EA Sports said as part of the reveal. </p>



<p>Those <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-fc/fc-25/news/authenticity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">leagues include</a> the National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL), Barclays Women’s Super League, Liga F, Google Pixel Frauen-Bundesliga, and Arkema Première Ligue. There will also be the UEFA Women’s Champions League within the game for players to enjoy. </p>



<p>It’s been a couple years since the inclusion of the NWSL made its way to EA Sports’ soccer franchise. Since then, the presence of women in the game has only grown into what players will get now.</p>



<p>A full deep dive on how the women’s career mode in EA Sports FC 25 will come prior to the game’s launch. EA Sports FC 25 releases for Xbox, PlayStation, PC, and Nintendo Switch on September 20 for those who purchase the Ultimate Edition of the game. Purchasing the Standard Edition of the game will see the game released on September 20.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/fc-25-71-changes-that-actually-make-a-difference<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Jude Bellingham may not have sealed the perfect season by lifting the Euro 2024 trophy with England, but he does at least have the small consolation of becoming EA FC’s (or FIFA’s) youngest-ever cover star at the age of just 21. EA FC 25 will be released on September 27th, 2024, or a week early on September 20th if you purchase early access. But what’s new this time around? </p><p>For annual sports releases, offering an enticing suite of tweaks and additions is a must to keep things feeling fresh, and with a new 5v5 mode, a completely overhauled approach to tactics, and those all-important Ultimate Team adjustments in the mix, FC 25 has a few tricks up its sleeve. So, without further ado, here are 71 changes that actually make a difference in EA FC 25.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>FC 25 Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2><u>Rush</u></h2><p><strong>1. Rush is a brand-new 5v5 mode that is included in all formats of FC 25, including PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch versions. It isn’t a standalone offering but is playable across four modes - Kick Off, Ultimate Team, Clubs, and Career Mode.</strong></p><p>2. Rush’s introduction comes at the expense of Volta, which will not be returning this year as a standalone mode but will appear in kick-off as a 3v3 match option.</p><p>3. Matches last seven minutes in total, with a further two minutes and 20 seconds of golden goal played in the scores are level. If after that things are still tied, a penalty shootout will settle it.</p><p>4. While being a five-a-side mode, Rush is actually built with four players in mind, with the goalkeeper being AI-controlled.</p><p>5. There are no fixed positions in Rush, meaning it will be up to you and your teammates to take responsibility and not just all run forward at once.</p><p><strong>6. Unlike Volta, Rush utilises the same core gameplay as standard 11v11 matches but comes with its own subset of rules:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Kick-offs have been reinvented so that each team runs towards the centre circle as the ball is launched into play. Think of it a little like the beginning of a game of Rocket League.</strong></li><li><strong>There are offsides in Rush, but only once you step inside the final third of the pitch, as opposed to the standard halfway line cutoff point.</strong></li><li><strong>There are no red cards in Rush, but instead blue cards are brandished for serious offenses, resulting in a one minute sin bin for that player. This time is reduced by 15 seconds for each opponent scored within that time frame. Two yellow cards result in a blue.</strong></li><li><strong>Penalties are completely different. Taken from the “final third line”, they’re essentially a one-on-one opportunity with the keeper – something not too dissimilar to what we see in hockey.</strong></li></ul><p>7. All Rush matches take place in the custom-built Rush Stadium, built in collaboration with Nike, and shaped like the brand’s line of Mercurial football boots. It’s futuristic in its design, and can even display environmental effects like colourful drone shows.</p><h2><u>FC IQ</u></h2><p><strong>8. FC IQ is a complete overhaul of the tactics system in EA FC and it aims to give even greater flexibility to players.</strong></p><p>9. FC 25 will launch with 31 player roles with an expectation of growing to over 50 during the course of the season. These roles are selected after you’ve placed a player in a position in your formation.</p><p>10. Three-to-five roles exist for each position. For example, a central attacking midfielder (CAM) can be picked between shadow striker, playmaker, and others. These directly affect both their offensive and defensive positioning on the pitch and the runs they’ll make off the ball.</p><p>11. The centre forward (CF) and wing-back (LWB and RWB) positions have been removed entirely from the game.</p><p>12. Wing backs can still be manufactured, however, by selecting the attacking wing-back option when choosing your left or right back’s role.</p><p>13. Through extensive Opta data research, each player has been assigned optimal roles that they will perform better when assigned. The better their familiarity with a role, the better their work rate.</p><p>14. As a result, the old attacking and defending work rate stats have been removed for FC 25. </p><p>15. Some elite players even have roles they’ve mastered, such as Vinicius Jr. cutting in from the left wing. As a result, he gets a “role plus” icon when positioned as an inside forward at LW. </p><p>16. Within each role, you can also choose the focus of that player’s movement, whether it be attacking, roaming, etc.</p><p><strong>17. FC IQ as a whole allows for more experimenting with formations, with player roles allowing for asymmetric formations to exist and for overloads of certain wings to be created. The half-wing role for central midfielders combined with both a winger and fullback is a prime example of this.</strong></p><p>18. For those not wanting to get lost too deeply in the world of FC IQ, preset tactics exist for those wishing to emulate the likes of Klopp’s gegenpress or Guardiola’s tiki-taka styles.</p><p>19. Up to five fully custom tactics can be created and switched between on the fly during matches. These can also be shared with other players online via uniquely generated cross-platform codes.</p><p>20. A new commentary system dynamically responds to tactical shifts being made during the match.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><u>Gameplay</u></h2><p>21. In FC 25 Hypermotion technology now allows for authentic representation of running styles, with 1,800 players now moving as accurately as possible. In 24, the upper bodies were accurate, but now the lower bodies are too.</p><p>22. Six PlayStyles are now available for goalkeepers. These include footwork, rush out, deflector, cross claimer, far throw and far reach.</p><p><strong>23. A new professional foul button input allows you to cynically take out your opponent by dragging them down. This results in an automatic yellow card.</strong></p><p>24. Players will now not automatically find an opponent with blindly played 180-degree passes, unless their passing stats are ridiculously high.</p><p>25. Five new skills moves are available to tease your opponent with. These are the toe drag step-over, the step-over ball, the heel nutmeg, the drag turn, and the big fade.</p><p>26. More contextual animations can be seen involving goalposts and advertising hoardings, some of which look extremely painful. If the name Phil Babb means anything to you, you’ll know exactly what I mean.</p><p>27. New weather effects can affect the way you play, such as very high winds that make the ball bend a significant amount and a slippery pitch that makes your players fall over. These are available in offline play only as a matter of fairness.</p><p>28. You can now celebrate with official club mascots after scoring a goal in a number of choreographed routines. Who doesn’t want to see Heung-Min Son doing Richarlison’s El Pombo dance with Chirpy the Spurs cockerel?</p><h2><u>Ultimate Team</u></h2><p>29. In Ultimate Team, Rush is a social space that’s a break from the more competitive modes within it. You’ll bring one of your player cards into the match with them to play as and there can’t be any duplicates between you and your teammates.</p><p>30. There will be Rush squad requirements that change regularly, such as only being able to use La Liga players.</p><p>31. Completing Rush matches in FUT will earn you Rush Points, which can be used to complete objectives and earn rewards.</p><p>32. FC IQ aims to shake up the FUT meta on a regular basis. The sheer amount of options available, plus the steady introduction of new player roles, are contributing factors towards this.</p><p>33. Team of the Week cards can give players new player roles depending on how they performed in the game that earned them the card. For example, Bellingham could specialise in a playmaker role if he played a bit deeper in midfield that week.</p><p><strong>34. Speaking of cards, players can now store up to 100 untradeable duplicates for use in SBCs.</strong></p><p>35. A new upgrading system with more open requirements aims to make player evolutions more attainable, meaning you’ll be able to upgrade your favourite players more often.</p><p>36. More customisation options are also being provided for evolution cards, meaning you can change their colour, choose sound effects, and add dynamic animated effects such as fireworks.</p><p>37. Matchmaking systems between rivals and friendlies have now been decoupled, meaning that friendlies should no longer feel as competitive, and hopefully, more relaxed.</p><p><strong>38. A points-based system for weekly rewards is being added to rivals. In standard football rules, you’ll gain three points for a win and one for a draw, meaning a draw no longer feels like a complete waste of time.</strong></p><p>39. Relegations are being introduced at the top end of divisions.</p><p>40. Increased rewards distribution means that players of a higher skill level will gain even greater rewards at the top levels of rivals.</p><p>41. A new stadium has been created for Ultimate Team in FC 25 with an expanded away team section allowing you to show off in someone else’s arena a bit more obviously. </p><p>42. The amount of customisation items has been decreased, meaning that you’ll be wading through fewer menus and they’ll have a greater impact when you swap them in and out.</p><p>43. The FUT and Clubs season passes are now being combined into one overarching pass that you’ll earn progress in no matter which mode you spend more time in. You’ll no longer have to prioritise playing one mode more than the other just to earn rewards.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><u>Clubs</u></h2><p><strong>44. Relegation is back. In FC 25, losing enough matches will trigger a one-off relegation battle where you'll need to avoid a loss to survive the drop.</strong></p><p>45. Rush is a key component of Clubs in FC 25 as you aim to climb the Rush ranks with your team. It’s also great if you’re like me and struggle to find more than three friends to play with at any time!</p><p>46. There are also Rush player ranks to climb up individually in order to gain greater rewards. You’ll gain points by winning matches, but also through goals, assists, etc.</p><p>47. The club manager now has the power to allocate budget toward facility cards that offer unique gameplay attribute boosts.</p><p>48. Defining your club identity on the pitch with a facility budget that grows as your club reputation improves facilities, and unlocks the power of club reputation, providing a tangible benefit for building long-term success with your club.</p><p>49. Each of the 20 to 30 facility cards comes with a one-star, two-star, or three-star variant each providing a unique attribute benefit to impact all the human members of the club and not the AI.</p><p>50. The options available to the club manager add a whole new level of importance to that manager's role within the club. Do you spend your budget on a two-star shooting coach and some finishing nets to increase the finishing of all your club mates? Or maybe you opt for a three-star weight room to maximize everyone's strength.</p><p>51. A dynamic clubhouse screen, complete with your team's colours and crest, now shows you and your teammates appear in the changing room as you arrive online for your next match.</p><p>52. You’ll be able to customise your avatar in far greater detail than ever before, thanks to EA Sport Cranium, new facial sculpting tech that allows for much more variety in player models.</p><h2><u>Career Mode</u></h2><p><strong>53. Women’s teams are available to manage for the first time ever in career mode. Five major leagues are included, as well as the Women’s Champions League. Both men's and women's clubs can be managed within a single career mode save.</strong></p><p>54. Live Start Points will allow you to start a career save from a real-life point in the upcoming season. For example, taking charge of a struggling, injury-hit Chelsea at Christmas and helping them avoid the drop through the rest of the season.</p><p>55. Live Start Points can be started in 11 of the top leagues in football and also take in the state of six major cup competitions.</p><p>56. Players can now be trained to gain familiarity with certain roles brought in with FC IQ. You can teach Haaland the movement skills of a false nine, for example, if you want him to fit more naturally into Pep’s Man City system.</p><p>57. Over 90 countries have been added to scouting, meaning over 160 nations can now be looked at for the next big talent.</p><p>58. Youth players now look more like men (or boys) of their age and will grow older over time, get taller, and gain facial hair, etc.</p><p>59. You can now play matches with your youth development players, but only in the Rush mode against other youth teams. These are tournaments that happen every two months and consist of three matches each.</p><p>60. You can choose to play with these youth players at their current overall rating or their projected full potential, just to see what they might be like 10 years down the road.</p><p>61. Social media transfer guru Fabrizio Romano has made his way into the in-game social feed to announce signings made in career mode. Get ready to be absolutely sick of seeing the words “Here we go”.</p><p><strong>62. You can now start a player career save as one of a few select Icons. At launch, you can choose from Andrea Pirlo, Ruud Van Nistelrooy, Theirry Henry, and Kelly Smith. Those who pre-order will also gain access to Zinedine Zidane, David Beckham, and Ronaldo (the better, Brazilian one). More Icons will be delivered to career mode throughout the season and you can play with them at any club of your choosing. Eusebio at Grimsby Town is no longer the dream it may once have been.</strong></p><p>63. There are three new ways to start a player career, thanks to origin stories. These backstories start you at different points in a player’s life and include the pressures of being the child of a legend, someone bursting onto the scene from the streets, and a player coming back from a serious injury.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><u>Presentation</u></h2><p>64. There’s more action than ever on the touchline as sideline moments are cut to during the match broadcast. These can be extended celebrations, or perhaps Mikel Arteta and his subs getting annoyed at yet another act of perceived injustice.</p><p><strong>65. For the first time ever, FC 25 will offer graphics mode options that can be switched between, but both offer 60fps. </strong></p><p><strong>66. The default is Enhanced Visuals mode offers enhanced lighting, including ray tracing, and graphic details, and will upscale to 4K resolution. </strong></p><p><strong>67. Favour Resolution mode uses the standard lighting setup, but renders at native 4K.</strong></p><p>68. Time will progress throughout the course of a match. You may start a game as the sun is setting, but end it under a pitch-black sky.</p><p>69. More POV angles will be built into the broadcast this time around. These short cutscenes may play before corners, penalties, and kick-offs.</p><p>70. Sizzle montages remain before games, but now you have the option to opt in and watch a full match intro if you really want to build the atmosphere before a big game.</p><p>71. The previously mentioned EA Sports Cranium tech has allowed generic faces to mostly become a thing of the past. Now players who haven’t had an official scan put into the game still look a little like their real-life counterparts.</p><p>And those are 71 exciting things coming to EA FC 25. We’ll have plenty more about the beautiful game coming to IGN over the next few months.</p><p><em>Simon Cardy will watch football endlessly, even if it only brings him pain.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/fc-25-developers-say-they-welcome-a-true-competitor-with-a-new-fifa-waiting-in-the-wings<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"It can only be a great thing for our players."</h2></div><section><p>The developers of FC 25 have welcomed genuine competition in the soccer video game space amid rumors of a new FIFA game entering the market.</p><p>EA Sports ditched the FIFA license in 2022, launching its new FC series with FC 24 in 2023. But the FIFA series is set to return with a different developer and partner, with 2K heavily rumored to have taken on the license by partnering with football’s governing body, FIFA.</p><p>In May, FIFA president Gianni Infantino confirmed a new FIFA game was in the works, saying: “We will develop a new e-game, because (the) football simulation game is called FIFA. For hundreds of millions of children around the world, when they play (a) football simulation game, they play FIFA. It cannot be named something else.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>FC 25 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>“We are developing with new partners a new game which obviously, as everything we do, will be the best. So get ready for the new FIFA e-game.”</p><p>2K, owned by Take-Two, already makes a number of successful annualized sports games including its NBA 2K series. FIFA then, may relaunch under this banner, titled FIFA 2K.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It can only be a great thing for our players in our community.</p></div><p>During an FC 25 reveal event at EA Sports’ Vancouver headquarters, IGN asked Karthik Venkateshan, Line Producer on the Ultimate Team mode, and Richard Walz, Game Design Director on Ultimate Team, if they’d welcome the challenge of a new FIFA game coming from a major AAA publisher.</p><p>"Yes,” Venkateshan replied. “As creatives, it's always so interesting to see how other people are approaching the same problem spaces that we're approaching, how they are interpreting football, how they want to solve the same things for other players. And I don't know, it energizes me as a football fan myself."</p><p>"I agree,” Walz added. “And as a player as well, I think it can only be a great thing for our players in our community. Yeah, that's great."</p><p>IGN also spoke with Lead Gameplay Producer Sam Rivera, who echoed his colleagues comments, insisting EA Sports has not succumbed to complacency despite a lack of competition in recent years.</p><p>"We welcome competition," he said. "I think it's good for everyone to see what other football simulation engines can do. Absolutely. What I can tell you is that creating a deep simulation experience like a football simulation experience, it takes a long time. It takes many, many years of polishing, balancing. We literally every year check in thousands of changes based on community feedback and improvements that we want to make to the game. All that just doesn't appear from scratch. You need to build it over the years. So what we have done over the last 15, 20 years for us, we're very happy with our game and we'll continue."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>EA Sports has had its own way with football video games for years now, with Konami, once the market leader with its Pro Evolution Soccer series, struggling to compete with EA particularly when it comes to high-profile licenses. Konami went through its own rebrand, switching from PES to the eFootball series with disastrous results.</p><p>It would perhaps feel odd for the developers at EA Sports who worked on FIFA games for so long to be faced with having to compete with a new FIFA series from a different developer. But, as Walz suggested, competition will surely benefit the player. EA Sports is often accused of failing to justify the $70 cost of its new football video game each year, with some suggesting FC would be better off as a potentially free-to-play live service with paid expansions. Perhaps FIFA 2K25, or whatever it ends up being called, will serve not only to shake up the football video game market, but EA Sports itself.</p><p>While we wait to find out, check out <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fc-25-71-changes-that-actually-make-a-difference">IGN’s hands-on FC 25 preview</a>, in which we reveal 71 changes made for this year’s game.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

It’s worth noting both graphical options offer 60 frames per second during gameplay to retain responsiveness.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>FC 25 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>In a reveal event at EA Sports’ Vancouver, Canada headquarters, Fab Muoio, line producer, match experiences, outlined the benefits of these new graphics options, while confirming FC 25 will default to Enhanced Visuals.</p><p>“FC 25 will have ray traced and occlusion as part of enhanced visuals,” Muoio explained. “We'll have full cloth sim on the jersey and the shorts during gameplay, self-shadowing at all times of the day, rim lighting on the players. So what that does is the closeup shots will really punch out from the background, and give you more depth to the frame. And then we will have 3D pitch divots and puddles as well.</p><p>“Particularly with shadowing, we see the shadowing on the pitch, on the player, even in the crowd we see that impact of the shadows there.”</p><p>Muoio continued: “Looking at Favour Resolution, we have cloth sim on the shorts only during gameplay and self-shadowing is only available during the day.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>In another first, FC 25 will show time progression during a match. “So in the first half the sun may be setting, in the second half, it'll be nighttime,” Muoio said.</p><p>FC 25 is due out September 27, with early access through the Ultimate Edition beginning September 20, across PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X and S, Xbox One, PC, and Nintendo Switch.

            <link>https://aftermath.site/gaggiuino-gaggia-classic-pro-mod-open-source-hack</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-espresso-machine-is-one-you-hack-yourself.930078/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/gaggiuino-gaggia-classic-pro-mod-open-source-hack<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I don’t like drip coffee, but I love espresso. This is annoying, because espresso is a huge pain to do correctly at home, and because espresso culture is the far deep end of coffee culture and an onerous subject to make a hobby out of. Pulling a cafe-quality shot at home is an expensive proposition, and getting a halfway decent machine under a thousand dollars has always been a challenge. But a project called <a href="https://gaggiuino.github.io/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gaggiuino</a> changed that math, transforming a decades-old classic coffee machine into something totally different and forcing me to fully dive head first into a hobby I had resisted the pull of for ages.</p><h2><strong>Where To Begin</strong></h2><p>If you go into espresso forums, at the entry level price point you will often be recommended a few viable options. First you have manual espresso machines, like the <a href="https://flairespresso.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flair </a>and the goofy little <a href="http://www.cafelat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cafelat</a> robot. Those are nice and portable but labor intensive and take a lot of skill to dial in. Beyond that your options are one of two models: the Rancilio Silvia and the Gaggia Classic/Gaggia Classic Pro. These espresso machines are iconic not for being the best but for being the first real valid entry point. The Gaggia is simple enough in construction that they can be easily taken apart and upgraded with additions like a spring swap to change the stock pressure, a PID controller, a new frothing wand, and more. The temperature and pressure mods in particular are important, because out of the box the Gaggia Classic produces too much for most people trying to pull a solid shot.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="You Won't Believe the Difference: 9 Bar OPV Mod for Gaggia Classic Pro" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/txWyLHnuuz0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Tried and true: the 9 bar OPV mod.</figcaption></figure></div><p>While those are all great upgrades, there is nothing revolutionary about them. But the Gaggiuino mod takes the Gaggia Classic and Gaggia Classic Pro (with experimental, community-driven support for machines like the Rancilio Silvia and, the developer writes, “[basically] any machine operating with a vibratory pump”) and completely upends it. By adding an STM32 “Blackpill'' microcontroller, a touchscreen, a temperature sensor, an SSR relay and several other parts, you gain total control of the device.</p><figure><figcaption>Peak Coffee orders a pre-made kit for the Gaggiuino mod with every part you need for the process, although keep in mind it is back-ordered a lot. Credit: <a href="https://www.peakcoffee.cc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Peak Coffee</a></figcaption></figure><p>With Gaggiuino, you can exactly control the pressure, temperature, and flow of the shot over the exact duration of the shot, and build that behavior out as a custom profile. One pre-programmed profile attempts to mimic the style of a Londinium R Lever machine. Another creates filter coffee. Yet another preinfuses the basket, allowing the coffee to bloom and maximizing the potential extraction. While other machines do do this (I would be remiss to not mention the <a href="https://decentespresso.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Decent</a> Espresso machine, itself an important milestone), they often cost many thousands of dollars and use proprietary technology. Gaggiuino on the other hand, is user installed and much more open. On top of that, the mod also wildly improves the anemic steam performance of the stock Gaggia, allowing you to make a real solid latte.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>The journey of my Gaggia Classic: Stock, <a href="https://gaggiuino.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">powder-coated</a>, Gaggiuino modded.</figcaption></figure><p>Zer0-bit, the mod’s creator, found his way to the Gaggia Classic modding scene like many other new people getting into the hobby: by first buying a really awful entry-level espresso machine and feeling ripped off. After some research, the Gaggia seemed perfect, but when he got it he found it lacking. “I got the [Gaggia Classic] from eBay,” he told me over Discord. “I quickly realized that I had a lot of inconsistency between shots.” A little research uncovered the<a href="https://www.shadesofcoffee.co.uk/gaggia-classic-pro2019-pid-kit---132din-single-display" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> PID temperature controller mod</a>, a tried and true improvement for the Gaggia, but he was turned off by the industrial look. A few weeks later, the first version of Gaggiuino was born: a simple temperature controller that became the basis of the rest of the mod. What started off as a tiny modification quickly spiraled off into a complex conversion of the machine, completely turning it on its head.</p><h2><strong>On The Grind</strong></h2><figure><figcaption>The DF64 has gone through multiple iterations since its launch. The original had clogging issues, but the guy I bought it from had already added 3D-printed mods. You can get a good deal from espresso guys upgrading their gear. </figcaption></figure><p>Before digging into the modding process, it’s worth noting that a good coffee grinder is more important to have than a good espresso machine. Most grinders you get cannot grind well enough to handle espresso. Being able to accurately adjust grind size to each specific bean (a tedious process known as “dialing in”) is crucial. The old standard entry level recommendation for home espresso was a <a href="https://www.baratza.com/en-us/product/encoretm-zcg485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baratza Encore</a>, and you can still get one of those for 50 bucks on Facebook if you look, but the enthusiast coffee market has entered into an aggressive arms race in the last few years.</p><figure><figcaption>I did not get to test them, but 1Zpresso apparently has some great hand grinders if you don't want to go the machine route. Kingrinder is also well-liked, and they have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPbVUR6Y83k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a $33 that's great for pour-over</a>. Credit <a href="https://1zpresso.coffee/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1Zpresso</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>1Zpresso creates fantastic hand grinders now if you don’t mind a little manual labor, but I wanted something automatic. A nice facet of coffee culture is that coffee guys are often selling their gear to buy new stuff, so I was able to buy an older version of the DF64 grinder with a bunch of anti-clogging mods (necessary for the early models of the machine specifically) from a guy I met on an espresso Discord who had upgraded to a commercial model. It’s a beast of a grinder, weighing in at 15 pounds, and takes up about as much space on my counter as my Vitamix. He also offered to sell me some new, <a href="http://www.sspgrind.com/?ckattempt=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">custom burrs for the machine</a>, but I politely declined as I had not crossed that threshold where I am spending 180 dollars on burrs. To give you a hint of how fast this coffee world moves, since I started writing this blog, the DF54 has emerged on the scene, itself hitting an <a href="https://df64coffee.com/products/df54" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ideal 230 dollar sweet spot</a>. I don’t regret buying my machine, but if I had to do it again I would seriously consider the smaller, lighter machine.</p><figure><a href="https://miicoffee.shop/collections/grinders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a><figcaption>The DF series of grinders are sold by multiple vendors (<a href="https://miicoffee.shop/collections/grinders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MiiCoffee</a>, <a href="https://www.turingrinders.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Turin</a>, <a href="https://espressooutlet.com/collections/turin-grinders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Espresso Outlet</a>, <a href="https://df64coffee.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DF64 Coffee</a>) at various price points and sizes.

Like me, he too had been contemplating pulling the trigger on the mod, but decided against it. And like the guy who sold me the grinder, he too had upgraded his machine, the Gaggia once again entering the secondhand ecosystem of Facebook Marketplace. <a href="https://aftermath.site/theyll-let-you-powder-coat-just-about-anything" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">One beautiful teal powder coating job later,</a> and I was ready to dig into the world of DIY espresso machine hacking.</p><p>There are multiple ways to approach the Gaggiuino mod. You can either buy a <a href="https://www.peakcoffee.cc/product/gaggiuino-v3-pcb-i/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">standard PCB</a> from an approved vendor like Peak Coffee or a <a href="https://www.peakcoffee.cc/product/gaggiuino-pcb-kit-gaggia-classic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full kit</a> that has all the hardware you need to start. You can also do what’s called a <a href="https://gaggiuino.github.io/#/guides-stm32/lego-component-build-guide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lego build</a>, where you buy the constituent components and solder them together. This is a lot of work, so I just went all out and bought the kit because I didn’t want to have to account for ordering dozens of tiny parts from Aliexpress (which the documentation lists). As of this writing there is a significant backlog to get kits from Peak Coffee, and it took me a few months to get mine, but this could potentially be alleviated in the future with more vendors. Plastic parts like housing for the PCB and screen enclosures are meant to be 3D printed, and Peak links to several vendors that offer this service for select models. I was fortunate enough to have several good friends who 3D print regularly, but there’s countless services for this.</p><figure><figcaption>My mod in the process of being installed, before zipties, a power cable mod and cable management. Please do not use this as a reference it is wired incorrectly. </figcaption></figure><p>The Gaggiuino is not a mod for the faint of heart. There are currently no official video tutorials on how to do it, in part because there is a lot of variation between different versions of the Gaggia. You need very strict cable management, and it’s important to understand and follow every part of the documentation to the letter, particularly the wiring diagrams, because you are dealing with high voltage wiring, hot steam and electronics. While reassembling the machine after my powder coating, I accidentally switched two wires and did not quadruple check the diagram. After getting the mod setup, I turned the machine on for the first time, the screen booted up briefly and I heard a loud popping as a component fried on the circuit board. This was luckily not a project-ending error. I simply <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/panasonic-electric-works/AQH3213/2125782" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ordered a new part from Digikey</a>, desoldered the old one, cleaned off the PCB and swapped the new chip in. Support for the Gaggiuino mod is community-based and takes place on the Discord. If you have difficulty, simply start a thread and the mods will help you through as best they can.</p><figure><figcaption>During my install process I accidentally swapped two lines (L and N) and blew a chip on the board. Luckily, the part costs less than <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/panasonic-electric-works/AQH3213/2125782" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2 dollars from Digikey</a> and after desoldering the old one the mod worked fine.</figcaption></figure><p>After a few afternoons mucking around inside my repainted 90s Gaggia Classic, I finally finished the mod and turned it on. The machine sputtered to life, and informed me that it was filling the boiler. I carefully dosed 18 grams of beans, mixed them in a small bowl with a moist spoon handle (<a href="https://thebasicbarista.com/en-us/blogs/topics/how-rdt-broke-changed-the-game-benefits-and-reasons-why-people-spray-their-coffee-beans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this is called RDT</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLnB99VJ0HE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most people use a tiny spray bottle</a>), and ground them. I de-clumped the ground coffee, tamped it, and locked my bottomless portafilter into place. I selected a profile and flicked the switch. The machine hummed on and the pump started chugging away, slowly preinfusing the puck before ramping the pressure up and pulling roughly 36 grams of espresso.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>The mod pulling a less than perfect shot (I am dialing in beans here.) I haven't decided on espresso cups yet so I used a mysterious cat <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaiwan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gaiwan </a>I bought on Etsy. </figcaption></figure><p>The mod allows for <a href="https://gaggiuino.github.io/#/accessories/hw-scales" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hardware scales</a> to be installed inside the machine itself, so the machine will stop pulling the shot when it hits the precise amount of espresso you’ve asked for. If you don’t have scales installed, it can use what’s called “predictive scales” to estimate roughly when it should stop pulling the shot based on pressure and flow. I gave it a test and was blown away. Trying to get a drinkable shot with the stock Gaggia Classic was a bit of a nightmare, but without too much fiddling I had pulled something I would be proud to serve guests. To me it tasted like something out of a cafe. Maybe this was because I had pulled the shot in my house, or maybe it was because of the time I had taken researching the mod, learning to pull a shot and fiddling with wiring inside the machine. The transformation felt like magic, and that magic was topped only by watching my little Gaggia rapidly steam a cup of milk into a thick, beautiful froth very quickly. Espresso guys are restless gear freaks, but I see no reason to go further, to use my little seafoam friend for the foreseeable future to serve guests.</p><figure><figcaption>The mod is controlled via a <a href="https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256803271061345.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2.4" Nextion touch screen</a>, although larger displays will exist in the future.</figcaption></figure><h4><strong>From Open-Source to Open-Core</strong></h4><p>It can be tempting to put a price tag on the Gaggiuino, saying that it transforms a lowly $300-$600 machine into something worth many thousands (particularly since the aforementioned decent starts at $3699) but Zer0-bit pushes against commercial comparisons. “I never put Gaggiuino against anything, it naturally grew into what it is today because I grew in terms of knowledge and met amazing people that helped with the growth as well,” he told me. The project started and largely has remained an open-source one, requiring community input at all stages. This changed while writing the piece, as Zer0 announced on Gaggiuino Discord that future development will switch to an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-core_model" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open-core model</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>“The decision to keep the code private stems from prolonged issues with scalping, which has been a significant challenge for the past year or so,” Zer0-bit said in a statement on the Gaggiuino discord. “It became increasingly necessary to take more decisive actions to protect the integrity of the project.” Practically, this means that, moving forward, development on the tiny 2.4” Nextion screen will no longer progress and all development will be for a new, larger screen platform. The existing internal PCBs will remain the same, and existing wiring will stay the same, but software will have to be enabled on the new screen at an approved vendor level. If you have a Gaggiuino already, you just need to get a new screen.</p><p>Though this model can be controversial, the move makes sense to me. The life of maintaining a large open-source project can take every waking moment of a person’s life, becoming a job on top of your job. I can see how frustrating it could be doing tech support for hardware you didn’t oversee that controls boiling water, hot steam and involves high-voltage electricity. So many things can go wrong in a build, I know this firsthand. But a part of me is saddened, a sentiment shared by Zer0-bit. “(To be honest) I'm not a fan of the transition,” he told me, “but I was put in the situation where I keep doing the hard work and others reap the benefits no matter what principles I wanted people to follow or I put the foot in the door myself.”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Gaggiuino next-gen pre-release software | limitless profiles" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-gLW79LdxMw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>On the plus side, transitioning to a new model allows Zer0-bit to develop for the new screen platform, which seems larger and far easier to read. According to Zer0, the hardware is easier to develop for, and the new branch will be far easier to flash and update over WiFi. And the previews of the model shown off look slightly less like a frankensteined together concoction, and more like a machine purpose-built for the task. As soon as I can, I will update it.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Gaggiuino next-gen software | Low Rider shot pull" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gom9W15fDL0?start=78&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>The new update to the mod looks less like something cobbled together with a 3D printer and more like a commercial product.</figcaption></figure></div><h3><strong>Coffee Guy Nirvana</strong></h3><p>The worst information you can learn when you’ve spent several hundred dollars turning an espresso machine inside out is a doctor telling you that you should cut back on caffeine for a while. This happened to me during the writing process (I’ll be fine, don’t worry). It doesn’t bug me that much. The point of doing this wasn’t just reaching espresso guy nirvana, but rather to explore the edges of what is possible with home espresso and to share what I learned with others. I took something I bought in a White Castle parking lot for a few hundred bucks and turned it into something completely new. And even though I’m done, I still keep an eye out for cheap Gaggia Classics on Facebook Marketplace, sending them out to friends I know who have the itch. I’m excited to see what happens in the rapidly changing coffee world and how the Gaggiuino project develops. But for now, it’s time to step back a bit. I’ve achieved my end game.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Amazon's Fallout TV adaptation, which drew significant acclaim from critics and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-tv-show-was-watched-by-65m-people-in-its-first-two-weeks">attention from audiences</a> when it was broadcast back in April, has been nominated for 16 Emmy Awards, across categories including Outstanding Drama Series and Best Actor.
</p>
<p>
This year's 76th Emmy Awards, which are hosted by the US Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences to recognise excellence in American primetime television programming, will be held this September. They'll be the second Emmy Awards in 2024, after the last year's ceremony was delayed due to the writers' and actors' strikes.
</p>
<p>
With votes now tallied and nominations <a href="https://www.emmys.com/emmys/nominations-documents">announced</a>, it's clear Amazon's Fallout TV adaptation has made an impression among academy members, garnering 17 nominations across 16 award categories. It's an impressive number but notably still somewhere behind this year's biggest hitters; FX's Shogun leads with 25 nominations, followed by The Bear at 23, Only Murders in the Building with 21, and True Detective: Night Country at 19.

Fallout has, however, been nominated in two of the more high-profile Emmy Awards categories, scoring nominations for Outstanding Drama Series (where it's jostling alongside The Crown, The Gilded Age, The Morning Show, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith, Shogun, Slow Horses, and 3 Body Problem) and for Outstanding Lead Actor In A Drama Series. Walton Goggins has secured a place in the latter category for his role as The Ghoul, and he's up against Idris Elba in Hijack, Donald Glover in Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith, Gary Oldman in Slow Horses, Hiroyuki Sanada in Shogun, and Dominic West in The Crown.
</p>
<p>
Here's the full list of Emmy nominations Amazon's Fallout TV show has amassed, with the winners set to be announced during the 76th Emmy Awards on 15th September:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Outstanding Drama Series</li>
<li>Outstanding Lead Actor In A Drama Series - for Walton Goggins</li>
<li>Outstanding Production Design - for episode The End</li>
<li>Outstanding Fantasy/Sci-Fi Costumes - for The End</li>
<li>Outstanding Picture Editing For A Drama Series - for The End and The Ghouls</li>
<li>Outstanding Main Title Design</li>
<li>Outstanding Period Or Fantasy/Sci-Fi Makeup (Non-Prosthetic) - for The Head</li>
<li>Outstanding Prosthetic Makeup - for The Beginning</li>
<li>Outstanding Music Supervision - The End</li>
<li>Outstanding Sound Editing For A Comedy Or Drama Series (One Hour) - for The Target</li>
<li>Outstanding Sound Mixing For A Comedy Or Drama Series (One Hour) - for The Target</li>
<li>Outstanding Special Visual Effects In A Season Or A Movie</li>
<li>Outstanding Stunt Coordination For Drama Programming</li>
<li>Outstanding Stunt Performance</li>
<li>Outstanding Writing For A Drama Series - for The End</li>
<li>Outstanding Emerging Media Program - for Fallout: Vault 33</li>
</ul>
<p>
Unsurprisingly given the Fallout TV series' positive reception (which also helped <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-currently-europes-best-selling-game-almost-a-decade-after-release">bump the ageing Fallout 4 back up the charts</a>), Amazon confirmed the show had been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-show-officially-renewed-for-second-season">renewed for a second season</a> back in April. There's no hint as to when Season 2 might air, but its show runners have already <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-tv-showrunners-discuss-season-two-location-and-why-the-series-doesnt-need-to-follow-a-canon-ending">teased some of the things viewers can look forward to</a> when it eventually arrives.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-ea-sports-fc-25-fc-iq-tactics-career-mode-improvements-and-more/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ahead of today's reveal of EA Sports FC 25, we were able to check a remote showcase of all of the game's new features and improvements. I've talked about the 5v5 Rush experience <a href="https://wccftech.com/rush-is-ea-sports-fc-25-exciting-new-5v5-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a separate article</a>, so I'll focus on everything else here.</p>
<p>It all starts with FC IQ, a comprehensive overhaul of the game's tactics implementation. The developers claim they want players to channel their inner club manager, dictating exactly how their team plays. FC IQ was designed to complement and benefit from previously introduced technologies like HyperMotion V and Play Styles.</p>
<p>It consists of three foundations: Player Roles, the big one which guides how players behave off the ball thanks to over 50 new roles; Team Tactics, which replicates a team's real-world playstyle more closely and provides more variety from match to match; and Smart Tactics, which allows for real-time suggestions based on the current match and even provides commentary on your tactical changes.</p>
<p>EA Sports used real world data provided by Opta and a proprietary AI model to power Player Roles. This model analyzed the Opta data from the last two seasons of each player: all games, stats, and plays. Jude Bellingham's predominant style turned out to be Half-Winger (75%), with 14% as Shadow Striker and 11% as Playmaker. Kai Havertz, on the other hand, has a more balanced style, with 40% as Playmaker, 39% as Shadow Striker, and 21% as Half-Winger.</p>
<p>According to the studio, the result is a more authentic and intelligent movement of your team. At launch, you can expect three to five Player Roles per position (except the goalkeeper). For example, a Wide Midfielder (RM/LM) can be a Winger, a Wide Playmaker, or an Inside Forward. A Full Back (RB/LB) may be a Falseback, a Wingback, or an Attacking Wingback. A Centre-Back (CB) can be a Stopper, Defender, or Ball-Playing Defender. A Defensive Midfielder (CDM) could be a Holding midfielder, a Centre-Half, or a Deep-Lying Playmaker. Striker Player Roles include Advanced Forward, Poacher, Target Forward, and False 9. Lastly, the Centre-Midfielder (CM) has the most options: Box-to-Box, Holding, Deep-Lying Playmaker, Playmaker, or Half-Winger.</p>
<p>On top of Roles, players will be able to select one to three Focuses per Role. For example, when a Playmaker is set to Roaming, it will move around more freely to find spaces. This greatly increases the amount of possible tactic combinations in EA Sports FC 25. By the way, each combination of Player Role and Focus will provide pros and cons. Moreover, EA Sports added Familiarity, which tells you whether a specific player is fit to perform well in any given Player Role.</p>
<p>There's the base role, and then every player has a Role+, which means they are specifically accomplished in something. World-class players also have Role++, which will be a rarity at launch. Finally, a player can also be put out of position, translating into a simplified version of the Role. An example could be placing Vinicius Jr. as a Defensive Midfielder. Familiarity is essentially the new and improved version of the old work rates (which have been removed in EA Sports FC 25).</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FC25_REV_PALMER_16x9_HIRES_WM-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Since the community is fond of sharing tactics, the developers have created a new code-based system. It is generated automatically when you save your own tactics. Since it's a universal system, it can be shared across any mode and platform. By the way, the bench size has also been increased to 9 players on Gen 9 platforms (PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X) in the Kick Off, Career, Seasons, and Tournaments modes. Lastly, they added three assignments for corner kicks: target player (when attacking) and near post/back post players (when defending).</p>
<p>EA Sports FC 25 is also getting improvements to HyperMotion V. Whereas last year they only mapped the upper body motions of players, this year the team was able to do full-body mapping on around 1800 players, including 200 women. Goalkeeper playstyles have been massively expanded: the new game includes everything from Deflector to Cross Claimer, Rush Out, Footwork, Far Throw, and Far Reach.</p>
<p>This year, a new core gameplay mechanic called Positional Foul is being introduced. Regular football watchers are very used to it: it's when a player essentially grabs another rugby-style without any chance of getting the ball, with the sole purpose of stopping a dangerous counter-attack. The Positional Foul can be triggered with the right bumper and A or X, depending on whether you play with an Xbox or PlayStation controller. Like in real football, this is an automatic yellow card, but the developers said persisting with this tactic could even result in a red card.</p>
<p>Dribbling has been refined to look more responsive, and the animation database has also been 'cleaned up' to make dribbling feel better than ever. Passing accuracy has been reduced a bit when doing blind passes compared to last year in an attempt to improve realism. Players will also find five new skill moves: toe drag stepover, big feints, stepover ball, heel nutmeg, and drag turn.</p>
<p>Those who plan to play EA Sports FC 25 in single player, offline mode will also get to select the brand new Simulation mode. This is meant to be a slower and more authentic way to play the game. In this mode, weather also affects the pitch, making players slip when it's raining a lot, and the AI opponent will feel more dynamic.</p>
<p>There's been an effort to make stadiums feel more alive through the introduction of authentic mascots, active sideline moments featuring managers, officials, and substitutes, authentic crowd reactions to what's happening on the pitch, and dynamic elements like photographers and cameras following the action.</p>
<p>On consoles, the game will allow users to pick between two graphics modes: Enhanced Visuals or Favor Resolution. The former mode upscales to 4K resolution while adding ray-traced ambient occlusion, cloth simulation on the shirt and shorts, self-shadowing at all times, rim lighting, 3D pitch divots and puddles, and local exposure, while the latter delivers a native 4K presentation as well as cloth simulation on shorts and default exposure. Both still target 60 frames per second to keep optimal responsiveness. Additionally, there's a dynamic time-of-day progression for the first time in the franchise, so you might start a match before sunset and then begin the second half at nighttime.</p>

<p>The accuracy of player likeness has been further improved with EA Sports Cranium, a new machine learning-based system that will be rolled out to other sports games in the future. While a lot of players have accurate scans, those who don't used to look very generic in past games. After feeding EA Sports Cranium enough photos, though, the results in EA Sports FC 25 definitely improve the likeness of thousands of less famous players.</p>
<p>Career mode also got a significant revamp. The first key feature the team talked about is Live Start Points, which will take up the unfolding seasonal stories from real-life football competitions such as the Premier League, Serie A, La Liga, Bundesliga, Ligue 1, and Champions League. An example from last year's season might be Girona being on top of La Liga last Christmas. You'd begin from a Snapshot, a specific moment in time grabbed from the real season, and continue in the game. Inevitably, Live Start Points will be added post-launch.</p>
<p>Career mode has fully integrated FC IQ. Something you could do here is, for example, bring in a coach to ensure Haaland can learn how to play in the False 9 Player Role, which he doesn't have by default in the game. Of course, another option is to recruit a brand new player who's already familiar with that playstyle from the Youth Academy, which has been expanded to include over 90 new countries to scout in. Youths will also be playable throughout the newly added 5v5 Rush tournaments, and managers will have the opportunity to play either with their current or potential stats. Winning these Youth tournaments, which happen every two months in Career mode, will give those players a big stat boost.</p>
<p>Women's football is also fully implemented now in Career mode as part of EA Sports' effort to bring parity with men's football. While most of it works identically, selecting women's football also means adapting to a different financial model with tighter budgets, shorter contracts, different salary structures, and so on. Career mode also optionally offers a more casual experience, stripped of things like transfers and scouting.</p>

<p>On the other hand, those who enjoy the transfer market game will be happy to know that EA signed Italian journalist Fabrizio Romano to be in EA Sports FC 25's in-game social media system. Whenever a club signs a major player, you'll get his classic 'Here we go, confirmed' message.</p>
<p>EA Sports FC 25 even features the option to go through a Player Career with icons like Pirlo, Van Nistelrooy, Henry, and Kelly Smith (pre-order icons add Ronaldo, Zidane, and Beckham to the mix), the twist clearly being that these legends would have their careers unfolding much later than they did in real football, against and with current players.</p>
<p>Lastly, the developers discussed the changes coming to Ultimate Team. First of all, the mode fully supports Rush, allowing users to bring their own players and even enter matchmaking if they do not have three friends to complete the team. Ultimate Team's Rush is based on Events, which may introduce certain limitations, like club requirements, to which players you can bring in.</p>
<p>Outside of Rush, Ultimate Team in general will enjoy live updates that tie into FC IQ. For example, if a player performs well in a slightly different role than usual for him or her, their Player Role in Ultimate Team will be updated as a result. If you don't want to get too involved in the tactics, you can now just hire real-world manager who will apply their favorite styles to the squad.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FC25_REV_BONMATI_16x9_HIRES_WM-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Everything can be managed via the Web and the companion app, allowing EA Sports FC 25 players to continue theory-crafting out of the game. Moreover, EA listened to three main community requests for Ultimate Team: players will now be allowed to send up to a hundred items to a squad building challenge storage, which is especially useful for duplicates; Evolutions have been expanded to dramatically increase (around seven times) the number of eligible players; the competitive space will see friendlies and rivals matchmaking decoupled, draws awarding one point for rivals, and relegations are being introduced to the top tier.</p>
<p>For Clubs, the developers created a personalized social space called Clubhouse that connects all players. It's essentially a dynamic, customizable locker room that will show up to 11 players at once. The Club manager can also allocate some budget towards Facilities cards, which provide unique attribute boosts that help define your Club's playstyle. There will be 20 to 30 Facilities cards at launch, each coming with one, two, or three-star variant. Moreover, league relegation is back to reintroduce greater stakes. Losing enough matches triggers a one-off relegation match where players will need to avoid losing to stay in their current league.</p>
<p>Crucially, the season pass in EA Sports FC 25 has been unified so that completing matches across all modes will go towards the same goals. Lastly, the player customization tool is deeper than ever before.</p>

<p>We'll need to wait until we get more time with the game, but on paper, it sounds like a bigger evolution than last year. EA Sports FC 25 is out on September 27 (although early access through the Ultimate Edition starts a week in advance) for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch.</p>
