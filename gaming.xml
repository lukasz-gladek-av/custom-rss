            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Blizzard Entertainment's Team 5—responsible for the development of <em>Hearthstone</em>—is unionizing. A group of around 100 workers voted yes to representation with the Communications Workers of America under CWA Local 9510. It's the third union to go public at Blizzard this week, following <a href="https://aftermath.site/battle-net-workers-unionize-blizzard-entertainment-cwa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two new units</a> composed of Blizzard Entertainment's Battle.net workers.</p><p>The <em>Hearthstone</em> union includes people from many different roles across the game's development, including artists, gameplay designers, and quality assurance testers. Microsoft has recognized the union after workers voted earlier this week; Microsoft and CWA's neutrality agreement, which was signed in 2022 ahead of Microsoft's $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard and prevented the company from interfering in union efforts, expired on Monday. Several unions formed under Activision Blizzard before the neutrality agreement was signed, but they faced what workers <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/national-labor-relations-board-finds-merit-charges-against-blizzard-illegal-union" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">called union-busting</a>—attempts to shut down union efforts. Since the signing, workers have voted to unionize across the company; there are at least seven separate union groups at Blizzard Entertainment alone.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Hearthstone</em> workers made a big push to unionize their own department about three months ago, senior 2D artist Uriah Voth told Aftermath. The deadline for the neutrality agreement's expiration was a big motivator to get the union finalized, workers said.&nbsp;</p><p>"One important moment was learning about the neutrality agreement and its deadline, and seeing the union busting that is and has happened at other very large companies," senior game designer Dominic Calkosz said. "Being owned now by Microsoft has always been a looming question of, <em>will things change? How will things change? How should we be prepared or react to those changes?</em> Knowing there is a date where this powerful option of forming a union may become significantly more difficult was a wake up call to me that, alright, we should start moving now."</p><p>Carol Blean, <em>Hearthstone</em> test analyst, told Aftermath that the agreement allowed the <em>Hearthstone</em> workers to openly talk about the union. "You [usually] have to be very hushed about it. You [usually] have to be very secretive," she said. "Fear hasn't been looming as much, because we have been very open about it, very supported, and everyone has been very respectful."</p><p>She continued: "We all share common struggles, so it's easy to keep supporting each other, not just in the product that we create, but in our own choices."</p><p>Workers don't know how things will change for unionizing at Microsoft game studios now that the neutrality agreement has expired. The unions that exist now, including Team 5's, are past the major hurdle of an election and recognition from the company, but neutrality agreements typically don't extend to the next steps of union effort, negotiating for a contract. Now, the <em>Hearthstone</em> union’s organizing committee will poll the group to determine what the most important issues are for staff to guide them in bargaining a contract. So far, just two of the many unions under Microsoft and Activision Blizzard have completed negotiations, <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/raven-software-workers-secure-first-contract-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Raven Software</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/zenimax-union-contract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ZeniMax QA workers</a>. Both groups were in negotiations for years.</p><p>Voth said that layoff protections are something that motivated him to get involved in the union. He's been at Blizzard Entertainment for two and a half years and has experienced three rounds of layoffs that impacted <em>Hearthstone</em> team members. "It was just this every six month cadence of experiencing this traumatic event," he said. "I looked into the union stuff, and I know that we can't fully stop layoffs from happening, but just the feeling that we need to have some say in these massive decisions that are affecting all of us."</p><p>It didn't feel like leadership was listening, the workers said—a union is a collective voice they can't ignore. "I cannot face everything by myself," Blean said. "We all share the same struggles." She described the "passion tax" that people often take when coming to jobs at places like Blizzard, because they're often dream jobs. But these companies, at the end of the day, are still corporations. "We're looking for just treatment," Blean said. "And right now, we don't have much of a say. That's what we're looking for."</p><p>Calkosz listed a number of things the union is interested in negotiating over, including layoff protections like improved severance packages and recall rights, reduced wage gaps, more support for work from home, formal protections for remote workers, accountability for harassment, and protections or limitations on AI usage.&nbsp;</p><p>"More generally, being able to preserve the good things that we have and being prepared to push back against future unfair treatment," Calkosz said. "Over the months and years, there will be things that upper leadership may have done that they choose not to do because they know we have solidarity now."</p><p>The workers said they're very grateful for the unions that came before them at Blizzard. Members of the organizing committees across unions meet weekly to talk and share information. "We were trying to get this done by the end of the neutrality agreement, and it was really because of the work that other unions had done before us," Voth said. "They were able to help us figure out how to best strategize and get the message out to our team."</p><p>Union influence is apparent even outside of that coordination–simply existing is a motivating factor. "It has been tremendously helpful for members of our team, of our unit, to see other teams at Blizzard union and make steps toward the contract and other things that they want," Calkosz said. "It's very difficult to take the first step or take that leap. Just knowing there are others already paving that way, and ready for solidarity with our team as well, has been motivating for a lot of people."</p><p>He continued: "It's been a little scary to not know how the company might react or retaliate. It helps a ton that other Blizzard teams and other developers have paved the way for us, but a bit of fear is still there. It's helped to remind myself that for [the company] to retaliate would be wrong, and so for us to obey in advance would be wrong. The other Blizzard developers helped pave the way for us. I hope we can help pave the way for other companies, especially being such a visible triple A studio."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/battlefield-6-campaign-singleplayer-review-impressions"><h3>Battlefield 6’s Campaign Is An Act Of Narrative Cowardice</h3></a><p>The only thing worse than saying something stupid is saying nothing at all</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/imdb-review-scale-bad-broken"><h3>The Sweet Spot Of IMDb Is 6.3-7.6&nbsp;</h3></a><p>Please enjoy my arbitrary and unscientific system for accounting for IMDb's awful rating scale.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/battle-net-workers-unionize-blizzard-entertainment-cwa"><h3>Battle.net Workers Unionize As Microsoft Neutrality Agreement Expires</h3></a><p>Nearly 400 workers formed two units under Blizzard Entertainment's Platform and Technology department</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/bus-bound-demo"><h3>Look Out, I’m The Bus</h3></a><p>The Bus Bound demo is pretty fun</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/hearthstone-union-blizzard]]></content:encoded>

<figure data-uuid="c24948fdaa810"><a title="Taunie Z-A" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c24948fdaa810/taunie-z-a.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Pokémon</strong> games have never, at least to our knowledge, had voice-over work. At least not the mainline games or direct spin-offs.</p>
<p>For many, especially those who have been with the series since the very beginning, this hasn't really been much of an issue. After all, it was only when Pokémon had properly transitioned into the 3D realm with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/pokemon_x_and_y">X and Y</a> that characters actually started articulating their joints while talking, and even then it was <em>very</em> limited.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, however, it feels a bit different. Yes, visuals are still somewhat lacklustre across the board with this latest entry, but character animation, particularly during cutscenes, is actually pretty good. They move like real people are supposed to, and their mouths are lip-synced with the dialogue.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2LcP6TZzqhM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed635c59onrvkw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>The problem..? There's no verbal audio to go with the dialogue. It's <em>still</em> completely silent.</p>
<p>It's pretty noticeable in the below clip doing the rounds on social media, with many noting that supporting character Taunie animates well, but the lack of any voice-over makes it come off a bit, well... weird:</p>

<p>Heck, our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">final verdict</a> on Legends: Z-A even highlighted the lack of any voice-over work, with reviewer Alana Hagues stating the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I know this is controversial, too, but voices would help give this game character. I’m not even asking for full voice acting — though monologues and pre-rendered cutscenes feel utterly bizarre as just text on a screen — but I’d love a voice clip or two, along the lines of modern Zelda games. It’d also help give the story a little more <em>oomph</em>, which it needs when focusing on friendship, recovery, and forgiveness. Even with an explosive climax (which I urge you not to spoil yourself on), I felt... nothing."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So now we'd like to put it to you fine folks. Is Legends: Z-A worse off without any voice-over work? Should Game Freak endeavour to add this into future titles? Let us know by voting in the below polls and sharing a comment in the usual place.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/demons-souls-polishing-diamond/"> Demon's Souls PlayStation 5 remake</a> has been updated to <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-september-17-system-software-update/">support the system's Power Saver Mode</a>, and the performance and resolution tweaks, and the reduced system power consumption may be the first glimpse at what the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-playstation-handheld-specs-leaked-rasterization-performance/">rumored PlayStation handheld could deliver</a> running PS5 games.</p>



<p>The remake developed by Bluepoint Games, which launched with the PlayStation 5 in November 2020, has now been updated to support the new Power Saver Mode, as indicated by the little leaf icon on the system's main menu. Introducing this mode, which reduces the system's power consumption, is SIE's commitment to Sony's <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/csr/eco/RoadToZero/gm_en.html">"Road to Zero"</a> environmental plan launched in 2010, which includes achieving net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2040.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The small icon right after Demon's Souls indicates the game supports Power Saver Mode.</em></figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="h-demon-s-souls-remake-power-saver-mode-screenshots-and-performance">Demon's Souls Remake Power Saver Mode Screenshots and Performance </h2>



<p>Although Power Saver mode has been <span>officially implemented on PS5 as part of a b</span>igger environmental effort,&nbsp;it has long been speculated&nbsp;that its implementation and limitations could be <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-power-saver-mode-impact-performance-significantly-handheld/">a testing ground for the rumored PlayStation handheld</a>, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/portable-playstation-6-ps5-games-patch/">allegedly going to run PS5 games as well</a>.</p>



<p>The performance and resolution tweaks introduced in Demon's Souls remake definitely support this theory in part, at the very least. As can be seen from this set of screenshots I have captured from my launch PlayStation 5 at the start of the game, the resolution in Power Saver mode is lower than the resolution of both Performance and Cinematic display modes, even at a quick glance.</p>

<p>The frame rate target of the game's has also been changed for Power Saver mode, going from the 60 FPS of Performance Mode to 30 FPS. The video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@user-el8fc5xg9h">?.?</a> accurately represents the experience, which is not the best for a home console for this type of game, but that wouldn't be terribly bad on a handheld gaming system.</p>

<h2 id="h-demon-s-souls-remake-power-saver-mode-reduced-energy-usage">Demon's Souls Remake Power Saver Mode Reduced Energy Usage</h2>



<p>Power Saver Mode delivers impressive reductions in energy usage as well. <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps5-to-recieve-power-saving-mode-which-will-scale-back-performance-on-compatible-games-rumored-to-be-used-as-upcoming-portables-power-target.1250814/page-5#post-146505994">In a test conducted by ResetERA forums member vicegold</a>, power consumption went from hovering at ~224 W in the regular operating mode to ~98 W with power saver mode, which is quite a big difference. While this power consumption target is way too high for a handheld gaming system, the fact that the game wasn't horribly downgraded to achieve it with some software tweaks bodes quite well for the rumored handheld, which would require games to be tweaked similarly to run well on it.</p>



<p>The Demon's Souls remake is only one of the PlayStation 5 games that will be patched to support Power Saver mode. Among other titles to support the feature will be Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, which will be another interesting game to test, given its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/">solid 60 FPS performance and high-quality visuals.</a></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-space-creator-pitched-new-dead-space-to-ea</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-pitched-a-new-game-in-the-series-to-ea-recently.1327972/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dead Space&nbsp;</em>creator Glen Schofield has revealed that he pitched a new game in the series to EA "recently", and that while the studio rejected his pitch, he's optimistic that the series may have a future.</p>

<p>That's according to an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-can-save-you-30-40-million-on-the-idea-i-have-dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-already-making-calls-about-dead-space-4-now-ea-has-new-owners" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">IGN</a>, in which Schofield says he "went to [EA] recently" and that they told him they were "not interested anymore" when it came to&nbsp;<em>Dead Space</em>, despite his assertions that he could "save [the company] $30 to $40 million on the idea that [he has]".</p>

<p>Schofield then says that he's got "quite a few ideas", presumably for several different games, but that "one of them is&nbsp;<em>Dead Space 4</em>". He points to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-could-go-private-powered-by-saudi-and-private-equity-money" rel="nofollow">EA's recent purchase by a consortium of investors</a> as an "opportunity" and says he's "already making calls".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-space-glen-schofield-isaac.jpg?itok=JC4SEM4c 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-space-glen-schofield-isaac.jpg?itok=0qJX5Pzu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Glen Schofield wants a new&nbsp;<em>Dead Space&nbsp;</em>to happen.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not just EA Schofield wants to revive&nbsp;<em>Dead Space</em>, though; he also reckons that with the studio's purchase, "somebody new could buy [the IP]", so it might not even be EA that releases the eventual&nbsp;<em>Dead Space 4</em>.</p>

<p>He also says he wants the franchise to branch out into "different mediums", suggesting that movies or a TV series based on&nbsp;<em>Dead Space&nbsp;</em>could be "great".</p>

<p>Still, Schofield says he doesn't think EA made a profit from the 2023&nbsp;<em>Dead Space&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dead-space" rel="nofollow">remake</a>, which is presumably why the company is so reticent to do anything new with the IP. Here's hoping it finds its way into the hands of someone who wants to use it for good.</p>

<p>The aforementioned remake is the last major project to be released in the&nbsp;<em>Dead Space&nbsp;</em>series. It's a ground-up rework of the 2008 original, adding new story scenes and gameplay mechanics to the first game's tale of spindly Necromorphs and sinister Markers.</p>




<p>Schofield himself wasn't involved in that remake, though; while it was in development, he was working on&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/callisto-protocol" rel="nofollow">The Callisto Protocol</a>&nbsp;</em>alongside Striking Distance Studios, although he <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-space-co-creator-pursuing-new-opportunities-less-than-year-after-callisto" rel="nofollow">departed the developer</a> less than a year after that game's release.</p>

<p>Subsequently, back in February, it was revealed that Striking Distance had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/striking-distance-layoffs-callisto-protocol" rel="nofollow">laid off "most" of its employees</a>, so it sounds as though Schofield may have been right to make his exit when he did.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see whether Glen Schofield's&nbsp;<em>Dead Space&nbsp;</em>pitch manages to get anywhere in the future, but for now, you can (and should) grab the&nbsp;<em>Dead Space&nbsp;</em>remake on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1693980/Dead_Space/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/dead-space/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dead-space/9nlb6v0gnc9p" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/silent-hill-2-remake-shipments-and-digital-sales-top-2-5-million" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>,&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>has now sold 2.5 million copies worldwide (inclusive of both digital and physical shipments), which means the game has picked up another half a million sales for itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">since January this year</a>. That's pretty good going for what is, in the end, a fairly niche title.</p>

<p>Although&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>is still selling steadily for Konami, it wasn't able to hold a candle to recent release&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>in the initial sales stakes; the latter outpaced the remake significantly, racking up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-f-sales-1m" rel="nofollow">a million sales in a single day</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/silent-hill-2-sales-2.5m-typewriter.jpg?itok=wOiAtzo5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/silent-hill-2-sales-2.5m-typewriter.jpg?itok=4ffEDVmj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>is going strong for Konami.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the milestone for&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2</em>, Konami also announced that the series as a whole has reached ten million cumulative sales, and since 2.5 million of those are&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2</em>&nbsp;(and a further million belong to&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f</em>), the franchise can reasonably call itself resurgent.</p>

<p>These numbers will bode well for Konami's future franchise plans as well. The studio is currently working alongside&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake developer Bloober Team on a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/konami-bloober-team-new-silent-hill" rel="nofollow">reimagining of the first game</a>, although no release date or gameplay have yet been revealed.</p>

<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2</em>, it's a remake of the 2001 survival horror classic, shifting the action from the fixed camera angles of the original to a more modern over-the-shoulder perspective and adding new story scenes for additional context.</p>

<p>At its core, though,&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>still tells the same story of James Sunderland, who travels to the titular town of Silent Hill in order to investigate a letter he receives from his deceased wife.</p>




<p>You can check out the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2124490/SILENT_HILL_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/silent-hill-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Reportedly Asking Manufacturers to Produce 25m Switch 2 Units By March]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-25m-production-report</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-reportedly-asking-manufacturers-to-produce-25m-switch-2-units-by-march.1327966/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report has emerged which claims that Nintendo is instructing manufacturers to produce a pretty staggering number of Switch 2 consoles by the end of March next year, indicating that the Japanese gaming giant is expecting a bumper sales year.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-17/nintendo-switch-2-production-plan-25-million-units-by-march-2026" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>, Nintendo has asked its suppliers to produce "as many as 25 million" Switch 2 units prior to March 2026, which, as Bloomberg points out, will set Nintendo up for "record first-year sales" of its console.</p>

<p>Additionally, Bloomberg notes that according to industry analysts, Nintendo is on track to "comfortably surpass" previous projections of 17.6 million Switch 2 sales within the console's first fiscal year, potentially reaching the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-20m-shipments-report" rel="nofollow">20 million target reported back in January</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-manufacturing-25m-report-console.jpg?itok=KRTdcBZR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-manufacturing-25m-report-console.jpg?itok=xE9UwGDr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nintendo is expecting the Switch 2 to do pretty well, it seems.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that this is a report, and as Bloomberg itself notes, it's possible the figure will be adjusted in the near future, especially as the holiday season approaches and Nintendo gets a better understanding of what demand for the Switch 2 looks like.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it's probably fair to say the Switch 2 has already been a major success for Nintendo. Just a couple of months after the console's release, it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-financials-q1-2026" rel="nofollow">hit six million sales</a> around the world, having already secured the position of Nintendo's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-fastest-selling-nintendo-console" rel="nofollow">fastest-selling console worldwide</a>.</p>

<p>Nintendo itself has stated that it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-15m-switch-2-first-year" rel="nofollow">expects to sell around 15 million</a> Switch 2 consoles in the machine's first year on release, but there's every chance that figure could be revised (either upwards or downwards) soon.</p>

<p>The console's sales numbers have no doubt been buoyed by the release of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">a new&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>game at launch</a>, as well as flagship 3D platformer&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, which may not be a&nbsp;<em>Mario&nbsp;</em>game but which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-super-mario-odyssey-team" rel="nofollow">bears the hallmarks of the&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Odyssey&nbsp;</em>team</a> nonetheless.</p>




<p>We'll have to wait and see whether Nintendo achieves its ambitious sales targets for the Switch 2, but current signs look pretty positive. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

He joined in 2018, and after a two-year stint at Polygon, he rejoined <em>The Verge</em> in May 2025.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>When I have to decide which wireless gaming earbuds that I want to use, it’s a tough choice between the <strong>SteelSeries Arctis Buds</strong> and the Sony InZone Buds. Both have a comfortable fit, active noise cancellation, great sound quality, and their USB-C transmitters work with every non-Xbox platform in my apartment. But it’s easy to tell you which of the two you should buy right now, if you’re in the market: SteelSeries’ Arctis Buds in white with PlayStation wireless connectivity are down to $127.99 ($73 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0DFX34VNZ/?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> — their best price yet. (This model originally sold for $159.99, but it was likely increased due to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/604742/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-updates">increased tariffs</a>). Even so, they’re considerably cheaper than Sony’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Wireless-Cancelling-Earbuds-WF-G700N/dp/B0CJHB7B59?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">$228</a> InZone Buds.</p><p>The Arctis Buds can connect to one of many devices with its 2.4GHz transmitter, from your PC, Mac, PlayStation 5, and Nintendo Switch 2. (A <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0DFX4TPS6/?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">pricier $165.99 version</a> in black works with Xbox and all of the aforementioned platforms.) If you need them more as earbuds for joining a call or listening to a podcast from your phone, you can pair them via Bluetooth 5.3. Whether you’re gaming or jamming away, these feature active noise cancellation to block out more sound. They have a transparency mode, too, letting you hear more of your surroundings.</p><p>Some additional perks include its Qi wireless case, which can recharge on the same wireless charging pad you might use for your AirPods Pro or a different set of earbuds. The earbuds can last about 10 hours per charge, slightly less if you’re using active noise cancellation. (Our reviewer Tom Warren got nine hours of life from them with ANC on.) Almost every set of wireless earbuds has limitations, and this model’s biggest one is that it can’t pipe in audio from its 2.4GHz and Bluetooth connections simultaneously. It’s one or the other.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p id="some-other-deals-for-your-friday"><h2>Some other deals for your Friday</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>Amazon Prime members who are building a PC or just looking for deals on midrange GPUs can save on <strong>MSI’s RTX 5070</strong> with 12GB of VRAM. The GPU had an original MSRP of $549, but this two-fan model is selling for $499.99 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MSI-RTX-5070-12G-Performance/dp/B0DYGFJK7C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, which is its lowest price yet. The Shadow 2X OC has a slightly faster 2,557MHz boost clock speed versus Nvidia’s Founders Edition model, and its design is slightly more compact (but more plastic-laden). It’s otherwise the same in terms of ports (three DisplayPort 2.1a, one HDMI 2.1b) and capabilities. It’s a solid GPU for playing most games at 1440p with respectable frame rates, even if turning on DLSS 4 is necessary to get the super-fast performance you may be hoping for.</span></li><li><span>Lego’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/1/24169526/lego-minecraft-the-crafting-table-15th-anniversary-adult-set">first <em>Minecraft</em> set for adults</a>, <strong>The Crafting Table</strong>, is down to an all-time low of $71.99 ($18 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Minecraft-Crafting-Collectible-Anniversary/dp/B0CRX64YFN/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Flego-minecraft-21265%2F-%2FA-90573727" rel="sponsored">Target</a>. The 1,195-piece kit essentially resembles an in-game crafting table on the outside, but inside, you’ll find a slick little diorama with 12 brick-ified biomes — including a village-laden Plains and Cherry Grove, which features an abandoned mineshaft. You also get eight tiny microfigures, because what’s <em>Minecraft</em> without a Creeper?</span></li><li><span>Those who are hoping to get a 55-inch 4K OLED TV for well under $1,000 won’t find many models out there at that price point.

You can get it for $798, which is about $200 less than the price you can typically find it available for. Even though the B-series is LG’s entry-level OLED model, it has some of the most important traits in common with its pricier next of kin; you’ll get four HDMI 2.1 ports, allowing any of them to display your games in 4K at up to 120Hz, if supported. Plus, it supports variable refresh rate (VRR), which allows the panel’s refresh rate to stay in lockstep with the connected gaming device’s output to eliminate the chance of screen tearing. For movie lovers, this TV supports Dolby Vision, HDR10 and HLG, ensuring that most of your content will pop with color.</span></li></ul></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/801041/steelseries-arctis-buds-rtx-5070-gpu-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>

It’s a new take on Mattel’s Intellivision, which initially went head-to-head with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/22/23841336/atari-2600-plus-compatible-with-7800-cartridges">Atari 2600</a> when it was released in 1979.</p><p>The Sprint looks a lot like the original Intellivision with a gold and black case and a wood-grain panel on the front, but there are a lot fewer cables.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Unless you have some crazy level of self-discipline or a truly superior bookkeeping system, you’re probably drowning in subscriptions like the rest of us. Those monthly bills are always an unpleasant surprise, so when you get a chance to ditch one for good, you take it. Here’s one to convert into a one-and-done purchase — <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4845/">a lifetime license to Microsoft Office Pro 2021 for Windows is just $40 at StackSocial.</a> You can also get the Home &amp; Business for Mac version for just $60 on the same StackSocial page.</p>
<p>Rather than deal with that monthly line in your bank statement, this one-time $40 buy gives you a lifetime license to the world’s preeminent productivity suite: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote, Access, Publisher, and Teams. This StackSocial deal is a massive 81% markdown from the list price of $220, and more importantly, you can drop that Microsoft 365 subscription once and for all now that you own all of the apps forever.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4845/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at StackSocial</a></p>

<h2>Accept No Substitutes</h2>
<p>There are other apps and programs out there for all of the tasks covered by the Microsoft Office Pro 2021 suite, but if you’re looking to share important data analysis, would you even think about sending it in a format other than Excel? Or an interactive slideshow presentation in anything other than PowerPoint, or a written document that’s not in Word?</p>
<p>These Microsoft apps have been the global standard for productivity for decades now, in no small part because Microsoft is continually updating and refining them. All of those updates are included in this lifetime license deal, and they’re automatically pushed out to your computer once you’ve installed and registered the suite.</p>



<h2>Easy to Install</h2>
<p>Getting your lifetime license to Microsoft Office Pro 2021 for WIndows or Office Home &amp; Busniness for Mac is easy. Just make the purchase on StackSocial’s site, and you’ll get a download code and your license keys via email. You must redeem the code within 7 days of receiving it by downloading and installing the software and registering it using the license key. (Keep that in a safe place in case you need to reinstall the software on a new computer at some point down the road; the license is good for only 1 computer at a time.)</p>
<p>Ditching a subscription model for Microsoft Office access won’t solve all of your subscription issues, but it might be the only one you can say goodbye to with a one-time lifetime license purchase for just $40. That is, unless you wait too long and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4845/">this sweet 81%-off deal on a lifetime license to Microsoft Office Pro 2021 for WIndows (or 72% off Microsoft Office Home &amp; Business for Mac) ends</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/sony-files-injunction-to-bar-tencent-from-using-any-resemblance-to-horizons-aloy/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new update on the lawsuit reveals that Sony has filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to stop Tencent from using Aloy’s resemblance and other elements from the Horizon series. </p>



<p>Sony Interactive Entertainment has filed a case against Tencent for copyright and trademark infringement in a California federal court. The company has already called the accused’s upcoming title a “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-calls-tencents-defense-in-horizon-clone-lawsuit-nonsense/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blatant knock-off</a>” after their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-claps-back-at-sony-playstations-horizon-clone-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">motion to dismiss</a>. Now, Sony is seeking an injunction. </p>



<h2 id="h-sony-wants-to-hold-a-hearing-next-month">Sony Wants to Hold a Hearing Next Month </h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://gamesfray.com/breaking-sony-asks-judge-corley-for-preliminary-injunction-against-tencents-upcoming-light-of-motiram-in-november-or-december/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Games Fray</a>, Sony is seeking a preliminary injunction in the Horizon clone lawsuit against Tencent. The motion is to stop Tencent “from reproducing, preparing derivative works of, displaying, performing, and distributing any works copied or derived from SIE’s Horizon Works, including Light of Motiram, and from using the ALOY Character Mark or any confusingly similar mark pending trial.”</p>



<p>Coming to what the Aloy Character Mark is, “she is a young and fierce tribal warrior huntress characterized by fiery red hair, high cheekbones, and outfits that blend tribal and industrial metallic elements.” The injunction also seeks to stop Tencent from using visual, audio, and storyline elements from the Horizon series.</p>



<p>Sony has asked Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley, from the FTC v. Microsoft-Activision Blizzard case, to hold a hearing by November 20, 2025.

<p>Plants vs. Brainrots pays homage to the classic Plants vs. Zombies tower defence title. In this Roblox experience, instead of fighting zombies with plants, you’ll battle waves of Brainrots, collect them, and place the best ones on platforms to generate passive income. However, to defeat and obtain Limited, Secret, Godly, and Mythic Brainrots, you’ll need the help of the active Plants vs. Brainrots codes.</p>



<p>These <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jump-and-splash-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> codes can be redeemed for free Gears, Potions, and Money, which in turn will help you expand your garden, purchase new platforms, and fill your Index with every Brainrot and Plant available.

            <p>The Arc Raiders server slam has begun. The much-anticipated third-person extraction shooter has only been available to play for roughly two hours (at time of writing), and it's already nearing 100,000 concurrent players.</p>
<p>This server slam is the final chance for interested players to check the game out before it launches on the 30th October, at which point you'll have to buy the game for £30.99 / $39.99 / €39.99. The purpose of this test is, as the name implies, to push the servers as hard as possible before the full release.</p>
<p>Arc Raiders already had a public test back in April. It was hard to account for how popular the test was, given its multi-platform availability. Instead, it's perhaps better to compare today's weekend play test to other games' recent open betas.</p>

<p>Compare it to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a>. This game was a massive presence on Steam during its open beta, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-hits-142000-concurrent-players-during-full-launch-smashing-past-record">quickly reaching roughly 150,000 concurrent users on Steam on its opening day</a>. Arc Raiders looks to be on track to pass the bar Dune: Awakening set, a good indicator of its popularity.</p><p>It is of course unfair to compare Arc Raiders to the most recent beta powerhouse of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-has-almost-250000-people-waiting-in-an-open-beta-queue">which had 250,000 players <em>waiting</em> to play in its open beta across all platforms</a>. Now, no one is expecting Arc Raiders to hit that level of popularity during a weekend play test, but peeking at where it lands this weekend between Dune: Awakening and Battlefield 6 could give a glimpse as to its eventual popularity when it goes premium.</p>
<p>These are, of course, different genres of games which must be taken into account. As an extraction game, Arc Raiders' biggest competitors are likely Escape From Tarkov, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/escape-from-tarkov-is-coming-to-steam">which is set to get a Steam release in November</a>, or it might also be Marathon, though it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-marathon-reboot-delayed-indefinitely-in-response-to-passionate-fan-feedback">remains indefinitely delayed following a plagiarism controversy</a>.</p>
<p>Either way, this weekend is your last chance to check out Arc Raiders before it comes out in full later this month. If you do hop in or have played it before, pop down below and let us know what you think of it. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/play-online-shooter-arc-raiders-free-next-month-in-final-test-weekend-before-release">The Arc Raiders playtest this weekend</a> is playable on PC via Steam and Epic, Xbox, and PS5. Nothing you collect will carry over to the full game, so just hop in and have a good time.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/801563/keeper-review-xbox-double-fine</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-weirdo-xbox-game-about-a-walking-lighthouse-is-a-keeper.1327903/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It’s a testament to the developers at Double Fine that it doesn’t take long before controlling a sentient lighthouse with spidery legs starts to feel almost normal. <em>Keeper</em>, the latest from the studio behind <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/9/9878278/psychonauts-2-tim-schafer-interview"><em>Psychonauts</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/27/7877417/grim-fandango-remastered"><em>Grim Fandango</em></a>, is obviously a strange game. You play as a building that can walk and solve puzzles and which befriends a cute bird while on a quest to rid a fantastical realm of an encroaching darkness. It’s like a cross between the wordless storytelling of <em>Wall-E</em> and the cinematic platforming of <em>Limbo</em>, with a psychedelic splash of Lisa Frank’s paints coating it all. It’s also a game that proves to be much more than it first seems. Somehow, things get even <em>weirder</em>.</p><p>Things start out simple. For unexplained reasons, you, a lighthouse, sprout legs and start stumbling about. There’s not much you can do aside from walk — awkwardly, at that — and point your big spotlight at things. Quickly enough, and after maybe accidentally crushing a few houses as you learn how to move, you’ll meet a big bird who immediately becomes your best friend. All you can do is keep moving forward, and as you do, you’re pulled into a strange world that’s clearly in need of help.</p><p>When you first start out, <em>Keeper</em> plays like a very linear kind of puzzle game. You walk down set paths so you can’t really get lost, and there are simple obstacles in your way. In most cases, you can trigger a magical switch or eliminate a hazardous impediment by shining your light on it. I’m glad the game starts slow because it took some getting used to; unlike most modern games, <em>Keeper</em> has a fixed camera, and you instead use the right stick to rotate the light at the top of the lighthouse.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Double Fine Productions</cite></p></div><p>From there, things slowly but surely open up. Even with only a few actions at your disposal, the puzzles can get surprisingly complex. You’ll be sending off your bird to collect items and flip switches and even messing around with the flow of time. <em>Keeper </em>manages to squeeze a lot out of its limited vocabulary — and then suddenly, it becomes something very different, multiple times. I don’t want to spoil anything because these moments are some of the most enjoyable parts of the game, but eventually, you’ll be able to jump and swim and, I kid you not, by the end the game, it resembles something like <em>Tony Hawk</em>. And along with this, the world similarly expands, giving you more space to explore.</p><p>And really, that world is the heart of <em>Keeper</em>. The puzzles are just there to give you something to do while you take it all in. It’s a strange, colorful, vibrant place, one teeming with life (though there’s not a human in sight). There are giant creatures made out of trees and adorable baby turtles the size of school buses. At one point, you have to find your way out of a clockwork town populated by little robots on wheels; later, you’re traversing caves that pulse with a hideous kind of life. Even though you’re a piece of architecture, <em>Keeper</em> makes you feel a part of this world, like you’re making it better over time. You also make a lot of cute friends who stick around to help when things get tough.</p><p>I put <em>Keeper</em> in the same category as experiences like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/13/18137844/gris-review-nintendo-switch-pc-gaming"><em>Gris</em></a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/28/12050342/inside-review-xbox-one-steam"><em>Inside</em></a>, where playing them is just a means to an end, and that end is moving through an imaginative, bizarre, and constantly changing space. The clever puzzles and strange forms of movement are just ways for me to feel more a part of the world. By the end of the game, which lasts just long enough to not overstay its welcome, it was almost hard to imagine I ever thought a walking lighthouse was weird at all. <em>Almost</em>.</p><p><sub>Keeper <em>is available October 17th on Xbox and PC.</em></sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/801563/keeper-review-xbox-double-fine]]></content:encoded>

            <p>As I wrote in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dire-comedy-bloodsport-king-of-meat-should-have-been-called-king-of-meme">our King of Meat preview</a>, I've long since fallen out of love with looting games. After thousands of hours rinsing RPG dungeons, I gaze upon even the shiniest and most temptingly crenelated of treasure chests with frigid contempt. But I'm not unenticed by the clanky and colourful, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deathloop">Deathloop</a> meets <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division">The Division</a> stylings of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>, Embark and Nexon's third-person extraction shooter, which is getting a three day open playtest this weekend.  
</p><!--more-->
<p>As <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-devs-would-you-like-you-to-slam-its-servers-with-one-last-open-to-all-tech-test-next-month">advertised in September</a>, the playtest is broadly an invitation to stress-test the game's servers before launch on October 30th, but it's not just an exercise in subjecting some weak-ass computers to a vigorous Spartan kicking. "This event will bring you to the Dam Battlegrounds where you'll experience elements of progression and crafting while completing a set of quests to provide you with a little taste of the Arc Raiders experience, while saving some surprises for the full launch," the developers explain.
</p>
<p>You don't need a code to get in, though you will need to create an Embark ID while signing on. Access will "roll out slowly" from today on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808500/ARC_Raiders/">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/arc-raiders-server-slam-79f964">Epic Games Store</a> (and the consoles, bless 'em). Progress made during the Server Slam won't carry over to the full game, but you do get a special edition backpack for your troubles.</p>

<p>Arc Raiders certainly likes a chunky backpack. Some of the carryalls in the trailers look like half-dismantled pianos. For all that, characters are very nimble, able to zipline between rooftops and descend rapidly to street level without getting squished by all the scrap stuffed into their rucksacks.

We'll see if lightning strikes twice.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-metal-gear-solid-death-stranding-ai-2000636622</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/death-stranding-director-hideo-kojima-embraces-%E2%80%98creating-together-with-ai%E2%80%99.1327888/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Celebrated gaming auteur Hideo Kojima is making waves once again with statements about artificial intelligence. This time, sporting a bit of a new look in a recent interview, Kojima has said he sees AI as a boon that can help cut out what he describes as “tedious” tasks, helping developers to lower costs and produce games faster.</p> <p>In an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPECvLZjFzO/">interview with <i>Wired Japan</i></a> (<a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/hideo-kojima-gives-his-verdict-on-use-of-ai-in-gaming-3269428/">h/t <i>Dexerto</i></a>), Kojima described “a future where [he stays] one step ahead; creating together with AI,” referring to the tech as “a friend.” Kojima presents an optimistic perspective on how the tech can be used, not necessarily to lead the creative projects, but rather to assist with mundane tasks to “boost efficiency.”</p>

 <p>It’s not the first time Kojima has opined on AI in the industry. Previously <a href="https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-ai-important-3d-ps6-portable-space-marine-last-of-us-2000621087">he described AI</a> as potentially as significant a development for games as the shift from 2D to 3D. He also recently suggested that AI will likely be used to <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/hideo-kojima-remakes-sequels-ai/">generate remakes and sequels</a>. Though the most recent statements on the potential friendliness of AI are rather optimistic, Kojima’s own creative output might have something to say about that. AI and advanced technology has often been a focal point of Kojima’s creative works, though they’ve typically played an antagonistic role in his fictional worlds.</p>

 <h2>Kojima’s previous games were far from optimistic about AI</h2> <p>Kojima’s statements are disappointing for those of us concerned about the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/federal-judge-rules-copyrighted-books-are-fair-use-ai-training-rcna214766">thorny issues of copyright</a> in the context of artificial intelligence systems, the desire to <a href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/sam-altman-real-work-ai">replace human labor </a>wholesale, and the inexcusable energy consumption that’s literally setting us back in our efforts to <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/explained-generative-ai-environmental-impact-0117">lessen the impact of climate change</a>. But they also ring dissonantly with the game developer’s own artistic output, namely <i>Metal Gear Solid 2</i> and <i>4</i>, which speculate not just on the dangers of artificial intelligence, but how the messiness of human history, hierarchies, and internet behavior could use (and lose control of) such highly advanced tech.</p>

  <p>Unravelling <i>MGS2</i> and other <i>MGS</i> games is messy business; like Kojima’s recent works, they’re long, dense games. But the modern embrace of AI, which is already being used to <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trumps-team-keeps-posting-ai-portraits-of-him-and-we-keep-clicking">efficiently produce propaganda</a> and which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/30/peter-thiel-palantir-threat-to-americans">folks who do not have humanity’s best interests in mind</a> are strongly encouraging, sounds a hell of a lot like what we were being warned about while the digital Colonel Campbell lost his artificial mind in <i>MGS2</i>.</p> <p>As <a href="https://locusmag.com/feature/cory-doctorow-a-vocabulary-for-speaking-about-the-future/">Cory Doctorow once said</a>, science fiction “is a literature that tells you how to prevent the bad tomorrows.” And while I appreciate Kojima’s optimism, I don’t think just seeing this tech “as a friend” is going to solve the ills of the bad <i>today</i>, much less the bad tomorrow.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-is-getting-a-sequel-1833479366">Nearly six years ago</a>, we learned that 2004’s clunky cult classic<em> RPG Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines</em> was going to get a big ol’ sequel. Now, flash forward to October 2025, and <em>Bloodlines 2</em> is nearly here after <a href="https://kotaku.com/original-writer-on-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-1844776074">a rocky development cycle</a><a href="https://kotaku.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-past-2021-1846333086"> that saw one studio replaced</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-new-release-date-1850804491">with another and multiple delays</a>. So is the game worth the 20-year wait and all the delays? Well, it depends who you ask.</p> <p>On October 17, three days ahead of <em>Bloodlines 2′</em>s launch on consoles and PC, reviews for the upcoming Chinese Room-developed action adventure RPG went live across multiple outlets. And critics are all over the place with this one. I’ve read a few reviews that make it sound like one of 2025’s worst games, other reviews that call it fine, and even a few that make it clear the reviewer truly enjoyed their time in the digital streets of rain-soaked and vampire-infested Seattle.</p>

  <p>Some critics praised the game’s atmosphere, storytelling, writing, and side characters, while others found a lot of that stuff to be disappointing. Others enjoyed <em>Bloodlines 2’s</em> combat and stealth, while some seem like they would rather eat glass than play anymore. The one thing nearly every review agrees on is that this isn’t really a sequel to <em>Bloodlines</em>. Instead, to many, it’s a linear, action-focused spin-off set in a bland open world with bad side quests and some neat ideas.</p> <p>While some might find such a wide array of critical reviews disappointing or annoying, I love it. These are the kinds of games that can often surprise you, though not always in a good way. Either way, I’m going to try and check out <em>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</em> when it launches on October 21 on PS5, Xbox, and PC.</p>  <h2><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review/">PC Gamer</a></h2> <blockquote><p><em>Bloodlines 2</em> is good, sometimes even great, and it absolutely sated my appetite for a blood-fuelled undead yarn. But it is a sequel in name only, and it never really enthusiastically embraces being an RPG. Given its predecessor’s cult status, and the source material, that’s bound to be a disappointment for some. – Fraser Brown</p></blockquote> <h2><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review">Eurogamer</a></h2> <blockquote><p>This is an action RPG with barely any character development (or even customisation) in it. You have four abilities you can use, tied to the clan you belong to, and you will unlock all of them within a couple of hours of play. And that’s it – you won’t get any more powerful after that. Powers don’t evolve or change. You can, if you like, unlock powers from other clans, but this won’t increase your overall power or offer more abilities to use in combat. It only offers variation and the potential to mix which four abilities you use, which might lead to finding a new combination you prefer, but it didn’t for me. I ended up using more or less my default abilities for the entirety of the 25-hour game. This, coupled with there being no loot or equipment in the game, makes character development feel thin to the point of nonexistent. – Robert Purchase</p></blockquote> <h2><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review">IGN</a></h2> <blockquote><p>Where it falls down the most, unfortunately, is as an RPG. You are playing as an elder vampire, so it’s not exactly a typical zero-to-hero story. But just to give a representative example, the damage your melee attacks do at the very beginning is exactly the same as it will be in the final boss fight. You awaken new powers called Disciplines, like being able to turn invisible or smooch an enemy to turn them to your side, but you’ll get all of them for your chosen clan within the first eight hours or so, after which point anything else is mostly a sidegrade. You can upgrade your health track by finding hidden symbols painted in blood across Seattle, but overall there isn’t much of a sense of power progression throughout most of the campaign. -Leana Hafer</p></blockquote> <h2><a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review-3265905/">Dexerto</a></h2> <blockquote><p><em>Bloodlines 2</em> isn’t the typical RPG many were expecting. It tells a great political story, taking you on a grown-up adventure where every choice you make affects the narrative, and it’s wonderfully complex. The city that The Chinese Room has built has a great atmosphere, and it’s populated by lovable (and hateable) characters. However, it could do so much more to live up to its name by taking great elements from the TTRPG to make you really feel like a vampire. As an adventure game, <em>Bloodlines 2</em> shines, but those missing features suck the life out of it as an RPG, for better and for worse. – Jessica Filby</p></blockquote> <h2><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review/">Gamesradar</a></h2> <blockquote><p><em>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</em> is the definition of a crying shame. Clumsy writing and flat, repetitive world design expose a handful of good ideas that never take root, while its poor technical quality and unstable performance will render it unplayable for some. The result is a half-baked, blunt-toothed action-mystery hybrid that disappoints at almost every turn, struggling to leave even the ghost of a good impression. – Jasmine Gould-Wilson</p></blockquote> <h2><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review-aged-but-still-a-fine-wine/1900-6418425/">GameSpot&nbsp;</a></h2> <blockquote><p>Fortunately, I think the wait (and the absolute&nbsp;chaos of development) was mostly worth it. Though I wouldn’t call <em>Bloodlines 2</em> a great game, per se, I had a great time playing it. For better or worse, it retains a lot of <em>Bloodlines’</em>&nbsp;DNA, blending action, stealth, and mystery to create a mature and enthralling, choice-driven RPG. Though not as nitty-gritty or system-heavy as its predecessor, it still largely feels the same to play. I swear, I experienced deja vu as I crouched through warehouses and nervously spoke with characters seemingly eager to sink their teeth into me if I said the wrong thing to them. However, it&nbsp;<em>also&nbsp;</em>carries with it some jank and technical issues that make it feel like an early aughts title. -Jessica Cogswell</p></blockquote> <h2><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/review">PCGamesN</a></h2> <blockquote><p>It seems The Chinese Room has taken all of <em>Bloodlines</em>‘ bad bits – chiefly janky combat and performance woes – and somehow magnified them.<em> Bloodlines 2</em> is neither a satisfying sequel nor a strong enough RPG experience to make the splash that the franchise sorely needs. If you’re a long-time <em>Vampire: The Masquerade</em> fan, you might just find enough to enjoy <em>Bloodlines 2</em>. I myself loved meeting its characters and lurking in the more hand-crafted sections of Seattle. But if you were hoping for a game that comes close to recapturing the magic of Troika’s classic, you won’t find it here. – Lauren Bergin</p></blockquote>

<h2 id="h-are-battlefield-6-portal-xp-farms-being-nerfed">Are Battlefield 6 Portal XP Farms Being Nerfed?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, Battlefield Studios will be adjusting Battlefield 6’s Portal mode to “Diminish the number of XP farms taking up server space while further emphasizing playing with friends on both custom and verified experiences.”</strong></p>



<p>We can’t have nice things, can we? It depends on how you look at it, really. Battlerfield Portal probably wasn’t designed to be an XP grind; it was supposed to be a creative playground filled with fun-filled rides packed with madness. However, the community got smart and used Portal to level up player ranks, weapons, and more much quicker.</p>



<p>Depending on when you read this guide, the nerfs might have already happened. But we know for sure that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-portal-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 Portal XP Farms will be patched</a>.</p>



<p>Are you playing BF 6’s Portal mode the way it was intended? Or are you having fun mercilessly beating bots and showing that you’re better than the AI?

<p>The Horizon Zero Dawn movie aims to start shooting in 2026 and release in 2027. </p>



<p>For those unaware, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-files-lawsuit-against-tencent-for-allegedly-copying-the-horizon-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony is fighting Tencent</a> for allegedly copying its Horizon series in its upcoming title, Light of Motiram. Sony recently described the title as a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-calls-tencents-defense-in-horizon-clone-lawsuit-nonsense/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blatant knock-off</a> of their game. Now, new documents have revealed more information, including the release plans for the Horizon Zero Dawn Movie. </p>



<h2 id="h-horizon-zero-dawn-movie-has-a-working-script-and-is-looking-for-a-director">Horizon Zero Dawn Movie Has a Working Script and is Looking for a Director</h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-horizon-zero-dawn-movie-filming-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Game Post</a>, the head of PlayStation Productions, Asad Qizilbash, spoke about the release plans for the Horizon Zero Dawn movie in a sworn declaration. Qizilbash stated that a film based on the Horizon series is in development in partnership with Columbia Pictures, with whom they have already partnered on the Uncharted and Gran Turismo films in 2023 and 2023, respectively. </p>



<p>Qizilbash added that they “already have a working script and are actively searching for a director.” The team aims to start “shooting the picture in 2026 and releasing it in 2027.” In the declaration, the PlayStation Productions head also spoke about Aloy’s significance as a brand, not just to the Horizon franchise, but to Sony PlayStation itself. The declaration doesn’t mention anything about the upcoming movie’s cast or plot. </p>



<p>In other news, Tencent had responded to Sony’s copyright and trademark infringement lawsuit with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-claps-back-at-sony-playstations-horizon-clone-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">motion to dismiss</a>. Additionally, Splash Damage, the studio behind Gears Tactics, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splash-damage-breaks-tencent-gears-tactics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has separated from Tencent</a> with the help of private investors.

Loaded with 45 classic games, the Intellivision Sprint is a new system celebrating the original Atari 2600 competitor.

The new console features two wireless controllers and "a USB-A port for library expansion." The games collection already installed on the system includes Baseball, Soccer, Astrosmash, Boulder Dash, and Sea Battle. In addition, two controller overlays are part of the package for every single title.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na6KVvxakMs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/na6KVvxakMs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"We’re thrilled to celebrate Intellivision's 45th anniversary, and what better way to honor it than by bringing back this innovative console for fans to experience once again?

            <p>This year's iteration of Football Manager will finally include official FIFA licensing for the first time.</p>
<p>A new multi-year licensing deal between Sports Interactive and FIFA has been signed, which will add official licenses to the game beginning with next year's FIFA World Cup 26 in Canada, Mexico and USA, as well as the FIFA Women's World Cup and FIFA Club World Cup.</p>
<p>The inclusion coincides with a revamped International Management module in an update due next year in advance of the World Cup - that's starting in June. The update will arrive across all versions of the game, including the Console and Touch versions.</p>

<p>As such, it means all official kits of the final 48 teams in the FIFA World Cup 26 will be included in the game, alongside broadcast graphics and tournament branding.</p>
<p>"Revealing this partnership with FIFA is an incredibly historic moment for the studio," said Sports Interactive studio director Miles Jacobson.</p>
<p>"Heading into a World Cup year, revamping International Management and making it a much more feature-rich module for our players was important.</p>
<p>"To be able to do that with the support of FIFA with an official licence, giving us the tournament broadcast graphics and tournament kits in-game, is a real honour and something we're delighted our fans will be able to experience next year.</p>
<p>"And this is just the start of our relationship - stay tuned for more to come in 2026 and beyond."</p>
<p>News of the FIFA license follows the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/football-manager-26-adds-the-womens-game-for-the-first-time-with-official-barclays-womens-super-league-inclusion">inclusion of the women's game to Football Manager 26</a>, in another first for the series.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/football-manager-2026">Football Manager 26</a> will be released worldwide across all platforms on 4th November, made for the first time with the Unity Engine.</p>
<p>Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell recently went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/brace-yourselves-football-manager-fans-ive-played-a-day-of-fm26-and-its-going-to-take-a-lot-of-getting-used-to">hands-on with Football Manager 26</a> to see how that new engine has impacted gameplay, for better and worse: "it's going to take a lot of getting used to."</p>

			<p>Surreal, surprising, and a bit silly are the best ways to describe Keeper, but with this being a game from Double Fine none of that is unexpected. Keeper is narrative puzzle experience, casting you as a lighthouse exploring a world that is in the grip of The Wither, accompanied by your bird friend Twig who is trying to get back to their family. None of this overtly explained, as there is no dialogue in Keeper with Double Fine trusting you to put some of the pieces together.</p>
<p><iframe title="Keeper - Official Announce Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AWAwVgTsFfk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Keeper starts off with your little lighthouse coming to life and growing legs. It is like a newborn creature and in the first moments you will fall over a lot while working out how to walk – though this is far from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/16/baby-steps-review/">a Baby Steps situation</a>. Soon, your feet are found and you start walking along the path with only one real goal, and that is to get to the top of the mountain.</p>


<p>Climbing a mountain is tough in the best of times when you’re a creature that has evolved to be very good at walking, so doing it as a lighthouse in a world that has lots of obstacles in the way sounds tricky. However, the way Keeper is laid out means the experience is hardly ever frustrating through its six hour runtime, though there is minor annoyance with some of the movement and the lack of ability to control the camera through more open areas. Sometimes, aiming your light can be a bit fiddly too.</p>


<p>Puzzles in Keeper start off very small. Your lighthouse can shine its light and focus it to highlight points of interest, interact with items, and clear paths. Where switches and levers need to be moved, Twig comes into play to move these switches to open doors and reveal more paths for you to follow. The more you venture into the world the bigger the puzzles get, with later ones using whole environments that hold the keys to passing. At no point does a puzzle get too hard, with many designed to kind of funnel you to the solution so you do not get stuck, but I do wish that there was something a little bit more mentally taxing.</p>
<p>That said, solving the puzzles in these areas is not all you should be focusing on. Among the different environments are little hidden areas with broken statues. With your light, these statues can be pieced back together, and you will unlock an achievement for each one. Double Fine has used the achievements system to expand Keeper’s lore, so you can learn more about what happened to the world.</p>

<p>Keeper looks fantastic throughout, with loads of variations in environments which feeds into how you play the game, constantly throwing up unexpected twists to the gameplay which keeps it fresh. The environments are really well detailed with lots of bright and colourful areas, juxtaposed with darker areas that reflect the mood of the story. My advice is take your time in each area, shine your light on the plants and inhabitants to watch them react and help the world bloom. I spent quite a bit of time in each place just shining the light on different things to see what would happen.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Keeper captures the essence of Double Fine, packaged in a heartfelt and surreal world where you never quite know what will happen next. The gameplay regularly surprises, but the lack of challenge in even the more elaborate puzzles is a bit of a drawback, along with not being able to control the camera.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Marc-Alexis Côté, the former head of the Assassin's Creed series at Ubisoft has clarified a key detail of his sudden departure from Ubisoft. Earlier this week, we learned <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-franchise-lead-leaves-ubisoft-following-tencent-subsidiary-reveal-vantage-studios/">through an IGN report (which Wccftech independently verified),</a> that Marc-Alexis Côté had left Ubisoft after 20 years with the company, 16 of them working on the Assassin's Creed franchise, and his final three as head of the entire franchise.</p>



<p>Côté's departure was framed as a result of the restructuring caused by Ubisoft's new subsidiary, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-new-subsidiary-far-cry-rainbow-six-assassins-creed-vantage-studios/">Vantage Studios</a>, a branch opened to house the Assassin's Creed, Rainbow Six, and Far Cry brands that Ubisoft established in collaboration with Tencent. A Ubisoft spokesperson confirmed to Wccftech by email that Côté "<em>was offered various leadership roles [within Vantage Studios] but respectfully declined</em>," and refused to speak further about the roles in question.</p>



<p>According to Côté, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7384672277055012864/">in a post on his personal LinkedIn account</a>, that's not how things shook out.</p>



<p>"<em>Many of you have expressed surprise that I would choose to leave Assassin's Creed after so many years, especially given the passion I still hold for it. The truth is simple: I did not make that choice,</em>" Côté writes.</p>



<p>"<em>Ubisoft decided to transfer the leadership of the Assassin's Creed franchise to someone closer to its new organizational structure. A different position was mentioned, but it did not carry the same scope, mandate, or continuity with the work I had been entrusted with in recent years</em>." </p>



<p>"<em>I want to be clear that I hold no resentment. Ubisoft has been my home for all my professional life, and I will always be grateful for the people, the projects, and the belief that together we could create worlds that inspire millions. But I also owe it to my teams, past and present, to say this plainly: I did not walk away. I stayed at my post until Ubisoft asked me to step aside."</em></p>



<p>So, while Ubisoft's version of events can still be technically true in that there was a potential role for Côté within Vantage Studios that he said no to, we now know that Ubisoft did not really give Côté a choice in the matter, and it almost seems like their preference was to lose a stalwart of the series, someone who had been through key periods of the franchise in lead creative roles, and who knew the franchise so intimately he could be at the helm of everything to do with Assassin's Creed, than to keep him.</p>



<p>It cannot be overstated that Côté's loss is a big one for Ubisoft, since veterans like him can be essential to keeping a long-running franchise alive and well, not just for their own leadership capabilities but also for their ability to mentor the next generation. Pushing out one of the people most knowledgeable about Assassin's Creed at Ubisoft is not necessarily a great start for Vantage Studios.</p>



<p>In any case, it'll be interesting to see how the Vantage Studios co-leads, Charlie Guillemot, the son of Ubisoft's chief executive officer, Yves Guillemot, and Christophe Derennes, carry the series forward.</p>

			<p>A long time ago, developers Double Fine burst onto the scene with the flop that was Psychonauts, following this up with the equally floppy Brütal Legend. Of course, Psychonauts became a cult classic, and I enjoyed Jack Black's Musical Strategy more than most. However, these efforts resulted in Double Fine spending a few years creating smaller titles before the massive Kickstarter success of Broken Age, followed by <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/psychonauts-2-mindblowing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Psychonauts 2</a>'s success on the Fig crowdfunding network, and the acquisition by Microsoft. This brings us to Keeper, their first game in four years.</p>



<p>So with that long introduction out of the way, let's talk about Keeper. You can tell this is a Double Fine game, with its unique art style, a story that is somewhat "out there", and just something that is generally difficult to pin down for one reason or another.</p>

<p>Let's start with what is easy to pin down: this is an adventure/walking simulator. There are puzzles, but I'm going to say it's not really a puzzle game because everything can be solved by just moving your character's head the right way, and then moving forward. There's no real thinking required. Sure, there are some where you have to shine your light on something, to free something else, and then take that something somewhere, but it's not going to test you.</p>



<p>Of course, it's not meant to test you. Keeper is about the journey and the story, more than anything else. The premise of the game is that you are a lighthouse that has gained sentience after a bird crashes into you. How you gained sentience, who knows? How you retain that sentience after (spoilers) being demolished, and being turned into a ship, a Beyblade, and then a crab-ship, I still have no idea.</p>



<p>What I do know is that the theme of the game, being about light fighting off darkness, is a little obvious, even if Double Fine has made it clear that the player is to take away from it what they will. The open cinematic is so reminiscent of Gandalf shining light to push off the Nazgul to save Faramir; it can't be a coincidence. If there is meant to be some deeper meaning, it was utterly lost on me.</p>



<p>Which is a shame, because there are positives to take away from Keeper. It's an absolutely gorgeous game, with an art style I can't take my eyes off of. The scenery and settings, particularly some of the stranger ones when magic comes into play, are like walking through beautiful paintings. There are some little secrets to find, so slight exploration is rewarded to an extent, but the problem is that Keeper is at its best about halfway through.</p>

<p>I'll explain, but then it's going to be a bit more negative. Keeper has a part which opens up a little; it's still linear, but that's not a problem. What is important is that you surround yourself with candyfloss, and this allows you to jump into some straightforward platforming. There's no difficulty here, but it <em>feels</em> fantastic. As you move through the game, the feel of your character adjusts based on the form you're in, but it never feels better than this platforming candyfloss form.</p>



<p>This ends up being the core problem of Keeper, at least for me. I could be completely wrong, but the game feels like a wide range of levels and designs were created, and the game was extended to accommodate them. You reach close to the top in the Lighthouse form, then you crash down. Then, in a boat form, you go so far before being demolished. Then you're quickly in a Beyblade form, facing what could be considered the only 'boss', before being knocked out. Finally, you're the crab for all of twenty minutes.</p>



<p>The problem is that it doesn't feel organic in its progression, and, at least for me, there are only so many times I can do the same thing without it feeling like padding for the sake of padding. The second I'm playing a game and I'm thinking "I'm bored now", there's something that has gone wrong, which is a shame because that boredom goes away and Keeper finds its stride again a little later.</p>

<p>Keeper is a strange game, to say the least, and one that isn't easy to review. As gorgeous as it is, and as fantastic as the animations and characterisations of the Keeper and its friendly bird are, it is still one that ultimately outstayed its welcome while I was playing it. The thirty-nine stages could have been condensed, and the game, taking up to eight hours, would have been more effective and impactful if it had been an hour or two shorter.</p>

				<p>Would I recommend giving it a go? For the art style alone, I probably would, yes. It's an absolutely gorgeous game, and there were moments that I genuinely had a smile on my face. It was a shame that there were other moments when I literally sighed and said, "I've had enough now," although this may not be the same for everybody.</p>
