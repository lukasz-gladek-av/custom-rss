<figure><a title="Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1db8811c4c1ba/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Marvelous</em></figcaption></figure><p>Marvelous has recently released <a href="https://marvelousgames.com/news/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-1-0-5-update">a new update</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a> on both the Switch and Switch 2, bringing the game up to version 1.0.5.</p>
<p>It's not a <em>massive</em> one, but there are definitely a few tweaks here that should improve your experience with the game considerably. Heck, we love Woolby, but reducing how often the dude pipes up is a big win in our books.</p>
<p>So without further ado, let's check out the patch notes:</p>
<h6>Features</h6>
<ul>
<li>Adds the ability to adjust village farmer behavior in the Options menu. You can now toggle the following tasks on or off: sow seeds, water fields, and harvest crops.</li>
</ul><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067lnjwix&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<h6>Bug Fixes</h6>
<ul>

<li>Adjusted the volume of certain lines for Zaza and Woolby in Japanese.</li>
<li>The Sacred Sword can now harvest crops over a wider range.</li>
<li>Added new warp points for Spring Village’s and Autumn Village’s development zones.</li>

<li>Fixed a bug where the ema plaque request “The Divine Sword Dance is the Best!” would not be available.</li>
<li>Adjusted the Blade Shard drop rate so you can now obtain them from high-level toad and fallen warrior enemies.</li>

<li>Fixed an issue in which some Ema Board and Hometown Quests could not be completed.</li>
<li>Other minor fixes including some localisation adjustments.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>We reckon Guardians of Azuma is well worth checking out if you haven't done so already. We awarded the game a 9/10 on the Switch and Switch 2, stating that it's "a must-play for Rune Factory fans and would be well-enjoyed by newcomers to the series as well".</p>

Her pursuit of Yuri is what many would call “intense,” and she ends up living in the Mito household. But as a Tayutai, she’s not exactly human…</p><p>Mashiro is tolerant and level-headed, but that just makes rousing her anger all the more terrifying.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 continues to nab the headlines as the newest and most exciting kid on the block, and this week has all been about <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/16/donkey-kong-bananza-review/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, which is what I’m planning to play all day today. Besides that, I’ve been putting a load of time into Yakuza 0 Director’s Cut, a spot of Mario Party, and dipping in and out of Rune Factory Guardians of Azuma.</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> is currently playing Shadow Labyrinth for review, but you’ll have to wait until next week for his thoughts on it! Meanwhile, <strong>Jim</strong> went for something decidedly more retro. He told us, “I don’t exactly know why I was drawn to it, but this week I ended up playing (and getting the platinum trophy for) Twisted Metal. I remember taking the PS5 emulated version for a spin when it first dropped on PlayStation Plus and really, really not liking it. However, accepting the game’s primitive design and rough edges, I went back and had a good time with it before jumping into the sequel which is slightly more polish albeit tougher.”</p>

<p><strong>Ade</strong> played the sneak ’em up <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/14/eriksholm-the-stolen-dream-review/">Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream</a> for review and after giving it a 10/10, it’s clear that he thinks it’s absolutely awesome! He says, “It’s the best stealth game I’ve played since Mark of the Ninja, I definitely recommend giving this debut release from River Island Games a go.”</p>
<p>This week, <strong>Gamoc</strong> has played The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered in Chronological mode, Peglin and Neverwinter Nights 2 Remastered for review, and a bunch of Switch games, including Breath of the Wild, “which is obviously excellent, but the weapon durability can die in a fire.” He continued, “I also played the “worry about my PS5 after it overheated” game, which I don’t recommend.”</p>


<p><strong>Steve</strong> has been catching up on a flurry of review titles as mid-July seems to be the new peak release season. He says, “I’ve polished off the standalone <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/17/robocop-rogue-city-unfinished-business-review/">RoboCop: Rogue City – Unfinished Business</a>, which was actually better paced than the original and I had a lot fun with, the great indie grindhouse point n click The Drifter, decent 2.5 platformer Once Upon a Puppet, and about to get stuck into The Necromancer’s Tale – the latter review will be next week now. I’ve treated myself to DK Bananza but might wait until I have my gallbladder operation and make it my recovery game.” Hope everything goes well with that Steve!</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has not really played Destiny 2. As unbelievable as that is, instead he’s gone back to The Callisto Protocol which he bought and never really sat down to play. His review? “It’s quite good.”</p>

<p>And we’ll round things out with <strong>Tef</strong>, who was charged with our Donkey Kong Bananza review this week and had a smashing time with it, but has now shifted focus from ape grunts and whoops to the grunts of V6, V8 and V12 engines in Le Mans Ultimate.</p>
<p>What about you? What have you played?</p>

"The fact AI tools are replacing people is absolutely disgusting but it’s all about efficiency and profits even though the company is doing great overall," said one source.

Platform owner Roblox Corp has partnered with a number of IP holders (with more to come, apparently) so users can license their properties when creating their own Roblox jaunts. Creators will only be able to license an IP if they meet the demands of their respective owners. Sega, for instance, wants to know creators are capable of pulling in over 1,000 daily active users before granting them permission to use the Like a Dragon license. Netflix, meanwhile, has opened Squid Game and Stranger Things to even the smallest creator—although their revenue share offering isn't quite as generous as their peers.

            <p>Nintendo is gearing up for another one of its Switch Online playtest programs.</p>
<p>This particular test will kick off later this month, on Monday 28th. It will run until Sunday, 10th August.</p>
<p>As with last year's playtest, Nintendo is keeping this rather mysterious for would-be participants, stating it is all "related to a service" for Switch Online. That said, if you did participate in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-playtesting-mystery-new-switch-online-feature-this-month-with-up-to-10k-people">previous event which took place in October</a>, you will have an idea of what this is all about, as "this is a test of the same service".</p>

<p>If you are interested in applying, you will need to have a Nintendo Account registered in Japan, United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Canada, Brazil, or Mexico, and an "active" Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership. Unlike October's test (for obvious reasons), the upcoming test also caters for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> users.</p>
<p>Nintendo said it expects to have 40,000 participants worldwide for the upcoming playtest. If you are interested, registrations open this week via <a href="https://playtest-p.nintendo.com/en-us">Nintendo's official website</a>. As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-asks-switch-online-playtesters-not-to-disclose-any-information-but-how-long-will-that-last">with the previous test</a>, Nintendo requests participants do not discuss or disclose content from either the Switch Online: Playtest Program test software or website with others (although, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/now-people-are-streaming-nintendos-mysterious-switch-online-playtest">we all know how that went last time…</a>).</p> <div>

            <p>FromSoftware's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>s have done much to explore the cycle of death and resurrection that games have historically taken for granted, but ask comparatively few questions on how the bosses feel about all this. What of the growing psychological weariness that comes from having to swat the same quixotic gnat over and over? What of the despair that grows from realising that, in the eternal battle between godly power and free resurrections 4 life, resurrections will always win out on a long enough timeline. Broken meta. Plz fix. My crumbling empire and poetically exposed eterna-hubris cannot take any more. </p>
<p>What I'm saying is, when people talk about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> being about "overcoming adversity", they are lying to themselves. Dark Souls is about being a tiny little cheater running face first into a wall until your head is so used to the shape of the bricks that they simply have no effect on your fat, dumb skull. Dark Souls is about using an unfair advantage to torture gods who are much better than you at everything.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-dark-queen-of-mortholme">Enter The Dark Queen Of Mortholme</a>, a one (boss) room play that casts you in the role of a 2D Soulslike's final challenge. It's actually been <a href="https://qwertyprophecy.itch.io/mortholme/devlog/952974/the-dark-queen-of-mortholme-coming-to-steam">kicking around on Itch</a> for a while now, but it's getting a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3587610/The_Dark_Queen_of_Mortholme/">Steamly</a> re-release <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3587610/view/532099213295617562">with</a> "full controller support, over a dozen languages," and achievements. Its existence is also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-just-discovered-a-dwarf-fortress-cave-diving-roguelite">news to me</a>. The best kind of news, for the best kind of me (me).</p>
<p>"Experience a macabre, short-form, second-person indie, you play as The Dark Queen of Mortholme, the final barrier between the Hero and the end credits," reads Steam. "In this fixed-screen pixel art game, use the Queen's attacks against this hero, slay them, and quell this nuisance once and for all. But, wait. How is this possible? The Hero keeps coming back".</p>
<p>The game is "designed to be eaten in a single, emotional sitting". Wait, no, sorry. I'm reading from the back of my Tesco Cherry Bakewell Cheesecake box (£1.85, 450g). The game is "designed to be <em>beaten</em> in a single emotional sitting". Lovely. It's also got multiple endings and routes. There's something in there about seeing "the hero's point of view" but this sounds like defeatism to me. It's out next month, August the 15th. Again, you can play on Itch right now.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-dark-queen-of-mortholme-is-a-reverse-elden-ring-where-you-play-the-final-boss]]></content:encoded>

<p>Nintendo has announced it will be running another <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendos-switch-online-playtest-program-returning-includes-switch-2-support">Switch Online Playtest Program later this month</a>, and in the fine print of the application guidelines and "how to apply" section, it once again asks participants to "not discuss or disclose content" about this test.</p>
<p>This request from Nintendo to not share content also extends to not revealing details from the participant website or talking about the experience with "others". One exception to this rule is if you participate "as a group" in the playtest, you may communicate and exchange information as long as it's "within the bounds of your group".</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067lnjwix&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p><strong>Nintendo:</strong> "We request that you do not discuss or disclose content from either the Nintendo Switch Online: Playtest Program test software or website with others. If you participate as a group, you may communicate and exchange information as long as it remains within the bounds of your group."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you might recall, the previous playtest immediately led to all sorts of leaks – with participants uploading details and videos about the experience, and also live streaming direct footage. According to previous reports, Nintendo responded to this at the time with copyright takedowns across multiple platforms.</p>
<p>Although Nintendo was enforcing these rules in the previous test, oddly, it didn't even bother to disable in-game screenshots or the video recording feature on the Switch. This latest playtest is also bumping the participant count from 10,000 users to "as many as 40,000 participants worldwide" so the chance of a leak has just been drastically increased.</p>

<p>As for Kidd, this actor and musician takes on the role of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/paulines-age-in-donkey-kong-bananza-has-been-revealed">younger 13-year-old version of Pauline</a>. The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> version of this character is voiced by Kate Higgins – with the same voice talent also cast as her in the more recent release, Mario Kart World.</p>
<p>In some related news, last month it was confirmed Peach's voice actor had been replaced after an 18 year run. In recent years, Nintendo has also told fans to wait for the official game release to find out details like this. This has extended to developer reveals, although this was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/donkey-kong-bananza-developer-has-been-revealed">slightly different for DK's new outing</a>.</p>

<p>So, if you haven't already got a physical version of Donkey Kong Bananza, or just don't plan on getting a hard copy of the game, this is what it looks like when you open the case! Nintendo also did <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/09/heres_a_first_look_inside_metroid_dreads_nintendo_switch_game_case">similar full spread shots like this</a> on some box arts during the Switch generation.</p>
<p>As for the rest of the DK physical release, the game card (which includes the <em>entire</em> game on the card) features the same artwork as Banaza's front cover featuring DK and Pauline. And the <a href="https://x.com/BoTalksGames/status/1943776059562070078">back of the case</a> shows off some more artwork of DK, while also highlighting some other aspects of the game.</p>
<p>All of this has got us wondering if our community has picked up this new Switch 2 release physically or if they purchased the game digitally via the eShop? <em>So, vote in our poll and let us know in the comments.</em></p>

<p>To apply and participate, you'll need to have a Nintendo Account and an "active" Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership. This is a test of the "same service" Nintendo performed a test for in October last year.</p>
<p>One other notable update is the ability to download this "exclusive software" on not only the original Switch system but also the Switch 2, which launched last month.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067lnjwix&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>This test will be available to users located in the US, Mexico, Canada, Brazil, Japan, the UK, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. It will take place between <strong>28th July 2025</strong> until <strong>10th August 2025</strong>.</p>

<p>Registrations open this week on <a href="https://playtest-p.nintendo.com/en-us">Nintendo's official website</a>, and if you participated in the previous playtest, you can apply to participate individually or as a group for this latest test. Applicants will be accepted on a "first-come, first-served basis".</p>
<p>In the lead up to the original playtest last year, Nintendo told participants to not "discuss or disclose" anything about it. Of course, this led to details and footage of the game leaking online, with some users even streaming their experience.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendo-still-doesnt-want-you-to-talk-about-the-switch-online-playtest-program">same rules apply for the latest test</a>, and Nintendo also notes how this playtest is "expected to accept as many as 40,000 participants worldwide". This announcement follows the news earlier this week Nintendo would be hosting an online demo for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a>, due out next month.</p>

                <p>Nintendo has announced it is hosting another Switch Online Playtest Program later this month. The closed beta is slated to begin on July 28, and it will give eligible users another chance to sample the same mystery service that was tested out during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-launching-mysterious-switch-online-test-soon-heres-how-to-sign-up/1100-6527070/" data-ref-id="1100-6527070">October 2024 Playtest Program</a>.</p><p>As before, the Switch Online Playtest Program is only open to select players on a first come, first served basis. To qualify, you must be at least 18 years old and have an active Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription as of July 17.</p><p>This time around, Nintendo is allowing players to apply either individually or as part of a group. You can create an application starting on July 18 at 3 PM PT/6 PM ET, with registration formally opening on July 21 at 8 AM PT/11 AM ET. Full details can be found on <a href="https://playtest-p.nintendo.com/en-us" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo's website</a>.</p><p>This Playtest Program is scheduled to run from July 28 to August 10. Nintendo says it is "expected to accept as many as 40,000 participants worldwide."</p><p>As was the case during the first Playtest Program, Nintendo is asking participants not to publicly discuss the service they are testing. The company writes:</p><p>"We request that you do not discuss or disclose content from either the Nintendo Switch Online: Playtest Program test software or website with others. If you participate as a group, you may communicate and exchange information as long as it remains within the bounds of your group."</p><p>This isn't the only beta test coming up for Switch Online members. Nintendo is also hosting a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-can-try-switch-2-wheelchair-basketball-game-drag-x-drive-next-month-but-theres-a-catch/1100-6533193/" data-ref-id="1100-6533193">limited-time Drag x Drive demo</a> from August 9-10. Unlike the Playtest Program, this is open to all NSO subscribers and will take place during three specific time slots over those two days.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="No Sleep For Kaname Date - From AI: THE SOMNIUM FILES Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157381/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/no-sleep-for-kaname-date-from-ai-the-somnium-files">No Sleep For Kaname Date - From AI: THE SOMNIUM FILES</a> is the newest entry in Spike Chunsoft's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ai_the_somnium_files">AI: Somnium Files</a> series and is actually a spin-off of the first two games. As a 'mid-quel' between both stories, No Sleep for Kaname Date is a good companion piece for fans of the series but not so much for those unfamiliar. Its visual novel elements are bolstered by new gameplay mechanics that keep the game, and series, from becoming stale.</p>
<p>This entry also sees the return of our original protagonist, Kaname Date. This time around, his idol friend, Iris Sagan, is kidnapped by a UFO and she’s forced to play escape room games in order to stay alive, while Kaname works around the clock to uncover the dark secrets behind Iris’s abduction.</p>
<p>No Sleep for Kaname Date is the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_heroes_trails_through_daybreak_ii">Trails through Daybreak 2</a> of the series, as its story doesn’t move the overall series plot forward in a meaningful way, but focuses on a much more personal conflict. I’ve always loved the series’ incorporation of wacky conspiracy theories to its mysteries, but then it turns out that the truth is actually much more grounded.</p>
<figure><a title="No Sleep For Kaname Date - From AI: THE SOMNIUM FILES Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157382/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>While I enjoyed the characters talking about how ancient civilisations received alien technology, I do think that No Sleep for Kaname Date has the weakest twists of the three games so far. They’re a little more predictable this time around and as a result don’t hit as hard.</p>
<p>By its very nature of being a spin-off, the story could leave some fans feeling alienated, but it reintroduces characters like the second game’s protagonist, Ryuki, to show players what he was doing before his prior big debut. The new characters Hina and Akemi are fantastic additions, as the former’s love for puzzles and the latter’s weird reptilian origins make the already weird cast even more enigmatic.</p>
<p>This makes No Sleep for Kaname Date an excellent bridge between both games. The game fully expects you to know who these characters are and how they fit into the overall Somnium Files universe, so it's best to go in once you’ve played the other two entries.</p>

<p>The previous games were written by Kotaro Uchikoshi, who was also director of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/zero_escape_virtues_last_reward">Zero Escape</a> series. However, this time around, No Sleep for Kaname Date is directed and written by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/it-was-hell-spike-chunsoft-devs-discuss-no-sleep-for-kaname-date-from-ai-the-somnium-files">Kazuya Yamada</a>. Honestly, it’s hard to tell that this game was written by someone else entirely. Yamada did a great job emulating Uchikoshi’s writing style. Iris is just as bubbly as ever, and Date is as much of a perv as he was in the previous games. The characters’ personalities are consistent, which prevents No Sleep for Kaname Date from feeling jarring.</p>
<p>The main gameplay mechanic revolves around Psyncs, where Date can jump into the psyche of another person. Date will have to solve “mental locks” that are related to the current mystery. Here, his eyeball companion, Aiba, navigates throughout the dream-like world interacting with various objects. For example, if she comes across an important script, she might get the option to “take” or “read” it. Only one of them is the correct answer that’ll progress through the mental locks.</p>
<p>These puzzles have remained largely unchanged from previous games and end up devolving into guessing games. There’s really not much of a strategy except hope that you pick the right answer. It feels rather unengaging sometimes.</p>

<p>However, the new escape room puzzles are much more exciting and make up for the somewhat underwhelming Somniums. Ironically, the game where Uchikoshi is the least involved with borrows the mechanic he’s best known for. These escape rooms require you to really put your brain to the test. For example, in the first escape room, you have to look at patterns on torn flags to figure out a special code to put into a terminal, or else your room will run out of air.</p>
<p>The escape rooms feel intense when you’re on a timer, especially compared to the Somniums. It’s difficult to strike a balance when it comes to escape rooms, but they feel appropriately challenging here. I felt an immense sense of satisfaction when I solved them, and that they were never unfairly hard.</p>
<p>If you are having trouble during these segments, however, there are plenty of gameplay settings and options to tailor your gameplay experience to be more approachable. You can enable infinite hints and even ask the game to reveal the solution to a particular puzzle, too.</p>

<p>Having played both the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/new-ai-the-somnium-files-is-latest-switch-2-game-to-include-mouse-mode-support">Switch and Switch 2</a> versions of the game, the latter’s graphical enhancements and load time improvements feel negligible. However, No Sleep for Kaname Date is a visual novel, so the lack of differences don’t really matter much. The Switch 2 version does support Mouse Mode, which I tried out for a bit before reverting back to standard Joy-Con controls. You can navigate escape rooms and Somniums, as well as interact with clues and items. Sure, it’s a nice feature to have but the novelty eventually wears off.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>No Sleep for Kaname is a good spin-off for existing AI: The Somnium Files fans. While the Somnium segments haven’t evolved much since their introduction in the first game, the new escape puzzle games are a welcome addition to the series. Despite a new writer taking the helm for this entry, the writing is tonally consistent and the characters are as charming as ever.</p></section>

            <title><![CDATA[An Ode To Order Of Battle, A Game About Moving Guys Around A Map]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/order-of-battle-ww2-turn-based-tactics-game-pc</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/an-ode-to-order-of-battle-a-game-about-moving-guys-around-a-map.1246773/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/strategy-game-turn-based-tactics-movement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As I have already made clear on this website</a>, there are few things I love more in video games than moving guys around a map. Today, I would like to pay tribute to my favourite entry in the MGAM genre: <em>Order of Battle</em>, a turn-based WW2 tactics game first released in 2015.</p><p><em>Order of Battle</em> is basically a more modern version of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panzer_General" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the classic <em>Panzer General</em></a>. With hex maps, turn-based gameplay and a probability-based resolution to battles, it basically plays the same as a round of <em>Advance Wars</em> or <em>Fire Emblem</em>, only you have Sherman tanks and paratroopers instead of wizards and hero characters.</p><p>I will say here that, before we go any further, this game has <em>problems</em>. For one, not long after launch it adopted what was at the time a fairly controversial release model where the base game (including a simple tutorial) was free, and players were then asked to buy each campaign individually. That's pretty normal by 2025 standards, but back then it pissed a lot of people off!</p><p>It also suffers from the same problem a lot of Second World War games do in that in trying to give you access to multiple factions--you can play scripted campaigns as both the Germans and Japanese--they end up inadvertently putting the player in charge of stuff like...genocides and the advances that led to the Rape of Nanking.<a href="https://kotaku.com/hey-history-games-the-nazis-were-the-bad-guys-1842463381" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Things here are nowhere near as glib as they are in, say, <em>Panzer Corps 2</em>, which almost revels in it</a>, but it's still uncomfortable to be so focused on moving little guys around a map when what came after those guys, even if the game never mentions it, was <em>a holocaust</em>.</p><p>(Given the purchasing model mentioned above though, you absolutely never have to play those campaigns, and there are loads available, including the most interesting ones, for the Americans and British.)</p><p>Even as a game, it has issues! A big part of <em>Order of Battle</em>, and one of the things that separates it from <em>Panzer General</em>, is that it includes both a visible frontline (which ebbs and flows depending where each of your units is on the map), and the ability to sever your opponent's supply lines by cutting across theirs, which can slow units down and even starve them of ammo, making them easier to mop up. It sounds great in theory--<a href="https://kotaku.com/unity-of-command-ii-is-a-really-solid-world-war-two-str-1839842115" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and is something the rival <em>Unity of Command</em> series is actually able to do well</a>--but its implementation in <em>OoB </em>is maddening, because it allows a single unit to cut off an entire army's supply lines, across thousands of miles of frontline, which is just some bullshit both from an authenticity standpoint as well as gameplay one.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Order of Battle - Burma Road Trailer 2017" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JOVHV7_IYPU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>All of which is to say that I love this game so much I do not really care about any of those things, at least not enough to stop me enjoying the game, because something <em>Order of Battle</em> does <em>very </em>well is let you move guys around a map. It excels at it. Everything about it is perfect. The way you can snap between selected units, the speed at which you can make them move, the little vrooms or marching boot sounds as they zoom off down a road, the way you can get a guy moving then click on the next guy and start <em>him </em>moving while the last guy is <em>still </em>moving, creating an endless succession of guys moving across the map all at once, it's wonderful.</p><p><em>Order of Battle</em> gives you the tangible thrill of being in command without any of the responsibility. Look at all these guys go! It doesn't matter if they stumble into an ambush, that's life, the point is that it was fun getting them there in the first place. You don't have to write letters to grieving mothers back home, and even if you did, their sons died doing what they did best: moving six hexes straight into enemy crossfire because their commander was too bust enjoying the cute noises they made while doing it.</p><p>What's also cool in <em>Order of Battle</em> is the sheer scale and variety of maps you get to move across. Ignoring the German and Japanese campaigns, there are still so many different ways you can fight this war as the British, Americans and Soviet Union, from the deserts of Africa to the snowy wastelands of Finland to the jungles of Burma. Each of those locations has different types of map, with different climates and different sizes. There are defensive maps, which are the worst, because they involve the least amount of moving guys around. There are dense urban struggles, vast open steppes that your tanks can soar across and, best of all, some big naval invasion maps which let you move ships, then have some of those ships turn into guys, then you get to move <em>those guys</em> around on land.</p><p>I don't want to discredit the rest of the game here (<a href="https://kotaku.com/order-of-battle-world-war-ii-the-kotaku-review-1795749182" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even if this isn't a review, I've done that already</a>), as <em>Order of Battle</em> also has a neat experience system where your units can grow and improve (and be upgraded with better gear) throughout a campaign, and many missions feature some wild attempts at scripting, some of which works magnificently, others which...well, they tried. Campaigns are a pleasure to play through on a tactical basis, not just a vroom vroom basis, and for all the times this game stumbles I admire the way it's able to pick itself up again and keep going given it was developed with what appear to be quite limited resources.</p><p>But yeah, for everything it does well, there's nothing it does better than letting me move guys around a map. So thank you, <em>Order of Battle</em>, for being the best in the MGAM business.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/polygon-valnet-off-the-grid-gunzilla-rip-this-sucks"><h3>🙃 [Update]</h3></a><p>Cool, cool, cool</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/friendslop-peak-lethal-company-social-media-discourse"><h3>‘Friendslop’ Isn’t Real, But People Love Posting About It Anyway</h3></a><p>But people are still intent on dunking on the idea of someone saying "friendslop" and meaning it.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lets-plays-sleep-youtube"><h3>Is Falling Asleep To Let’s Plays Medically Approved Gamer Melatonin Or Nah</h3></a><p>A gamer neurologist discusses whether YouTubers are onto something with this Millennial-meets-Gen-Z craze</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/order-of-battle-ww2-turn-based-tactics-game-pc]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">The weight of expectation that Sucker Punch Production is carrying is rather heavy. As one of the few first-party PlayStation games of 2025, many players will be looking to it to scratch the story-driven AAA blockbuster itch that has been out of reach for a lot of the year. But, beyond that, it has the unenviable task of following up the beloved Ghost of Tsushima.</p><p dir="ltr">Ghost of Yotei has been kept behind the curtain throughout most of its development, but recently, it had a big showing as the focal point of a State of Play broadcast. Depending on who you ask, they'll either say it looks stunning and has some potentially exciting gameplay evolutions or it looks good... but also very familiar.</p><p dir="ltr">That split in perspective isn't surprising to directors Jason Connell and Nate Fox. In fact, that very much is the intent. The challenge, however, is in finding a good balance between the two, which is easier said than done. Following the State of Play, GameSpot spoke to Connell and Fox about the success of Ghost of Tsushima and how Sucker Punch approached its sequel, as well as what players can expect when the game launches in October.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4534077-ghostofyotei_stateofplay_edgeofjapan_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4534077" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4534077-ghostofyotei_stateofplay_edgeofjapan_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4534077"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4534077-ghostofyotei_stateofplay_edgeofjapan_2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: Ghost of Tsushima was a spectacular game and I think it's fair to say that it elevated awareness around the studio significantly. What was that like afterward? How did you feel after that and did you start to feel the pressure of having to meet that high bar now?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Connell</strong>: Making Tsushima, there's certainly a lot of passion that goes into that project. Nate and I love samurai cinema, so getting to make a game in that sort of way was exciting, but I think it's certainly very thrilling to see it land with a bunch of people--way more people than maybe we anticipated. And that's a very positive feeling; kind of an overwhelming feeling too.</p><p dir="ltr">The amount of people that were posting photo mode [shots] on Twitter and reaching out and making comments--whenever you have something that many people play, there's going to be things they hate about it, there's going to be things that they love about it. And you just hear it all. It's certainly a new feeling.</p><p dir="ltr">But I know for me, and Nate might feel different, it certainly makes it feel daunting to go make whatever comes next, because inevitably people are going to be like, "Oh, is this as good as your last thing?" That's just a normal part of the creation process, though, so I think it's a gift. We have great [intellectual properties]. We're part of a great studio. Sony, in general, lets us be really creative. It feels like we're sitting in a really awesome spot where we can build off the shoulders of an awesome game that we created, but then add all these extra new features in and fresh elements that maybe we didn't have time for in the last game because we were just trying to get the basics moving. It feels both exhilarating, overwhelming; really a lot of gratitude, but also at the same time really creatively fulfilling to be able to make Yotei the way we want to make it.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Nate Fox: </strong>I found it really inspiring, actually, to see people play the game on YouTube or Twitch and talk about what they liked, they didn't like. It fuels all of us here in the studio when we're making the sequel to see where people get so much enjoyment out of the game. And it's a new experience. When we were making Sly Cooper and Infamous, people didn't do live playthroughs of Sly, so I didn't know what level hit. It's really exciting to have this level of transparency into how people are enjoying the video game, you hope and you dream they're going to like this part or react in this way to that part.</p><p dir="ltr">Now we get to see it and see where we're right and where we're wrong, and it affects how you choose to work on the next game. But overall, it's a really incredible change in how video game creation works because before, you made a thing that you threw over a fence and you hoped people liked it, unlike a movie, where you could go into a movie theater and sit amongst people watching it and see if they laughed or didn't laugh. It is new now. We get to see how people really enjoy it or how they react.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>With that in mind, has the process of coming up with or creating a sequel changed at all? Because I imagine so soon after you go, "Oh, we've done Tsushima, let's go to the next one now," you presumably have to sit there and start poking holes in the game that you just made and love to figure out where you can go next. Is that made any easier by being able to flip on a YouTube channel and have people just break down everything that they don't like? Or what's that process like for you both?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Fox: </strong>[Laugs] Sorry. I started laughing because you're like, "Oh, you have to go through the process of pointing out the things you don't like" but at Sucker Punch, we are relentlessly critical of our work.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Connell: </strong>Every week.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Fox: </strong>That is our love language. We just do criticism in a constructive way. We definitely are hard on ourselves, but it's because we want [our games] to be really great and we have a lot of passion to manifest this thing. So, when we get done with Ghost of Tsushima, we kind of know, "Oh, here are the parts we think are lovely. Here are the parts that we don't like as much. How can we invest more in the parts that seem very alive?" But it's such a long process of making the game. Of course, you're looking at online articles, photo mode posts, or YouTube, and it changes some of the ways that you consider the game because you can see [those things].</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Connell: </strong>For sure. I know that, for Nate and me, all those things are true. And then before we even really started on the next thing, we sort of [said], "Here are the core pillars." Because when we're making Ghosts of Tsushima, it's just coming out of us and we're changing stuff daily. Now it's like, "Oh, we have this whole thing we built, now we want to turn it into a franchise, so what are the things you have to carry forward?" So, we created a whole pillar sheet: lethal precision and combat; samurai cinema film-inspired, stunning art direction and beautiful depiction of the world; not just photorealism but a style that kind of matches; surrounding ourselves with advisers. Whatever those pillars were, and there's a whole host of them, we're like, "Okay, these can't change. We have to do all of these. Now where's our sandbox? Where are we going to play? What do we want to push on?" And that was a kind of fun experiment.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>How do you strike a balance between making progress in design and ideas without compromising those pillars, knowing that a lot of people might come to it looking for something drastically different? </strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Connell</strong>: This sounds stupid, but it actually really helps and it really works: we actually use this term, "Fresh but familiar." There's versions of this game which could have been hyper familiar and there's obviously versions of the game that could be hyper fresh and you lose the identity of Ghost. But again, part of that is, what are you going to carry over? And for example, the art style, we could have taken a route where we're like, "Let's go for photorealism on the next one." But the art style is part of the identity to Ghost, so why would we move away from that? In my opinion, and I think our team's opinion, it is a longer-lasting, impressionable feeling to have a style that resonates with people, that resonates with the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Now, some people might be like, "Oh, it kind of looks like the last one." I'm like, "Yeah, we love the art style of the last one. I think it's integral." And so what we said is, "Okay, now how do we expand upon that?" We have way longer sight lines. There's better visual rendering quality all over the place. Performance is better. There are all kinds of things that we improve and we could talk about that forever.</p><p dir="ltr">But the point is, that is familiar, but adding a little bit of freshness on it. And some things [are] purely fresh, like our memory mechanic [where you can relive Atsu's younger days] that we have that's inside the home. So, that's purely a narrative tool that you can do at any point in time. That is totally just a completely fresh thing. There's nothing like that in any of our previous games. And to be able to just bop back and forth instantaneously; totally new. Or sure, there's a relationship with animals in our games, like foxes and birds in the last one, and the sense of nature, wind, whatever. And this one, you have a wolf. The wolf is a much deeper experience than anything we've ever done before. So, it's a nice mix. It's the familiarity part of it, because wolf, animals, etc., but [it's going] way deeper that makes it a bit more fresh.</p><p dir="ltr">For us, Yotei is obviously an opportunity to stand on the familiar because we have a lot of fans that love that, but really think hard about the core aspects of the game we wanted to bring the freshness to. Exploration is a big one. Combat. I'm sure Nate will want to talk about combat. Those two are probably the biggest areas where we spent some time on.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Fox: </strong>I do want to talk about combat. I think it's a great example of that fresh but familiar strategy that Jason was talking about. In Tsushima, we had this feeling of lethal precision that was born of classic samurai movies, and we loved it. So, we wanted to not change [that], but of course, we want to bring something fresh. A great example of this is, in Tsushima, we had four stances you could use, and for Yotei, we increased that. Now, you have five stances, but they're not just stances in how you hold your weapon. We said, "Okay, we're going to change those to actually be different melee weapons," even though, as a system, it's the same thing. It's just a radical visualization difference.</p><p dir="ltr">Oh, but wait, it's not, because if you switch over to, say, a kusarigama, which is the right weapon against an enemy holding a shield, it also has benefits because of the nature of what the weapon is. In that case, if you get surrounded by a bunch of enemies, you can swing the weighted chain above your head and do an area effect attack to hit a lot of enemies at once. Or if you're holding the spear and you're fighting near a cliff, you can use it to knock an enemy backward off the cliff to kill them. So it's a much broader application of tools than we had in Tsushima, but the foundation is the same style of lethal precision that was in that game. We wanted to give players more freedom, more options, but not leave or walk away from the core feeling that was established in that previous game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4534084-ghostofyotei_stateofplay_edgeofjapan_4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4534084" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4534084-ghostofyotei_stateofplay_edgeofjapan_4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4534084"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4534084-ghostofyotei_stateofplay_edgeofjapan_4.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>You mentioned previously the identity of Ghost. For me, one of the key factors in the identity was the character Jin, and the mythology that you built around him--the samurai code being corrupted and becoming something new. Is that a major element of Yotei and its identity? Because it seems like Atsu is a little more formed in her identity and is slowly becoming more deadly over time. Is there that same sense of mythology building around Atsu and the Onryo?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Fox: </strong>So Ghost of Tsushima, as you point out, was absolutely about a samurai who sacrifices his codes to become a stealth fighter, and that was his arc. Ghost of Yotei is a spiritual sequel. It's not the same story at all.</p><p dir="ltr">Atsu starts the game, she's a sellsword. She doesn't live by some code of the samurai. She'll do whatever it takes to win. And she is so relentless in her hunt for the Yotei Six, and she overcomes a lot of odds that should kill [most] people, so the folks around Ezo start to believe that she is a folk tale kind of monster, an Onryo, a vengeance ghost. Early in the game, people believe that about her. She has that identity because of her relentlessness.</p><p dir="ltr">And even though she has that quality that people think of her as larger than life, her transformation in the game isn't necessarily, how does she become more and more the Onryo? It's a question of how her identity as Onryo changes her. We get to see her transform from a broken lone wolf warrior who doesn't really care if she lives or dies to [someone that grows] to surround herself with a wolf pack that helps take care of her, and she changes in that journey. It's a unique story. It's a different take on a different facet of what it is to be a ghost in feudal Japan, and we're happy that people soon get to experience it.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>It sounds like one of those "what does Batman do to Bruce Wayne, as opposed to how does Bruce Wayne become Batman" stories. One of the things that really stuck out to me was the reliving memories stuff that you discussed. It feels like a kind of John Wick "You killed my dog" effect, where it's like you need something to humanize the main character in a game where the primary goal is to inflict brutal violence. What was the approach for that mechanic and the idea behind that, and what are the limitations of it? Is it that you can do it anywhere, or just specific areas?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Connell: </strong>Yeah, there are specific areas in the game that Atsu will visit that are very rich with memories for her, and we wanted to let people experience those memories through an interactive way where you can hit a button, go back and actually play as young Atsu to really experience her life. But that freedom is really important to us because as gamers, as you know, when you're in control, you really feel like you're that character. You identify with them. Being able to go back and forth from memories to the present lets you do a before-and-after shot [showing] the warmth of her youth, juxtaposed with the cold loneliness of her adult life. And because you're in control, I think you feel it more.</p><p dir="ltr">Just as you say, we wanted to establish that feeling of what it used to be so that you could understand Atsu's loss, and I think everybody has had this experience where you maybe go home to your parents' house and you see the bedroom that you grew up in and whether you like it or not, you remember who you were at that time. These memories come back and it's a very human experience. And to make it interactive just helps drive home the universality of it.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>One of the other things that you really emphasize is the freedom and the idea that Ghost is never going to rush you to do anything before you want to do it. How do you approach that freedom when it could disrupt the pacing, if your character is suddenly running around doing something else for 25 hours when you've got this objective that is very timely? And, secondly, how do you account for FOMO? I'm one of those people who is constantly like, "What else am I missing?" It's that two-pathway gamer thing where we're like, "I'm going to go halfway down this one and halfway down this one and see what's up."</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Connell: </strong>We might be tapping into some anxiety for you.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Absolutely. Massively.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Connell: </strong>[Laughs] We really want to reward different play styles. If there are people who just want to rabbit run the golden path--<em>we</em> don't think that's the best way to play the game, but it's a good story if you want to do that--go ahead, you can do that, and we don't want to obscure that from people. We don't want to make it hard for people who buy our game and that's what they want to do because they are invested in your story and they like it. We don't want to force them to go out to do a bunch of stuff they don't like to do in the open world and say, "You got to do these six things before you can go do their golden path." That doesn't seem like a great experience.</p><p dir="ltr">But at the same time, we also don't want to shove that in your face and put all the progression there and all the cool stuff that you can get on the golden path. We want to celebrate the people that like to play wide, and there's a lot of them. People like to play the game for 70, 80, 90 hours and use photo mode at every corner of the map, uncover the beauty, and find the little things, the medium things, the big things. That's why we create things like weapon sensei. To get weapons in the game, you have to hunt down the weapon sensei, you've got to find them in the world, build relationships with them, and then engage with them in sub-missions, and you'll get to get these new weapons and they'll train you how to use these cool new things.</p><p dir="ltr">That's one of the reasons why we put that stuff on the side path and out in the open world--such a huge part of the play experience. If you want to spend all your time in the open world, you should be able to do that. We're not going to force you to go over here and do this thing. It's really a simple philosophy that does manifest into some actual game mechanics in the way that we present the game. But really and truly, it's just trying to express to people that you can play it the way you want to play it. The best way to play it is, pull out the spyglass and explore around. We really do believe that, but at the same time, if you really are interested in that golden path story, we're going to make it easy for you to engage in it because there is a lot of emotion and a lot of heart and a lot of structure that does come from that. We don't want to obscure that from people. We're trying to celebrate both.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>It's one of those things that I know is tricky to design for. I'm one of those people who loves the freedom, but I also want the game to be gravitating around me to tell me where to go a little. I think I'm just an annoying person when it comes to open-world gaming.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Connell: </strong>But I think [the] clue cards are that, a little bit. We got rid of this exhaustive journal that's just pages and pages and texts and texts and just what you've done, what you can do, what you're doing right now. It's exhaustive when people spend way more time on the map, visual, and pictorial references.</p><p dir="ltr">Getting these clues, you might get a little bit of a clue because you haven't gotten a weapon in a while or something like that. We might give you a little bit of a clue where a weapon might be and maybe we tell you where it is for this one and maybe we give you a general location. If weapons are your thing, cool, go do it. Or maybe we'll tell you about armor over here. If armor is your thing and that's what you want, great. We try to give you some of these opportunities so you're not completely aimless, and you'll never be aimless if you're on the golden path, but we try to feed you enough cool things to whet your appetite for what you possibly could do in the game.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>One of the things that caught my eye was the segment where you were buying a map from a cartographer and it looked like you were placing the map piece. Can you tell me more about that?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Connell: </strong>We think maps are cool and we actually spent a lot of time figuring out ways we might be able to interact with the map a little bit more when somebody sells you a map or if you discover one. In this time period, cartographers were mapping out these areas, so it's a nice connection point there. But you can purchase these maps that can take you to a variety of things that you'll learn about and you'll want to get some of them, so there's a little mini-game where you have to figure out, based off the map that he gives you, where it goes, and when you figure out where it goes, it rewards you. It's a little bit of a mini-game inside of the map experience.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>I'm a person who plays primarily in stealth and when you were presenting Atsu she very much seems to be engaging head-on in combat. Will stealth players still be able to scratch their itch?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Connell</strong>: You can absolutely sneak up on enemies and assassinate them when they're unaware. I think this is a really important part of the fantasy. Atsu is not burdened down with the sense of how you're supposed to honorably attack enemies. She'll do whatever it takes. We showed in the State of Play how you can use a kusarigama. There are more tools and different behaviors we've developed for Yotei to make that a richer experience, but I like to think that the stealth, even though you can just engage vis-a-vis stealth if you'd like with most enemies, it's about a dance between stealth using ranged attacks and melee combat. The player is not locked into any one of these things. You can move between them when you're up against a group of enemies, and it just offers a lot of freedom of play style to users.</p><p dir="ltr">I'm a ranged player, the rare weirdo who likes to shoot at things with a bow, and the game works for ranged attack folk. Again, I was talking about earlier, where offering the player a lot of options means that they get to play and approach the game in the way that best suits them. It's more than just combat or stealth. It's also whether or not you like to go after the main story or do a lot of exploration. That is a big component of how we want to make the game be what it is to you, so that it meets you where and how you want to play.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Working with two consoles now, PS5 and PS5 Pro, is there anything distinguishing between them? Are there any advantages to one over the other? What was it like to work with that extra horsepower?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Connell: </strong>The broader answer to your question is that we're going to actually do a bit more of a deeper dive on all the specifics of the Pro features and have all those details ready. Unfortunately, we don't have those here today.</p><p dir="ltr">I will say I can speak less specifically about that and more general about PlayStation and making the game. There are a whole host of things that, and some of it on the Pro too, that has really helped us visualize the world in a new way, and advance that artistic, beautiful style in an appropriate way that still celebrates that. It doesn't just go into photorealism, but it really props up our creative and artistic goals.</p><p dir="ltr">For example, way longer sightlines than we had in the last game. We've been able to vastly improve our far terrain rendering and I think people that see Tsushima and compare it will be like, "Whoa," because it's crazy. I was a bit shocked when those features came in. Or things like native 4K rendering or improved hair and skin. Snow deformation--we didn't have that in the last game. If you have a fight in the snow, your weapons make slices in the snow, your feet trample all over the place. The characters get all snowy, there's blood going everywhere. It's a messy, cool experience because of the deformation. We even extended the deformation into things like chunky mud, so if you're in really thick and deep mud. These are just things we didn't have before and that we do have in this game. We're really excited about that, but specifically for the Pro and the difference between the base and the Pro, we'll have a nice breakdown in the future regarding that.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4534078-ghostofyotei_stateofplay_edgeofjapan_5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4534078" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4534078-ghostofyotei_stateofplay_edgeofjapan_5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4534078"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4534078-ghostofyotei_stateofplay_edgeofjapan_5.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>What was it like getting Shinichiro Watanabe for the game? It must've been a wild journey to get him involved.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Connell</strong>: Each one of [the directors] have their own unique journey to try to bring forward the idea with them, and each one has their own way to approach it. Shinichiro Watanabe was also doing Lazarus at the time, and I think they were just launching it. It was in its first episode. It was a really exciting time, and I watched it and I was like, "Oh, man, I love this. This is good." It really just reminded me how much I loved Samurai Champloo, Cowboy Bebop.</p><p dir="ltr">See, these Samurai video games, it doesn't matter what they are. People do playthroughs of them and they throw lo-fi beats over the top of it, just for their stream or whatever. I'm like, "Man, we should do a mode where we celebrate that genesis point, really." Even though it's anime, it's not classical Samurai cinema, but there's a huge overlap with our fans like yourself or anyone, myself, that really is attracted to that and recognizes that. I was like, "We should celebrate that."</p><p dir="ltr">We reached out, had a meeting with them. They were super psyched on the idea, really excited.</p><p dir="ltr">Really, almost immediately [Watanabe-san] went into like, "Oh, I'm going to get these artists. I think these people might be really great fits." And within a very short amount of time, we were already getting music. We have several original tracks he's created. We've got some remixes of our actual score. It was a really positive and very exciting journey for us, and really, really, really honored that he was willing to and was excited about it. Our fans get to hear that when it comes out.</p>

Still, it is fun to walk into a room and shoot 20 random thugs with a big pistol. So that’s something. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/best-robocop-game-rogue-city-sequel-expansion-2025-pc-1851768472&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/best-robocop-game-rogue-city-sequel-expansion-2025-pc-1851768472"><em>Unfinished Business</em></a></span><em> </em>opens in a really depressing way. Set after the events of the last game, it kicks off with an attack on the police station—which served as one of your central hubs in <em>Rogue City—</em>that leaves many of the NPCs from that game dead. A few of the main characters from the movies, like Officer Lewis, survive, point RoboCop in the direction of a big tower filled with mercenaries who were likely responsible, and then don’t show up again for hours and hours. It’s like<em> Unfinished Business</em> wants to remind players of the more varied world and characters of the last game before it dumps you into the boring corridors of OmniTower. </p><p>Once in OmniTower, <em>Unfinished Business</em> tasks you with reaching the upper levels of the massive structure. But between RoboCop and his goal are hundreds of bots and mercs ready to kill the shiny hero. While<em> Rogue City</em> featured plenty of first-person combat,<em> Unfinished Business</em> features loads more. This is  mostly an action game, whereas the last one could be charitably described as a low-budget spin on a Bethesda game.</p><p>Thankfully, gunning down creeps and saving hostages is still a blast in <em>Unfinished Business</em>. And a few new weapons, along with the ability to use the environment to take down baddies—like shoving someone down a garbage chute—help spice things up. But I really hope you liked the shooty-shooty bits from <em>Rogue City</em> because <em>Unfinished Business</em> is mostly that. </p><p>In <em>Rogue City</em>, I fell in love with a little slice of Old Detroit as I patrolled it, completed side missions, met various characters, and helped protect them. That’s all gone in <em>Unfinished Business</em>. There are still side quests and characters to meet, but most of them are left behind between levels as you keep moving up. Instead of a small slice of urban decay that you can grow to love, <em>Unfinished Business</em> gives you oh so many grey corridors and rooms. Thanks? </p><p>All the RPG systems from<em> Rogue City</em> are back in <em>Unfinished Business,</em> which does help add more to this game and keep it from being just a straight-up linear shooter, but compared to what came before, it’s disappointing. A few moments where you get to play as a pre-RoboCop Alex Murphy are neat, but don’t add much to the experience. </p><p>Hopefully, the devs behind <em>Unfinished Business</em> and <em>Rogue City </em>have a proper sequel in the works that brings back the open-world RPG formula that made that last game so charming and memorable. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/robocop-rogue-city-unfinished-business-expansion-review-1851786534]]></content:encoded>
