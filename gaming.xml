            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The tabletop community has lost another prolific creative voice. Australian designer Steve Dee, who was a pillar of the community thanks to his outspoken social advocacy, has passed away.</p><h2>The Passing of Steve Dee</h2><p>According to a social media post <a href="https://www.facebook.com/622121166/posts/10162318714106167" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">on Facebook</a>, the body of Steve Dee was found by his romantic partner, Hilary Kincaid, on Friday January, 2nd. The post states the cause of death was not determined, but he did not suffer. At the time of writing, an official cause of death has not been disclosed.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Steve Dee, also known as Steve Darlington, had a considerable impact on the tabletop industry. His work credits include officially licensed work like <em>Doctor Who Adventures in Time and Space</em>, <em>Vampire: The Requiem</em>, and multiple editions of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay-4th-edition-review" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</em></a> system.&nbsp;</p><p>Dee also published several board games under his own imprint, Tin Star Games. He has won several Ennies for a few of these published titles, including 2023's card-based heist game <em>The Score</em>, 2021's co-op improvised story game, <em>Partners</em>, the mystery TTRPG <em>Relics</em>, and the 2019 detective game <em>There's Been a Murder</em>.</p><p>But above all, Steve Dee was a vocal member of the community. In an in-depth post by <a href="https://www.rascal.news/steve-dee-game-designer-tin-star-games-obituary/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Rascal News</a>, many tabletop developers spoke up about Dee's passion for the medium and his active advocacy. Indie Game Developer Network's own James Kerr highlighted one of Dee's blogs on the network discussing the importance of worldbuilding. A blog so successful it became a book, titled <em>Worldbuilding for Game Designers</em>.</p><p>But Dee's biggest platform was on his personal blog, Just Do Something. This blog was an account of Dee educating himself on the atrocities happening in Gaza and discussing the use of genocide as a system of control. The ultimate goal of the blog was to encourage others to speak out and, well, do something, in light of horrible events.&nbsp;</p><p>The last post on the blog was a rough draft for a resource management and accrual game called NAKBA. A game where the goal is prevent genocide before it begins. Dee was designing the game as part of the <a href="https://www.games4palestine.it/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">games4palestine</a> initiative.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

                <p>The increasing demand for AI among tech companies is one of the reasons why the global shortage of memory chips remains an ongoing issue. And while it's expected to adversely affect the production of smartphones, Samsung Electronics co-CEO T M Roh has warned that TVs and home appliances may also be hit by shortages and increased prices.</p><p>"As this situation is unprecedented, no company is immune to its impact," said Roh via <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/samsung-double-mobile-devices-powered-by-googles-gemini-800-mln-units-this-year-2026-01-05/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reuters</a>. According to the report, Roh noted that TVs and home appliances will also feel the pinch from the shortages and he didn't rule out price hikes to compensate for them. Samsung is the biggest manufacturer of TVs in the world, and Roh said it the impact of the RAM shortages will be "inevitable."</p><p>The rise in consumer-electronic prices would also throw a large wrench in Microsoft's ongoing "This Is an Xbox" strategy, as smart TVs, including those made by Samsung, are among the growing list of platforms capable of playing Game Pass titles.</p><p>The lone bright spot from Roh's comments is that he mentioned that Samsung is working with its production partners on strategies to minimize the impact of the memory shortages.</p><p>A recent report suggests that Nvidia may take a different approach to the increasingly high GPU prices <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nvidia-reportedly-combatting-gpu-shortages-by-bringing-back-discontinued-graphics-card/1100-6537185/" data-ref-id="1100-6537185">by resurrecting its previously discontinued GeForce RTX 3060 GPUs</a>. That has yet to be confirmed by Nvidia, which phased out the GeForce RTX 3060 GPUs in favor of the 40 and 50 series GPUs, both of which were more expensive and more advanced.</p><p>As for Samsung, the company touted its plans to use Google's Gemini AI in 800 million units this year, which will continue the need for RAM across its family of products.</p>

            <guid>1402093</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>EA's biggest franchises are undoubtedly its <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-26-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-battlefield-6-black-friday-eu-sales/">EA Sports</a></strong> games, but on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-split-up/"><strong>EA Entertainment</strong></a> side, beyond shooters like <a href="https://wccftech.com/apex-legends-season-27-amped-arrives-next-week/">Apex Legends</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-schedule-i-hollow-knight-silksong-battlefield-6-steam-best-selling-new-games-2025/">Battlefield 6</a>, it's <strong>The Sims</strong> that rules the roost as one of its biggest ongoing live service titles.</p>



<p>Today, EA studio <strong>Maxis,</strong> the team behind The Sims, gave players an update on the life sim franchise and its future <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/future-of-the-sims">in a blog post</a>, with insights into what players can expect in 2026 and beyond. But before it got to that, it began with a couple of paragraphs on how the "values" of the game have not changed.</p>



<p>The blog post doesn't say why it starts with this topic, but the context is clear for fans of The Sims and anyone who has paid attention to EA in the last year. Following the reveal that <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-confirms-agreement-to-be-acquired-by-pif-silver-lake-and-affinity-partners-for-55-billion/">EA is going private and being bought out by a 'Consortium' of investors led by the Saudi Arabia PIF (Public Investment Fund) and Jared Kushner's Silver Lake</a>, many fans of the life-sim game feared it would undergo drastic changes once the deal was finalized.</p>



<p>Changes like the removal of LGBTQIA+ representation, and changes to the game to disallow same-sex couples after The Sims was the first video game to ever feature a gay couple kissing.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-shareholders-officially-approved-55bn-sale-to-saudi-arabia-pif-silver-lake/">While the deal has been approved by EA's shareholders,</a> it hasn't made its way through regulators, and is nowhere near finalized. So to make a statement now about how the studio's values are "<em>unchanged</em>" when the deal isn't done feels slightly muted, but it's there nonetheless. The studio even dug more into what it means by its values not changing <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/the-values-that-shape-the-sims">in a separate blog post to further hammer home its point</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>The Sims has always been more than a game. It’s a canvas for life in all its unpredictable forms…the chaotic moments, the tiny joys, the big dreams, every identity, every version of you. And, thanks to you, The Sims has grown into something bigger than we ever imagined: a living world bursting with creativity, expression, humor, chaos, and heart. Our Sims team's creative control, guided by our values of inclusivity, choice, creativity, community, and play, has not changed. These values inspire the decisions we make each and every day as we plan for today, tomorrow, and the future.&nbsp;The Sims will always be about life, your way.</em>"</p>



<p>Following that introduction, the post goes on to discuss what the team at Maxis is working on, confirming that the studio has multiple projects in the works, and that the team is "<em>building a family of new Sims experiences across PC, console, and mobile</em>."</p>



<p>Maxis also goes on to say that the team is "<em>committed to single-player life simulation experiences</em>," recognizing that the game's foundation has always been those moments players have when building their own worlds within The Sims.</p>



<p>As for Project Rene, the new Sims project that <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sims-next-gen-project-rene-revealed-customization-cross-platform/">was first introduced as a next-generation title</a>, it has now evolved into a "<em>mobile-first life-sim game</em>," and will be a separate experience from The Sims 4. Last year, Maxis and EA <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-shutting-down-the-sims-mobile-next-year/">announced they would be shutting down The Sims Mobile in 2026</a>, and at the time, combined with a report from <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/ea-only-plans-to-make-concentrated-bets-in-mobile-following-a-flurry-of-cancellations/">MobileGamer.Biz</a> regarding the last time EA spoke on The Sims on mobile platforms, Wccftech speculated that The Sims Mobile was being shuttered to make way for a new title. It seems that was indeed the case, though we'll have to wait until more about Project Rene is revealed to know for sure.</p>



<p>Beyond that, the studio is committed to continuing to evolve The Sims 4 after it <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sims-5-not-in-the-works-ea-working-on-separate-multiplayer-project/">confirmed that it would not be making The Sims 5</a>, and diehard fans who want to see what's coming next first will have the chance to test new features through limited market tests via The Sims Labs.</p>



<p>The blog then concluded on a final statement, all to do with the team moving into the future of The Sims with the same driving core that built its past.</p>



<p>"<em>For decades, you’ve made </em><em>The Sims</em> what it is, a world that spans generations and cultures, filled with joy, surprises, emotions, and stories that stick with us long after the save file closes. Now, we’re building the future the same way we built the past, with creativity, bold ideas, curiosity, and you as our partners. <em>The Sims</em> is, and has always been, all about you - <em>uniquely you</em>. And as a result, unmistakably <em>The Sims</em>."</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Sims: Project Rene is Now a ‘Social, Mobile-First Life-Sim Game’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/the-sims-project-rene-now-social-mobile-game/</link>
            <guid>1402078</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Sims fans have spent many a year wondering what the next major release in the series would look like. For the most part, it’s assumed that it’ll just be ‘The Sims 5’, but it’s what that game will look like that has the community deep in discussion. There’s also ‘Project Rene’, which has been thrown around by Maxis and Electronic Arts for some time.</p>



<p>At least one of those things has a more solid identity now, and it’s all thanks to those very same fans. In a new blog post, the team at Maxis revealed that Project Rene has ‘evolved’ into a ‘social, collaborative, mobile-first life-sim game.’</p>



<p>It’s not the next big Sims title, but what <strong>is it</strong>?</p>







<h2 id="h-project-rene-is-not-the-sims-5">Project Rene is NOT The Sims 5</h2>



<p>In a recent blog post, Maxis and Electronic Arts took a deep dive into all things The Sims. The post started with a reaffirmation that things aren’t set to run cold with The Sims 4, which will continue to receive updates and new content going forward.</p>



<p>It was believed that the game’s new expansion pack, Royalty &amp; Legacy, would be <strong>the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sims-4-royalty-and-legacy-final-expansion-pack/">final Sims 4 expansion</a></strong>. It seems that might not be the case, based on the new blog post.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/future-of-the-sims" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> in question details everything you’d want to immediately know about Project Rene, including how the project has pivoted to focus on mobile-based multiplayer mechanics:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Thanks to ongoing player feedback, Project Rene has evolved to focus on social multiplayer play, offering a more direct way for friends to share creativity together. </p>



<p>It is not the successor to&nbsp;<em>The Sims 4</em>&nbsp;and is a separate experience from any future deep, single player life simulation experience.&nbsp; It introduces a new way to explore and play together within the growing Sims family of games, welcoming Simmers who want to connect directly with other players.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team is adamant that the core of the Sims franchise is rooted – and <strong>forever will be</strong> – in <strong>single-player experiences</strong>. That has been the bread and butter of The Sims since the first game debuted almost 26 years ago.</p>



<p>And again, those updates won’t stop flowing right into The Sims 4:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>At its core,&nbsp;<em>The Sims</em>&nbsp;was built on a deep, single-player life simulation, chock full of rich systems, meaningful storytelling, and player agency that puts you in control. That foundation isn’t going anywhere. We’ll continue to deliver content and updates to&nbsp;<em>The Sims 4</em>&nbsp;and we are committed to improving the experience.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>There’s still no indication of when the next numbered Sims title might surface, but as the live-service, free-to-play model of The Sims 4 is doing so well, it might be a <strong>long time </strong>before it does.</p>

			<p>The award-winning cRPG <strong>Baldur's Gate 3</strong> couldn't possibly run on the original <strong>Nintendo Switch</strong>, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/modded-nintendo-switch-baldurs-gate-3-run-crysis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">evidenced by a test made with a modded console</a> that featured twice the amount of RAM (<strong>8GB</strong> instead of <strong>4GB</strong>), with the game still bringing this 'Switch on steroids' on its knees.</p>



<p>However, the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> is a completely different beast. In some regards, it is even superior to the Xbox Series S, as Studio Wildcard's Lead Programmer <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-port-asa-only-doable-ue-5-7-says-ark-dev-studio-trying-to-get-fg-running/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just told me in an interview</a>, and the Xbox Series S does run the game, albeit not very well. <span>Additionally, there have been successful Switch ports of computationally intensive games, such as Cyberpunk 2077, Hogwarts Legacy, and&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-nintendo-switch-2-runs-30-fps-nvidia-dlss-baked-gi/" target="_blank">Assassin's Creed: Valhalla</a>, to name a few, and the&nbsp;<strong>Steam Deck</strong>&nbsp;native version of BG3&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-steam-deck-native-performance-act-3/" target="_blank">has also made great strides</a></span>. Furthermore, last year, insider Nate the Hate had shared that he heard Baldur's Gate 3 might indeed be coming to the new Nintendo console. </p>



<p>All in all, there was good reason to believe this version would arrive at some point. However, during today's Reddit AMA, <strong>Larian CEO Swen Vincke</strong> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nylkog6/?context=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commented on the topic</a> with a negative response:</p>



<p><em>We would have loved to, but it wasn't our decision to make.</em></p>



<p>That sounded like Vincke hinting it might be due to issues with IP holder <strong>Wizards of the Coast</strong>. Larian famously <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-no-sequel-dlc-larian-dropping-dungeons-and-dragons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decided to pivot away from Baldur's Gate 3 DLC and a sequel</a> to make something else (which we recently learned <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-announces-divinity-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is a new <strong>Divinity</strong> game</a>), and fans have long suspected that there was a fracture between the two companies, although Larian <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-ceo-clarifies-wizards-of-the-coast-was-a-a-great-licensor-and-had-nothing-to-do-with-bg4-not-happening/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publicly said</a> their decision had nothing to do with the company. </p>



<p>In the ResetEra thread that picked up Vincke's Reddit comment, Nate the Hate quickly <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/swen-vincke-no-baldurs-gate-3-for-switch-2-wasnt-our-decision-to-make.1401871/post-149859475" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replied</a>:</p>



<p><em>From what I was told last year… It's a complicated situation and involved their relationship with WotC.</em></p>



<p>At this point, the question is whether Wizards of the Coast might be looking for someone else to port their massively successful game. Last month, it was announced that Baldur's Gate 3 had surpassed <strong>20 million copies sold</strong>, a nearly unthinkable figure for a cRPG before Larian's game. It's hard to imagine it wouldn't sell at least a few more million units on the rapidly growing Switch 2 installed base.</p>



<p>We've reached out to Wizards of the Coast, asking for a comment, and will update this story if and when we receive it. Nintendo Switch 2 users who may be into Larian games can, however, <a href="https://wccftech.com/divinity-original-sin-2-definitive-edition-has-launched-ps5-switch-2-xbox-series-s-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">play Divinity: Original Sin 2 Definitive Edition</a> in the meantime, and the studio's Technical Director just <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nylf8qz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said in the Reddit AMA</a> that <strong>they will consider a port of the future Divinity game</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’ve been waiting for the chance to play Baldur’s Gate 3 on the go on your Nintendo Switch 2 console, you’re going to want to sit down for this. It’s not happening.</p>



<p>Taking part in an AMA (Ask Me Anything) on Reddit on Friday, Larian Studios’ Swen Vincke was asked about the game possibly being ported to Nintendo’s latest system. His answer, immediately shut the door on it. </p>







<p><strong>“We would have loved to, but it wasn’t our decision to make,”</strong> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nylkog6/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Vincke wrote</a>. </p>



<h2 id="h-why-won-t-it-come-to-switch-2">Why Won’t It Come To Switch 2?</h2>



<p>As a follow up to Vincke’s confirmation, known leaker NateTheHate, who had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-3-could-potentially-come-to-the-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed in the past</a> there was a possibility to bring the game to Nintendo, <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2009691766191165501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">gave a bit more insight</a> into why it’s not coming.</p>



<p><strong>“While Larian would love to bring Baldur’s Gate 3 to the Switch 2… their relationship with Hasbro/Wizards of the Coast is not healthy,”</strong> he said. <strong>“Late last year, I heard [Baldur’s Gate 3] for [Switch 2] was no happening….”</strong></p>







<p>Baldur’s Gate 3 first launched in Early Access in August 2020. The full release of the game came in August 2023 on PC. The game would then come to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S later that year. It would also receive regular <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-major-baldurs-gate-3-update-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">updates until April 2025</a>, when the last major patch was released.</p>



<p>While Baldur’s Gate 3 coming to Switch 2 may not be happening, that doesn’t mean Larian isn’t working on what’s next. The studio is in-development of the next game in the Divinity franchise, which, as part of the same AMA, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/divinity-devs-will-refrain-from-using-genai-tools-for-concept-art/">won’t feature any sort of generative AI</a> artwork.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">And why his story still seems to be lacking.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">In the years since Baldur's Gate 3's release, Larian has put a lot of time and energy into updating the game with tons of new content, including new content for some beloved character who got the short end of the wizard staff the first time around, like Karlach. But one character is still coming up short for fans: Wyll. And at least one writer at Larian is just as frustrated by it as you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nylf1wn/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit AMA today</a> conducted by a number of Larian employees, during which one person asked why Wyll wasn't developed further in post-launch patches, even as other companions got storyline and even personality updates. We've known for a while that the "Blade of Frontiers" warlock Wyll was <a href="https://gamerant.com/baldurs-gate-3-wyll-early-access-story-change-karlach-explained/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rewritten significantly from his early access version to final version</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The question was answered by Larian senior writer Kevin VanOrd, who explained that he also wished Wyll had gotten more attention, and that the lack of content compared to other companions was mostly the result of a series of unfortunate timing coincidences. Here's how VanOrd puts it:</p><blockquote>I wish Wyll had gotten more content and a more fulfilling arc too.</blockquote><blockquote>As you probably know, we weren't connecting with Wyll's Early Access recruitment and initial questing, so we started over at a point when most of the other companion stories were fairly solid. A lot of decisions came later in development than was ideal - and there was a key situation near Baldur's Gate that I intended to heavily involve Wyll in (the Red War College) that got cut. That meant back to the drawing board again. We eventually tied him to Duke Ravengard and started to work on that element of his arc just in time for me to get unexpectedly ill. I was out of the office for quite a while, and again after the epilogue's release.</blockquote><blockquote>I think that Ansur's lair was Swen's idea - we did have the resources for a standalone dungeon, so we got to work on tying Wyll to the Wyrmway, but I couldn't get more than a dungeon boss out of it. Once the situations were in place, that was that - I had to start writing them.</blockquote><blockquote>Wyll's content is sparser than I'd have liked as a result. He's also split into two stories, really - the Mizora story and the Ravengard story, and that might have been a mistake in hindsight. I also wish I could given him a stronger endpoint - it always bugged me that he can end up just as he started, as the Blade of Frontiers, without any meaningful difference. All that said, I love the Blade and I am really proud of him, his sincerity, his good nature, and his eager heroism. I'm truly sorry I didn't give you more quality time with him.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">It's worth pointing out that it's not that Wyll received no updates post-launch. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3s-long-awaited-patch-7-out-now-on-pc-alongside-massive-patch-notes">Patch 7</a> made some light tweaks to Wyll's dialogue that helped those pursuing him romantically have a more interesting time, though it didn't really give him any new story content. But that's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/karlach-is-trending-on-xtwitter-after-baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-because-her-new-evil-ending-is-absolutely-metal">nothing compared to Karlach</a>, who got an entirely new ending in the same patch. Karlach, like Wyll, was considered to be one of the character who had been given the least love in terms of story content in the 1.0 release, and has consistently been a popular favorite. Recently, one fan <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/determined-baldurs-gate-3-fan-calculates-it-has-236-hours-of-recorded-dialogue-and-even-larian-had-no-idea-it-was-that-much">broke down how many minutes of dialogue</a> every character in Baldur's Gate 3 had, and Wyll's down below most of the other companions with just under 9 hours speaking. Still, it's not as bad as Halsin, Minthara, Jaheira, and Minsc, though admittedly those four companions are a little more complex to recruit and you can't even get them until Acts 2 or 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, perhaps cold comfort to Wyll fans, but it's comforting to know that he wasn't intentionally sidelined. We're proud of him too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the same AMA, CEO Swen Vincke addressed concerns about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/everything-we-learned-about-divinity-from-larians-reddit-ama">generative AI use on the studio's next game</a>, Divinity, following a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-ceo-responds-to-divinity-gen-ai-backlash-we-are-neither-releasing-a-game-with-any-ai-components-nor-are-we-looking-at-trimming-down-teams-to-replace-them-with-ai">controversy around some of Vincke's comments</a> from an interview last year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> fans have made progress towards solving the game's newly-discovered spiderweb mystery, and now believe they've reached its final clue. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this week, attention was thrown on a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-discovery-in-red-dead-redemption-2-in-years-rockstar-fans-uncover-spiderweb-mystery-unnoticed-since-release-and-now-the-hunt-is-on-for-answers">major new discovery within Rockstar's epic cowboy sequel, dubbed the biggest uncovering of hidden content in years</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">An intricately-placed breadcrumb trail of spiderwebs was found and plotted, leading to a further set of marked telegraph poles. These then pointed to a collection of guitars within the game's Fort Wallace location, where the trail temporarily went cold. Now, however, fans have pushed forwards — to what seems like a final clue beyond the edge of Red Dead Redemption 2's map, and a sense of what this whole mystery might actually be about. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Once again, progress on the discovery has been brilliantly chronicled by YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COX49Q71y0Y" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strange Man</a>, who picks up the trail back at Fort Wallace by showing that these guitars acted as signposts, guiding players to the roof of the location's tower. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On this roof, two tiny engravings of flying birds were then spotted, pointing in the direction of Giant's Birds, right at the very north of the game's map within Calumet Ravine. Heading here and using binoculars allows you to see a tiny, faint, but unmistakable "?" symbol on a mountain in the distance. The design of the question mark across the far hillside is such that it is only visible from this particular location. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once again, it's a smart set of clues — which is perhaps why this mystery has taken over seven years to be discovered — and once again, progress has stalled. But there's a sense now, with this latest clue way beyond the boundary of the map, that the trail has reached its final stage. As Strange Man suggests, it now seems likely that the mystery's denoument is right here, though the trigger remains elusive. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Let's solve this before GTA 6 arrives!" Strange Man wrote, asking for further ideas from fellow fans. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/09/i-found-the-last-step-of-the-spider-web-mystery-rdr2-00-05-49-1767975280217.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Does this mark the spot? Image credit: Strange Man/Rockstar Games.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While the wait for an answer continues, there is at least a growing sense of what this whole breadcrumb trail might be about. With the hunt for clues leading to Calumet Ravine, it's been noted that this is in the Wapiti reserve, amplifying previous suggestions that earlier steps in the mystery were an obtuse reference to Wapiti tribe member Eagle Flies. (Feathers could be shot out of spiderwebs, with five colored black and three colored red. Eagle Flies appears in five story missions, before three more which chart his capture and eventual death.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Could it all lead nowhere? Possibly, but earlier this week IGN's previous story on the mystery was shared by former Rockstar developer Adam Butterworth, who provided the first official acknowledgement that the game had included this trail of clues. "Absolutely wild people have found this," he <a href="https://x.com/Adam76511able/status/2008220493266981116?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> on social media.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/what-will-win-game-of-the-year-2026</link>
            <guid>1402045</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It may only be January, but I say it’s never too early to look towards the future and try to predict what the best games of 2026 will end up being. I don’t have a crystal ball or some sort of undiagnosed superpower, but I do have a long list of all the games coming out over the next 12 months and a modicum of taste to guide me, though. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 secured a pretty convincing sweep of wins during the end-of-year 2025 awards, but who truthfully saw that coming before its April release date? So, what could surprise us this year? And will a left-field project have what it takes to steal this year’s IGN Best Game award away from the very obvious contender we can see coming from a mile off? Let’s take a look ahead and try to predict what will be the 2026 game of the year, fully aware that whatever’s here has a not-insignificant chance of being proven completely wrong, and you can all come back here in December and tell me what an idiot I am.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Game of 2025</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>GTA 6</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The quite enormous elephant in the room is, obviously, Grand Theft Auto 6. But no GTA game, or, for that matter, no Rockstar game, has ever won IGN’s overall game of the year prize. That includes all of those PS2 classics from Vice City to San Andreas, and more recent creations, such as 2013’s GTA 5, which lost out to The Last of Us, and Red Dead Redemption 2 (my favourite game of all time), which got edged out in 2018 by God of War. Sadly for me, the vote doesn’t all come down to my opinion, so I guess I’ll just have to get over it. One day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, does GTA 6 have a shot at taking home our biggest prize? Obviously, it does. It’s arguably the most anticipated game of all time, a feat achieved by Rockstar’s recent trend of receiving 10 out of 10 review scores, and we expect (or at least hope) the studio builds upon those successes with whatever it releases this November. If Rockstar can avoid implementing a delay yet again, we won’t have to wait too long after that release date to see if the IGN staff (and the voters behind other award ceremonies) determine it as the greatest game of 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Chances: Could Rock, and also take the Star prize.</strong></p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Resident Evil Requiem</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Similarly, Resident Evil is another series that has never won IGN’s game of the year. It did come very close to doing so, though, when the Resident Evil 2 remake narrowly missed out on the 2019 award, coming in as our runner-up to Remedy’s Control. The soonest to release on this list of contenders, Resident Evil Requiem could have a shot at winning this year, though, if it fulfills the promise of its many teaser trailers. Combining the classic third-person action-horror magic of the likes of Resident Evil 4 with the more modern first-person scares from the likes of Village could prove a perfect cocktail to suit everyone’s tastes. We’ll find out just how good it is when it comes out on February 27, but then face a 10-month wait to see if anything rises above it for the rest of 2026. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Chances: Scarier things have happened.</strong></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Control Resonant</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of the 2019 awards, could Control go back-to-back on game of the year wins when its sequel, Control Resonant, arrives this year? You can always bank on something interesting coming from Finnish developer Remedy Entertainment, and it doesn’t look like it's resting on its laurels either, with the follow-up to Jesse Faden’s supernatural-powered action-adventure mixing things up quite a bit by putting us in <em>control</em> of her brother in a wide-open Manhattan. A switch to melee-focused combat certainly has us excited, as does a story that looks deeply rooted in the events of Alan Wake 2, as Remedy continues to build out its connected universe,  but will it be enough to secure another game of the year win?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Chances: Could be just the Remedy needed after FBC: Firebreak.</strong></p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Marvel’s Wolverine</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Insomniac has delivered consistently amazing games, but the studio has never quite secured one of our overall game of the year awards. Both Marvel’s Spider-Man games made the shortlist in their respective years, and Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart also impressed in 2021, but will the angriest of the X-Men have a better chance? Yes, while it doesn’t yet have a release date locked in, Marvel’s Wolverine is the Sony studio’s project for 2026, and it looks highly impressive from the little we’ve seen so far. It’s actually been a whole eight years since a PlayStation exclusive won the IGN game of the year award, so could Wolverine be set to claw back that record?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Chances: We wouldn’t lose sleep if Insomniac came out on top.</strong></p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Saros</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony will have more than one opportunity this year, though, as Saros arrives in April. Housemarque’s follow-up to its critically acclaimed looper shooter, Returnal, hopes are definitely high for this PS5 exclusive. Returnal made our shortlist back in 2021, but ultimately lost out to Xbox, exclusive (at the time, anyway) Forza Horizon 5. If Saros displays the exquisite shooter design skills that Housemarque has honed throughout Super Stardust, Resogun, and many more over the years, as well as a thrilling story and engaging world, then it may well have the juice to claim the number one spot in 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Chances: The House(marque) always wins, but will it here?</strong></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Fable</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It may have won our award back in 2021, but Playground Games certainly won’t be resting on its laurels when it comes to Fable. A reboot of the long-dormant RPG series originally developed by Lionhead Studios, the Forza Horizon developer will be taking on an entirely different type of open world in this fairy tale-infused universe. Could it be the best game of 2026, though? Well, fantasy RPGs have traditionally done very well when it comes to game of the year, with Dragon Age: Inquisition, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Elden Ring, Metaphor: ReFantazio, and, of course, most recently, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 all winning the IGN vote since 2014. That track record bodes well for Playground, and we can’t wait to see its take on Fable at the upcoming Xbox Developer Direct.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Chances: Would be a Fairy Tale ending to Fable’s development.</strong></p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>007 First Light</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s no doubt that IO Interactive knows how to make a fantastic assassin game, but how about spies? Well, we’ll find out in 2026 when the Hitman studio turns its attention to James Bond in 007: First Light. Will this stealth action-adventure blend the best of Agent 47 with spectacle worthy of Uncharted? If it manages to, maybe it will find itself in game of the year consideration.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Chances: 007 to 1 odds.</strong></p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Nintendo</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">A big question mark for 2026 is what games Nintendo has cooking as it approaches the Switch 2’s second year in the wild. Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza set the console off to a good start, but neither quite had what it took to win game of the year. So, what could stand a chance? <strong>Fire Emblem: Fortune’s Wealth</strong> is the upcoming 18th entry into the tactical RPG series, and while we know little about it yet, FE has traditionally set a high quality marker. There’s also Switch 2 exclusive, <strong>The Duskbloods, </strong>and if there’s anything Hidetaka Miyazaki and the team at FromSoftware know about, it’s winning game of the year awards. Let’s see if this upcoming PvPvE action RPG can do something similar.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While it may be fanciful to expect a new mainline Zelda anytime soon, it has been many years (far too many, if you ask me) since a <strong>new 3D Mario game</strong>. Nothing is hinting at one arriving in 2026, but we can dare to dream, because if history is to go by, when that plumber starts jumping, he more often than not enters the game of the year conversation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Chances: A surprise Nintendo hit would Switch things up nicely. </strong></p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Half-Life 3</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Haha, it could happen, couldn’t it? Not that the rumours have ever truly died, but over recent months, whispers have started to get louder and louder about the arrival of a new Half-Life game. A new Steam machine is due out early in 2026, and it would be the perfect launch game, after all. We won’t seriously consider Half-Life 3 a game of the year prospect until we have it in our hands, though, and who knows if that will ever happen. If Valve does decide that the time is now, then it’s certainly a strong contender, as we gave Portal 2 our biggest award back in 2011, as well as Half-Life 2 in 2004.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Chances: Hahahaha</strong></p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Potential Breakout Hits</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As I mentioned at the beginning, it’s not always the games you expect at the start of the year that end up taking home the game of the year prize. So let’s look at a few that are a little more under the radar than those listed above. <strong>Replaced </strong>has received a lot of buzz and is a 2.5D action-platformer from Ukrainian developer Coatsink. Its beautiful pixel art depicting a sci-fi city with a distinctly Blade Runner-like look could surprise a few that aren’t familiar with it when it arrives on March 12. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there’s <strong>Mixtape</strong>, the new coming-of-age retro adventure from Australian studio Beethoven &amp; Dinosaur, who made a few game of the year shortlists back in 2021 with the psychedelic The Artful Escape. Its nostalgia-laced tale, supported by a soundtrack of ‘80s favourites, could hit just right if it all comes together like the trailers suggest it might. And finally, <strong>Mewgenics </strong>is an upcoming roguelike tactical RPG from the creators of Super Meat Boy and The Binding of Isaac that has been in development for many, many years. The buzz is high for it as it finally looks set for a February 10 release. Could the cat get the cream come December time?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Chances: We all love an underdog story. But what about an undercat?</strong></p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Verdict</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">So, who do I think will actually win? Well, it is impossible to ignore the behemoth that is GTA 6, but seeing as I’m still not <em>100% </em>convinced that it’s arriving this year, <strong>I’m going to go with Saros as my pick</strong>. I think that Housemarque’s reputation has only grown over time, and more and more people have gotten around to playing Returnal since its 2021 release, and would love to give the studio its flowers in 2026 if Saros turns out to fulfill its potential.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What do you think will win IGN’s game of the year 2026 award? Will it be a game that hasn’t even been revealed yet?

                <p>Sometimes, I feel like writing the same article four times could be considered a bit of a meme. But then I remember that this is a pretty phenomenal achievement for any streamer, let alone an AI VTuber. First Neuro-sama beat the Twitch Hype Train world record ... then <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-vtuber-neuro-sama-just-obliterated-her-own-massive-twitch-world-record/1100-6537146/" data-ref-id="1100-6537146">it happened again</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-vtuber-neuro-sama-has-only-gone-and-done-it-again-smashing-another-world-record/1100-6537158/" data-ref-id="1100-6537158">And again</a>. This time around, her "sister" Evil Neuro, who has her own distinctive voice, model, and attitude, led the calls to beat the Hype Train record for a fourth time. In the process, she also helped her creator<a href="https://twitch.tv/vedal987" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Vedal987</a> become the third-most-subscribed Twitch channel of all time.</p><p>After becoming the third most-subscribed channel, Vedal joined Evil on stream to ask his community to "Give it a rest." He added, "In all seriousness chat, you have given me and the twins more than we need, so it's okay." Evil wasn't happy with this though, retorting, "No Vedal! Please can we raise the timer, just a little bit? Don't you think it's a bit cruel to just cut it off here?" Evil was referring to the timer that's currently running for Neuro's third birthday subathon, where each subscription gifted to the channel adds time to a countdown clock that determines when the stream will end. It has been running since December 19, 2025, and has around 22 hours left at the time of writing.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeeUq9cNFbU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YeeUq9cNFbU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Regardless, shortly afterwards the Hype Train did come to an end at level 72--although not a fourth world record, it's still a hugely impressive achievement, and leaves Vedal's Twitch channel with more than 328,900 subscribers. It's hard to nail down an exact figure, since that number continues to rise as the community attempts to extend the subathon. What that does mean, however, is that Vedal, Neuro, and Evil have overtaken streamer <a href="https://twitch.tv/jasontheween" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jasontheween</a> and fellow VTuber<a href="http://twitch.tv/ironmouse" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Ironmouse</a>'s positions as the third and fourth <a href="https://twitchtracker.com/subscribers/all-time" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">most-subscribed channels on Twitch</a>. The only two channels that have ever beaten that achievement are<a href="http://twitch.tv/evelone2004" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Evelone2004</a>, with 459,924 subscribers, and<a href="http://twitch.tv/kaicenat" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> KaiCenat</a> with 1,112,947 subscribers.</p><p>If you're unfamiliar with Neuro-sama and Evil, they are twin VTubers that utilize a large language model to communicate with their creator Vedal987's Twitch chat and play games. Neuro was originally created to play the rhythm game OSU, but evolved quickly to become a series of AI systems that work in tandem thanks to the knowledge of programmer Vedal. By taking an input from Twitch and from voice, giving that input to the LLM, and converting it via a text-to-speech system, the twins can interact with their viewers. If you're interested in learning more, I'd really recommend the explainer video by <a href="https://youtu.be/wZ0osmPlSaY" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Creative Every Day</a> on YouTube.</p><p>With under one full day remaining of the subathon, it seems there are not many more Twitch records for the trio to achieve. But with a community as dedicated as theirs, who knows what comes next?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I finished Death Stranding 2 during my holiday break after 66 hours (absolutely loved it, especially that bonkers ending and also, maybe one of my favorite performances from Troy Baker and proof we need him as a villain in more games). Looking ahead to January, I realized I had the rare opportunity to dive into my backlog because the month is so chill for new releases. I whittled my options down to Yakuza 0, Assassin’s Creed Syndicate, and Metroid Prime Remastered… and Samus Aran’s big round shoulders won.</p><p>I’m roughly halfway through it now, and I am enjoying it, but I’m not so sure it works as well for someone who hasn’t played the original. Of course, this game originally launched more than two decades ago and this is not a remake; it’s a remaster. Its visuals hold up well, especially given the remastering work that has upgraded what I’m seeing on screen. I can’t lie, though – the 2002 of it all is making it an annoying experience to interact with. Fortunately, I’m enjoying it more than I am becoming frustrated by it but, man, I would have killed for some quality-of-life updates like auto-save and reworked controls.</p><p>I don’t mind visiting save points to save my progress, but sometimes, the sequences I must endure are extensive and packed with enemies, making it easy to die and lose upwards of 45 minutes of progress (looking at you, Thermal Visor runback). It’s also frustrating switching between visors, weapon types, and more using Remastered’s control scheme. I can’t point to a specific aspect I dislike, but it just doesn’t feel great when I’m pressing buttons, doubly so when playing handheld on Switch 2 with Joy-Cons.</p><p>Anyway, I’m fresh off losing 45 minutes of progress this morning because of that dang Thermal Visor, so I’m feeling more jaded on it than not, but I do think it’s a great game. It’s nice to revisit a classic and experience where a game that has so clearly inspired countless others began; I’m just not so sure it holds up as well as other classics, especially as a first-time player.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/opinion/2026/01/09/the-video-games-you-should-play-this-weekend-january-9]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Elon Musk’s Bot Lies About Locking Deepfake Nudity Factory Behind A Paywall]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-grok-ai-deepfakes-undressed-images-2000658486</link>
            <guid>1402018</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A week ago, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/02/elon-musk-grok-ai-children-photos"><em>Guardian</em>&nbsp;story</a> revealed the news that Elon Musk’s Grok AI was knowingly and willingly producing images of real-world people in various states of undress, and even more disturbingly, images of near-nude minors, in response to user requests. Further reporting from <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/grok-is-generating-sexual-content-far-more-graphic-than-whats-on-x/"><em>Wired</em></a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-07/musk-s-grok-ai-generated-thousands-of-undressed-images-per-hour-on-x"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> demonstrated the situation was on a scale larger than most could imagine, with “thousands” of such images produced an hour. Despite silence or denials from within X, this led to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5y5w0k99r1o">“urgent contact”</a> from various international regulators, and today X has responded by creating the impression that access to Grok’s image generation tools is now for X subscribers only. Another way of phrasing this could be: you now have to pay to use xAI’s tools to make nudes. Except, extraordinarily—despite Grok saying otherwise—it’s not true.</p> <p>The story of the last week has in fact been in two parts. The first is Grok’s readiness to create undressed images of real-world people and publish them to X, as well as create far more graphic and sexual videos on the Grok website and app, willingly offering deepfakes of celebrities and members of the public with few restrictions. The second is that Grok has been found to do the same with images of children. Musk and X’s responses so far have been to seemingly celebrate the former, but condemn the latter, while appearing not to do anything about either. It has taken until today, a week since world leaders and international regulatory bodies have been demanding responses from X and xAI, for there to be the appearance of any action at all, and it looks as if even this isn’t what it seems.</p> <h2>How we got here</h2> <p>The January 2 story from <i>The Guardian</i> reported that the Grok chatbot <a href="https://x.com/grok/status/2006618883055046758">posted</a> that lapses in safeguards had led to the generation of “images depicting minors in minimal clothing” in a reply to an X user. The user, on January 1, had responded to <a href="https://x.com/AnOpenSecret/status/2006491540848341408?s=20">a claim</a> made by an account for the documentary <em>An Open Secret</em> stating that Grok was being used to “depict minors on this platform in an extremely inappropriate, sexual fashion.” The allegation was that a user could post a picture of a fully dressed child and then ask Grok to re-render the image but wearing underwear or lingerie, and in sexual poses. The user asked Grok if it was true, and Grok responded that it was. “I’ve reviewed recent interactions,” the bot replied. “There are isolated cases where users prompted for and received AI images depicting minors in minimal clothing.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I've reviewed recent interactions. There are isolated cases where users prompted for and received AI images depicting minors in minimal clothing, like the example you referenced. xAI has safeguards, but improvements are ongoing to block such requests entirely. (214 chars)</p> <p>— Grok (@grok) <a href="https://twitter.com/grok/status/2006618883055046758?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 1, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>By January 7,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/grok-is-generating-sexual-content-far-more-graphic-than-whats-on-x/"><em>Wired</em> published an investigation</a> that revealed Grok was willing to make images of a far more sexual nature when the results weren’t appearing on X. Using Grok’s website and app,&nbsp;<em>Wired</em> discovered it was possible to create “extremely graphic, sometimes violent, sexual imagery of adults that is vastly more explicit than images created by Grok on X.” The site added, “It may also have been used to create sexualized videos of apparent minors.” The generative-AI was willing and able to create videos of recognizable celebrities “engaging in sexual activities,” including a video of the late Diana, Princess of Wales, “having sex with two men on a bed.”</p> <p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-07/musk-s-grok-ai-generated-thousands-of-undressed-images-per-hour-on-x"><em>Bloomberg</em>‘s reporting</a> spoke to experts who talked about how Grok and xAI’s approach to image and video generation is materially different from that being done by other big names in generative-AI, stating that rivals offer a “good-faith effort to mitigate the creation of this content in the first place” and adding, “Obviously xAI is different. It’s more of a free-for-all.” Another expert said that the scale of deepfakes on X is “unprecedented,” noting, “We’ve never had a technology that’s made it so easy to generate new images.”</p> <h2>Where we are now</h2> <p>It is now being <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/09/grok-image-generator-outcry-sexualised-ai-imagery">widely reported</a> that access to Grok’s image and video generation has been restricted to only paying subscribers to X. This is largely because when someone without a subscription asks Grok to make an image, it is responding with “Image generation and editing are currently limited to paying subscribers,” then adding a link so people can pay up for access.</p> <p>However, as discovered by the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/859309/grok-undressing-limit-access-gaslighting"><em>The Verge</em></a>, this isn’t actually true at all. While you cannot currently simply @ Grok to ask it to make an image, absolutely everyone can still click on the “Edit image” button and access the software that way. You can also just visit Grok’s site or app and use it that way.</p> <p>This means that the technology is currently lying to users to suggest they need to subscribe to X’s various paid tiers if they wish to generate images of any nature, but still offering the option anyway if the user has the wherewithal to either click a button, or if they’re on the app version of X, to long-press an image and use the pop-up.</p> <h2>What does Elon Musk have to say?</h2> <p>Musk, as you might imagine, has truly been posting through it. Moments before the story of the images of minors broke, following days of people discovering Grok’s willingness to render anyone in a bikini, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2006868990287810750">Musk was laughing</a> at images of himself depicted in a two-piece, before a rapid reverse-ferret on January 3 as he <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2007475612949102943">made great show of declaring</a> that anyone discovered using Grok for images of children would face consequences, in between endlessly claiming that his Nazi salute was the same as Mamdani doing a gentle wave to crowds. Since then (alongside <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2009546483054592185">posting</a> full-on white supremacist content), the X owner’s stance has switched to <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk">reposting</a> other people’s use of ChatGPT to demonstrate that it, too, will render adults in bikinis, seemingly forgetting that the core issue was Grok’s willingness to depict children, and declaring that this proves the hypocrisy of the press and world leaders.</p> <p>Regarding today’s developments, he has not uttered a peep. Instead his feed is primarily deeply upsetting lies about the murder of Renee Nicole Good and uncontrolled rage at the suggestion from Britain’s Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c99kn52nx9do">that X might be banned in the UK</a> as a consequence of the issues discussed above.</p>

However, some Sims fans and creators have been concerned about how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/majority-control-of-ea-could-shift-to-saudi-arabias-public-investment-fund-report/1100-6536660/" data-ref-id="1100-6536660">Saudi Arabi's potential control</a> over the company will affect the inclusive nature of the experience. To alleviate those concerns, the developers behind The Sims franchise wants players to know their core values haven't been changed by this deal.</p><p>"The values of The Sims are unchanged," reads the statement on <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/future-of-the-sims" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the franchise's official page</a>. "Our Sims team's creative control, guided by our values of inclusivity, choice, creativity, community, and play, has not changed. These values inspire the decisions we make each and every day as we plan for today, tomorrow, and the future."</p><p>Given Saudi Arabi's history of human rights abuses, the worried reactions from The Sims community appear to be understandable. Senators Richard Blumenthal and Elizabeth Warren have both raised their <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/eas-saudi-deal-draws-scrutiny-from-us-senators-over-foreign-influence/1100-6535453/" data-ref-id="1100-6535453">concerns about "foreign influence" on EA</a> if the deal goes through.

Playtesting for those experiences is expected to begin this year. The team also stated that, "Project Rene has evolved into a social, collaborative, mobile-first life-sim game," and it's not intended to be a successor to The Sims 4. Instead, it's described as "a new way to explore and play together within the growing Sims family of games, welcoming Simmers who want to connect directly with other players."</p><p>Last year, EA said that it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-says-its-sold-too-much-sims-4-dlc-to-make-the-sims-5/1100-6533647/" data-ref-id="1100-6533647">sold too much DLC for The Sims 4</a> to even consider moving on to The Sims 5.

            <guid>1401979</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="4dae6d8a5f80d"><a title="Baldur's Gate 3 Shadowheart" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4dae6d8a5f80d/baldurs-gate-3-shadowheart.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Larian Studios</em></figcaption></figure><p>Of all the dream Nintendo Switch 2 ports, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/baldurs_gate_3">Baldur's Gate 3</a> is probably extremely high on many people's lists. It certainly is on ours too! But that pipe dream may have to stay as just that — a pipe dream.</p>
<p>Larian Studios, the developer behind the GOTY winning RPG from 2023, held a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/larian_studios_divinity_ama/?sort=qa">Reddit AMA</a> earlier today mainly focusing on its upcoming <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/divinity">Divinity</a> title, which was revealed at The Game Awards 2025. And, as you'd expect, one fan asked about the potential of a Switch 2 port of the latest Baldur's Gate game.</p><div><figure data-videoid="nq-wlNfCGDw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nq-wlNfCGDw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytnq-wlNfCGDw" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nq-wlNfCGDw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nq-wlNfCGDw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed7bb9d0jikwmn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>When asked if a port is even possible, Larian CEO <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nylkog6/">Swin Vincke's response</a> was disappointing and a little vague: "We would have loved to but it wasn't our decision to make."</p>
<p>So, were their plans to make this happen, and if so, who could have got in the way? Would Nintendo refuse the game? Unlikely, we think. The only possible answer we can think of is Dungeons &amp; Dragons publishers and IP owners Hasbro and Wizards of the Coast.</p>
<p>It seems like a strange decision either way — Baldur's Gate 3 is primed for success on the new console. And, of course, this response might mean nothing.</p>
<p>We're still going to hope <em>something</em> changes, but even known leaker <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2009691766191165501">NateTheHate</a> has claimed that "[Larian's] relationship with Hasbro/Wizards of the Coast is not healthy."</p>
<p>In more positive news, regarding that new Divinity game, Larian is potentially considering a Switch 2 version of that title. Another user asked about this while praising the recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/divinity-original-sin-2-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Divinity: Original Sin 2</a> Switch 2 upgrade, which came out in December 2025.</p>
<figure data-uuid="bdd1acc0308f4"><a title="Divinity Announcement trailer screenshot" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bdd1acc0308f4/divinity-announcement-trailer-screenshot.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Larian Studios</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nylf8qz/?context=3">Technical director Bert replied</a>: "We love the platform and we will certainly consider Switch 2 for the next Divinity game." So it sounds like the Switch 2 is firmly on the mind for the team at Larian.</p>
<p>We can only hope at this stage that one, or both games, make it to the system. But Divinity is likely a while away, while Baldur's Gate 3... well, anything could happen there.</p>
<p>Larian announced this AMA back in December following the reveal of Divinity and an interview with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level">Bloomberg</a>, where Vincke revealed the team were using generative AI for generating ideas, concept art, PowerPoint presentations, and more.</p>
<p>In this AMA, Vincke seems to have changed his stance on AI use, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nyl9tdz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">stating</a> "there is not going to be any GenAI art in Divinity." That's good news.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/the-division-3-in-production-will-have-as-big-an-impact-as-division-1-ubisoft-massive/</link>
            <guid>1401976</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-3-announced-star-wars-outlaws-director-julian-gerighty/">It's been over two years since <strong>Ubisoft Massive</strong> confirmed</a> that it would be making <strong>The Division 3</strong>, and that series creator<strong> Julian Gerighty</strong> would be at the forefront of the project. Since then, Ubisoft has released <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-2-battle-for-brooklyn-dlc-launches-on-may-27/">major updates and expansions for The Division 2</a>, and at <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom 2025</a>, we even got a major reveal of what the company has planned for the franchise, with a new survival extraction game called The Division 2: Survivors and an upcoming mobile MMO title called The Division Resurgence.</p>



<p>As for The Division 3? Ubisoft did not mention it at the time, but during yesterday's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDt-guVbQMs">New Game Plus Showcase,</a> when Gerighty was showcasing and discussing The Division 2: Survivors, he also answered a question regarding The Division 3.</p>



<p>While he couldn't say much beyond the fact that the game is still coming and a confirmation that it is in production, he does set the expectation bar quite high for what players can look forward to.</p>



<p>"<em>So, The Division 3 is in production, right? This is not a secret; it's been announced. It's shaping up to be a monster</em>. <em>I can't really say anything more than that. But this is, within these walls, in Massive, we are working extremely hard on something that I think will be as big an impact as Division 1 was</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Division 2 Developer Interview | New Game+ Showcase 2026" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GE_C1ueUnss?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Ultimately, Gerighty isn't saying too much, and he quickly moves on to continue talking about Survivors and Resurgence, since those are the two projects that he was technically supposed to be talking about. But as you'll see from the first few comments under the interview, players were more pleased to just have a few new words on The Division 3. </p>



<p>Hopefully, these aren't the last words we hear on the game before 2026 is done. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tom-clancys-the-division-2-loot-capital/">The Division 2</a></strong> will officially be seven years old when we get to March 12, 2026, and while Ubisoft Massive has done a great job in maintaining the third-person shooter and updating it with new content, for two, arguably three of those last seven years, all players have wanted to see is a third mainline entry in the franchise.</p>



<p>We likely won't get it in 2026, but hopefully, we'll know to expect it for 2027.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The boss behind the studio that developed one of 2025’s best RPGs, <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-come-swen-vincke-larian-bruce-straley-ai-warhorse-2000654591">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>,</em> says that online controversies about the game and its predecessor involving representation likely didn’t hurt the game’s sales and only mattered to “a handful” of people who are online 24/7.</p> <p>Some quick history. <a href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-the-kotaku-review-1823606430">In 2017, in the lead-up to the launch of </a><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance,</em> developer Warhorse Studios was criticized by some online for not including people of color in the game. The studio defended this by claiming it was <a href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-come-owes-its-popularity-to-realism-and-conserv-1823420208">historically accurate</a> that in early 15th-century Bohemia, especially in the countryside where the game was set, it was rare to see non-white people. Some scholars agreed, others weren’t sure, and people online yelled about it, with some right-leaning gamers very invested in protecting the studio from the “woke agenda.” Fast forward to 2025, when a lot of the people who had previously defended Warhorse’s dedication to historical accuracy were now mad that the studio was including more people of color. The studio explained that it made sense as the sequel involved a large city that would have brought in more people from around the world. There were also some folks angry about the ability to have a gay relationship.</p>

 <p>So, did any of this controversy affect the game sales? <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/attacks-on-kingdom-come-deliverance-for-gay-romance-representation-only-mattered-to-a-handful-of-terminally-online-culture-warriors-reckons-kcd2s-exec-producer-and-probably-didnt-impact-the-games-reception/">That’s what <em>PC Gamer</em> recently asked</a> Martin Klíma, Warhorse’s co-founder and the executive producer on <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>“I would really, really like to know the answer to this one. You can really convincingly argue both ways,” Klíma told the outlet. “You can convincingly argue that we got some extra visibility—that it doesn’t matter what they say about you, as long as they spell your name right.” At the same time, he said, you could argue that “any controversy is hurtful, and you want to speak about the game, and you don’t want to explain some…tangled reasoning.”</p>

 <p>Klíma further explained that he personally felt that the online controversies surrounding both games “only mattered to, really, a handful of terminally online culture warriors” and believed that they are “an insignificant intersection with the gaming public writ large.”</p>

 <p>“The real players really don’t care about it at all, and probably most of them never really even heard about these pseudo-controversies,” said Klíma.</p> <p>Considering the fact that <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em> has sold over 10 million copies since 2017, and that its sequel has already sold over four million, I think Klíma might be right. It’s a good reminder that most people aren’t online as much as your favorite journalists, content creators, or posters. That’s not to say they don’t care about things like representation, but they aren’t really hearing about most of this stuff, and instead are just buying that game that people said was good or that has a cool cover. Honestly, I’m jealous.</p>

I found <em>The Alters</em>' core gameplay stressful and just a little dull, which is a shame because the story is superb.

<p>It would be churlish not to acknowledge one of the biggest and most generous Metroidvania platformers ever created on this list, even if I do have some issues with wonky storytelling and some questionable difficulty choices.</p><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e6454f0b-6800-4e17-96eb-7c686c1e2c90" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></a><em> </em>is, to put it simply, the platformer that keeps on giving. Like its predecessor, it keeps going when you think it surely must have run out of ideas, and then it tacks on entire extra areas and bosses after that as well.</p><p><em>Silksong </em>also represents a level up for Team Cherry's already drum skin-tight combat design; Hornet is an acrobatic protagonist, and she's an absolute thrill to control as she bounces and weaves her way through Pharloom's many and varied denizens.</p><p>Much like <em>Hades II</em>, however, things come apart for me in the story stakes. <em>Silksong</em>'s narrative is unfocused and sprawling, and it never quite coalesces around an identifiable goal, nor does it succeed in making Hornet feel like a genuine character for me.</p><p>I'm also not sure <em>Silksong </em>needed to be quite so frustrating. Some of its boss runs are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/death-to-death-runs" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bc88c70a-a511-49c5-9fc0-4b3f70907424" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">a little patience-testing</a>, and while its encounters feel perfectly tuned to me, one or two of its nastier surprises feel unfair rather than punishing.</p><p>With all that said, <em>Silksong </em>is a superb sequel to <em>Hollow Knight</em>, and I look forward to knitting my broken fingers back together to play its upcoming free expansion.</p><h2>3. <em>The Roottrees Are Dead</em></h2><figure role="group">

<p>Representing an extremely strong start to the year, <em>The Roottrees Are Dead </em>is exactly what I think deductive puzzle games should be, which is to say it's inspired by <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/return-of-obra-dinn" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cf4c55bd-209b-4472-8975-e018955d838d" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Return of the Obra Dinn</em></a>.</p><p>Tasking you with sorting through a tangled web of genealogy in order to uncover the secrets of a family of candy magnates, <em>The Roottrees Are Dead </em>isn't particularly flashy or sexy, but it is rich with puzzle goodness.</p><p>Discovering the identity of a particularly elusive family member by digging through periodicals and books might not sound like your idea of fun, but it's certainly mine, so I for one am grateful to Evil Trout.</p><p>In an era of AAA games treating players like complete morons (looking at you, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/metroid-prime-4" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c195faed-5d46-484c-bbea-f034fca5544b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a>), <em>The Roottrees Are Dead </em>represents a refreshing and exciting trend towards do-it-yourself puzzle-solving, and I'm very much here for it.</p><p>The art is a little uncanny at times, and it's true that there's no pulse-pounding action or multi-stage boss fight to captivate adrenaline junkies, but <em>The Roottrees Are Dead </em>thrilled me thoroughly, so onto the list it goes.</p><h2>2. <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></h2><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>shows Nintendo's innovative spirit isn't dead.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Yes, yes, alright. I'm a Nintendo shill, I admit it. Still, there were very few games that matched <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>'s sheer joie de vivre and inventive spirit for me this year.</p><p>Okay, so DK's latest adventure can sometimes feel like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-super-mario-odyssey-team" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="95f40f3e-5162-45ed-8871-019d18466db6" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">a reskin (presumably a banana skin) of <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em></a>, and the dynamic between Donkey Kong and his young charge Pauline is odd, to say the least.</p><p>None of that changes the fact that Nintendo is still creating best-in-class platformers, and that <em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>represents a thrilling demonstration of the legendary Japanese company's design chops.</p><p>Even without DK's ability to tunnel through levels, thus skipping entire platforming challenges and causing potentially devastating sequence breaks, <em>Bananza</em>'s many and varied challenges would be the cherry on top of the chef's kiss, as it were.</p><p>Taken with its innovative <em>Minecraft</em>-style digging systems, though, <em>Bananza</em>'s responsive platforming and wealth of diverse levels made it a joy to play through. I'm not collecting every banana, though. That way madness lies.</p><h2>1. <em>Blue Prince</em></h2><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Blue Prince </em>has its flaws, but it's just so gosh-darn interesting.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Dogubomb and Raw Fury released roguelite adventure puzzler <em>Blue Prince </em>in April, and not only was it easily the highlight of that month for me, it was also easily the year's best, with a couple of heavy caveats.</p><p>Let's get this one out of the way first: yes, the RNG is a problem. It's baked into <em>Blue Prince</em>'s design, so I can't think of a way to fix it, but having a puzzle most of the way solved only to repeatedly fail to get the room you need can be aggravating.</p><p>Despite that, though, <em>Blue Prince</em>'s mixture of randomized room-laying and puzzle-solving that stretches across multiple runs absolutely captivated me this year.</p><p>Between this and <em>Roottrees</em>, 2025 really was the year of retrieving an actual pen and notepad with which to make notes (I also thoroughly enjoyed <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes </em>this year, but I'm restricting myself to 2025 releases for this list).</p><p>As well as the wealth of puzzles to solve, <em>Blue Prince </em>also has a story to discover, and it's told out of order, so you'll need to be paying attention if you want to piece together what happened in this cozy but deceptively complex world.</p><p>I won't deny that <em>Blue Prince </em>frustrated me at times, but it's still my game of the year simply for its uniqueness and experimentation. I'd rather play a single <em>Blue Prince </em>than a thousand <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>s (<em>Ghosts of Yotei</em>?).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>While 2025 was a relatively tame year when it came to AAA game releases, there were still plenty of standout titles if you knew where to look. <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> of course was the breakout hit of the year, definitively proving that you don't really need 20 different studios and billions of dollars to deliver a top-tier experience.&nbsp;</p><p>Naturally, the success of one game isn't indicative of an upheaval in the entire industry. However, between the apparent stagnation of old guard studios, the rapid maturation of Chinese gaming studios as a whole, and the proliferation of new software that enables smaller teams to pump out competitive titles, 2026 may be a very interesting year in terms of both individual games and the industry at large.</p><h2><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></h2><picture>

  </picture><p>What else can be said about <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-french-revolution" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Expedition 33</em></a> that hasn't already been said by others? If you're a fan, or have even a passing interest in turn-based RPGs and you have the time to try the game, you should.&nbsp;</p><p>While the idea of implementing action-game mechanics into a turn-based RPG isn't new, <em>Expedition 33</em> does it so flawlessly that it sets a new standard for the genre. Throw in some excellent music and writing with some very creative world design and it's no surprise that it's one of the more undisputed Game of the Year contenders in recent memory.</p><p>On a small side note, I personally quite like the default skins of the playable characters. They all have similar uniforms with a very neat color scheme, but with just enough personalization that you can tell who is who with a mere glance. Given the context of the expeditions, it seems like a logical and practical choice, and it's a small deviation from the norm of every party member having completely different clothing and armor.</p><p>There are two small quibbles I have with <em>Expedition 33</em> though in that it seems like no matter what language you play on, the lip syncing seems to be just a little bit off. The second is that the jumping animation is a little stiff. Yet these are such a relatively minor issues in an otherwise excellent game.</p><h2><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em></h2><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-mech_0.jpg?itok=3FK3KbBh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p>Sequels to first-person shooters tend to be rather hit or miss in my experience and thankfully, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/doom-dark-ages-review" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6c34b81d-7c3a-4488-97a7-1de8454240f4" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em></a> delivers more of the former than the latter. While the changes to <em>Doom's</em> core gameplay formula took a little bit to get used to, the shield and all of its abilities opens up so many more venues for violence that it's hard to see it as anything but an upgrade.</p><p>The shift from a sci-fi setting to a more fantasy-inspired backdrop was a great idea though. There have been a million and one interpretations of what humanity in space might look like, yet there are only so many games that take medieval design and decide to use that as a starting point for a sci-fi society.</p><p>Unfortunately, the new mech and dragon levels kind of just exist. They're a step up from those on-rails segments that were in every FPS decades ago, although in practice they're fundamentally identical. Simply put, if there was any real disappointment to be found in <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>, it's that the on-foot combat is somehow more visceral and more dynamic than flying a dragon with guns or piloting a huge mech.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em></h2><picture>

  </picture><p>After so many years it's nice to see one of original "git gud" game franchises make a return in the modern era, and what a humbling return it is. The gameplay is ridiculously fast paced and the enemies aren't pulling their punches, even on normal difficulty. Miss a dodge and that random generic goon is taking off a big chunk of your health. Oh and there's usually several goons per encounter. The damage goes both ways though, and if you play correctly you can eviscerate bosses in mere minutes.&nbsp;</p><p>Admittedly, some of the difficulty comes from the camera and how it sometimes struggles to track enemies, but for the most part you really do have to just learn how to play. It's less "memorize these attack patterns and parry" and more "combo this guy out of existence before his friends spawn in," which I personally find to be more visually satisfying.&nbsp;</p><p>The injection of cyberpunk elements into the art direction of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/ninja-gaiden-4-review-blackened-rain-beckons" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cd1796d1-2f9f-45e0-9bc3-182e5870632c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em></a> is quite neat too. There are chapters where you have a mix of contemporary, cyberpunk, and traditional/demonic themes playing off of each other and it's usually very well done.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>Where Winds Meet</em></h2><picture>

  </picture><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/where-winds-meet" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="09a36c6b-7807-494f-9194-2047bdcea2c4" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Where Winds Meet</em></a> is one of those rare games that I would recommend solely for the world design and art direction. While countless games draw from European fantasy for their setting, <em>Where Winds Meet</em> stands out because it quite obviously inspired by Chinese fantasy. The broad strokes of both genres are actually quite similar in concept, although the latter typically involves things like using martial arts to throw bears around or flying through the air with special sword moves and such.&nbsp;</p><p>Thankfully, such physics-defying tropes are used sparingly in the main quest and are seemingly there mostly for exploration purposes. <em>Where Winds Meet</em> plays like any other action game with parry and dodge mechanics otherwise.&nbsp;</p><p>Your arsenal is quite unique though. You have access to your standard array of swords, spears, and bows, but you also have more atypical options like umbrellas and fans. Similarly, your "magic" options are to get drunk and fist fight your enemies, throw geese at people, meditate really hard to get a damage reduction buff, and other similar moves that don't usually appear in games.&nbsp;</p><p>Again, this ties into the aspect that sets <em>Where Winds Meet</em> apart from its competitors. Without the strong adherence to the Chinese fantasy art direction, you're left with a mechanically sound yet somewhat mundane action game.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>Persona 5: The Phantom X</em></h2><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/persona5x-trial.jpg?itok=_jruadxn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1200">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/persona5x-trial.jpg?itok=vMrYWdhm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="750">
                  

  </picture><p>While it's certainly not ideal that the latest <em>Persona </em>game is a spin-off of <em>Persona 5</em> but with gacha mechanics, credit should be given to the developers of <em>Persona 5: The Phantom X</em> for implementing a lot of features that demonstrably improve the classic Persona experience. The most obvious addition would be the inclusion of multiple adult confidants and playable characters of various ages, ranging from college students and young adults to senior citizens.</p><p>Another neat change is the modernization of various core gameplay mechanics. For instance, party roles are more strictly defined, so you might have characters that are specialized buffers or tanks. Personas have similar niches, so while you do have the freedom to build a Persona however you want, you're still encouraged to pick certain Personas based on what your team needs. Navigators also play a more active role in combat, functioning as a kind of off-screen support.&nbsp;</p><p>The most controversial changes might be the removal of the calendar system and some of the writing. The mere notion that you might miss relevant story content in previous Persona games due to the calendar was like a specter that haunted every dialogue decision that you could make, so I certainly didn't miss its absence.</p><p>Unfortunately, most everyone can agree that <em>Persona 5: The Phantom X's</em> story has a very weak opening act. While I like the first two antagonists on a conceptual level, the execution of these concepts in terms of both writing and presentation left much to be desired.</p><p>The narrative only starts to shine at the third Palace, which is much better executed thus far. While it's not quite on the level of Dr. Maruki's arc in <em>Persona 5 Royal</em>, it has the potential for greatness, and its themes are quite contemporary too.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Boy, there were a lot of games this year, huh? One would think I'd get fatigued from playing so many different titles, but I always try to experience as much as I can in a given year. So, even though this is my Top 10 list, I could very well make it my Top 20 if I had the room for it.</p><p>Honorable mentions go to <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X </em>and <em>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster </em>for being amazing games that have already had their time in the limelight, and <em>Avowed</em> for being an outstanding RPG, just not quite as good as the rest of the games on this list.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>10 - <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em></h2><p>If you read the above paragraph, you'll see that I'm contradicting myself. <em>Oblivion</em> has had plenty of time in the limelight, but this one holds a special place in my heart. <em>Oblivion </em>is easily one of my favorite games from childhood, and I was itching to go back and play it with or without a remaster.</p><p>Now that we have a remaster, I'm reminded of why it's so special. It's goofy and janky as all hell. But then you have this amazing sense of immersion and exploration with all these engrossing questlines and locales. This remaster captures all of what made <em>Oblivion</em> both flawed and fantastic back in the day while giving it a fresh coat of paint and QOL fixes for only what's needed. This is how you do a remaster, folks.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>9 - <em>Promise Mascot Agency</em></h2><p>Save a dilapidated Japanese town by running a mascot agency. These mascots aren't just people in suits, they're real-life creatures: A walking, talking severed finger, for instance. As you try to repay your sumptuous debt to your Yakuza boss, you'll unravel an intriguing mystery surrounding the town of Kaso-Machi.</p><p>Gameplay is far from conventional, taking place mostly within your little kei truck while also managing the logistics of a business. <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/promise-mascot-agency-review-little-kei-truck-that-could" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Promise Mascot Agency</em></a><em> </em>is fresh and vibrant, and there isn't anything else out there quite like it.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>8 - <em>Kirby Air Riders</em></h2><p>Coming out at the tail end of the year was <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>, and what better time to come out than during the holidays when everyone is surrounded by friends and family. It got my brothers and I to play a game together for the first time in years, so that in itself made the purchase worth it.</p><p>Gameplay-wise, it is, essentially, a better and improved version of <em>Kirby Air Ride, </em>though its mechanics are deceptively deep. There are so many challenges to complete and unlocks to collect, so it'll keep me occupied way into 2026.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>7 - <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em></h2><p>This year saw the release of several <em>Ninja Gaiden </em>titles, including <em>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</em>. That was my first true introduction to the series, and I was hooked from there. After beating <em>Black </em>last January, I was very excited to sink my teeth into <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/ninja-gaiden-4-review-blackened-rain-beckons" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em></a><em> </em>(which, at that time, had just been announced the same day as <em>Black</em>'s release).</p><p>This is one of the most exciting, challenging, intense, bloody, and badass action games I've played. Not just this year, but period. Every fight shot adrenaline through my veins as I pulled off awesome combos and took down droves of enemies. <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> just slaps.&nbsp;</p><picture>

This 2D platformer is tough-as-nails and pays homage to the series' roots with modern sensibilities.</p><p><em>Ragebound</em> boasts top-of-the-line pixel art and excellent stage design. Combat is fast-paced, simple, but brutal, requiring precision from players in order to succeed. It also introduces two intriguing characters, Kumori and Kenji. I truly hope their dynamic is expanded upon. Something tells me we haven't seen the end of them just yet.</p><picture>

Nonetheless, it's a technically excellent title with bulletproof gameplay, and it's also one of the most beautiful games to release since, well, <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>. It's a little lacking in story, but were it not for that, this might have landed in my first pick.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>4 - <em>Hades II</em></h2><p>More <em>Hades</em> is just what the doctor ordered, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/hades-2-review-new-standard-for-rougelites" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Hades II</em></a><em> </em>delivers. It's essentially a better game in every regard, even though the first game was exceptional. What really blew me away here was the Underworld <em>and </em>Overworld, adding even more variety to a sumptuous game. Also, it has Ben Starr as Prometheus. Need I say more?</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>3 - <em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em></h2><p><em>Dragon Quest </em>never got much traction in the West; at least, not as much as Japan. Even so, the <em>Dragon Quest</em> <em>HD-2D</em> remakes have been wonderful to experience. Both last year's remake of the third entry and this year's combination of the first two games have made me a lifelong fan.</p><p><em>Dragon Quest I</em> is a brief experience, but its context is important to fully appreciated <em>Dragon Quest II. </em>I'd like to think of the first game as a prologue to the full-fledged JRPG that is <em>Dragon Quest II</em>. Common sentiment is, this is the quintessential remake, adding so many wonderful additions to expand the story while paying homage to the original.&nbsp;</p><p>The journey of the four cousins in <em>Dragon Quest II HD-2D Remake</em> is heartfelt and uplifting, even when there are moments of darkness. It's a story of perseverance and camaraderie that warms my soul. Oh yeah, and it's downright gorgeous with its new HD-2D visuals.&nbsp;</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>2 - <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></h2><p><em>Mario Kart World</em> is all well and good, but the real power behind my decision to purchase the Switch 2 was, of course, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/donkey-kong-bananza-review-oohh-banana" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a>. It was a purchase well worth the price, as this is one of the most charming and addicting platformers Nintendo's ever put out.&nbsp;</p><p>The destruction physics are spectacular. I spent most of my time just digging and destroying these levels, scouring the earth for collectibles and the like. It's damn near perfect and can comfortably stand as the premier 3D platformer of the system in the same vein that <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> was for the Nintendo Switch.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>1 - <em>Dispatch</em></h2><p>This game lives rent free in my head. I binged the <em>hell</em> out of this game when all the episodes released. I was absolutely hooked by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dispatch-sales-3m-stats-adhoc" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Dispatch</em></a>, with its clever writing, stellar performances from its wonderful cast of characters, and outstanding art style.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm not even that big into super heroes, but <em>Dispatch</em> has a fresh take on the whole genre, and now I'm begging AdHoc Studios to give me another season. Even if there isn't a Season 2, I can't wait to see what else they cook up.</p>
