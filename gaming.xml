<p>In a new <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-19-donkey-kong-bananza-part-2/">Ask the Developer feature</a>, fresh screenshots have been shared that shows the visual difference between Switch 1 and Switch 2 for Bananza, with Kenta Motokura, Wataru Tanaka, and Daisuke Watanabe all providing more context as to why development was shifted over to Nintendo's new console.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, it's confirmed that the development team started to think about moving the game over to the Switch 2 in 2021. The general idea was that if the new hardware could handle more objects in the environment, then the very nature of destruction would become significantly more enjoyable.</p><div><figure data-videoid="Vb6JFhMsLFI" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c2cb8gxvipq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb6JFhMsLFI" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Here's what was said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Motokura:</strong> We originally began developing <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> on Nintendo Switch, but we ran into some challenges. I think it was around 2021 when we started to think about moving development to Switch 2.</p>
<p><strong>Watanabe:</strong> We first looked into how we could upgrade what we'd originally built for Switch to take advantage of Switch 2. One of the most obvious improvements was that we could place far more objects in the environment than before. Being able to place more objects in the terrain didn't just enhance the game's visual richness. More importantly, it increased the amount of things players could destroy, which amplified the exhilaration of being able to demolish anything and everything. That went hand in hand with the game’s core concept of destruction. It convinced us that this game would be even more fun if we developed it for Switch 2.</p>
<p><strong>Tanaka:</strong> From a programmer’s perspective, voxel technology is well-suited for creating gameplay centered around destruction. However, it also uses a lot of system memory, and we faced the challenge of Switch not having enough to support everything we wanted to do.</p>
<p>I'll explain with some simple arithmetic. If you're asked to double the size of a 1 × 1 pixel image in both width and height, you end up with a 2 × 2 image, which means four times as many pixels. But when you do the same with voxels, you've got width and height, but also depth to contend with. So, doubling all three dimensions gives you 2 × 2 × 2, or eight times the data. It may sound simple to just “double something,” but the reality is that memory usage, voxel density, and all kinds of processes end up gobbling up eight times the resources. It was clear that the memory available on Switch would struggle to handle that load, and we felt that manifesting the huge volume of terrain that we did in this game might have been unachievable on that platform.</p>
<p>With the move to Switch 2, we gained not only more memory but also greater processing capacity. That gave us the freedom to incorporate gameplay ideas we'd previously abandoned because they were too demanding. When we got down to trying it, we discovered that not only could it handle the heavy processing requirements, but it also ran at 60 fps. Things we'd given up on, like explosions flinging large objects or causing them to collapse, were now possible. Designers could also place as many objects as they wanted. There were so many moments when we thought to ourselves, “Now we can really do this.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, with that context in place, let's take a look at how the game differs between the two consoles:</p>
<figure><a title="Switch 1 vs. Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/469d762bb927c/switch-1-vs-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-19-donkey-kong-bananza-part-2/">Nintendo</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It doesn't look <em>bad</em>, right (though the overall quality of the image provided doesn't do it any favours)? But it's clear just how much Nintendo was able to implement into the game world with the Switch 2, in addition to some fancy crepuscular rays shining down from above.</p>
<p>Donkey Kong Bananza is launching this week on <strong>17th July 2025</strong>. It was recently reported that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/uh-oh-it-looks-like-donkey-kong-bananza-is-already-out-in-the-wild">physical copies of the game have managed to sneak out into the wild</a>, so be wary of what you're looking at online if you don't want to be spoiled.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/candy-crush-developers-set-to-be-laid-off-by-microsoft-are-reportedly-being-replaced-by-the-ai-tools-they-were-told-to-build.1244004/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new report from <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/laid-off-king-staff-set-to-be-replaced-by-the-ai-tools-they-helped-build-say-sources/">MobileGamer.biz</a> claims that 200 developers at Candy Crush studio King are at the risk of being laid off as part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">Microsoft's latest mass layoff</a>, and will be replaced by the AI tools they were told to build.</p>



<p>King is the mobile division of Activision Blizzard King, and arguably was the division out of Microsoft's ABK acquisition that its gaming team needed the most, since Microsoft lacked any presence in the mobile gaming industry. Buying the studio that makes Candy Crush, one of the biggest and most well-known mobile games around the world, changed that overnight. </p>



<p>But as it's been<a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/"> reported multiple times</a>, Microsoft's cuts are allegedly not concerned with anything beyond the company wanting to get ahead, and stay ahead<a href="https://wccftech.com/microsofts-in-house-ai-chip-delayed-as-firm-worried-about-losing-to-nvidia-in-competitiveness/">, in the AI race</a>. Now, this report from MobileGamer.biz shows the<a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-trying-replace-jobs-ai-agents/"> inevitable endgame that every bean counter pushing AI and generative AI tools has in mind, being put into practice</a>. That every part of the job they currently pay people to do can be replaced by an AI tool.</p>



<p>"<em>Most of level design has been wiped, which is crazy since they've spent months building tools to craft levels quicker</em>," said a source that MobileGamer.biz spoke to. "<em>Now those AI tools are basically replacing the teams. Similarly the copywriting team is completely removing people since we now have AI tools that those individuals have been creating</em>."</p>



<p>The report also adds that certain employees are being targeted and getting laid off for "<em>arbitrary reasons</em>," with a source claiming that people who have been vocally speaking out against decisions made by leadership are now set to lose their jobs. A different source in the report claims that the HR department at King is "<em>an absolute shitshow and has been for years. An extreme example of an HR department whose role it is to protect the company, not the staff</em>."</p>



<p>So far, the line from any company that's implementing generative AI tools into their game development process, King included, has always been that the AI tool will take care of the more tedious, mundane tasks, while the human developers can focus on the more complex, creativity-focused parts of making games. Reporter for The Logic, Brendan Sinclair, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/brendansinclair.bsky.social/post/3ltytlpz3ws2s">pointed out that just last year,</a> King's director of AI labs, Sahar Asadi, had that exact message as part of her talk at GDC 2024. </p>



<p>Now, those designers who were supposed to have more time to be creative, are being replaced entirely by these AI tools. An internal memo sent out to King developers claims that these cuts  are about "<em>making several changes to get the business back to growth" </em>and that "<em>unlocking many more AI tools"</em> is one element of that. It also goes on to explain that this is about having "<em>fewer layers, fewer overlapping remits, fewer hours spent on alignment, fewer people in meetings, fewer stakeholders for every project</em>."</p>



<p>According to a source in the report, it could be the case that more than 200 developers are cut from King, impacting the Candy Crush team, half of the Farm Heroes Saga team, and developers working in London, Barcelona, Stockholm, and Berlin-based studios. </p>



<p>"<em>The fact AI tools are replacing people is absolutely disgusting but it's all about efficiency and profits even though the company is doing great overall,</em>" said a source that MobileGamer.biz spoke to. "<em>If we're introducing more feedback loops then it's crazy to remove the developers themselves, we need more hands and less leadership.</em>"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has revealed that it isn't planning to implement any kind of upgrade path for the Switch 2 version of the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em>&nbsp;package.</p>

<p>In a new FAQ on its website, Square Enix says there is "no upgrade path currently available or planned" for the game, and that if you want to play the Switch 2 version, you'll have to buy that one separately, regardless of whether you've purchased the Switch version or not.</p>

<p>As with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-switch-2-500k-sales" rel="nofollow">other Switch games</a>, the Switch 2 version of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>will come complete with improved visuals and performance on Nintendo's newest console, although Square Enix does say there are "no differences in the story, game content, or in which items can be obtained" between both versions.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-switch-2-upgrade-steps.jpg?itok=W5sKmgbk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-switch-2-upgrade-steps.jpg?itok=SOZEC4Iw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>won't have a Switch 2 upgrade path, unfortunately.</figcaption></figure><p>Buying the Switch version of the game will enable you to play it on both the Switch and the Switch 2, but you'll just be playing the original Switch version on the newer hardware; unlike <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-upgrades-switch-1" rel="nofollow">certain Nintendo games</a>, there won't be any free update to improve performance for the original Switch version on Switch 2.</p>

<p>Additionally, you can't transfer save data between the two versions, nor can you use download codes for the Switch 2 version on the original Switch game, or vice-versa. They're treated as separate software, so they're not inter-compatible in any way.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, though, if you've played&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>on the original Switch, that still entitles you to in-game bonuses for the new games, even if you buy them on Switch 2.</p>

<p>It's worth reading Square Enix's full FAQ for the Switch and Switch 2 versions of its new HD-2D&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest&nbsp;</em>games if you've got any other questions about how the games will work across Nintendo hardware.

                <p>Like most open-world games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529507/" data-ref-id="1100-6529507">Borderlands 4</a> will have its fair share of collectibles to hunt down. The catch here is that you'll need to really work to get your hands on collectible bobblehead replicas of everyone's refund-adverse arms dealer, Marcus, as these will be hidden away in hard-to-reach areas.</p><p>As detailed by Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford, the idea for these collectibles came from the studio wanting to push the game's enhanced move-set to its very limits. Borderlands 4 has several new traversal options--including gliding, double-jumping, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-seamless-world-and-movement-mechanics-will-make-it-hard-for-players-to-go-back/1100-6528427/" data-ref-id="1100-6528427">and using a grapple-hook to move around areas</a>--and Gearbox wanted to reward players with a memento for reaching remote spots on the map.</p><p>"Graeme Timmons--Borderlands 4's creative director--got with some of our designers and other artists and engineers and decided that we needed something for players to find when they made their way to these remote or uninhabited areas," <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1944529531978858850" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pitchford tweeted</a>. "We wanted something of an icon. The same kind of thing in each spot, so players would <em>know</em> they found it. The item had to be simple, recognizable, have a feeling of being something one might collect--and ideally--having real connections to our universe."</p><p>This led to the Marcus bobblehead being chosen, and there's even an in-universe reason for these being on the isolationist planet of Kairos. As Pitchford noted, there are "well over 200" of these bobbleheads to collect, and he expects that most players will never see any of them. "A very, very small number of people will explore Kairos so completely that they might discover them all. Each has a story," Pitchford added, while also throwing down a gauntlet to players with the inclusion of a map showing off the locations of these collectibles.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/DuvalMagic/status/1944532238554812905" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">All in all, there are well over 200 Marcus Bobbleheads hidden around Kairos.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>With Nintendo's next Switch 2 exclusive game, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, just <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/donkey-kong-bananza-is-a-new-nintendo-switch-2-platformer-starring">two days away from launch</a>, the company has released a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-19-donkey-kong-bananza-part-1/">three-part interview series</a> about the game's development. In the final section of the series, one of Bananza's directors, Kazuya Takahashi, said players can skip locations and parts of the story in the game, thanks to its unique destruction gameplay.&nbsp;</p><p>"There's a lot of leeway in terms of progression in this game," Takahashi said when asked about any final words he might have to close out the interview. "For example, locations or parts of the story you can skip without suffering any consequences. When the game progresses in a way we hadn't intended, we call it a 'sequence break' in development terminology. Typically, in game development, restrictions are put in place to prevent this from happening, but since this game is all about destruction, we wanted people to play freely."&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6vIDbh6D414"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6vIDbh6D414" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>As you can see, it sounds like there's a lot of leeway given to players when it comes to destruction and what they're able to accomplish by destroying the environment around them. It can even lead to skipping story sections or locations; however, given Nintendo's typically high standard of quality, it's unlikely that players will be able to skip critical parts of the game. Regardless, Takahashi said this newfound freedom from restrictions makes things easier for the development team.&nbsp;</p><p>"But please do experiment," he said.&nbsp;</p><p>Fortunately, there are just two days left until everyone can begin experimenting with Donkey Kong's destructive abilities because Donkey Kong Bananza launches exclusively on Switch 2 this Thursday, July 17.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, read <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2025/07/01/our-impressions-after-two-hours-of-gameplay"><em>Game Informer's </em>hands-on preview impressions</a> after two hours with the game, and then check out this <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/ngt/2025/07/01/we-played-two-hours-of-donkey-kong-bananza-new-gameplay-today">Donkey Kong Bananza New Gameplay Today</a>.

            <p>
Nintendo has pushed out another <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> system update with typically minimal patch notes. But as delightful as the company's endless quest for "stability improvements" undoubtedly are, users have also starting spotting some undocumented backward compatibility improvements affecting the previously broken likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/portal-2">Portal 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
Switch 2's latest update - officially titled Ver. 20.2.0 - arrived overnight, delivering two specifically documented (if not especially thrilling) enhancements for the console. Firstly, it fixed an issue where parental control settings were not being copied from Switch 1 to Switch 2 during system transfer, and then came those  "general system stability improvements".
</p>
<p>
However, word of some secret sauce hidden amid Ver. 20.2.0's mundane documented fixes started circulating soon after. Prominent Switch data miner OatmealDome, for instance, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oatmealdome.bsky.social/post/3ltxqqi5d4s2h">noted</a> it also addressed "some problems" with Switch 1 backwards compatibility. "I can personally confirm that Portal 2 no longer crashes after updating," they added.
</p>
<p>
Owners had previously found a temporary fix for Portal 2's crashing problem - the issue was seemingly remedied by setting Switch 2 to aeroplane mode before launching the game - but workarounds are needed no more. Alongside user reports of a fix, Nintendo has - as of today, 15th June - now officially <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/portal-2-switch/">updated Portal 2's eShop listing</a> to confirm its compatibility with Switch 2. "Supported," reads the new note. "Game behaviour is consistent with Nintendo Switch."
</p>
<p>
Other previously wonky games have also been hit with the magic fixing stick following Ver. 20.2.0's release - Crypt of the Necrodancer is another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Portal/comments/1ldawwb/do_not_buy_portal_2_for_the_switch_2/?sort=new">highlighted by users</a> and relabelled as compatible on eShop - but the full extent of Nintendo's tinkering is not yet known. At least we've got those stability improvements to enjoy while the investigations continue.

Only some M1 and M2 Macs are supported, though — you’ll need a Mac with 16GB or more of unified memory to play <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, so base 8GB M1 and M2 chips won’t be compatible.</p><p>There will be graphics presets that are optimized for each Apple silicon model, and more powerful Apple silicon chips will also fully support <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/23/23653237/cyberpunk-2077-overdrive-mode-full-ray-tracing-path-tracing">features like path tracing</a>, which is a film-like full ray tracing mode that greatly improves lighting and occlusion in the game.</p><p>AMD’s FSR upscaling and frame generation will also be available in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> on Mac, helping the game feel more smooth with options like path tracing enabled. There will be MetalFX upscaling, too, alongside support for Apple’s Magic Mouse and Trackpad hardware.</p><p>Apple and CD Projekt Red haven’t shared performance data for what to expect across different Apple silicon Mac configurations. If you own an Apple XDR display, or any other HDR monitor, you’ll get HDR support in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, and there’s even spatial audio and head-tracking with Apple AirPods.</p><p>Mac owners have technically been able to run <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> on their devices for a couple years now, thanks to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/7/23752164/apple-mac-gaming-game-porting-toolkit-windows-games-macos">Apple’s own Proton-like game porting tool</a>. This official release means the game takes full advantage of Apple silicon and Apple’s native Metal graphics APIs, including its Tile-Based Deferred Rendering (TBDR) architecture.</p><p><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> debuts on Mac just as CD Projekt Red releases the latest 2.3 patch for the game, which includes additional cars and new photo mode features. The game will support cross progression across all platforms and includes the <em>Phantom Liberty</em> expansion and all of the major updates to the game so far.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/707106/cyberpunk-2077-mac-release-date]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tales-of-the-shire">Tales Of The Shire: A The Lord Of The Rings Game</a> is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cosy-life-sim-tales-of-the-shire-needs-more-time-in-the-oven-delayed-until-2025">finally coming out this month</a>, offering <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hobbit-life-sim-tales-of-the-shire-is-so-jolly-and-joyful-it-creeps-the-hell-out-of-me">terrifyingly cosy Hobbitiness</a> to us bumbling Bilbos. Its system requirements have just dropped, and they're pretty reasonable.</p>
<p>In fact, its needs are so modest and homely that I'm wondering whether you might be able to run it <em>on</em> a Hobbit, provided you could find one in real life and staple some Nvidia - or AMD- branded plastic into the surface of its flesh. It's ok, I'm sure Gandalf has a magic stapler that doesn't produce excruciating pain if you fire it directly into a person.</p>

<p>So, donning our spec-inspecting specs, let's take a look at the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2016460/Tales_of_the_Shire_A_The_Lord_of_The_Rings_Game/">Steam page</a>. Tales of the Shire's minimum system requirements, which promise 30fps on very low settings, comprise the following: an Intel Core i5-7600K or AMD Ryzen 3 1200 processor, 16GB of RAM, 3GB of storage space on a hard drive or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-ssd-for-gaming">SSD</a> running at least Windows 10, and your choice of an Nvidia GeForce GTX 770, an AMD Radeon R9 270X, or an Intel Arc A580.</p>
<p>Those Nvidia and AMD GPUs are both from 2013, so while you'll need a decent CPU, there's some nice older rig potential for those who aren't down to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-graphics-card">splash the cash on an RTX 5090</a> just to play a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-electronic-wireless-show-podcast-s3-episode-16-the-new-hobbit-life-sim-and-our-favourite-the-lord-of-the-rings-games">Hobbity life sim</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the recomended specs - which should net you 60fps on high settings - list Intel Core i5-10600 or AMD Ryzen 5 8400F processors, 16GB of RAM, 3GB of drive space, Windows 11, and either an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti or an AMD Radeon RX 6750 XT.</p>
<p>Nice, but can it run on a Hobbit? Hear me out. You install the game in his head through hypnotic suggestion, his mouth makes all the noises, and the visuals are projected onto his eyes through forbidden rendering magic, turning them into dual monitors. There's a graphics card from just over a decade ago grafted onto his buttocks, and a DisplayPort cable runs from it up into his ear. He averages a solid 20fps because he occasionally has to blink, and you use his nipples like the analogue sticks of a controller and bop his nose every time you need to press Enter.</p>
<p>In the distance, Sauron sees what you're up to, and is so horrified he considers giving the Middle-earth cops a spare ring and your address.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tales-of-the-shires-system-requirements-have-me-considering-grafting-a-graphics-card-to-a-hobbits-bum]]></content:encoded>

There was a time when video games were all about gruesomely murdering people, watching as the viscera was torn from their dismembered limbs, hearing that sloppy, wet slap as a severed leg flopped messily to the ground. But now it’s all factories and conveyor belts, with careful industrious management and not a writhing stream of entrails to be found. And we let <em>children</em> play these games?</p><p>To give you an idea of how popular this reasonably new genre has become (yes, yes, such games have appeared since the dawn of the hobby, but not as part of a thriving genre), the Automation Fest includes 259 games, primarily from the last ten years. And that’s a lot of games to look through if you don’t know where to start. Fortunately, like the well-oiled, overly elaborate machine we are, we <em>do</em> know where to begin digging through the stockpiles, and which games you should—I dunno—place on the conveyor belt to your wishlist? Is that something? (<em>Well, it’s</em> something<em>—Ed</em>)</p><h2 id="h50993"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/300570/Infinifactory/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/300570/Infinifactory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Infinifactory</a></span></h2><p>It would be foolish to attribute the current success of automation games to one specific developer, not least because no game appears in a vacuum, instead influenced by the decades of development that came before it. But that aside, I’m going to entirely attribute the current success of automation games to one specific developer: Zachtronics.</p><p>Founded by Zach Barth, Zachtronics first created <em>Infiniminer—</em>a game which influenced&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>—and then blew up puzzle gaming with 2011's <em>SpaceChem</em>. But in 2015, the studio released <em>Infinifactory</em>, combining ideas from both, and in doing so, instantly made automation gaming A Big Thing. Rather than simply being a factory sim where you build these intricate assembly lines to solve challenges, <em>Infinifactory</em> also had a batshit storyline of alien abduction and being forced to manufacture suspicious equipment likely to be used for nefarious purposes.</p><p>Now 10 years old, it feels like the granddaddy of this whole festival, discounted to half price for the week.</p><p>Rather than bloat the rest of these selections with other games from Zachtronics, which could very reasonably just have the entire list to itself, I’ll just note that nearly all the studio’s classics are discounted this week. There’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/558990/Opus_Magnum/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/558990/Opus_Magnum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Opus Magnum</em></a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/92800/SpaceChem/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/92800/SpaceChem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>SpaceChem</em></a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/504210/SHENZHEN_IO/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/504210/SHENZHEN_IO/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Shenzhen I/O</em></a></span> and many others at half off. The studio’s last game, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1511780/Last_Call_BBS/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1511780/Last_Call_BBS/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Last Call BBS</em></a></span>, isn’t discounted, but you can pick it up as part of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/2925/The_Zachtronics_Puzzle_Pack/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/2925/The_Zachtronics_Puzzle_Pack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zachtronics Puzzle Pack</a></span> which contains all the games, currently 39 percent off.</p><h2 id="h50994"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/526870/Satisfactory/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/526870/Satisfactory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Satisfactory</a></span></h2><p>At the other end of the timeline sits <em>Satisfactory</em>, 2024's smash hit evolution of the genre, where your assembly line constructions also take place on an alien planet, but this time in an open world that you’re free to explore, and even featuring combat. But, of course, the primary focus is on making a factory, which here can be ridiculously tall, complicated, and...exploitative of local nature?</p><p>First-person is obviously not the normal way such construction-driven games are played, but <em>Satisfactory</em> has absolutely nailed it. (And before we move on, can we just sit back and give a small round of applause for the title? Perfect puns are too easily glossed over, and this deserves its props. Until you’re Googling for it, and then...) This is a factory-building game with jump pads and vehicles and angry fauna.</p><p>It’s pretty hard to overstate the popularity of Coffee Stain Studios’ game (yes, the same people who made <em>Goat Simulator</em>!). This has received an eye-watering 237,000 reviews on Steam, and over 96 percent of them are positive. That’s just extraordinary. And nearly a year after release, it’s still seeing 25,000 or more people playing simultaneously every day. And for good reason. This week you can pick it up for 30 percent off.</p><h2 id="h50995"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/Factorio/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/Factorio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Factorio</a></span></h2><p>And here, bridging between the two ends of the genre’s long road, is <em>Factorio</em>, 2020's mega-hit automation game. The 2D, top-down factory-making sim feels a lot like a precursor to <em>Satisfactory</em>, with its free building, predatory local fauna, and enormous world. (Well, this one’s infinite, while Coffee Stain’s is a slightly smaller 30km².) </p><p>Do not be fooled by the late-90s style of the graphics; this is a thoroughly modern game of ludicrous complexity, where you mine your resources, research your tech, and automate your production lines, all while—yup—exploiting the local ecology. As such, you’ll also need to defend your factories from external forces. Oh, and credit where it’s due: this game went to Kickstarter in 2013, two years before <em>Infinifactory</em> appeared.</p><p><em>Factorio</em> has been wildly successful, selling millions of copies, and developers Wube Software are still releasing updates as recently as...today! Wube has also committed to never putting the game on sale, which—honestly—good for them! That means it’s always $35, whether you buy it during this fest or next week, but 96 percent of 217,000 people reckon that’s a good deal.</p><h2 id="h50996"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2275490/Kaizen_A_Factory_Story/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2275490/Kaizen_A_Factory_Story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kaizen: A Factory Story</a></span></h2><p>And let’s complete the loop. While it’s only been out for a few hours, it’s fairly safe to say that short of a very surprising twist, <em>Kaizen: A Factory Story</em> is about to be the next big automation game. Why? Because this is developed by Coincidence, which is Zachtronics in a new hat.</p><p>Funnily enough, Zachtronics was closed in 2022 because Zach Barth thought the studio had become stuck making factory-based puzzle games, and wanted himself and his studio mates to be set free to develop other things. Three years  and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2870750/Add_Astra/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2870750/Add_Astra/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one math-based puzzle game</a></span> later, it seems that other things weren’t perhaps as attractive as they looked, because Barth and chums are back with a brand new automation-based puzzler. Whoops!</p><p>While <em>Kaizen</em> only has a handful of reviews so far, all have been very positive. This time, you’re running a Japanese assembly line around the turn of the 1990s, working out how to arrange machinery and processes to best create a range of products. And its story explores the time period in what I’ve read are surprisingly emotional ways.</p><h2 id="h50997"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2072840/Word_Factori/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2072840/Word_Factori/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Word Factori</a></span></h2><p>A little more off the beaten path is <em>Word Factori</em>, a puzzle game in which you must create words but only after having invented recipes for the alphabet.</p><p>What begins as a rather cute game about combining letter parts through various machine parts to build new ones, starting with only the letter i and building from there, very quickly becomes the most astonishingly intricate and brain-hurting challenge. It looks so friendly and welcoming, but when you’re trying to optimize your production lines for the more efficient creation of tricksy words, you’ll realize its real depths.</p><p>Spelling the word “CAT” has never been so difficult.</p><hr><p>Obviously there are <em>so</em> many other games worth checking out in the selection, and we’ve barely scraped the surface of even the best-known examples here. If you’re looking to get into automated gaming, these are an excellent way to start, but make sure to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/category/automation&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/automation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dig through the full list</a></span> for any treasures that may perfectly match your mood.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/steam-automation-fest-factory-games-satisfactory-1851786275]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda has quietly fixed a door in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> that had left Dark Brotherhood lore fans scratching their heads.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> Potential spoilers for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered follow.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s cast our minds back to April and the hugely successful release of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered. Soon after launch, players of the original, much-loved open-world role-playing game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-some-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-lore-fans-are-disappointed-with-oblivion-remastereds-new-dark-brotherhood-door">noticed the door to the Dark Brotherhood’s Cheydinhal sanctuary entrance was inexplicably changed in a way that broke the lore</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The door in question is at the centre of an iconic moment in Oblivion, one players who took on the excellent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/The_Dark_Brotherhood"><u>Dark Brotherhood quest</u></a> will probably remember well. In the original Oblivion, the glowing door has a heavy mood aesthetic and a relief showing the Night Mother (who members of the assassination-obsessed Dark Brotherhood worship) murdering five children. The Oblivion Remastered version of this door has no glow, is light on atmosphere and, weirdly, has two extra children.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can see a comparison with accompanying complaint in the reddit post from alvaro-elite, below:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Elder Scrolls lore fans were quick to point out that the addition of two kids on the relief makes no sense given what we know about the story of the Night Mother. This moment in time is meant to represent the Night Mother’s murdering of the five children she conceived with Sithis, the Elder Scrolls deity who represents emptiness and the Void. As the story goes, the Night Mother is murdered by the locals for killing her kids, which turns her into the immortal Night Mother in the first place. In fact, in Oblivion, the Night Mother’s tomb includes skeletal remains of one adult and five children, reinforcing this lore.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans had wondered whether Bethesda and developer Virtuos would patch Oblivion Remastered to change the door to be lore compliant, and so it has proved. As noticed by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/oblivion-remastereds-latest-patch-stealthily-fixed-the-most-lore-breaking-door-in-videogames/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PC Gamer</a>, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-update-12-finally-adds-performance-improvements-tunes-journeyman-difficulty-setting">the recent release of Update 1.2 in Steam beta form</a>, those who have opted in to test the patch now have a lore-compliant door with five children, rather than seven in the relief. Strangely, this change isn’t in the officially released patch notes, below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The expectation is this new door is what Oblivion Remastered will include across the board when Update 1.2 launches fully.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be sure to check out our comprehensive guide to everything you'll find in Oblivion Remastered, including an expansive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/maps/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/cyrodiil"><u>Interactive Map</u></a>, complete Walkthroughs for the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Main_Quest_Walkthrough"><u>Main Questline</u></a> and every <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Guilds"><u>Guild Quest</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Character_Building_Guide"><u>How to Build the Perfect Character</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Things_to_Do_First_in_Oblivion"><u>Things to Do First</u></a>, every <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/PC_Cheats_and_Console_Commands"><u>PC Cheat Code</u></a>, and much more.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered update 1.2 patch notes:</h2><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>SETTINGS CHANGES</strong></h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>We’ve added additional difficulty settings to allow players to further tune their “Player Combat Damage” &amp; “Enemy Combat Damage”.

So, even if you did start playing on Switch 1 and then decide to later fully re-purchase the Switch 2 edition, you'd need to start your playthrough again from scratch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Curiously, the only Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2 HD-2D Remake item that does seem to be cross-compatible is a save data bonus for an in-game Dog Suit (in Dragon Quest 1) and Cat Suit (in Dragon Quest 2). These will unlock if you buy a Switch 2 version of the game, if you previously unlocked them with a Switch 1 copy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Each version has different graphical specifications based on the hardware's processing capabilities," Square Enix wrote of the remake's differences on Switch 2. "However, there are no differences in the story, game content, or in which items can be obtained."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The publisher has given no reason why the two versions of the game remain separate, without a $10 paid-for upgrade option (as with similar third-party Switch 2 games such as Hogwarts Legacy and Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds) or the situation, as found by fans with many other Switch 1 games, where some titles simply run better on Nintendo's newer hardware.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Square Enix is set to launch its Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2 HD-2D Remake on October 30, 2025, for PC (via Steam and Microsoft Store), PS5, Switch, Switch 2, and Xbox Series X/S. Just remember to be careful which version you're buying</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In a way, Dragon Quest’s, let’s say 'classic' storyline and trope-ish setting is easier to appreciate today than maybe a decade ago," IGN wrote in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake-first-impressions-classic-dq-has-never-looked-so-good"><u>Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2 HD-2D Remake preview</u></a>. "Nowadays, with graphics as advanced as they are and storylines trying to compete with the biggest movies and TV shows, Dragon Quest is a reminder that some stories are timeless for a reason."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

As detailed in the "Character Art" section pertaining to base game update changes, the update says, "Added clothing to a character in A Lethal Obsession, Narcos, and some characters in the mission Hide and Seek," evidencing it is pressing on with one of the more controversial changes, which was to cover up nudity.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of the hundreds of comments left by players, many are unhappy VOID has gone ahead with the amendments.

At the time, VOID insisted the changes were "small enough that most people here wouldn't notice if we didn't say anything," but it "wanted to be transparent" with its players. Players disagreed, and the news caused Ready or Not's Steam user review rating to plummet to "mostly negative" for recent reviews, although overall the review rating remains "very positive."

It was then moved to Sumo Digital before being <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/08/14/dead-island-2-is-officially-on-its-third-developer"><u>shifted again in 2019 to its final home of Dambuster Studios</u></a>. A new trailer and gameplay video was released on December 6, 2022, during a Dead Island 2 Showcase that announced it was delayed once again, slipping 12 weeks to April 2023. It was the first proper look at the game fans had since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-island-2-new-trailer-release-date-february-2023"><u>it was re-revealed after years of troubled development in August 2022</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I was working on that with the creative team, and we were mightily proud of that [trailer]," Wein said. "But then, about three to four weeks later, we had a major milestone with the development studio that was in charge at that time. And boy, that game sucked.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It had nothing to do with what [made] the original Dead Island [...] really fun. So we commissioned a play test and got horrific feedback. And we sat down with the development team and said, 'Okay, what's the course of action?' And they said, 'Yeah, leave it with us.'"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But at the next touch-point, Wein said little had changed, with playtest feedback indicating the sequel was "not fun, not engaging, [and] does not feel like the Dead Island that I played."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So at the end of the day, we had to take the game away from that external developer, find a new studio, and that put the game on a journey of… well, it was supposed to launch in 2015. When did it come out? 2023?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Sometimes you have to make hard decisions," Wein added. "Because we could have, at that point, put out a sh*t game. It might have made some money, but it would have killed the franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I cannot really speak to the conversation between the production team and the development partner as I was not part of those, but as the developer wanted to pursue their vision rather than follow player feedback, the ultimate decision was made to part ways."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When it did finally release in 2023, IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-island-2-review"><u>Dead Island 2's review</u></a> returned a 7/10. We said: "Dead Island 2 is a hilarious gore-fest and a competent zombie-slaying adventure, but lacks creativity outside of its great sense of humor."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

<figure><a title="I saw this item shower for the first time after more than 60 hours of play" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d208f120cf309/i-saw-this-item-shower-for-the-first-time-after-more-than-60-hours-of-play.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>I saw this item shower for the first time after more than 60 hours of play. — <em>Image: Omar Hafeez-Bore</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Guys, I've played so much <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1752654427536000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2eHtBrTPLbsgQZCUSwXNsT" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>I've done all the Grands Prix (on three stars, obviously), and the Knockout Tours (not on three stars, life is short). I've had an ongoing competition with friends on Mario Bros. Circuit Time Trial, where you go to bed victorious and wake up to a blurry photo of someone beating you by 0.003 seconds.</p>
<p>I've done more than 200 P-Switches and taken (I’ve just checked) about 211 photos in Free Roam, so now pressing minus is part of my normal driving flow and I share photos most days on our WhatsApp gaming group. Yesterday Ibby said "Great shots bro."</p>
<p>I’m now at the point of obsession where you try to get the balance right to bounce on a Toad's head indefinitely like a trampoline. Tricky!</p>
<p>It helps that the game is pure movement exuberance, every trick a bouncing, squashing, sparking laugh in the language of kart. And that the new moves turn it into a sort-of a momentum platformer, scratching some of the itch of not having a bona fide single-player Nintendo adventure at launch (and by 'momentum platformer' I mean you desperately try to fling your kart near a cliff edge with coins, overshoot, then try to get the rewind just right to end up on top anyway).</p>

<p>But there's no way I would have mained this game so hard if <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1752654427536000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1217wZndXWyLR-OI95u2jM" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Bananza</a> was also out at launch. And I'm grateful for that, and the other ways the Switch 2 launch period has reminded me a bit of old-school Nintendo fandom. <em>I know this feeling.</em></p>
<p>There's Mario Kart, and the way the Free Roam mode has that unstructured (<em>or unfinished</em> <em>har har</em>) sense of self-directed play that came naturally when younger; getting new games on birthdays and Christmas, spending weeks licking the plate clean for all its offerings, then looking for new ways to play a game upside down and backwards (now spinning the plate?). The other day I was literally mooching around Mario Kart World backwards with 'X' held - it takes your focus off the route to better admire the cool tyre size transitions!</p>
<p>Then there’s the strong, thrifty, thorough energy in replaying all the upgraded Switch 1 games, too. You get that 20/20 new glasses <em>wow</em>-ness of loading up <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1752654427536000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3Fs03xLYflane1PNpr3Ocx" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a>, say — simultaneously enjoying what you’re playing and how you remember it and loving the difference — and then using the Zelda Notes app (with grating GPS off) to finally polish off the main side quests. I was glad to have played the one with the mushroom-hunting gals, and it feels like a brief reprieve from the firehose of constant gaming newness, to dot some Is and cross some Ts and plunge again into the depths at 60fps and without a hitch.</p>
<figure><a title="TOTK" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c8dff79bf0bd5/totk.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>This was a nice side quest. Thanks, Zelda Notes. — <em>Image: Omar Hafeez-Bore</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I suspect there's also an element of Launch Period Grace, an unseen line where 'the new stuff' starts - as unreal-yet-real as a border on a map. <em>I've got a new console and want to be playing it</em>. That's <em>new</em>-new stuff like <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1752654427536000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3TwJ_KC5ot53RThQZv0b83" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Welcome Tour</a> — a game I somehow keep going back to in small bursts despite it not recognising my TV as 4K, in which you can only pick up one piece of museum litter at a time — and new-old stuff like <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1752654427536000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0X2YRVFDyslw8zFInBQ38k" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk</a>.</p>
<p>I know some third-party stuff has apparently underperformed, but I’ve still felt that hunger-is-the-best-spice tug that means games like <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1752654427536000&amp;usg=AOvVaw00lEITDPk5MbbN4xRGLj0_" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion">Fast Fusion</a> get some love in a way that reminds me of first loading up my new Game Boy Advance at my dad’s house, with <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/f-zero_maximum_velocity&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1752654427536000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3nh4Qs1f4TWr40BcOAogr9" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/f-zero_maximum_velocity">F-Zero Maximum Velocity</a> (and a barely visible screen). Or all those 4-star, mid-80s-scoring classics-to-my-family, like <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/fighters_destiny&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1752654427536000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3hO_HRTlgqx6WYeLBcC6e6" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/fighters_destiny">Fighters Destiny</a> or <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/snowboard_kids&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1752654427536000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3pUcNY_XmI6rL3ogAWQRhp" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/snowboard_kids">Snowboard Kids</a> or <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/lost_kingdoms&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1752654427536000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2OEktimpTjmP0uYu-dCilw" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/lost_kingdoms">Lost Kingdoms</a> on the GameCube.</p>
<p>What’s weird is I think I was most struck the other day, when scrolling across the Switch home screen (apparently with unacceptable blur?), choosing which of the select, launch-glowed games to play. It reminded me of flicking through my N64 carts in their repurposed ice cream tub on days off school. Crazier still, I’ve just checked and there’s only about 10 of them, played and loved deeply enough to fill an era. (Yoshi’s Story was £18.99 from Cash Converters according to the peeling label on the back.)</p>
<figure><a title="N64 carts" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0e8d65f3ec3cb/n64-carts.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I’ve had a blast getting to know my Switch 2, gorging on Mario Kart and the rest - pips and all. And now I've enjoyed these few weeks of runway where everyone’s gotten in-sync with excitement for Bananza - <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1752654427536000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1WDa8FrGaWtuLTK1wxNhKB" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it">an all-timer Direct</a>, some snippets of the songs, opening Chrome in lulls at work because Bing corrects it to ‘Bonanza’. So much of games is the context around them, and it's nice to have some uncrowded space so ripe for hype. Now it feels like <em>proper</em>, Big Nintendo Release Time.</p>
<p>Just a couple of days to go.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lossless-scaling-frame-generation-plugin-for-steam-deck-delivers-up-to-4x-performance-boost-in-both-native-and-emulated-games.1243884/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Lossless Scaling Frame Generation Steam Deck plugin is now available, allowing users to boost performance in native and emulated games by up to four times.</p>



<p>A new video shared on YouTube by Deck Wizard provides a quick overview of the new plugin, the installation procedure and how it can be used to improve performance via frame generation with the 2x, 3x and 4x options. The video also shows some quick tests for multiple games, including Elden Ring, which can run at over 80 FPS on the system with the proper settings, Okami HD, and Shin Megami Tensei III Nocturne HD Remaster, which can both run at above their 30 FPS lock. The plugin can also be used to improve performance in emulated games, as shown with Shadow of the Colossus.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Lossless Scaling Frame Generation has made incredible progress since its release, adding, over time, a 3x and 4x options which work decently enough, but are in no way on par with NVIDIA DLSS Multi Frame Generation, unsurprisingly. The 2x option, on the other hand, has been improved so much that in some games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-lossless-scaling-2x-comparable-dlss-4-frame-generation/">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, it is almost on part with NVIDIA DLSS 4 Frame Generation. As such, the app is an excellent choice for all those using previous generations NVIDIA GPUs like the RTX 2000 and 3000 series that will never get official Frame Generation support.</p>



<p>More information on the Lossless Scaling Frame Generation Steam Deck plugin can be found on its <a href="https://discord.com/invite/TwvHdVucC3">Discord server</a>. The app is available for purchase <span>on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/993090/Lossless_Scaling/">Steam</a> right now</span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/993090/Lossless_Scaling/">.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Another look at Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is coming next month right at the beginning of this year's Gamescom.</p>



<p>A new worldwide reveal of the next entry in the popular series has been confirmed for this year's Gamescom Opening Night Live, which will be held on August 19th from 2:00 PM ET / 11:00 AM PT / 8:00 PM CEST, host Geoff Keighley confirmed. This confirmation is rather interesting, as usually, reveals for the new entries in the Call of Duty series are held separately from bigger events, so there's still the chance that an event focused on the game could be coming at a later time.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>CALL OF DUTY: BLACK OPS 7 worldwide reveal at Opening Night Live kicks off <a href="https://twitter.com/gamescom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@gamescom</a> in a massive way.</p><p>Tuesday, August 19.</p><p>Streaming live everywhere at 2p ET / 11a PT / 8p CEST. <a href="https://t.co/6HfSTirTze">pic.twitter.com/6HfSTirTze</a></p></div>— Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1944804083300270541?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 14, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The confirmation of the Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 gameplay reveal for Gamescom Opening Night is not completely surprising, despite no longer happening with a dedicated event focused on the game, as it was teased last month that the game would be shown again this Summer. The only look at the game to date was provided with a teaser shown at the end of this year's edition of the Xbox Games Showcase, which set the tone for the next entry in the series and for its 2035 future setting. It was also confirmed shortly after the showcase that the campaign will be entirely playable in co-op.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will launch later this year on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One.</p>

Months later, the ruthless climbing sim for friends is one of Steam’s biggest surprise hits of 2025.

So the team decided to partner with some of the 2024 co-op horror playground game’s developers on something similar, but with the disarmingly twee quirkiness that Aggro Crab is known for.</p><p>The result is <em>Peak</em>, a first-person hiking adventure in which players control lo-fi, child-like avatars as they help one another traverse through hazardous terrain like steep cliffs and scorching lava pits. The game is cheap, just $8 to download, exploits social dynamics for drama and comedy in otherwise familiar gameplay scenarios, and is catnip for social media.

                <p>Considering the popularity of the John Wick films, there aren't a lot of video games that let players assume control of the legendary killer. Now, there's going to be one fewer because <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/john-wick-hex-review-tick-tock-wick/1900-6417333/" data-ref-id="1900-6417333">John Wick Hex</a> is being delisted later this week across PC and consoles.</p><p>Big Fan Games announced the news on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1405790/view/596280216846860675" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">John Wick Hex's Steam page</a>. The game is being delisted on July 17, but players who purchase it ahead of time will still be able to play their copies. Fans who own a physical copy of John Wick Hex will also continue to have access to this tactical action RPG.</p><p>The announcement didn't include a reason for the delisting, but it stands to reason that the John Wick rights may have simply run out for the title. John Wick Hex was originally published by Good Shepherd Entertainment, and it was released on PS4, Xbox One, PC, and Nintendo Switch. Good Shepherd's parent company, Devolver Digital, shifted the publishing rights for John Wick Hex to another one of its smaller companies, Big Fan Games, in 2024.</p><p>John Wick Hex is currently <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/john-wick-hex?irclickid=3NISJV1K-xycUhN0CIwuRwDlUksSc4S9QW9VXI0&amp;sharedid=&amp;irpid=1804712&amp;utm_source=impact&amp;utm_medium=paid&amp;utm_campaign=Fandom%20-%20Gamespot&amp;utm_content=1804712&amp;utm_term=Online%20Tracking%20Link&amp;irgwc=1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">available on Humble Bundle for only $4</a>.

            <p>Sony Santa Monica, the studio behind the God of War series, is working on a new game, but reportedly it won't be a new IP though "it might feel like one".</p>
<p>There's been plenty of speculation around what the studio may be working on next, in particular game director Cory Barlog. He was responsible for the God of War reboot in 2018, but on its sequel he was producer.</p>
<p>Now, Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier has addressed the speculation on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot46-back-to-the-beach.1172010/page-406#post-142670637">ResetEra</a>, calling Barlog's game "Sony Santa Monica's next big thing" and that "it was going well" at least a couple of months ago.</p>

<p>In a later response, Schreier added it won't be a new IP and it certainly won't be a sci-fi game.</p>
<p>"I'll put it this way: it’s not a new IP but it might feel like one," Schreier said. "Maybe that's why people are confused. Please don't ask me more questions about this - if I wind up reporting more information at any point in the future it'll be in an article, not on a forum. And that the sci-fi stuff (that people have apparently believed for years now?) is nonsense."</p>
<p>Rumours swirled in August last year that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-santa-monica-is-making-its-first-new-ip-in-over-20-years">Sony Santa Monica was developing its first new IP in over 20 years</a>.</p>
<p>It's unclear if the studio has multiple projects, or if indeed its next game will be part of an existing franchise. The obvious conclusion is a new game in the God of War series, likely with a new direction.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-santa-monicas-next-game-is-reportedly-not-a-new-ip-but-it-might-feel-like-one]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Though the DirectX 12 Work Graphs feature will be part of next-gen game development, it won't see massive adoption on PlayStation 6 and the next generation Xbox, especially in the cross-generation period.</p>



<p>Speaking on the NeoGAF forums, known AMD leaker Kepler L2 <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/playstation-6-sony-says-future-platforms-%E2%80%98top-of-mind%E2%80%99-exploring-%E2%80%98new-and-enhanced%E2%80%99-ways-to-play.1685298/post-270627665">commented</a> on the possibility of next-generation consoles having access to the DirectX 12 Work Graphs feature, which delivers better performance and improved scalbility across complex workloads including procedural generation, particle systems and AI logic, saying that while <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/playstation-6-sony-says-future-platforms-%E2%80%98top-of-mind%E2%80%99-exploring-%E2%80%98new-and-enhanced%E2%80%99-ways-to-play.1685298/post-270627867">hardware and API will be ready</a>, it is unlikely to see widespread adoption, as the engines and tools currently in use don't support this style of graphics programming. As such, it will be a while to see if the feature will bring significant performance improvements on consoles that go well beyond what we have already seen on PC<a href="https://wccftech.com/directx-12-work-graphs-performance-boost/"> shortly after its release.</a></p>



<p>Very little is currently known about next-generation systems from Sony and Microsoft, other than the fact that they are in the works. While rumors on the next Xbox are scarce, there's been considerably more unconfirmed information on the PlayStation 6, which is supposedly launching in two different editions - a home console and a portable system speculated to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/portable-playstation-6-more-powerful-xbox-series-s/">more powerful than the Xbox Series S </a>that will be able to <a href="https://wccftech.com/portable-playstation-6-ps5-games-patch/">run PlayStation 5 games natively</a>, although performance may not be great without developer intervention.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bithell Games and publisher Big Fan have announced that fast-paced tactical game&nbsp;<em>John Wick Hex&nbsp;</em>is being delisted from all storefronts in just a couple of days.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1405790/view/596280216846860675" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on Steam,&nbsp;<em>John Wick Hex&nbsp;</em>will be removed from digital storefronts on July 17th. That includes PC and consoles; as the two studios say, as of that date, "new purchases of&nbsp;<em>John Wick Hex&nbsp;</em>will not be possible, regardless of platform or storefront".</p>

<p>However, if you do already own the game, then you'll still be able to play it after that date. That includes both physical and digital copies, thankfully, so it's not completely disappearing.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/john-wick-hex-delisting-shooting.jpg?itok=WjI3_x27 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/john-wick-hex-delisting-shooting.jpg?itok=8kNE40Vo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>John Wick Hex&nbsp;</em>is being delisted this week.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>John Wick Hex</em>, it's a tactical strategy game created by&nbsp;<em>Thomas Was Alone&nbsp;</em>and <i>Subsurface Circular&nbsp;</i>developer Mike Bithell under his Bithell Games label.</p>

<p>Announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/john-wick-goes-tactical-on-epic-store-with-john-wick-hex" rel="nofollow">in May 2019</a> and released in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/john-wick-hex-launches-for-pc-on-october-8th-consoles-to-follow" rel="nofollow">October that same year</a>, the game takes place prior to the events of the popular&nbsp;<em>John Wick&nbsp;</em>movies. It sees the titular hitman descending into the underworld to rescue allies Winston and Charon from a new enemy calling himself Hex.</p>

<p>Gameplay-wise,&nbsp;<em>John Wick Hex&nbsp;</em>offers what Bithell calls "fight-choreographed chess brought to life as a video game", with the gameplay "capturing the series' signature gun fu style while expanding its story universe".</p>

<p>You can check out a trailer for&nbsp;<em>John Wick Hex</em>, which shows off the game's unique graphic novel art style and some of its tactical gameplay, right here.</p>




<p>Big Fan and Bithell Games didn't give any reason for the sudden delisting of&nbsp;<em>John Wick Hex</em>, but it's almost certainly got something to do with licensing rights, given that the game is based on an existing property.</p>

<p>If you do want to grab&nbsp;<em>John Wick Hex&nbsp;</em>before it's delisted, you can do so right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1405790/John_Wick_Hex/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1050-CUSA18381_00-JOHNWICKHPS4SIEA" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/john-wick-hex/9pb1c8s0922m" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/john-wick-hex-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> (as well as their current-gen successors via backwards compatibility).</p>
