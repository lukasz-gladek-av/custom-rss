One of which happens to be Nintendo's very own Shigeru Miyamoto, which former Rare designer and director Gregg Mayles revealed <a href="https://x.com/Ghoulyboy/status/1995198826211340653">on social media</a>.</p>
<p>Sharing a fax from the legendary game creator and director (thanks, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/12/former-rare-designer-reveals-what-shigeru-miyamoto-thought-of-banjo-kazooies-n64-sequel">Time Extension</a>!), Mayles says "Nice of him that compliment (in my mind anyway)" before explaining just what a fax is — to those youngsters online, of course.</p>
<p>The fax itself is a written notice of approval of the final rom of Banjo-Tooie, the sequel to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/banjo-kazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a>, with an additional note hand-written by Miyamoto in English which says "splendid game" with a little thumbs up and smiley face.</p><div><figure data-videoid="U-42JOukqJg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U-42JOukqJg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytU-42JOukqJg" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/U-42JOukqJg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U-42JOukqJg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4af2b0rphzom&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>It's a cute little piece of history, and the timing is pretty perfect too — the game just celebrated its 25th birthday a few weeks ago, and we too (read: this writer) have <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-banjo-tooie-is-pure-nightmare-fuel-and-i-wouldnt-have-it-any-other-way">fond memories of the follow-up</a>, which takes a bit of a darker, bigger turn.</p>
<p>Mayles left Rare earlier this year following a number of layoffs at Microsoft and the cancellation of Everwild. Back in October, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/banjo-kazooie-director-marks-departure-from-rare-with-a-poem">developer shared a poem on his final day at the studio</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's the holiday season once again, and what better way to spend time with family and friends than with a brand new <a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/beat-em-up" rel="nofollow">beat 'em up</a>?&nbsp;<em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em>'s got you covered. From <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/tribute-games" rel="nofollow">the team</a> that brought you the excellent&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/tmnt-shredders-revenge-review" rel="nofollow"><em>TMNT: Shredder's Revenge</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Marvel</em>'<em>s Cosmic Invasion</em>&nbsp;is a blast from start to finish, and it doesn't hurt that it also has a bunch of iconic characters we know and love.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-cosmic-invasion-roster.jpg?itok=QdrccdK3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-cosmic-invasion-roster.jpg?itok=Sd6w-fQ- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some characters you'll have to unlock by playing the campaign.</figcaption></figure><h2>Avengers, X-Men, and Others Too!</h2>

<p><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em>'s a beat 'em up, so you already sort of know what you're getting into. It's not the most complex genre ever, that's for sure, but it's usually one that provides a great deal of fun, especially with friends. As with any beat 'em up, my favorite part is the roster, and this game has it in spades.</p>

<p>What helps&nbsp;<em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em>&nbsp;stand apart from the pack is its cast of characters -- and it's a large one, for sure. 15 total characters to choose from makes the variety almost overwhelming, but it's exciting to see a bunch of iconic characters (and some more niche ones) make an appearance.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-cosmic-invasion-phyla-vell.jpg?itok=9ahtHidd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-cosmic-invasion-phyla-vell.jpg?itok=zmed1MLw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Phyla-Vell is cool as hell though!</figcaption></figure><p>You have fan favorites like Spider-Man, Iron Man, and Captain America, of course, but other not-so-obvious picks like She-Hulk (instead of Hulk), Cosmic Ghost Rider (instead of regular Ghost Rider, I guess?), and even Nova.</p>

<p>Admittedly, I'm not the biggest Marvel-head, but I enjoy the character designs and their powers, so forgive me for not knowing who the hell, uhhhh, Beta Ray Bill is? And Phyla-Vell? These fringe choices, at least from a casual Marvel fan's perspective, are intriguing and make the roster all the more intriguing.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-cosmic-invasion-combat.jpg?itok=h7u77tPi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-cosmic-invasion-combat.jpg?itok=FIOhwJKm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Fighting alien worms is just another day for the Avengers.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Many Moves of&nbsp;<em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em>'s Diverse Roster</h2>

<p>When you're ready to start the campaign or run through the classic-styled Arcade mode, you choose not one but&nbsp;<em>two</em>&nbsp;characters, which is another area where&nbsp;<em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion&nbsp;</em>stands out. In combat, you're able to switch between two characters tag-team style. You can even call the benched character in for assists during combat.</p>

<p>Developer Tribute Games does a fine job at keeping characters distinct from one another in not just looks but in terms of gameplay, and move-sets are&nbsp;<em>mostly</em>&nbsp;unique, though some characters share similarities with each other.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-cosmic-invasion-flight.jpg?itok=i_V3nKjF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-cosmic-invasion-flight.jpg?itok=uGywcV5n 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Oh yeah, CRT filter!</figcaption></figure><p>For example, some characters have the ability to fly and float around the stage -- I'd say roughly half the roster -- while the rest are grounded. Some characters can dodge, while others block. Blocking, by the way, seems way more useful than dodges since blocking at the right time can parry, so I wish dodges felt equally useful.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even still, when you consider the combination of teams with a roster of 15 different heroes, each run has the potential to be quite different since there are 105 combinations in total. Throw in some friends with their own choice of two characters, and the variety here is quite impressive.</p>

<p>Let's dive into some characters and how they play specifically, because that's the bread and butter of<em>&nbsp;</em>beat 'em ups. I often chose Captain America because, weirdly enough, he felt the closest to your traditional brawler-type character from most beat 'em ups.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-cosmic-invasion-captain-america.jpg?itok=NsgaxJ9D 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-cosmic-invasion-captain-america.jpg?itok=aA9LCkCo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Captain America is looking at him like "You call that a workout?"</figcaption></figure><p>Each character has a special ability, so Cap can throw his shield across the screen to hit enemies. His combos are really straightforward and punchy, and his rising attack opens up the ability for some good air combos.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then there's Wolverine, and he's an absolute monster. Tribute captured the feel of Wolverine to a tee with his fast-moving, vicious attacks and the ability to latch onto enemies and plunge his claws into them.</p>

<p>Some characters I didn't enjoy purely because they didn't fit my playstyle, but I still had fun with the entire cast. She-Hulk was a total surprise, since I expected a big, punchy character like her male counterpart. She-Hulk is actually a bona fide grappler, with short-ranged wrestling moves and a few grabs as her special moves that throw enemies around the stage.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-cosmic-invasion-worm-race.jpg?itok=KzuMnT23 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-cosmic-invasion-worm-race.jpg?itok=i7qp1iHX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Slug racing.</figcaption></figure><p>Interestingly, each character in&nbsp;<em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em>&nbsp;has a passive you gain as you level them up (like&nbsp;<em>Shredder</em>'<em>s Revenge</em>). These usually relate to a character thematically, so Wolverine uses his mutant healing powers to slowly regain health.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a character like Rocket Raccoon has a grenade ability that changes depending on RNG. He also has a very powerful nuke grenade. With his passive, defeating enemies in a combo increases the chances of the nuke grenade coming up, so it's a passive that rewards skill and keeping your combos up.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-cosmic-invasion-she-hulk-and-rocket.jpg?itok=CaccH1Dg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-cosmic-invasion-she-hulk-and-rocket.jpg?itok=ZOL196VW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>An unlikely duo.</figcaption></figure><h2>Tag Team Time</h2>

<p>At this point, I feel like I've only scraped the surface. Characters also have a charge attack, used by holding down the standard attack button. These come in the form of additional projectiles, parries, gap closers, and more. For example, Spider-Man pulls in enemies from afar with his web by charging, closing the gap without actually having to run across the screen.</p>

<p>Each character has a dash attack, and one interesting thing my co-op partner found with these is that they can be animation-cancelled. Beta Ray Bill can fly forward hammer-first, and this can be spammed to cause absolute chaos.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, each character also has a special that taps into a Focus gauge accrued while fighting. These are what you'd expect -- powerful, screen-clearing attacks that do big damage. Some feel better than others, though. Iron Man's special shoots across the screen and does big damage, while Rocket's, though powerful, requires you to be a bit closer to enemies.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-cosmic-invasion-tag-team.jpg?itok=NflOW-rG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-cosmic-invasion-tag-team.jpg?itok=6jS9Bcav 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Tagging in Nova for some support!</figcaption></figure><p>This is all for individual characters, but consider that you have to choose two heroes from the roster. As I said, there's a bit of a tag-team element in&nbsp;<em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em>, so you can switch between characters on the fly. Each has their own Focus bar, so you can use two specials simultaneously if you want.</p>

<p>Similarly, a character's health is their own, so even if one hero dies, you can use the other. The main advantage of this system is calling in your second hero to assist in combos. For example, you can have your benched hero use their special while you're mid-combo with the other.</p>

<p>The assist system is more than just pressing a button, as there are a few options in addition to the combo assist. You can launch an enemy into the air and swap to your other character -- this is called a Launcher Cosmic Swap. The assist system adds another layer to the gameplay that few other beat 'ups have, so it's great to see this here.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-cosmic-invasion-dinosuars.jpg?itok=Y_F6MjDV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-cosmic-invasion-dinosuars.jpg?itok=f3749AL4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Isn't this pterodactyl the dude that doesn't want to cure cancer, he just wants to turn people into dinosaurs?</figcaption></figure><h2>A Quest Across the Cosmos</h2>

<p>For now, let's set characters and their specifics aside. There's a whole campaign here, and each level offers up a different theme within the Marvel universe. New York, with references to Spider-Man and the Daily Bugle, is the first level we see. As things go on, levels take us to some pretty wild locales.</p>

<p>Wakanda, sure, that's in Africa, but nothing we haven't seen before. We're going to different realms like Valhalla and fighting across the stars. The story was a bit hard to follow as a casual fan, and having dialogue in the middle of gameplay doesn't help. Even still, it was cool to see what the next stage would be.</p>

<p>The sprite work for these stages is almost distractingly beautiful; seriously, Tribute's pixel artists are an impressive bunch. Still, I wish levels had more gimmicks or some hook to make them more exciting beyond looking pretty. Most gimmicks are just annoying hazards, lava geysers, or projectiles from afar.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-cosmic-invasion-avenger-ship-spiderman-and-venom.jpg?itok=O8x40ihL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-cosmic-invasion-avenger-ship-spiderman-and-venom.jpg?itok=4BwCR6OT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Venom and Spidey fighting side-by-side is a good time.</figcaption></figure><p>The stage featuring Valhalla is actually a super cool one I won't spoil, but beyond that, it didn't feel like stages had enough of a hook for them to stand out. Nonetheless, running through the campaign with a few friends is a blast.</p>

<p>Enemy variety is also adequate, and I don't have much to say about this other than that there's enough to make encounters feel varied. Likewise, bosses are fine. Some of them are way more memorable than others, and one boss in particular felt like a letdown considering they are one of the most feared villains in the entire Marvel universe.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, the last boss is one of the weakest in terms of design -- probably the least memorable, too. They're bulky and have a lot of health, but I expected them to have more abilities or&nbsp;<em>something</em>&nbsp;since they were, you know, the very last fight.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-cosmic-invasion-matrix.jpg?itok=OLviMNu0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-cosmic-invasion-matrix.jpg?itok=7_xIM7UH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Unlocking stuff on the matrix kind of reminds me of <em>Smash Bros Brawl'</em>s unlock grid.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Gripes aside, there are plenty of ways to replay&nbsp;<em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion.&nbsp;</em>I'm waiting for a good time to have friends together so we can play Arcade mode, which has a bunch of modifiers you can use to make things more difficult. As an example, you can play solo but fight the same amount of enemies four players would, double enemies' health, and much more.</p>

<p>There are also a handful of challenges to complete in the campaign, usually involving specific characters. These are usually quite simple, but it's another thing for completionists to tackle. Completing these allows you to unlock more nodes on the "Cosmic Matrix," which features new skins, lore entries, arcade mode modifiers, and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All-in-all,&nbsp;<em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion&nbsp;</em>is an exciting and enjoyable time. It throws in a few twists with the tag-team system and its large roster, and it looks amazing as well. It offers all that you'd want in a beat 'em up, and even if it isn't perfect, bring a few friends along for the ride, turn your brain off, and fight like heroes.&nbsp;</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Stranger Things Season 5 Made A Retro Gaming Mistake Most People Would Never Notice]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-ghosts-n-goblins-nes-arcade-error-2000649178</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>After nearly a decade, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-trailer-teaser-netflix-1851786407"><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i></a> <span>is in its fifth and final season, and the Netflix series about kids fighting evil monsters is still dripping with ‘80s nostalgia. This includes a scene where a kid is playing </span><i><span>Ghost ‘n Goblins</span></i><span>, the classic NES platformer from 1985, on his NES. To most, this scene probably didn’t raise any red flags, but for eagle-eyed retro fans, this is a pretty glaring error from </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>, whose whole shtick has been ‘80s references since the first season aired when Barack Obama was still president.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>While Derek Turnbow, a new character in season five, seems to be playing </span><i><span>Ghost ‘n Goblins </span></i><span>on an NES, the game that appears on his television is actually the arcade version. Retro-focused outlet </span><a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/11/random-did-you-spot-this-nes-related-blunder-in-stranger-things-season-5"><i><span>Time Extension</span></i></a><span> points out the details that reveal this, like the big black borders shown on the screen. On the console, these black bars were nowhere to be seen. The arcade version uses these bars to show text overlays with the player’s score. The console version, meanwhile, just puts this information on top of the gameplay.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The error is all the more baffling because the set dressing has everything </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>needs to just play the NES version. There’s an actual Nintendo Entertainment System plugged into a TV, with the original </span><i><span>Ghost ‘n Goblins </span></i><span>cartridge inside, and yet, someone at Netflix used footage of the arcade version in the final episode. Retro fans are feeling some type of way about it.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I wasn’t born during this decade and didn’t play it until years after I was born, […] but even I know what the game looks like on there,” PrivateLiker7625 </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StrangerThings/comments/1p9idys/how_the_heck_did_they_mess_up_something_as_simple/"><span>wrote on Reddit</span></a><span>. “Talk about an insult to the intelligence of those that grew up on this!”</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite devs revealed in a new post that the Chapter 7 launch featured 10.5 million players and over 3 million tuned in across livestream platforms. </p>



<p>Chapter 7 Season 1 for Fortnite is already live, introducing players to a brand new island where the battle bus has been destroyed, and players have been tasked to collect the missing parts. Before Chapter 7 launched, Fortnite held a Zero Hour event that brought swarms of players to the title. </p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-chapter-7-launch-had-over-3-million-players-tuned-in">Fortnite Chapter 7 Launch Had Over 3 Million Players Tuned In</h2>



<p>The announcement of the new player stats comes from Fortnite’s post on <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1994855116869116102" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter). The post states, “Absolute Cinema: 10.5M of you joined us in-game for Zero Hour, and 3M+ tuned in across livestream platforms!” Fortnite’s Chapter 6 Zero Hour event, bringing millions of players, wasn’t a surprise as it featured a jam-packed event filled with collaborations. We also saw the likes of Playboi Carti, Hatsune Miku, and more. The end also featured an Avengers: Endgame type of event, where so many past collabs of Fortnite returned.</p>



<p>For those wondering about the new chapter, Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 introduced a brand new map called Golden Coast. You have to reach this map by using Storm Surf, as the Battle Bus is out of commission. The update also introduced new gameplay features, including the addition of self-revive, drivable reboot vans, turning into bosses, and more. </p>



<p>In other news, Fortnite is reportedly looking to add a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-getting-gulag-mechanic-similar-to-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone-style Gulag mechanic</a>. Fortnite featured Quentin Tarantino’s ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-to-feature-quentin-tarantinos-dream-kill-bill-chapter-later-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dream’ Kill Bill chapter</a> last month.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>GTA 6 has the eyes of the world on it, from players to developers and publishers. It’s the biggest video game ever, and there’s no doubt about this. It’s been two years since Rockstar Games dropped a sacred piece of history on our laps with the GTA 6 reveal trailer, and no one’s been the same since.</p>



<p>The first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-gta-6-coming-out-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6</a> trailer debuted nearly two years to the day on December 5. Rockstar actually announced the trailer’s launch several days in advance, and it meant that everyone was locked in. We’re coming up to the trailer’s second anniversary, and it’s a moment of reflection on a long journey.</p>







<h2 id="h-gta-6-trailer-1-turns-2-in-december">GTA 6 Trailer 1 Turns 2 In December</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Our time will all come. Credit to Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>There’s every chance Rockstar Games was going to drop GTA 6’s first trailer without warning. However, a leak beforehand forced Rockstar’s hand, and the company revealed the first trailer’s date in advance.</p>







<p>Vice City has never looked better than it did in Trailer 1. We also got our first glimpse into the mysterious new characters of Lucia and Jason. Eventually, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-trailer-2-is-live-featuring-jason-and-lucia/">GTA Trailer 2</a> <em>was </em>shadow-dropped, but it’s been two years since the record-breaking first trailer, and it’s incredible how little has been shown from the full game since—such as any discernible, official gameplay footage (not the leaks). </p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-1-allegedly-becomes-number-one-youtube-trailer-of-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Auto 6 Trailer 1 allegedly became the number one YouTube trailer of all time</a>.</p>



<p>We continue to wait for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-trailer-3-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6 Trailer 3</a>, and it’s amazing how ravenous the community becomes when so much as a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-video-in-development-grand-theft-auto-rockstar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">short in-development video of GTA 6</a> appears online!</p>



<p>The latest GTA 6 delay means it’ll be close to three years since Trailer 1 was announced. If you fancy a quick reminder of what’s coming, or feel a mini-wave of nostalgia close to Christmas, check out Grand Theft Auto 6’s reveal trailer here.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Marvel Cosmic Invasion Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-cosmic-invasion-review</link>
            <guid>1369519</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Depending on who you talk to, beat ‘em ups are either repetitive, button-mashy coin munchers or a deceptively simple vehicle for absolute combat mastery. Me? I’m in the latter camp. But how do you get people who aren’t sickos like myself interested? How do you lure them into taking the first steps down Sicko Road? This year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/absolum-review"><u>Absolum</u></a> tried by merging a mechanically excellent beat ‘em up with a middling roguelite. Marvel Cosmic Invasion developer Tribute Games – the cats behind Shredder’s Revenge, the best TMNT game since Turtles in Time– takes a different approach. It looks to the Marvel vs. Capcom fighting games of old and asks one of the boldest questions I’ve seen a beat ‘em up pose in a New York minute: what if it was a tag game where you controlled multiple heroes? The answer, as it turns it, rules, even if the actual execution of Cosmic Invasion doesn’t quite live up to that concept.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ll be real with y’all; I’m not a Marvel guy. My dad’s into comics, and he got me into them, but DC was always his bag (he owns every Wonder Woman comic ever published, and no, that’s not an exaggeration), so I’m a DC kid at heart with a soft spot for indie comics. But I love the weirder parts of Marvel, especially the million conflicting X-men timelines and the cosmic stuff. It’s not the most popular thing Marvel publishes (that is and always will be Spider-Man, though X-men is no slouch), but it’s the most interesting. Give me that over the MCU stuff any day.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Marvel Cosmic Invasion Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If the title didn’t give it away, that’s what Marvel Cosmic Invasion is about. The story here is real simple, almost like it has been ripped straight from the pages of a multi-issue event series. Big Bad Annihilus’s Annihilation Wave (listen, it’s comic books, okay?) is sweeping the galaxy! All life hangs in the balance! So it’s up to a rag-tag assortment of Marvel heroes, whether Earthborn or cosmic in origin, to bring him down. That’s all you gotta know. And you know what? It works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A lot of it comes down to the team of 15 heroes that Tribute Games has assembled. Yeah, you’ve got the icons, the regulars who absolutely, positively accept-no-substitutes gotta be there. You know the ones: Storm, Wolverine, Spider-Man, Captain America. Then you’ve got cats that were B-listers before the movies elevated them to prominence: Black Panther, Iron Man, Rocket Raccoon, She-Hulk, Nova, Phoenix, Venom. And then there are the weird and wacky inclusions. Thor isn’t here; instead, you get Beta Ray Bill. Real ones know. How do you feel about Cosmic Ghost Rider? Then there’s my girl Phyla-Vell. Oh, and because this is cosmic Marvel, the Silver Surfer is also here, and he is <em>caked up</em>. To the Silver Surfer degenerate at Tribute Games: I see you, and I appreciate you.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Everyone looks stunning because the spritework is absolutely gorgeous.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But the reality is that everyone here looks stunning because the pixel art spritework is absolutely gorgeous. Whether it’s Phyla-Vell’s hair blowing gently in the wind, how Wolverine always looks like a coiled spring, or the subtle transformations that sometimes reveal Eddie Brock beneath the symbiote as Venom, Cosmic Invasion captures the essence of these characters, right down to their voices. Go ahead and watch one the videos on this page, tell me that doesn’t sound exactly like the way Wolverine or Storm or Iron Man sound in your head. True believers, the vibe is immaculate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Structurally, Cosmic Invasion is a pretty standard beat ‘em up. Not counting the tutorial, there are 15 stages, including old Marvel standbys like New York City, Wakanda, the Savage Land, and Genosha, as well as more exotic environs like Fort Galactus, each with a fun little sub-description (Genosha’s is Heavy Metal; the Savage Land’s is Rumble in the Jungle). Stage selection is mostly a straight line, but occasionally the path will split before reconverging and you’ll have to complete both branches before moving on. 
</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Levels themselves are good but unremarkable beat ‘em up fare with the occasional environmental hazard. There is a collectible to find to liven things up, as well as three challenges in each stage – two are hero specific, such as defeating a certain number of enemies with a certain character’s special attack, while the final one is related to the stage itself. All of this is good: the challenges encourage you to use new characters and learn the intricacies of each arena, and stages are well-designed, snappy (each one takes around 10-15 minutes), and visually distinct in cool ways – you’d never mistake Savage Lands for Klyntar or Genosha – but nothing here is going to redefine your expectations for what a beat ‘em up can be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What makes Cosmic Invasion special is its characters. Up to four people can play Cosmic Invasion at once, each controlling two characters, and it’s impressive how different each character is, even if they might not feel that way at first. Take Nova and Iron Man; sure, both of their unique attacks are ranged energy blasts, but Nova’s can pass through and hit multiple targets at once. Iron Man’s don’t. Nova’s special attack is an energy field that only hits foes at close range, while Iron Man’s giant, Marvel vs. Capcom 2-esque laser can hit anyone standing anywhere on-screen, but it does require you to line up your enemies and aim well.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Levels themselves are good but unremarkable beat ‘em up fare.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Rocket is a ranged powerhouse, but his charged heavy attack does massive damage, while Phyla-Vell’s, who is more melee focused, can stun – and no one else has anything like her sword, which she can throw and then teleport to in order to start combos and then keep them going across the screen. Beta Ray Bill and Cap can both throw their weapons, too, but Cap’s shield returns to him automatically; Bill’s will spin in place, potentially juggling anyone unlucky enough to come into contact with it until you manually call it back. Even She-Hulk and Wolverine, both up-close-and-personal bruisers, play differently. Logan is faster and all about chaining long stabby-stab combos together, while Jen is a powerhouse who focuses on short combos that launch her victims into the air for potential follow-ups. They both have grabs, but they operate in very different ways. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some characters have dodges, while others can block and parry if they time things right, opening up more defensive options. Characters that fly have a much easier time dealing with winged foes than those who don’t, and it’s easier for them to avoid stampedes. Everyone is a <em>little</em> different, and that can have a massive impact on how they play. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s really cool, though, are the tag team elements. You only actively control one character at a time, and you can summon your tag partner for various assists to keep laying on the hurt, opening up cool new offensive possibilities – that could be a launcher, a standard combo, their unique ability, their metered “I want these guys <em>dead</em>” special attack, and so on. Figuring out the best combinations and how movesets interact is a lot of fun, especially since you don’t start with everyone unlocked. It’s possible to lose a character mid-level (they have separate health bars), but even then, all isn’t lost. You continue on with your remaining hero, and if you stumble upon some floor food, a time-honored beat ‘em up tradition, they’ll come back with a little health.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Characters also level up as you use them, gaining more health, passive abilities, and so on, encouraging you to experiment, especially in co-op. I played the whole game with my wife (a single run through the campaign took three hours), and while I think Cosmic Invasion is a good time solo, like basically every beat ‘em up, it’s better with friends.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Will's Favorite Licensed Games</h3><p>A list of the best licensed games unfit to print.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If this beat ‘em up has any black eyes, it’s the lack of enemy variety. You’ll see the same core cast of baddies <em>a lot</em> in Cosmic Invasion, and while that’s not a huge problem (this happens in most beat ‘em ups), it can get a little old. It’s also hilariously obvious when you’re fighting a boss that will become a playable character later on because it <em>feels</em> like you’re fighting someone you’ll be able to play later. It can lead to some really funny moments, like when we were fighting the Silver Surfer on an elevator and kept knocking him into the abyss. Eventually, he’d levitate back up to us for more, only to get knocked down again. It wasn’t bad, but it was as goofy as Rob Liefeld-drawn feet or pouches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you get bored of beating on Annihilus’s minions, you can head to the Vault, where you can see each hero’s progress in the Hero Lab, learn about their history and the history of your foes in the Nova Corps Files, and listen to some of Cosmic Invasion’s excellent tracks. You can also spend Cosmic Cubes you earn to unlock nodes in the Cosmic Matrix for more color palettes, hero profiles, tunes, and Nova Corps Files. It’s a cool little system, and it even doubles as a neat way to make art if you unlock the right nodes in a way that forms a pattern. I made an adorable little bug, and I’ll miss him when I fill everything out and he’s gone.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">The stages themselves aren’t going to blow you away and I wish there was a more varied rogues’ gallery to smack down, but Marvel Cosmic Invasion’s tag team action has the juice, and it’s a joy to dig into each character’s kit, especially in co-op. I don’t think it’s a great beat ‘em up, but it is a very good one that I’m looking forward to playing again in the years to come, and it highlights some of the more obscure (and fun) parts of Marvel’s history. If you’re not already into the genre, I doubt Cosmic Invasion will change your mind, but it’s good enough to get my Avengers assembled on a lazy Sunday, kick back, and pop some baddies in the mouth.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-cosmic-invasion-review]]></content:encoded>

Abrak said that any talk of a Hitman 4 announcement will have to wait until Hitman co-op arrives in World of Assassination, which continues to enjoy support via DLC from the studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So of course there will be more Hitman,” Abrak said. “But right now, I think we need to get to the other side of this year and next year you’ll get more news about Hitman co-op, because I think co-op is a really, really good extension to the universe, and will introduce very interesting mechanics and combinations in World of Assassination. But we will, after that, be talking about the next Hitman — because, of course, there’s going to be a next Hitman.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Hitman franchise kicked off in 2000 with Hitman: Codename 47. Hitman 2: Silent Assassin followed in 2002. Hitman: Blood Money came out in 2006, and served as the third game in the original Hitman trilogy. Hitman: Absolution followed in 2012, before Hitman, which acted as the first installment of the World of Assassination trilogy, came out in 2016. Hitman 2 followed in 2018, then Hitman 3 in 2021.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IOI has three main productions right now: ongoing work on Hitman: World of Assassination, 007 First Light, and a new fantasy IP appropriately codenamed Project Fantasy. “It’s not announced yet, exactly what it is, but it’s a multiplayer fantasy project, which is extremely ambitious and really cool and is something else than a gun in a suit,” Abrak teased. “So that’s also good to have something new within the creative outlook here.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Will Hitman 4 have to wait until all three projects are wrapped up? Abrak didn’t say, but you can see why the studio would want to return to the franchise with a brand new sequel: overall, Hitman has had more than 85 million players and over 25 million copies sold.

Naturally, the exploit quickly became popular--and frustrating for players who didn't use it--leading Embark Studios to apply a "hot" fix to this part of the game. If you now decide to cheese your way into one of these treasure rooms, you can now expect a toasty reception inside.</p><p>Using a keycard to access one of these rooms ties into the high-risk, high-reward nature of Arc Raiders, but the exploit essentially bypasses it.

This meant that players who unlocked the room properly would find it stripped bare, leading to frustration within the Arc Raiders community.</p><p>To remedy this, Embark Studios made it so that the rooms automatically activate flamethrowers when you glitch into them. Players quickly found out that they would be caught inside this deathtrap, while other players with keycards would discover a room full of loot and a freshly cremated adventurer.</p><p>Arc Raiders has been a big hit since launch, selling millions of copies and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-hits-480000-active-players-on-steam-quadruple-cods-launch-weekend-peak/1100-6536262/">hitting a peak player count of 481,966 raiders on Steam</a>. Embark Studios has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-most-op-perk-just-got-nerfed/1100-6536194/">regularly updated Arc Raiders</a>, fine-tuning the gameplay and nerfing overpowered perks.</p><p>"Arc Raiders is an extraction shooter unlike any other, a totally unpredictable, immersive, thrilling story generator directed by the community," Mark Delaney wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/arc-raiders-review-us-against-the-world/1900-6418435/">Arc Raiders review</a>.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The test is to gather feedback on "combat improvements" like footstep audio updates that improve distance perception surface definition, and enemy audibility. Network and hit registration changes are also being tested that should result in "more consistent interactions and better responsiveness during close-quarters and higher-intestiy combat. Battlefield Studios also notes that there will be "broader adjustments across key combat systems."</p><p dir="ltr">The test will be PC only, and is accessible either through the EA app or Steam. Like previous Battlefield Labs tests, players will need to <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/battlefield/battlefield-labs" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sign up</a> for the program beforehand and sign a non-disclosure agreement to participate.</p><p dir="ltr">While this latest test is short and sweet, developer Battlefield Studios added there will be more "quick, short-notice sessions" in the future to gain "rapid insights on focused gameplay changes," as well as bigger playtests that will focus on specific new features or content ahead of their final release.</p><p dir="ltr">"In the months ahead, we'll use Battlefield Labs to look at a broader range of early concepts and experimental scenarios that benefit from real player insight," Battlefield Studios stated. "Beyond that, we are preparing future Lab sessions that explore changes to map layouts, pacing, and alternative team compositions such as smaller player counts or vehicle-focused setups."</p><p dir="ltr">Battlefield 6 has been a big success for EA, immediately becoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/" data-ref-id="2900-6281">2025's best-selling game in the US</a> by dollar sales and in franchise history.

                <p>It looks like Fortnite will borrow a feature from one of its competing battle royales, should recently surfaced leaks prove to be accurate. According to prominent Fortnite leaker Shiina, the Epic Games title is adding something very similar to the Gulag from Call of Duty: Warzone.</p><p>This feature is purportedly called "Restarter Island," and it'll have eliminated players compete in a random 1v1 minigames, with winners respawning back into battle royale matches. One of these minigames is a simple duel, similar to the Gulag system in Warzone, with another described as a best-out-of-three Rock, Paper, Scissors showdown.</p><p>Fellow Fortnite leaker Blortzen adds that other Restarter Island minigames include a "Shockwave Deathmatch," in which players have to use shockwave grenades to knock each other off, and sprint races between players, with one variation adding deadly baseball bats for competitors to use against each other.</p><p>Blortzen emphasizes that these leaked maps are in a "really really REALLY early state," <a href="https://x.com/blortzen/status/1995200912252621021" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">speculating in an X post</a> that Restarter Island is either an upcoming addition to Fortnite or one that has been scrapped entirely. Shiina, conversely, seems confident enough to <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1994896784154661265" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">say that the mode is "COMING SOON."</a></p><p>This wouldn't be the first time the battle royale game has taken notes from one of its competitors--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-reboot-vans-will-be-very-familiar-to-ape/1100-6466155/" data-ref-id="1100-6466155">Fortnite added a respawn system</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-just-copied-apex-legends-ping-system/1100-6465276/" data-ref-id="1100-6465276">pinging</a> shortly after the release of Apex Legends, which innovated on the genre with those features. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-reload-mode-is-live-exclusive-loot-available-for-those-who-like-a-challenge/1100-6524461/" data-ref-id="1100-6524461">Fortnite Reload is also very similar</a> to Warzone's own Resurgence mode.</p><p>In other Fortnite news, the Hollywood-themed first season of Chapter 7 is now underway, reportedly attracting a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-chapter-7-launch-reportedly-propelled-the-game-to-3-million-concurrent-players/1100-6536598/" data-ref-id="1100-6536598">concurrent player count of around 3 million</a>, but also receiving <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/players-think-theyve-found-ai-use-in-fortnite-chapter-7-but-artist-shows-its-not-cut-and-dried/1100-6536597/" data-ref-id="1100-6536597">accusations of using generative AI art</a>.</p>

            <p>Monkey Island creator Ron Gilbert has called time on his previously teased but largely under the radar RPG.</p>
<p>Back in May of last year, I first caught wind of the developer's 2D pixel art RPG, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monkey-island-creator-ron-gilbert-has-a-2d-pixel-art-game-in-the-works">which he described as "classic Zelda meets Diablo meets Thimbleweed Park"</a>. Screenshots shared at this time showed a town, which was said to have both a bakery and a weapon shop. As Gilbert noted, these two establishments would really set players up with "all [they'll] need before setting out on a day of questing".</p>
<p>However, it seems that we will be unable to set out for a day of pixelated questing, as in a new interview, Gilbert has revealed he is no longer working on his Zelda-like RPG due to a lack of funding support from publishers.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>"I just [didn't] have the money or the time to build a big open-world game like that," Gilbert explained to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/12/after-40-years-of-adventure-games-ron-gilbert-pivots-to-outrunning-death/">ArsTechnica</a>. "You know, it's either a passion project you spent 10 years on, or you just need a bunch of money to be able to hire people and resources."</p><p>Gilbert added securing that "bunch of money" to help realise his vision was no easy task, as "the deals that publishers were offering were just horrible". He also believed the genre he was working with did not play into his favour.</p>
<p>"Doing a pixelated old-school Zelda thing isn't the big, hot item, so publishers look at us, and they didn't look at it as 'we're gonna make $100m and it's worth investing in'," the Monkey Island creator said. "The amount of money they're willing to put up and the deals they were offering just made absolutely no sense to me to go do this."</p>
<p>Gilbert previously turned to crowdfunding for his previous release <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/thimbleweed-park">Thimbleweed Park</a>, but even this route isn't as straightforward as it may have been in the past, with the game creator suggesting: "Kickstarter is basically dead these days as a way of funding games."</p>
<p>Today's big-name publishers "are very analytics-driven," Gilbert furthered. "The big companies, it's like they just have formulas that they apply to games to try to figure out how much money they could make, and I think that just in the end you end up giving a whole lot of games that look exactly the same as last year's games, because that makes some money."</p><p>This is different from the start of his career, Gilbert continued. "When we were starting out, we couldn't do that because we didn't know what made this money, so it was, yeah, it was a lot more experimenting," he said. "I think that's why I really enjoy the indie game market because it's kind of free of a lot of that stuff that big publishers bring to it, and there's a lot more creativity and you know, strangeness, and bizarreness."</p>
<p>Some of the artwork from Gilbert's now cancelled RPG has found a new lease of life, however, and features in the creator's newest game, Death by Scrolling.</p>
<p>Death by Scrolling is described as a "rogue-like vertically scrolling RPG", with the ultimate goal being to race upward through endless levels in order to amass enough money to pay the Ferryman and escape Purgatory. To do this, players will need to battle enemies, swipe gems and power ups, complete quests and more while outsmarting the ever-pursuing Grim Reaper. You can check out a trailer for Death by Scrolling below.</p>

<p>Closing the interview, Gilbert looked back at his career as a game creator, noting it is a very different world now than it was 40 years ago.</p>
<p>"Back then, there were a handful of print magazines, and there were a bunch of reporters, and you had sent out press releases... That's just not the way it works today," he said, adding the rise in content from not just streamers but developers on the likes of YouTube requires a person to be good on camera.</p><p>"The [developers] that are successful are not necessarily the good ones, but the good ones that also present well on YouTube," he said. "And you know, I think that's kind of a problem, that's a gate now... In some ways, I think it's too bad because as a developer, you have to be a performer. And I'm not a performer, right?</p>
<p>"If I was making movies, I would be a director, not an actor."</p>

<p>Back in 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/return-to-monkey-island">Gilbert along with co-writer Dave Grossman released Return to Monkey Island</a>. It was a project many thought would never happen, but which had actually been in secret development for two years before its April Fool's Day announcement that same year.</p>

            <p>
If a CEO says their company is going to do that something sounds ridiculously unrealistic, or borderline unachievable if you actually take a second to think about it, you can probably assume that this is for the ears of shareholders. With that said, CD Projekt Red recently held a <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/11/transcript-q3-2025-earnings-3.pdf">financial call</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekt-still-plans-to-launch-all-3-games-in-the-new-ciri-fronted-the-witcher-trilogy-within-a-6-year-period">IGN</a>), where co-CEO Michał Nowakowski made some comments about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>… and The Witcher 5 and 6, all of which are apparently planned to be released within a six-year period. Right!
</p>
<p>
To dig a touch more into that, Nowakowski specifically frame it this way: "[CD Projekt Red have] been using UE5 for The Witcher 4 for almost four years now, and we’re very happy with what we’ve achieved… and we’re happy with how the engine is evolving through the Epic team’s efforts, and how we are learning how to make it work within a huge open-world game, as TW4 is meant to be."
</p>
<p>
He goes on to note that he believes further games should be released in quicker succession than in recent years (The Witcher 3 turned 10 this year after all, and even <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> is already five years old). And, as the developer has apparently claimed before, their "plan still is to launch the whole trilogy within a six-year period, so yes, that would mean we would plan to have a shorter development time between TW4 and TW5, between TW5 and TW6 and so on."
</p>
<p>
I think it should be made quite clear that the intention to do something like this is very different from the practical reality of doing this. Insomniac Games admittedly achieved that with its Spider-Man games, but all three of them are set in the same map, and Miles Morales was much shorter than the other two, too. If The Witcher 5 and 6 were to do something similar, perhaps it'd be a different story, but with as big as CD Projekt games are, you should be taking this with several pinches of salt.
</p>
<p>
Both The Witcher 4 and Cyberpunk 2 seem to be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cd-projekts-mysterious-project-hadar-is-now-their-research-focus-as-cyberpunk-2-and-witcher-4-gather-steam">chugging along well enough</a>, but they're both obviously still years out, so, we'll see how CD Projekt's plans develop.

              <p>Didn’t get a chance to grab a solid tablet during Black Friday? Don’t worry. Cyber Monday is here, slashing prices across all popular categories, and offering one last chance to save massively before the holiday season begins.</p>
<p>We’ve been spotting tons of great options going for less, and if you’re after something that covers all the basics while staying under the $100 mark, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6135/">the Lenovo Tab One is an excellent option to consider. It’s now sitting at just $90, after a nice 25% discount, and there are no delivery charges to worry about either.</a> It’s not every day you get to grab an impressive screen while also saving on shipping, so get your orders in sooner rather than later. The tablet is going to be pushed back to its retail price of $120 at midnight, which is why it’s best to act fast.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6135/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Bright Visuals, Even Better Sound</h2>
<p>We won’t label it as a massive tablet. You’re getting a modest 8.7-inch display, which isn’t overwhelmingly large; just enough for a comfortable viewing experience on the go. The display pushes vibrant visuals, while the 480 nits of brightness ensure exceptional visibility in all lighting conditions. Of course, visuals alone aren’t enough for an immersive streaming experience, which is why Lenovo packs the tablet with dual Dolby Atmos speakers for bold, rich audio. Translation? Brighter content, paired with an even better sound that brings your favorite content to life.</p>
<p>Performance is taken care of by the MediaTek Helio G85 processor, plus a 60Hz refresh rate, both of which come together to ensure a smooth, lag-free experience. You won’t exactly be able to multitask on this tablet, but it holds up well for casual use like browsing, streaming, video calls, etc. In fact, it’s a great option for kids, too. Google Kids Space support lets you introduce your little ones to teacher-approved content based on their interests. Subscribe to YouTube Kids, and you’ll have instant access to thousands of age-appropriate videos and hundreds of books, all ad-free.</p>



<p>Storing all the media content and programs you want won’t be an issue, thanks to the massive 64GB of storage, which is quite rare to find in this price range. If you’re purchasing it for your kids, you can pre-install a bunch of kid-friendly apps and games to keep them entertained for hours. There’s an included folio case to protect your tablet from the inevitable daily wear and tear. The built-in stand lets you prop it up wherever you like, however you prefer it. Place it on your workstation, a cafe, or even your bed for some late-night streaming sessions. As for the battery, a single charge gets you around 12.5 hours of unplugged YouTube streaming. It’s also designed to recharge faster than previous models, so it should be back at it in no time when running low. And since the tablet is compact, you don’t have to get a dedicated bag to carry it. Just toss it in your purse or backpack, and you’re good to go.</p>
<p>To wrap it up, this tablet isn’t a powerhouse. It’s made to do all the basic tasks, and it does those well. We especially recommend it for kids/teenagers wanting to have their own device. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6135/">The current deal brings it down to just $90, which is pretty cheap for a tablet from a known brand.</a> It’s also one of the lowest we have seen it drop to in a long while, but the offer ends soon. Grab yours before it’s too late.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-devs-tease-new-update-for-5th-anniversary/</link>
            <guid>1369477</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 developers have made a very cryptic post that teases a new update for December 2025, which also falls during the game’s fifth anniversary. </p>



<p>Recently, CD Projekt Red provided us with some information on how they are laying the foundation for Cyberpunk 2, with plans to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cd-projekt-red-adds-50-new-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increase the dev team</a> for the game by a tremendous amount by 2027. However, right now we are looking at the original title, Cyberpunk 2077, which seems to be getting more content 5 years after release. </p>



<h2 id="h-could-cyberpunk-2077-get-update-2-4-in-december-2025">Could Cyberpunk 2077 Get Update 2.4 in December 2025?</h2>



<p>No concrete details were revealed about Cyberpunk 2077’s new update in their latest post on <a href="https://x.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1995500633277755416" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter); however, they did mention some dates in cryptic messages for players to look out for. The new post includes the words “SECURE COMMS CHANNEL ESTABLISHED. STANDBY FOR INCOMING PRIORITY TRANSMISSION…” The post also includes an image of a calendar that lists Cyberpunk 2077 for December 10, Solomon Reed for December 12, and Songbird for December 29. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>SECURE COMMS CHANNEL ESTABLISHED. <br>STANDBY FOR INCOMING PRIORITY TRANSMISSION…</p><p>CYBERPUNK 2077 — 10.12</p><p>REED, SOLOMON — 12.12</p><p>SONG, SO MI — 29.12</p><p>END OF TRANSMISSION. <a href="https://t.co/3PcagdOjlt">pic.twitter.com/3PcagdOjlt</a></p></div>— Cyberpunk 2077 (@CyberpunkGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1995500633277755416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>There are no other details in the post, and all players can do right now is wait for these dates to find out for sure what the Cyberpunk 2077 devs are cooking up. The game’s fifth anniversary arrives on December 10, 2025, so there’s a chance we’ll learn more on or before that date. Many players have been anticipating the announcement of update 2.4 for Cyberpunk 2077, which might introduce new features and content, and there’s a chance this is it. </p>



<p>In other news, Cyberpunk 2077 recently reached a huge new sales milestone, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-hits-new-sales-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surpassing 35 million copies sold</a>. Additionally, Cyberpunk 2 could feature <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2-could-feature-online-multiplayer-new-job-listing-suggests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">online multiplayer</a> according to a new job listing.

                <p>Konami appears to be a little undecided on what to make next now that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater/" data-ref-id="5000-589435">Metal Gear Solid Delta</a> is out on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. Another remake isn't totally out of the realm of possibility, and neither is something wholly brand new, but series producer Noriaki Okamura said that if Konami were to do another remake, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-solid-4-guns-of-the-patriots/" data-ref-id="5000-23469">Metal Gear Solid 4</a> would be a "pretty hard" one to do.</p><p>Speaking to the Japanese website <a href="https://realsound.jp/tech/2025/11/post-2232566.html#google_vignette" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Real Sound</a> (and machine translated by both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-series-producer-remakes-metal-gear-solid-4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a> and <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/metal-gears-producer-says-hes-undecided-on-future-remakes-mgs4-would-be-real-challenge/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>), Okamura said that, while he'd love to build on the momentum that the Metal Gear Solid 3 remake gave him and Konami, the team is still at the decision-making stage about what comes next.</p><p>He expressed that another remake is possible, but so too is something entirely new. After all, with Metal Gear Solid alone, Konami has a rich history to pull from.</p><p>Okamura continued, saying that because much of the original Metal Gear Solid staff no longer works at Konami, the team isn't going to just apply the same coat of paint MGSD got to every remake it develops in the possible future. He was then asked about that future and if a Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots remake was something the team would consider pursuing. It's not a no, but Okamura said it wouldn't be an easy task, particularly because of the unusual designs required to get the 3D performance at the time. Modernizing those assets would be difficult, he concluded.</p><p>Snake Eater and Guns of the Patriots were released just four years apart, but they're actually 50 years from each other in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-games-in-order" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the franchise's official chronological order</a>. If Konami were to consider remaking the series in the order its story goes, then the next game would be 2006's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-solid-portable-ops/" data-ref-id="5000-26743">Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops</a> for the PSP. (Though I'd personally love to see a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-rising-revengeance/" data-ref-id="5000-43546">Revengeance</a> remake/remaster.)</p><p>Metal Gear Solid Delta is out now for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. We awarded it 9/10 in our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-review-youre-pretty-good/1900-6418396/" data-ref-id="1900-6418396">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater review</a>, saying it "successfully modernizes visuals, tweaks game design, and updates controls so that the game sits comfortably alongside its action game contemporaries."</p><p>.</p>

A large voting jury made up of game critics and media decides 90% of the results. The remaining 10% comes from fan votes, so while that doesn't decide everything, your votes can still make a difference when the results are announced live on December 11. What's more, the first round of Players' Voice nominees have been revealed. These are picked exclusively by the general public.</p><p>People can vote on The Game Awards website, and fans in China can vote on Bilibili. Voting stays open until December 10, at 6 PM PT / 9 PM ET. Anyone <a href="https://thegameawards.com/nominees/game-of-the-year" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">who signs up</a> can vote in all 29 award categories, including Game of the Year.</p><p>On the official The Game Awards website, the organization outlines why the primary award categories are not 100% chosen by the general public.</p><p>"Creating a 100% fan vote presents several challenges. First, given that some games are exclusive to one platform, a public vote puts single-platform games at an inherent disadvantage over multi-platform titles," the organization says <a href="https://thegameawards.com/faq" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on its website</a>. "In addition, it is important that winners cannot be 'socially engineered' in any way. We find that a blended vote is the most credible and authentic way to select winners."</p><p>This year's event will celebrate many major games. The Game of the Year nominees are Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, Donkey Kong Bananza, Hades II, Hollow Knight: Silksong, and Kingdom Come: Deliverance II. Expedition 33 leads with 12 nominations--the most in The Game Awards history--followed by Death Stranding 2 and Ghost of Yotei with seven each. Hades II earned six nominations, Hollow Knight has five, and Split Fiction has four.</p>

            <p>Sega and Creative Assembly have announced a 25th anniversary celebratory livestream will take place later this week for Total War, in which new projects will be revealed to the masses for the first time.</p>
<p>According to the official release announcing the event, fans on Thursday 4th December, will be able to see exciting new stuff across "historical and fantasy Total War, offering a first look at what's been in development behind the scenes." So this is something absolutely worth tuning into.</p>
<p>The event will be going live on the official Total War YouTube and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> channels. In terms of timing, you'll want to be present at <strong>8am PST / 11am EST / 4pm GMT / 5pm CET</strong>. There's no word on how long it'll be running for, but we do know it'll be co-streamed, so maybe one of your favourite streamers will be checking it out live.</p>

<p>Now, what could these new projects be? Well, there are some games rumoured to be cooking away over at Creative Assembly. For one, reports last year stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/total-war-star-wars-reportedly-in-development-at-creative-assembly">a Star Wars game was in development</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/future-creative-assembly-games-may-require-blood-thematically-which-sure-sounds-like-a-total-war-warhammer-40000-teaser">there is some evidence pointing towards a Warhammer 40k title</a> too. We just don't know for sure, all the more reason to check into the livestream on Thursday.</p><p>One thing is for certain: Creative Assembly is sorely in need of a win. Its last big Total War release was not well received, with the company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/creative-assembly-apologises-for-missteps-with-total-war-series-offers-pharaoh-refunds">offering refunds to those who bought Total War: Pharaohs</a>. It had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/total-war-developer-creative-assembly-refocusing-on-strategy-games-after-hyenas-failure">Hyenas cancelled, causing the studio to refocus back to strategy games</a>. Not only that, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-layoffs-hit-240-staff-including-at-total-war-studio-creative-assembly">the company also suffered layoffs last year</a>.</p>
<p>That being said, Creative Assembly has a history of releasing fantastic strategy games, so here's hoping the devs there can show the world why they remain, frankly, one of the genre greats.</p>

<p>Is that looking... less tarnished?</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>We might have to wait a little while longer than expected until we can see <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition</a> in its full glory on Switch 2, but the title is still popping up at games expos around the world, giving us plenty of opportunities to see it in action.</p>
<p>The latest slice of hands-on time came from the Milan Games Week 2025, where '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Coreydaflame">Corey Da Flame</a>' captured the over-the-shoulder footage found above (thanks, <a href="https://www.nintenderos.com/nintendo-switch-2/nuevo-gameplay-de-elden-ring-en-nintendo-switch-2-muestra-mejoras-en-el-rendimiento/">Nintenderos</a>). It's the same opening section that we have seen played on Switch 2 a couple of times now, and off-screen recording is never the <em>best</em> way to get an idea of things from a performance perspective, but things seem... less tarnished than we were expecting.</p>
<p>Okay, it's no PS5 build, but as far as talk of the Switch 2 version goes, it looks pretty darn fine. Our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/video-uh-oh-elden-ring-on-switch-2-has-issues-in-handheld-mode">initial impressions of the game in handheld</a> were rather rough, and while things certainly seemed to be a step in the right direction when getting our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/first-footage-of-elden-ring-running-on-switch-2-appears-online">first look at the game in docked</a>, the latest footage suggests that things are getting better still.</p>
<p>Again, we won't know for sure until the full game comes our way at some point next year — and we don't <em>only</em> have over-the-shoulder footage to go off. At the time of writing, Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition is still hanging with a vague '2026' release window after FromSoftware decided to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/elden-ring-delayed-on-switch-2-to-allow-time-for-performance-adjustments">delay</a> the port back in October.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Styx: Blades of Greed Delayed Out of 2025, Now Set to Arrive In February 2026]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Fans of the stealth series Styx will have to wait a little longer for the titular goblin to return. After it was initially set to arrive sometime in 2025, developer Cyanide Studio and publisher Nacon have confirmed that the game has been delayed, and will no longer make its 2025 release window. The silver lining in all of this is that while we know it won't be out this year, we do have a release date for next year, as Styx: Blades of Greed is set to arrive on February 19, 2026.</p>



<p>A release date trailer accompanied a post on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3290690/view/529864539779367425?l=english">game's Steam page announcing the delay</a>, which also includes a snide comment from Styx, where he says, "<em>What? I'm not late, I just like making you wait."</em></p>



<p>The post on the game's Steam page includes a similar tone, with Cyanide Studio - speaking in character as Styx -  writing, "<em>Yeah, yeah, I know, waiting isn’t your favorite thing. Mine either. </em><em>(Unless I’m waiting in the dark to stab someone, of course)</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>The devs are taking a few extra months to polish everything up, tweak the bits that need tweaking, and make sure my grand return is as glorious </em><em>(and chaotic)</em> as it deserves to be. <em>A much more sharper adventure. One worthy of slipping back into my slightly grimy, perfectly stylish boots.</em>"</p>

</p></figure>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/styx-blades-of-greed-gamescom-hands-on-preview-not-for-the-faint-of-heart/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo got the chance to preview</a> Styx: Blades of Greed during Gamescom 2025. Though its hardcore approach to stealth might not be for everyone, it still presents as an interesting game that will likely please fans of the originals. "<em>Though a little complex at times, the Styx: Blades of Greed Gamescom demo did an excellent job showcasing how the third entry in the series will elevate the franchise to new heights. With the abilities and tools on show being so diverse and versatile, I'm really interested to see what else the game will offer when it launches this Fall on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</em>"</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see how fans of the original games and newcomers to the series take to it when it arrives on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on February 19, 2026.</p>

Getting stabbed in the back always feels unnecessarily mean <i>and</i> there’s no direct way to get some revenge, as the odds of you running into and recognizing the same person in a future game are pretty low.</p> <p>But a new community resource hopes to change that.</p> <p>Enter <a href="https://speranzabounties.com/">Speranza Bounties</a>, a fan-made site that does just what you think it does: publicly tracks troublesome rats up to no good out there in the Rust Belt (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/arc-raiders-bounty-hunting-fansite/">h/t <i>Polygon</i></a>). Not only can you check to see what active bounties are on deserving players, which includes information such as what bad deeds they committed (extraction camping, lying, bait and switches, etc), but you can also post your own. All you need is a player’s Embark ID, which you can find by looking at who killed you in the post-game carnage report.</p>

 <p>Speranza Bounties keeps track of all bounties for 30 days, after which they expire. So if you find yourself on this naughty list, just lay low for about a month. The site also awards you with titles for taking down a player with an active bounty.</p>

 <h2>PvP could use a little extra love in <i>Arc Raiders</i></h2> <p>I’ll gladly get sent back to Speranza on this hill: PvP belongs in <i>Arc Raiders</i>. We don’t need exclusive PvP modes or maps or a PvE mode.</p> <p>That said, every time I get downed by another player, damn do I wish there was someway to exact revenge. While it’s a neat social experiment to wrestle with that impulse, I think tools like Speranza Bounties (as well as the fictional Speranza Watchlist) show that some added social elements to PvP, such as a bounty system or user-facing behavior report system that isn’t strictly punitive could add more ways to interact with the PvP element of this otherwise fantastic game.</p> <p>And no. I do not have a bounty on my head.</p> <p>…yet.</p>

              <p>Good morning! I hope you enjoyed a lot of turkey. I did. I celebrated two Thanksgivings. Double the fun, double the calories. Anyway, welcome back from holiday break, and let’s get right into Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of gaming news and other stuff you might care about. And please, nobody mention turkey. I’m done with it until next year.</p> <h2>There Will Be Another <em>Hitman</em> Game, Says IOI</h2> <p>IO Interactive is currently wrapping up <em>007: First Light,</em> which is set to launch in March of next year. While some are excited, there are plenty of <em>Hitman</em> fans who are worried that perhaps Agent 47 and his deadly franchise have entered extended retirement. That’s not the case.</p>

 <p>“So of course there will be more <em>Hitman</em>,” <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/hitman-eminem-slim-shady-mission-io-interactive-ceo-interview-1236595901/">IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak told <em>Variety</em>.</a> “But right now, I think we need to get to the other side of this year and next year you’ll get more news about <em>Hitman</em> co-op, because I think co-op is a really, really good extension to the universe, and will introduce very interesting mechanics and combinations in <em>World of Assassination.</em> But we will, after that, be talking about the next <em>Hitman</em> — because, of course, there’s going to be a next <em>Hitman</em>.”</p>

 <h2><em>Zootopia 2</em> had one of the best opening weekends ever</h2> <p><em>Zootopia 2</em> hit theaters over the holiday weekend, and it broke a whole bunch of records on its way to earning an impressive $556 million. <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/zootopia-2-box-office-records-1236631348/">As reported by <em>Deadline</em></a>, Disney’s new animated sequel had the largest opening for an animated movie in history, was the fourth-biggest opening in movie history ever, and now also holds the record as Disney’s biggest animated movie opening. And that’s just <em>some</em> of the records it smashed.</p>

 <h2>A bunch of Xbox games are nominated for PlayStation Game of the Year awards</h2> <p>On Monday, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/01/ps-blog-game-of-the-year-awards-2025-polls-are-now-live/">Sony announced</a> that fan voting for this 2025’s PlayStation Blog Game of the Year Awards was now open. And if you peruse the categories, you’ll notice that an awful lot of games are from studios or publishers owned by Xbox, including <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, The Outer Worlds 2,</em> and <em>Forza Horizon.</em> In fact, four of the games nominated for the blog’s top honors, Best PS5 game of 2025, are from Xbox-owned studios. Video games in 2025 are so weird now, y’all.</p>

 <h2>Oops, some <em>GTA 6</em> animations have leaked</h2> <p>A demo reel containing what appears to be <a href="https://x.com/GTAVI_Countdown/status/1995234091856478416"><em>GTA 6</em> animations</a> was uploaded by an animator who worked on the highly anticipated open-world game. Fans quickly spotted the animations and started sharing them online. Of course, the video has since been deleted, but that hasn’t stopped the animations from spreading on social media and Reddit.</p> <p>The clips show a man loading an electric bike into a bike rack and a woman jumping out of a pickup truck. Not the most exciting stuff, but fans who have been waiting for over a decade for<em> GTA 6</em> will take anything they can get their hands on between now and the game’s launch on November 19, 2026.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-perfect-thanksgiving-plate-2000648127">What’s the perfect Thanksgiving plate?&nbsp;</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/indie-games-pc-steam-wishlist-black-friday-thanksgaming-2000648371">Here are some good indie games!</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/2025-best-games-monster-hunter-split-fiction-avowed-1851767689">The best of 2025 (so far…)</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Rockstar Games promised everyone a definitive Red Dead Redemption Remastered upgrade for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch 2 consoles, and the release date is a defining day.</p>



<p>Recency bias would cause most people to pick Red Dead Redemption 2 as their favorite game. But many underestimate the impact and power of the original RDR story and gameplay. Yes, RDR 2 provided substantial upgrades, but the first game still has a certain charm that makes it worth replaying even now.</p>







<p>If RDR is something you want to play or you’ve never tried, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-owners-on-last-gen-consoles-are-eligible-for-free-upgrades/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Red Dead Redemption Remastered upgrade</a> release date for all modern hardware should interest you.</p>

<p><strong>The Red Dead Redemption Remastered Upgrade for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 2, and even Netflix, iOS, and Android launches on December 2.</strong></p>



<p>It’s an early Christmas present for all Red Dead Redemption fans. Rockstar Games might be busy with GTA 6, but the team is big enough to handle extra goodies—such as the remastered upgrade.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-red-dead-redemption-remastered-upgrade">How To Play Red Dead Redemption Remastered Upgrade</h2>



<p><strong>You need to own a copy of Red Dead Redemption Remastered to experience the free revamp for modern-day consoles and platforms, a <strong>GTA+ subscription,</strong>&nbsp;or download it via PlayStation Plus on December 2.</strong></p>



<p>On the one hand, the upgrade is free. Conversely, it’s only free if you already own Red Dead Redemption Remastered through one of the stated means.</p>



<p>Here’s what Rockstar says about the upgrade:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Current owners on PS4, Nintendo Switch, or the digital backward compatible version on Xbox One will be able to upgrade digitally for free. Anyone who owns the PS4 version can utilize previous PS4 save data to pick up where they left off, and Switch 2 players can continue with their previous save data from the previous Nintendo Switch console.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you are looking forward to playing the RDR upgrade, it includes the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>60 FPS.</li>



<li>Enhanced image quality.</li>



<li>HDR support enabled.</li>



<li>4K capabilities.</li>



<li>Nintendo Switch 2 owners get DLSS, HDR, mouse controls, and 60 FPS at high resolution.</li>



<li>Undead Nightmare DLC.</li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr">The tutorial will show players around the neighborhood, the basics of decorating, and answer some common housing-related questions players may have. As noted in the video, housing is available almost immediately, even for entirely new players. After doing the first few quests in the tutorial zone Exile's Reach, new players will be given the option of continuing with the game's introductory zone or jumping straight into the housing tutorial.</p><p dir="ltr">Players will be able to easily see which houses are available for purchase in any given <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-player-housing-will-include-a-level-up-system-and-neighborhood-wide-events/1100-6533095/" data-ref-id="1100-6533095">neighborhood</a>. There's plenty of housing plot options for all kinds of players, with a variety of different biomes to choose from. Those who want to be more secluded can buy a home farther away from the center of town, while others may want to be closer to the action and have neighbors directly next door.</p><p dir="ltr">If a specific plot is taken, players can simply travel to a different neighborhood until they find one where it's available. A house typically costs 1,000 gold but that already-small fee is waived for brand-new players. Players aren't locked into a specific neighborhood or plot, and can pick up their house (as well as all of its interior and exterior decorations) and move to a new plot or neighborhood at any time for a fee.</p><p dir="ltr">As for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-housing-will-allow-for-plenty-of-nitty-gritty-interior-decoration-options/1100-6530083/" data-ref-id="1100-6530083">decorating, Blizzard is giving players plenty of options</a>. All players will receive a housing starter pack of decor items to get going. Both the inside of a home and the outside plot can be customized with decor items gained from quests, raids, professions, vendors, and more. There are both simple and advanced tools for placing and customizing decor items for those who want to get lost in the details.

It will be saved as it last was with all of its decorations and customizations and put into storage after a certain amount of time, freeing up whatever neighborhood plot it occupied. Once that player resubscribes to WoW, the home can then be placed back down in a new plot or neighborhood.</p><p dir="ltr">Make sure to check out Blizzard's Housing 101 video above for a more in-depth look, but housing in WoW looks to be remakarbely straightforward compared to how it can be in some other MMOs, where players need to enter a house lottery or pay taxes on their virtual real estate.

            <p>Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser has once again discussed the proliferation of AI, comparing the tech to "mad cow disease" and describing the execs pushing it as "not the most human or creative people".</p>
<p>Houser, who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-co-founder-dan-houser-is-leaving-the-company-in-march">left GTA developer Rockstar back in 2020</a>, is currently on a media tour for his forthcoming novel that not only explores AI as part of its narrative, but is set in the same world as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/meet-absurdaverse-gta-5-writer-dan-housers-next-big-project">the game his new studio is working on</a>.</p>
<p>Interviewed on Virgin Radio UK by host Chris Evans, the discussion turned to the topic of AI. "Some of these people trying to define the future of humanity, creativity, or whatever it is using AI, are not the most humane or creative people," said Houser. "So they're sort of saying, 'We're better at being human than you are.' It's obviously not true."</p>

<p>He added: "Humanity is being pulled in a direction by a certain group of people, who maybe aren't fully-rounded humans."</p>
<p>More specifically on the technology, Houser was damning on its future promise.</p>
<p>"I think that AI is gonna eventually eat itself, because as far as I understand it - which is really superficial - the models scour the internet for information, but the internet's going to get more and more full of information made by the models," he said. "So it's sort of like when we fed cows with cows and got mad cow disease."</p>
<p>He admitted it will "do some tasks brilliantly, but it's not going to do every task brilliantly".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-games-co-founder-is-dabbling-with-ai-for-his-next-game-but-admits-its-not-as-useful-as-some-of-the-companies-would-have-you-believe-yet">Houser's comments echo his appearance last week</a> on UK TV, interviewed on Channel 4's Sunday Brunch programme.</p>
<p>"We have a whole field of areas we need technology for and AI's great at some of the tasks and can't do the other tasks yet," he said in that interview. "So [AI companies] will claim it can solve every single problem and it really can't yet. As far as I understand it, it's a sort of hold-all term for all future computing and it's not really doing a lot of the stuff yet. But if we all give it all of our money, it might do in the future."</p><p>In game development, AI is becoming more prevalent, but not all studios are using it. "I don't feel that games created with only AI will have soul," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-dont-feel-that-games-created-with-only-ai-will-have-soul-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-director-doesnt-think-ai-can-replace-human-creativity-but-the-studio-is-using-it-in-reasonable-ways">The Witcher 3 and The Blood of Dawnwalker director Konrad Tomaszkiewicz told Eurogamer</a>. Meanwhile the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/maybe-ai-is-a-creative-solution-if-you-arent-a-creative-person-dispatch-devs-take-a-firm-refreshing-stance-against-ai">developers of Dispatch stated: "Maybe AI is a creative solution if you aren't a creative person"</a>.</p>
