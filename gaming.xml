		<p>ustwo Games has announced that it will be released Monument Valley 3 on PC and consoles this summer, following on from its brief exclusivity on Netflix. The game was released back in December for the streaming service, and now the studio is looking to reach more players as it comes to PC via Steam, Xbox Series X|S, PS5, PS4, and Nintendo Switch. Additionally, the original Monument Valley and Monument Valley 2 will be released on April 15th for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/07/31/ustwo-games-confirms-monument-valley-3-is-now-in-development/">Monument Valley 3 was first announced</a> way back in 2019, so it did take five years to get to release. In this third game, players are Noor. Noor is on a mission to find a light source to push back the darkness that is enclosing her world. Like the previous games, players will have to manipulate the environment to find the solutions to the puzzles with each chapter adding a new spin to things. In a first for the series, Monument Valley 3 lets you set sail in open areas to further explore the world. Post launch, ustwo games has confirmed there will be new puzzles and chapters added to the game.</p>
<p>Anyone who purchases Monument Valley 3 will also be donating to charity, as ustwo games has stated the 3% of profits to Flood Relief.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/27/chucklefish-re-reveal-their-magical-life-sim-witchbrook/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/chucklefish">Chucklefish</a> and co-developer Robotality have revealed their first proper look at their magical life-sim Witchbrook, confirming that the game will be coming to PC, Nintendo Switch and Xbox this winter. It will be day one in<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass"> Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Witchbrook - First Look Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TIKSGazNOqg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game will let you enrol in Witchbrook College near the seaside city of Mossport, sinking into a world where you can simply pull out your magic wand and clean up messes and broken plumbing, or hop onto your broomstick and fly over the rooftops. The trailer also showing little snippets of home decoration and fishing. Truth be told, it doesn’t really show too much about what the game will actually play like, though it’s sure to lean on established genre tropes in some areas.</p>
<p>The game is playable with up to four players exploring the sandbox in co-op multipayer, and honestly, the pixelart visual style is stunning. Every scene in the trailer is packed with people and detail from an isometric view.</p>
<p>Technical Director Rodrigo Braz Monteiro said of his the game, “Witchbrook is the most exciting project I’ve ever worked on, and it’s been a long time coming, but I’m very eager to get the game in the hands of the players soon. I don’t think that the level of simulation and fidelity we’ve aimed for in this game is expected of any games short of AAA, and to see it realised in a pixel art indie game has been very satisfying to us. For now, we’re only sharing a small glimpse into a vast game, and I can’t wait for the community to see what’s coming over the next few months.”</p>

<p>Elsewhere, producer Rosie Ball explained that the team has embraced a 4-day work week and no-crunch approach to getting the game made, which is always great to hear.</p>
<p>This is the first meaningful look at Witchbrook, but you might remember the game from its original announcements. First teased as Project Spellbound in 2017, with Chucklefish looking to ride the wave of Stardew Valley interest (for which they provided porting support for the console versions), it was then named as Witchbrook a year later in 2018. At that time, the concept artwork and screenshots showed the game with that face-on view familiar to many pixel art life sims. In the intervening time, the game has clearly jumped 45º to give an isometric viewpoint, which feels much more distinct.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/v-rising-1-1-update-brings-new-biome-and-more-next-month.1146666/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/v-rising-11-update-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Stunlock Studios has revealed the release date for&nbsp;<em>V Rising&nbsp;</em>Update 1.1, which will serve as the vampire survival game's first major update since its 1.0 release.</p>

<p>The developer first promised a big new update for the game back in January, when&nbsp;<em>V Rising&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/v-rising-sales-top-5-million" rel="nofollow">crossed five million sales</a>. Now, that update, named "Invaders of Oakveil", has a release date: April 28th.</p>

<p>Invaders of Oakveil's first major addition to&nbsp;<em>V Rising&nbsp;</em>is the eponymous Oakveil Woodlands, a new biome filled with "deadly enemies, new bosses, and dark magic techniques" for you to discover. As the name suggests, it's a forest biome.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/v-rising-update-1.1-invaders-of-oakveil.jpg?itok=2LPD8amB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/v-rising-update-1.1-invaders-of-oakveil.jpg?itok=snKXy4JZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>V Rising</em>'s 1.1 update is coming in April.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not just the new biome, though. Update 1.1 will also bring the ability to build custom duel arenas within your castle, then challenge your friends (or anyone you like) to a duel. Don't worry, though; duels won't have any consequences, so you can fight to your heart's content.</p>

<p>Three new weapons will be added in the form of the Claws, the Twinblade, and the Throwing Daggers, each of which, Stunlock says, will unlock "fresh combat strategies and unique playstyles". They'll be accompanied by seven new spells for you to test out.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to&nbsp;<em>V Rising</em>'s "biggest combat overhaul yet", which the developer says will bring "a deep stat rework, rebalanced gear, completely overhauled blood types, and powerful new customization tools".</p>

<p>All of this and more will be introduced as part of Invaders of Oakveil, and you can watch the debut trailer for the update (which admittedly doesn't give a whole lot away) right here.</p>




<p><em>V Rising&nbsp;</em>is an open-world survival game in which you play the vampiric lord of a castle. You must sally forth into the mortal world to collect resources, do battle with powerful rivals, and establish your dominion as a lord.</p>

<p>The game is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1604030/V_Rising/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/v-rising/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and its Invaders of Oakveil update lands on April 28th.</p>

This had me looking at prices for its predecessor, the still-very-fast 990 Pro, and I was happy to see that its 4TB model is currently selling for $279.99 at <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSAMSUNG-990-PRO-M-2-2280-4TB-PCI-Express-Gen-4-0-x4-NVMe-2-0-V7-V-NAND-3bit-MLC-Internal-Solid-State-Drive-SSD-MZ-V9P4T0B-AM-Non-Heatsink%2F5075942372" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a> and at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CHGT1KFJ/ref=ewc_pr_img_1?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;psc=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> as part of its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/634880/amazon-big-spring-sale-march-2025-prime-day-deals-shop">Big Spring Sale</a> — more or less half off the price of the 9100 Pro’s 4 TB version (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Computing-Workstations-VAP1T0B-AM/dp/B0DX2GJ1YR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">$549.99</a>).</p><p>Why buy the 990 Pro over the 9100 Pro? Well, the 9100 Pro requires PCIe Gen 5-ready hardware to take advantage of its speeds, and that tech is far from being affordable or mainstream at the moment.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/24/23319258/samsung-990-pro-ssd-speeds-heatsink-ps5">we wrote</a> when the 990 Pro launched in 2022, that SSD came close to PCIe Gen 4’s theoretical speed limit, making it among the quicker options out there for PC (its faster speed is wasted on the PS5, though it’ll work fine in one). It’s still a great value today, especially as prices for all storage configurations have dropped considerably. Considering that a 2TB version of the 990 Pro is $170 and doubling the storage costs just about $100 more, we think that the 4TB is the one to get right now. As game install sizes continue to increase, it’ll be a great addition to any PS5, or in any desktop or laptop that supports PCIe Gen 4 speeds.</p><p>Given that the 990 Pro we’re recommending doesn’t have a heatsink (one’s suggested for use in the PS5, and it’s never a bad idea on PC), it’s <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=m2+ssd+heatsink&amp;i=electronics&amp;crid=2C532BVY97UYG&amp;sprefix=m2+ssd+heatsink%2Celectronics%2C107&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2&amp;tag=theverge02-20">cheaper to buy and install your own instead</a> of paying Samsung a $20 premium for the heatsink edition of the 990 Pro.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Coming in an April system update, Nintendo is introducing a new game management system called “virtual game cards.” Virtual game cards are meant to function similarly to physical ones. When the feature goes live, purchases of digital games on the Nintendo eShop will automatically create a virtual game card that you’ll be able to manage from a dedicated screen.</p><p>Virtual game cards also make sharing games between consoles simpler. Using a local wi-fi connection, you can use virtual game cards to transfer digital games between Switch 1 and Switch 2 consoles. But perhaps the most interesting aspect of this feature is that now, you’ll be able to lend games to members of your Nintendo Switch Family account. You can only lend out one game per person and only for two weeks, but its still very neat that Nintendo has replicated the spirit of renting video games from Blockbuster.</p><p>Since Nintendo already told us the Switch 2 is backwards compatible, it seems like this new virtual game card system was created to ease the transition for players upgrading their consoles. We’ll learn more about the Swtich 2 and all its new features during the Switch 2 direct on April 2nd.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I don’t want to spoil too much for you, but here are a few simple things to know before you dive into <em>AI Limit</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196447" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: January 2024 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="330" data-playlist="196447,195410,196143" data-current="196447"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: January 2024 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196447/196447_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196447/196447_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196447/196447_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196447/196447_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21996.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h325295"><a id=""></a>There’s no need to hoard Mud Balls</h2><p>Mud Balls are a consumable restoration item dropped by enemies or found via exploration.

However, these don’t really stick out from the rest of the environment; if you don’t know they can be interacted with, you’re likely to just wander past them.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/atomfall/" data-ref-id="5000-631970">Atomfall </a>is a new open world, survival RPG that’s set in a post-apocalyptic version of 1950s England. A radioactive disaster has just occurred, and you’re locked inside the “Quarantine Zone” without any recollection as to how you got there or what’s happening around you. From the moment the game opens up to you, you’re able to go anywhere, complete any quest you come across, and explore numerous different areas within the game’s open-world zones.</p><p dir="ltr">The way Atomfall is designed makes it a different experience for every player. This can make it difficult to nail down just how long it takes to beat the game, as some players will take longer to reach the end than others based on the path they take. However, you can see a general timeframe for how long it takes to reach the end credits of Atomfall in the guide below.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How long is Atomfall - Campaign length</h2><p dir="ltr">For most players, Atomfall will take <strong>roughly 15-20 hours to beat</strong>. This is contingent on completing the main story and taking time to explore the different zones in the game, as you often don’t have exact quest markers to guide you to your next objective.</p><p dir="ltr">The way Atomfall works, though, can either expedite or prolong this timeline. There are actually several different main story questlines that you can embark on throughout the game, and each one takes multiple hours to complete. However, some of the main story questlines don’t need to be completed at all to reach the end of the game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4465136-atomfall_features_06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4465136" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4465136-atomfall_features_06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4465136"></a><figcaption>No two Atomfall playthroughs will be much alike.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4465136-atomfall_features_06.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">So, for example, if you pick the right main story questline to complete and don’t take part in too much side content, you could be done with Atomfall significantly faster than our estimated timeline. However, on the flip side, if you see all of the main story questlines to their end, then you’ll exceed the timeline and could spend <strong>over</strong> <strong>30 hours in Atomfall</strong>.</p><p dir="ltr">If you’re a completionist who wants to complete most or all of the main story questlines and partake in a majority of the side content, you could easily get <strong>40+ hours out of the game</strong>. There are a plethora of side quests you can go on in the Quarantine Zone, and the main story questlines can have over a dozen individual quests each that all take some time to get through.</p><p dir="ltr">You’ll find your quest log will soon be chock-full of different leads to investigations that can either pan out quickly or take the entire game to resolve. A seemingly run-of-the-mill side quest can actually be how you reach the end of the game, and an apparently important character could really be insignificant after you do a few quests for them.</p><p dir="ltr">It’s up to you what leads you choose to chase and which ones you leave to the wayside. All quests in Atomfall lead you to different parts of the various maps in the game, though, so you’ll have to eventually visit every single map even if you want to get through the main story quickly.</p><p dir="ltr">Suffice it to say, Atomfall isn’t a game that will be beaten in the same amount of time by most players. Players can have a completely different experience from other players depending on the choices they make, who they choose to trust, and what quests they want to complete. All of this results in a game that can be beaten fairly quickly or take significantly longer than the average time to beat.</p>

            <p>
Ever wondered why Pokémon Legends: Z-A is called that? There are a few notable coincidences already - Zygarde is likely to be the key mascot of this entry, with the previous game's being Arceus; and the mysterious character AZ, pronounced as "A, Z" returns here in a seemingly promintent role also - but now we have another explanation, via a new, seemingly quite important feature announced today, as part of the game's surprise appearance in the Nintendo Direct.
</p>
<p>
The new feature is called the Z-A Royale, a trainer-on-trainer tournament that takes place in Lumiose City after night falls. Here, the city's wild areas, previously outlined in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-everything-we-know">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a>'s first full trailer, will turn into Battle Zones, where you can find opposing trainers waiting for you. It's mentioned that only "fierce" and "highly skilled trainers" are invited to participate, though that's swiftly followed by footage of you kicking things off with a Lv. 13 Totodile.
</p>
<p>
Earn enough Ticket Points, meanwhile, from defeating opponents and picking up 'bonus cards' by fulfilling certain challenges specified by the cards, and you'll earn a Challenger's Ticket, a requirement for undertaking a 'promotion match' where you can go up a rank. You'll start at Rank Z and, you guessed it, eventually climb to rank A - hence, Z-A. Curiously, it's mentioned that "trainers who reach the top are said to have a wish granted", which is likely a hint at the feature's role in the main story. Maybe you need a particular wish granted to defeat this entry's big bad?
</p>
<p>
In the trailer we also saw a little bit more of the new, hybrid battle system, that juggles real-time dodging with the order-based attacks of Legends: Arceus, and there are a few nice little twists in there for the eagle-eyed Pokémon fans. 
</p>
<p>
For one, now you can surprise other trainers, rather than the other way round - successfully sneak up and startle them before they make eye contact with you and you can use a surprise attack. This will always result in a critical hit, we're told, dealing hefty extra damage, in a similar method to the mechanic first introduced in Legends: Arceus that previously let you get an entire extra attack in on your opponent. 
</p>
<p>
We also got a first glimpse at how Mega Evolution will work in practice - an Alakazam was shown mega evolving into Mega Alakazam, when four bars had been filled in a glowing gauge in the bottom right. How you fill those up isn't clear just yet, though at one point the player-character's Lucario uses an attack and the gauge increases slightly, so it may be down to using attacks - or certain attacks - to charge it up.
</p>
<p>
Curiously, there's also a little figure of a person running over on the left of the in-battle screen, with the dash button icon next to it. At first glance, it looks like this might mean you can actually run away from trainer battles for the first time in the series' history, though we wouldn't be surprised if this was a feature only limited to these special night-time tournament bouts. In wild battles, by contrast, as we also saw in this new trailer, it's notable that you can just physically run away, rather than having to select it as an option.
</p>
<p>
Last but not least, this trailer also confirmed a few more Pokémon that'll be available in the games, most notably the full trio of elemental monkey Pokémon and their evolutions - Pansage and Simisage; Pansear and Simisear; and Panpour and Simipour - that were previously only available back in the X and Y and Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire days of generation six.
</p>
<p>For <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-wont-arrive-until-late-2025">more on Pokémon Legends: Z-A, which won't release until "late 2025"</a>, it's worth looking through our roundup of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-shown-at-this-years-pokemon-presents">everything revealed in the big Pokémon Presents</a> earlier this year. You can also look forward to some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-pokemon-announced-coming-2026">long-wished-for Pokémon Lego sets some time in 2026</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As a reminder, this Direct doesn't have anything for you when it comes to the Switch 2; you'll have to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">wait until next week's show</a> for that. With that in mind, here's everything that was announced during today's Nintendo Direct showcase!</p>

<hr><h2><em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD Remaster</em>&nbsp;still coming this year</h2>

<p>First, we got to see a little footage from the upcoming JRPG collection&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD Remaster</em>, which is still coming to Switch sometime this year. No release date was revealed for the collection, sadly.</p>

<h2><em>No Sleep for Kaname Date - From AI: The Somnium Files&nbsp;</em>is a&nbsp;<em>Zero Escape</em>-style adventure</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-direct-march-2025-ai-somnium-files.jpg?itok=-Dhrt5J0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-direct-march-2025-ai-somnium-files.jpg?itok=_CzgAo5U 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A new&nbsp;<em>AI: The Somnium Files&nbsp;</em>game is coming.</figcaption></figure><p>Next up, it's time to take a look at the next game in the&nbsp;<em>AI: The Somnium Files&nbsp;</em>series. This one stars detective Kaname Date, who must work together with the sophisticated AI embedded in his eye in order to save internet personality Iris from a "mysterious escape game". It's coming to Switch on July 25th.</p>

<h2><em>Raidou Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army&nbsp;</em>has more Atlus RPG shenanigans</h2>

<p>A remastered version of Atlus' action RPG <i>Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. the Soulless Army&nbsp;</i>is coming to Switch on June 19th. If you like&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>but wish the combat was a bit more active, this one's probably for you.</p>

<h2><em>Shadow Labyrinth&nbsp;</em>is, uh, a&nbsp;<em>Pac-Man&nbsp;</em>Metroidvania</h2>

<p>Have you ever wanted Pac-Man to star in his very own Metroidvania platformer? Well, you're in luck.&nbsp;<em>Shadow Labyrinth&nbsp;</em>is that very thing, although you're teaming up with "Puck" rather than exclusively playing as him. This one's coming on July 18th.</p>

<h2><em>Patapon 1+2 Replay&nbsp;</em>brings the&nbsp;<em>Patapon&nbsp;</em>games to Switch in July</h2>

<p>The PSP's&nbsp;<em>Patapon&nbsp;</em>games were some of that system's most delightful and joyful titles, and they're now coming to Switch as part of&nbsp;<em>Patapon 1+2 Replay</em>, which will hit the system on July 11th.</p>

<h2><em>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar&nbsp;</em>is a remake of a DS farming classic</h2>

<p>A new&nbsp;<em>Story of Seasons&nbsp;</em>game is coming to Switch...well, sort of.&nbsp;<em>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar&nbsp;</em>is a remake of the DS game (which was released under the series' previous&nbsp;<em>Harvest Moon&nbsp;</em>name), and it's coming on August 27th.</p>

<h2>More&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond&nbsp;</em>gameplay info revealed</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-direct-march-2025.jpg?itok=S1CsocbO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-direct-march-2025.jpg?itok=1slXJ7c2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond&nbsp;</em>is shaping up to be great, but I wish we had a release date for it.</figcaption></figure><p>Next, we got a new look at hotly-anticipated first-person shooter&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>. No release date, sadly, but we did get to see some of the game's combat, which looks like it's in the classic&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime&nbsp;</em>tradition.</p>

<p>We also got to see some of Samus' new psychic abilities, which can be used both to explore the world around you and to enhance combat.</p>

<h2><em>Disney Villains Cursed Cafe</em>&nbsp;is essentially&nbsp;<em>Coffee Talk&nbsp;</em>with added Ursula</h2>

<p>If you thought&nbsp;<em>Coffee Talk&nbsp;</em>could use some extra villainy, this next one is for you.&nbsp;<em>Disney Villains Cursed Cafe&nbsp;</em>lets you brew potions and serve them to Disney villains, and the kinds of potions you brew can even have an effect on the story. You can play it on Switch later today.</p>

<h2><em>Witchbrook&nbsp;</em>looks like the cozy magic school game you've been waiting for</h2>

<p>Next, it's time for a look at Chucklefish's&nbsp;<em>Witchbrook</em>, a cozy magic school game in which you can fly on broomsticks, learn magic spells, and hang out with other witches. This one's heading to Switch sometime this holiday season.</p>

<h2>Action and arcade sizzle reel</h2>

<p>Nintendo showed an action and arcade-focused sizzle reel next, featuring THQ's hand-drawn platformer&nbsp;<em>The Eternal Life of Goldman&nbsp;</em>(coming this holiday), retro collection <i>Gradius Origins&nbsp;</i>(launching in August), and rhythm game&nbsp;<em>Rift of the NecroDancer&nbsp;</em>(coming to Switch today).</p>

<h2><em>Tamagotchi Plaza&nbsp;</em>is a new&nbsp;<em>Tamagotchi Connection&nbsp;</em>game</h2>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>Tamagotchi Plaza</em>, twelve stores await your help, and you can do everything from designing eyewear through to, uh, being a dentist. The game features over 100 "new and classic" Tamagotchi and launches on June 27th.</p>

<h2><em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>sure does look fun</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-direct-march-2025.jpg?itok=O-ewIs2x 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-direct-march-2025.jpg?itok=pQ-yMcvi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll have to fight a lot of trainers to be the very best in&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>We were treated to some more&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>info next, although much of it was already revealed in February's&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>Presents show.</p>

<p>This Nintendo Direct showed off some of the game's Z-A Royale tournament, which will let you face off against fellow Trainers for the chance to "have a wish granted". Still no release date, though.</p>

<h2><em>Rhythm Heaven Groove&nbsp;</em>brings more fun rhythm minigames next year</h2>

<p>Next, we got to see a new entry in the&nbsp;<em>Rhythm Heaven&nbsp;</em>series, which is always welcome. This one will have lots of the franchise's signature quirky, off-the-wall minigames when it comes to Switch next year.</p>

<h2>Nintendo's new Virtual Game Card system looks...odd</h2>

<p>It looks like Nintendo is introducing a new system for game-sharing between Switch consoles. The Virtual Game Card system will render each digital purchase as a Virtual Game Card, which can then be loaded onto second Switch consoles using local communication.</p>

<p>Two systems can share cards freely, and you can also lend cards out to those on your family Switch account for two weeks. Nintendo says this system will make "digital games even easier to use", and it's being added in late April. It'll be used on Switch 2 as well.</p>

<h2>More sizzle reel goodness</h2>

<p>A few more games are making their way to Switch, and we got a sizzle reel for them. Here are the games that were featured in that reel.</p>

<ul><li><em>High on Life&nbsp;</em>(May 6th)</li>
	<li><em>Star Overdrive&nbsp;</em>(April 10th)</li>
	<li><em>The Wandering Village&nbsp;</em>(July 17th)</li>
	<li><em>King of Meat&nbsp;</em>(2025)</li>
	<li><em>Lou's Lagoon&nbsp;</em>(Summer 2025)</li>
	<li><em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>(May 21st)</li>
	<li><em>SaGa Frontier 2 Remastered&nbsp;</em>(later today)</li>
</ul><h2><em>Monument Valley 1</em>,&nbsp;<em>2</em>, and&nbsp;<em>3&nbsp;</em>coming to Switch</h2>

The first two games will be available for the system on April 15th, along with all of their DLC, and the third entry is heading to Nintendo's console in summer.</p>

<h2><em>Everybody's Golf: Hot Shots&nbsp;</em>brings wacky golf to Switch this year</h2>

<p>A new&nbsp;<em>Everybody's Golf&nbsp;</em>game is heading to Switch this year, bringing the series' signature cartoony golfing action to Nintendo's console. It'll support local play or online multiplayer for up to 4 players.</p>

<h2><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion&nbsp;</em>calls back to retro beat-'em-ups</h2>

<p>Next, a beat-'em-up right out of the 16-bit era was revealed.&nbsp;<em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion&nbsp;</em>is a sidescroller from Dotemu that lets you play as classic Marvel heroes like Spider-Man, Captain America, and Venom, and it supports four-player co-op. It's coming this holiday.</p>

<h2><em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream&nbsp;</em>looks characteristically offbeat</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-nintendo-direct-march-2025.jpg?itok=ripQbsBN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-nintendo-direct-march-2025.jpg?itok=eOqrj2eC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Aaaaargh!</figcaption></figure><p>The first new&nbsp;<em>Tomodachi Life&nbsp;</em>game in over ten years was revealed as Nintendo's final game announcement for this Nintendo Direct.

<h2>A new Nintendo app is being released</h2>

<p>Finally, we got to see a new Nintendo app being released for smart devices. Nintendo Today! will feature all kinds of news and other Nintendo-related goodies, and it'll also bring you new Switch 2 news every single day following the Direct presentation next week. You can download it now!</p>

<hr><p>That about does it for today's Nintendo Direct! Stay tuned for next week's presentation, when we'll have everything Nintendo announces about the Switch 2 ready for your perusal. Until then, you can check out today's full show here.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> publishers and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starbound">Starbound</a> developers Chucklefish have conjured up the first proper trailer for Witchbrook, the magic school life sim some have called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/renomine-wiz-school-rpg-spellbound-now-witchbrook">“isometric Little Witch Academia”</a>, and other, more English people <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stardew-valley-harry-potter-project">“a reworking of The Worst Witch books”</a>. Me, I’m going with “isometric Kiki’s Delivery Service”, given that there appear to be delivery missions and also, you <em>do</em> get to fly on broomsticks. 
</p>
<p>
I italicised that “do” in honour of Alice Bee (RPS in peace), who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/5-things-i-demand-from-witchbrook-chucklefishs-new-magical-stardew-like">threatened in 2020</a> to institute scoring on RPS specifically in order to give Witchbrook 0/10 if it didn’t have flying broomsticks. Nice save, Chucklefish! Here’s that trailer.

<p>
And here’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1846700/Witchbrook/">the Steam page</a>. Witchbrook seems like pretty standard, albeit beautifully presented Stardewlike fare, but it’s glamorised considerably by the fact that you can learn spells and potions, read the stars, and participate in occult rituals while pursuing your education at the titular Witchbrook College.
</p>
<p>
When not hitting the grimoires, you’ll also get to decorate your very own witch’s cottage and pursue a range of relationships in the town of Mossport, with its many persistent NPCs. The Steam blurb suggests that you can form a coven. I’ve always wanted to form a coven. They sound like unions but you can hex people instead of going on strike.
</p>
<p>
There’s also scope for such non-witchy, extra-curricular and/or entrepreneurial activities as shopping at the boutique, selling goods at the Sunday market, founding a business and playing local photographer. The witch of today loves to diversify, it seems. 
</p>
<p>
Witchbrook will launch in holiday 2025. In her article threatening to give the game a 0/10, Alice also demanded pet options besides dogs and cats, an occult range of things to farm, the ability to get put in detention for skipping classes, and *squints* the right to fuck a ghost. I’m pretty sure 50% of that is in the trailer. 
</p>
<p>
Myself, I will only add that I feel like Witchbrook’s witches could be wickeder. I get that this is another idyll for people who seek relief from reality’s cares in the endless watering of pixelart turnips, but I would quite like to build a gingerbread house and start a business catching and roasting small children. I won't give the game a 0/10 if it doesn't meet my needs, but it's definitely not scoring above a 7.

The release is expected to arrive this year, but no solid release date was provided.</p></div><div><p>In this new detective-focused game in the <em>AI: The Somnium Files </em>series, you’ll have to help out a poor idol in distress trapped on a space station with low oxygen, solving mysteries and such to help her. <em>No Sleep For Kaname Date</em> launches on July 25, 2025.</p></div><div><p>A remastered version of <em>Raidou</em>, originally released for PlayStation 2 in 2006 as <em>Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. the Soulless Army</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>is heading to the Switch on June 19, 2025.</p></div><div><p>With some sick-looking dark environments, the edgy <em>Pac-Man </em>spin-off <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> promises some brutal fights in which you can not only beat the crap out of your foes, but also eat them for enhanced abilities. <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> launches on July 18.</p></div><div><p>If you have fond memories of playing <em>Patapon</em> on PSP, good news! You can relive the portable experience with remasters of <em>Pataon 1 </em>and <em>2 </em>on the Switch, launching on July 11, and get that infectious rhythm stuck in your head all over again. <br></p></div><div><p>Want another farming sim? How about a throwback to the DS era? <em>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</em> hits the Switch on August 27, 2025.</p></div><div><p>With some absolutely gorgeous-looking environments, our girl Samus is back in first-person mode to hopefully escape a hostile planet. While <em>Dread</em> absolutely owned, it’s gonna be pretty sweet to focus on alien-blasting and scanning stuff yet again from inside her helmet. She’s also got some pretty neat psychic abilities for combat and exploration.</p><p><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> arrives on the Switch sometime in 2025.</p></div><div><p>Coffee and tea are pretty sweet, but in <em>Disney Villains Cursed Cafe</em>, you’ll get to make some nifty potions with unique narrative outcomes based on your choices. The game is out today, March 27.</p></div><div><p>How about a magic school that doesn’t suck? Well, that’s the dream anyway. <em>Witchbrook</em> features some nice-looking pixel art, magical learnings, and even co-op for up to four players. The game arrives on Switch this holiday season.</p></div><div><p>Billed as a “hand-drawn platforming adventure,” <em>The Eternal Life of Goldman </em>will let you smack the crap out of fools with a cane. Fun! <br></p></div><div><p>Oh hell yeah. Schmup fans will be eating well with this sick-looking collection of the <em>Gradius</em> franchise featuring not only some classics, but also a new adventure with <em>Salamander III</em>.</p></div><div><p>Haven’t you ever wanted to start a band to take on dark forces? Well, you can live out that very dream with <em>Rift of the Necrodancer</em>, available for the Switch today, March 27.</p></div><div><p>With adorable little meeps for dialogue, <em>Tamagotchi Plaza</em> looks like a chill store-management sim where you can explore all of your retail dreams, only cuter. This one arrives on Switch on June 27.</p></div><div><p>What do you mean you still haven’t caught ‘em all? Today we got another look at <em>Pokémon Legends Z-A</em>, in which a corporation is in charge of urban development, you know, to let humans and Pokémon live in peace together. It’s totally not an open air prison for the powerless critters.</p></div><div><p>If you’re looking for a rhythm game that drills timing down to the basics, <em>Rhythm Heaven Groove</em> eschews grand storylines and epic settings for something a bit more focused on timing your button presses to the beat. Past entries have been a delight, so it’s great to see this series make its way to Switch.</p></div><div><p>Hey, there’s a new Switch on the horizon. It’s left many of us wondering what’s gonna happen with our digital games; after all, many of us have dumped a fair bit of coin into that eShop. </p><p>Fortunately, Nintendo is promising us the ability to easily transport digital games via a virtual game card management system across two different Nintendo Switch systems (the trailer seems to indicate that’s the limit). You’ll also be able to share games within your Nintendo family. The feature is coming to both the Switch and the Switch 2, and is expected to arrive in April of this year.</p></div><div><p>Stoner-FPS-fest <em>High On Life</em> is hitting the Nintendo Switch on May 6, perfect for extended periods of couch lock for you troublemakers.</p></div><div><p>Promising speedy action adventure across a strange alien world, <em>Star Overdrive</em> lands on the Switch on April 10.</p></div><div><p>This alien settlement management sim arrives on the Switch on July 17.</p></div><div><p>A sequel to the Nintendo 3DS’ <em>Fantasy Life, The Girl Who Steals</em> <em>Time </em>promises open-world exploration and item crafting when it arrives on the Switch on May 21 of this year.<br></p></div><div><p>1999 PlayStation RPG<em> Saga Frontier II </em>is getting a remaster on the Switch. The original narrative is joined by some new story material and characters. <em>Saga Frontier II</em>’s remaster arrives on Switch today.</p></div><div><p><em>Monument Valley 1 </em>and <em>2 </em>promise chill adventures across geometrically complex environments. This package, which includes all DLC, on April 15, 2025. The third game, which released on Android in December of 2024, will also make its way to the Switch this summer.</p></div><div><p><em>Everybody’s Golf</em>, aka <em>Hot Shots Golf</em>, is making the leap from Sony platforms to the Switch with the appropriately titled <em>Everybody’s Golf: Hot Shots. </em>It arrives on Switch later this year. </p></div><div><p>If you’re craving some retro beat ‘em up action with legendary superheroes like Spider-Man and Wolverine, <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em> looks like a pretty swell time, with single and cooperative play. <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion </em>arrives this holiday season.</p></div><div><p>The event’s final game reveal showed off the newest <em>Tomodachi</em> release in 10 years with this strange teaser that is already resulting in memes galore on social media.</p></div><div><p>At the very end of the event, Nintendo announced that they’ll continue the Direct series of video presentations, but they’re also launching a new channel via an app called Nintendo Today.

<p>Ubisoft has announced that Assassin’s Creed Shadows has passed 3 million players in its first 7 days since launch.</p>



<p>The news was shared on the official Assassin’s Creed X (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1905268079958904991" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">account</a>, where it was officially confirmed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Assassin’s Creed Shadows is the 2nd highest day 1 sales</a> (in revenue) in Assassin’s Creed’s franchise history.</p>



<p>It was also announced that the game is the biggest day 1 release on the PlayStation Store, with over 40 million hours of the game already being played.</p>



<p>In addition to the games commercial success, Assassin’s Creed Shadows is one of Ubisoft’s highest-rated Metacritic games in recent history, which currently sits at 82/100.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming’s Grant-Taylor Hill gave Shadow’s a “Buy” verdict, praising the game’s visuals and cinematics but said that the game had “too many niggling flaws for me to consider this a perfect title.”</p>

It's all very BioShock-y as everyone's favorite space bounty hunter scans stone figures and blasts new enemies on the planet Viewros using purple energy that she controls with her free hand.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Pokémon Legends: Z-A - Official Z-A Royale Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>As a Lumoise City newcomer, your trainer will enter the tournament at Rank Z and be forced to duke it out at night in order to become Rank A. Though the trailer didn't reveal everything that comes with earning this coveted title, it did share that trainers who reach the top are "said to have a wish granted."</p><p>Like Pokemon Legends: Z-A's Wild Zones, these dusk-'til-dawn duels will be contained to designated areas called Battle Zones, which will be indicated by red, holographic borders. Once your trainer steps foot in these areas, other trainers will be eager to challenge them, making timing and the way you approach certain opponents critical to success.</p><p>The French-inspired Lumiose City, which serves as the Kalos region's main hub, will be familiar to those who played Pokemon X and Y. However, Legends Z-A further realizes the location by greatly expanding it and adding in plenty of new characters, new locations, and wild Pokemon. Players will be able to battle and capture these wild Pokemon regardless of if they are tucked away in one of the city's Wild Zones or lurking up on the rooftops.</p><p>Pokemon: Legends Z-A is the second entry in the Pokemon: Legends spin-off. While the mainline Pokemon series sees players traverse an entire region, battling gym leaders to earn the title of Pokemon Master, the Legends series confines players to a more fully-realized version of a particular location. In Pokemon Legends: Arceus, players traveled back in time to the settlement of the Sinnoh region.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/why-your-next-game-needs-a-babygirl<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Okay for this to make sense, I need you to understand what a "babygirl" is. A babygirl is, as writer and narrative designer Alexa Ray Corriea explained in her 2025 Game Developers Conference talk, a character that everyone can agree is "a little bit traumatized," but secure in their masculinity, attractive, sensitive, and vulnerable, but not weak. He's probably over the age of 25, and may have "soft reasons to make hard decisions." Corriea's example was Clive from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Final Fantasy XVI</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Still with me? Good, let's talk about a "woobie." A woobie refers to a villainous or morally grey character who fans are inspired to "care for or comfort" amid all the terrible things happening to them. Do not confuse a woobie with a "meow meow," as a meow meow refers to a more heroic character you might want to just give a big hug. If that one's confusing, think about the difference between Waluigi (woobie) and Luigi (meow meow).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Oh no, there are so many phrases left to cover. A "girl failure" is a female character who seems to have their life together but absolutely does not (Misato Katsuragi from Neon Genesis Evangelion). Then there's the handsome older male characters you'd say are a "daddy" or "zaddy," and last but absolutely not least there's the handsome-but-well-meaning "himbo." These words all describe a new genre of character tropes defined by fans and popularized on platforms like Tumblr and Ao3.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/uc-santa-cruz-professor-roleplays-gig-economy-publisher-negotiation-and-layoffs-with-game-design-students" target="_self" data-discover="true">UC Santa Cruz professor roleplays gig economy, publisher negotiation, and layoffs with game design students</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Why should developers care about these magnificent words? Well let's get down to brass tacks. It's common knowledge that if you want players to give a shit about your game's story, you need strong characters. But after 40 or so years of great narrative games, a lot of the classic tropes have been well-worn out and we all get a bit exhausted when a narrative director pulls out his copy of Joseph Campbell's The Hero's Journey again.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Corriea's argument is that these fandom phrases are the secret to juicing up your game. How? Some of it's about the data—and some of it's about freeing your creativity from a box of shame.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Fans. Love. These. Tropes.">Fans. Love. These. Tropes.</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Data-hungry developers deserve a little guidance here. Ao3 (which stands for "Archive Of Our Own"), for the un-indoctrinated, is a successor to fanfiction.net, and is now the de facto home of fanfiction in the world wide web. It is also, it turns out, a useful barometer for assessing which characters are most popular in a beloved video game. Corriea showed a list of the top "shipping" categories of 2024 (shipping, another fandom phrase, refers to pairing characters up in fanfiction whether they're a canon couple or not), and pointed out that five fanfiction romances from Larian Studios' </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Baldur's Gate 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> ranked in the top 100 of all submitted projects in 2024. Astarion and the player character clocked in at the fourth-most popular category, while the "Dark Urge" version of the player character and the villain Enver Gortash ranked at number 85, if you want a sense of the spread.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/achieving-creative-sobriety-in-game-design" target="_self" data-discover="true">Achieving 'creative sobriety' in game design</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"These characters are like six years old," she said (referring to the 2019 Early Access launch of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Baldur's Gate 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">). "That lasting power really means something," she said. "Looking at how your fan base is consuming your game, or how your players are consuming other games you admire...can help with your own character ideation phase."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">She also revealed that an unexpectedly popular entry on the Ao3 2024 shipping rankings was...Soap McTavish and "Ghost" from the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare series. "When I was in the writer's room on Call of Duty, we wanted to make this canon, and they wouldn't let us," she said. "So thanks a lot Activision."</span></p><p>Image via Ash Poprik.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Image via Ash Poprik.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But before you run off and start dumping all of Ao3's data into a spreadsheet to quantify the most potent pairing you could conceive (I know some of you are already trying this don't hide from me), take a quick breather. There is one side effect to this fandom-led phenomenon that has a nasty side effect: the perpetuation of "toxic fandom."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/consume-me-wins-grand-prize-nuovo-award-at-the-2025-igf-awards" target="_self" data-discover="true">'Consume Me' Wins Grand Prize, Nuovo Award at the 2025 IGF Awards</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers are quite familiar with toxic fandom, as it unfortunately drives harassment across the business. But when swimming in these waters, fans sometimes develop unhealthy attachments to characters and may lash out at other players or developers if their favorite character isn't portrayed in the way you like. "I'm not telling you to listen to toxic fandom culture that's still a huge problem across our industry...this is about having a dialogue with your fandom, and not letting yourself being run by it."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">She also added that with younger generations of developers emerging from the primordial ooze of fandom, there are going to be more game industry professionals who speak this language. "You're going to start having these conversations a lot, hearing this kind of talk in your writer's room, because that's a part of our culture. Those fandoms brought us into this line of work, and it's good form to keep up and know how to meet them halfway."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And pop culture has already nudged the shape of the game industry in small ways. The X (formerly Twitter) account called "Can you pet the dog?" launched hundreds of pettable animal video games in game development.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those were the "practical" takeaways from Corriea's talk—the kind you might bring into a big meeting when you have to convince leadership that you've only gone a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>little bit</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> feral in your corner of the office. But if we only limit ourselves to the practical, we risk burying these tropes in the same graveyard as "the grizzled war veteran" or "the talented female sidekick who is somehow shown up by the main character."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you truly want to tap into the power of these tropes, you must learn to set yourself free.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Embrace cringe, be vulnerable">Embrace cringe, be vulnerable</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"For an artist to become overly cerebral is to become crippled. This is not to say that artists lack rigor, rather that artistic rigor is grounded differently than intellectual life usually admits."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The above quote comes from Julia Cameron's 1992 book The Artist's Way, and is a quote Corriea said she regularly thinks about. When she thinks about it, she recalls advice from one mentor who told her to "write from the hip," slinging out ideas with the speed of a classic cowboy gunslinger. Another told her to "write the unhinged thing, because you never know who will identify with that." All three quotes are, in one way or another, a call for creatives to write deeply from their instincts. To do that, you need to fight your way past an emotion holding any creative person back: "cringe."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The verb "cringe" has become popularized as a noun and adjective, describing an emotion mixing shame and embarrassment tied to social awkwardness. Lusting publicly for fictional characters can sometimes be "cringe." Telling your development peers about the hours spent making a playlist for your game's protagonist might be "cringe." </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/star-wars-outlaws-shows-the-limits-of-familiar-but-with-a-twist-">Regularly waxing on at length about Star Wars on a B2B website</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> read by game industry professionals might also be "cringe."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bustle.com/wellness/embrace-cringe-tiktok">Embrace cringe</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">," reads one of end of the internet.

"Climb cringe mountain," commanded Corriea. Whichever choice you make it's easy to agree that cringe is, one way or another, about emotions or actions someone else may perceive as awkward—or even laugh at you for expressing. If you're uncomfortable with being "cringe," you might revert to safer emotional behavior, something more familiar, something you think will keep people from laughing at you or mocking you.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sometimes that's a business-driven instinct. If you fear you're taking too many risks with a new type of gameplay, you'd be forgiven for thinking you need a conventional plot with conventional characters to not alienate the player.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But that line of thinking can also be your undoing. The fear that no one will resonate with your strange ideas can be what makes your game not very interesting.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The beautiful thing about art, and the thing that we so often forget when we're making art, is that people will find meaning in just about anything. When we are creating, what we are creating will resonate with different people on different levels. It's all valid," said Corriea.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And if you can't be vulnerable—or "cringe"—around your collaborators, how will you help them make games that connect with those players? "This is all still fun," Corriea reminded the audience in her closing remarks.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We make games. We need to remember that under all of this capitalism, we are still having fun."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

<p>"Create your own Mii characters based on yourself, friends, family – anyone! – and watch them live their lives on an island out at sea," reads the official blurb.</p>
<p>"Get involved with their relationships and experience all the weird and wonderful ways these Mii characters interact. You may even drop in on their dreams" (which we saw to haunting effect at the end of the trailer).</p>
<p>Elsewhere today, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-new-app-that-will-deliver-you-daily-information-and-content">Nintendo announced a new app which will deliver daily information about games and events to users</a>.
