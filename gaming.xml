		<p>Nintendo has announced an overhaul for how digital game licenses are handled on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch">Nintendo Switch</a> and the upcoming <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> with the new Virtual Game Card.</p>
<p><iframe title="Virtual Game Card – Nintendo Direct 3.27.2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EWwyh74MXXY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The change will make digital game use much more like how you use and share physical game cartridges. When purchasing a digital game, it will be loaded as a Virtual Game Cartridge, giving you access to that game on that particular system.</p>
<p>Using a new dedicated management screen, you can manage those games to load and eject them individually. Ejecting from one Switch system will then let you load it onto a second Switch system – your account is seemingly limited to using this feature through two systems only, and will require local communication in order to bind them together.</p>
<p>That’s a bit of an upheaval when compared to playing your games on any Switch console simply by having an online connection to authenticate your login.</p>

<p>However, this does present new opportunities for families and friends. You will now be able to lend to members within your NIntendo Switch Online family group. This again requires a local wireless connection in order to do so, and you can only lend one game at a time to each person. Additionally, they will only be available for up to 2 weeks before they are automatically returned to you.</p>
<p>This seems like a better system for families to share one copy of a big single player game, perhaps, and certainly when compared to the tricky primary account for game sharing that has been a staple of console gaming since the late aughts. It’s not clear yet if this effectively grants that game license to the whole console (if a primary console for another person’s account), or if it’s user specific.</p>
<p>This system will be implemented in a system update for Nintendo Switch in late April, and will apply to the Nintendo Switch 2 as well.</p>
<p>We’ll hopefully have more details soon with a full FAQ to detail the changes, but there’s seemingly both upsides and downsides to this new system for individual and family uses. However, it does seem appropriate to address this, given the likelihood of a lot of people having two generations of console in the relatively near future…</p>

			<p>A complete overhaul of the Nintendo Switch digital game system will come next month with the launch of the Virtual Game Cards system.</p>
<p>Revealed during today's Nintendo Direct, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWwyh74MXXY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the new system</a>, which will launch in April and will be fully compatible with the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2, will completely change the way digital game purchases are handled across different systems. Upon purchasing a digital game via the eShop, the game will be loaded onto the console as a Virtual Game Card, which can be virtually ejected from one console and inserted into another to allow the same digital game to be used on different systems. Games on a single Virtual Game Card can also be arranged between consoles and can even be lent to be used with other Nintendo Accounts that are part of a family group by transferring games between consoles using a local connection. These games will be playable for two weeks before being returned to the original owner.</p>

<p>As the new Virtual Game Cards system will be fully compatible with the Nintendo Switch 2, it will be interesting to see if it will impact how the console will handle <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-confirmed-to-be-backward-compatible/">backward-compatible digital games</a>. More information on the matter is likely to come next week during the long-anticipated Nintendo Direct focused on the system.</p>

Nintendo unveiled a new trailer for the game that serves as an introduction of sorts, showcasing the alien world you’ll be exploring along with Samus’ various abilities, including new psychic powers that work both in combat and in puzzle solving. While no specific release date was announced, the game is due out in 2025 for the Switch.</p><p><em>Beyond</em> has been in development for a quite a while. It was originally announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/13/15782806/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-announced-e3-2017">in 2017</a> shortly after the launch of the original Nintendo Switch, but in early 2019, Nintendo announced that it was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18197164/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-delay-release-date">rebooting the game’s development</a> and bringing on Retro Studios to make it.</p><p>Last year, Nintendo finally debuted a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23768041/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-direct-trailer">gameplay trailer for it</a> and announced the <em>Beyond</em> subtitle. That trailer had some clear <em>Metroid Prime</em> DNA — intense firefights and scanning things! But at the time, the company only provided a vague 2025 release date for the upcoming game.</p><p>The first Switch was actually a great platform for <em>Metroid</em> games, with the thrilling <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22710468/metroid-dread-review-nintendo-switch">2D <em>Metroid Dread</em></a> and a very-good <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/9/23592822/metroid-prime-remastered-nintendo-switch-best-way-classic">remastered version of the original <em>Metroid Prime</em></a>. You can also play the original <em>Metroid</em>, <em>Metroid II: Return of Samus</em>, <em>Super Metroid</em>, <em>Metroid Fusion</em>, and <em>Metroid: Zero Mission</em> via Nintendo Switch Online.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Nintendo says any registered user on the console can play that digital game. </p><p>The real news is that these VGCs can be “digitally ejected” and “digitally loaded”  into another Switch console and freely played on that second device. The original Switch user that bought the game can’t play that VGC anymore as it’s been “ejected” from the console. </p><p>The company promises that you are free to load and trade digital games using VGCs freely between two specific, paired systems. Think an upstairs Switch and downstairs Switch 2.  You will need to locally connect the two consoles the first time you do some digital swapping, but after that it should be easy and hassle free. </p><p>You can also share Virtual Game Cards with members of your Nintendo Account Family Group. However, this is a bit more limited. It must be done over a local wireless connection, and you can only lend one game at a time to each member. And after two weeks, they lose access to the Virtual Game Card and it returns back to original owner. Better hope it’s not a long game!</p><p>Nintendo claims this new system will make digital games even easier to use. And this new system will also work with the Nintendo Switch 2, as confirmed by the company during the Direct. But it does seem like a very Nintendo solution to a problem Xbox and others solved already. Still, I’m happy to see Nintendo doing something to make it easier to play owned digital games on multiple devices as we get closer to the launch of Switch 2. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Hopefully we still get HD remasters of <em>Metroid Prime 2</em> and<em> 3</em> on Switch before then. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Nintendo has officially unveiled Virtual Game Cards today: a new, easier way to share digital games between two Switch consoles. With this new feature, Nintendo aims to make games purchased digitally “as flexible and convenient” as physical game cards.</p>







<p>Virtual Game Cards were announced today <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-direct-march-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a Nintendo Direct</a>. In the future, all games purchased on the Nintendo Switch digitally will be loaded onto the system as a Virtual Game Card. These cards can be “loaded” and “ejected” onto a second Nintendo Switch system (under the same account) using an internet connection. The two Switches only need to be linked locally once, and an internet connection is only needed during the load and eject phases. The new feature will also support Virtual Game Card swaps between a Nintendo Switch and a Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>The new Virtual Game Cards also provide enhanced features to family group managers. Virtual Game Cards can be lent out to a Nintendo account’s <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/products/detail/p/989?_gl=1*1dv082h*_gcl_au*MTc5MTU0MzU5LjE3NDMwODcwMzE.*_ga*NzE2NTIxOTAxLjE3NDMwODcwMzU.*_ga_F6ERC4HMNZ*MTc0MzA4NzAzNC4xLjAuMTc0MzA4NzA2MS4wLjAuMA.." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">family group</a> members, but only for up to two weeks, after which they will return to the original account’s Switch. The Nintendo account can only share one game at a time with one specific family group member, and the Switches also need to be locally linked once before swapping.</p>

<p>This new feature will be added via a system update in late April. For parents with multi-Switch households, this is welcome news, as they no longer have to manage multiple libraries and purchase games across multiple Switches. All they have to manage is their own library, and they can lend their Virtual Game Cards to members of their family group. </p>



<p>Will you be lending out Virtual Game Cards to Nintendo Switch users when this feature launches in late April? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>Pokémon games are no stranger to innovating gameplay mechanics. The March 2025 Nintendo Direct revealed this to be the case as a new Pokémon Legends Z-A gameplay video showed off new features, including day and night gameplay, and Z-A Royale.</p>



<p>Don’t panic, even though I’ve mentioned the word “Royale,” there’s no emphasis on battle royale here. Z-A Royale ties into the new day and night cycle introduced in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-platforms-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a>. Previous games have tinkered with the idea of dynamic daily cycles, but few have changed the gameplay in such a way.</p>



<p>The newest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-direct-march-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Direct</a> showed us what we’re in for, and Legends Z-A looks mouth-watering.</p>



<h2 id="h-day-and-night-gameplay-changes-pokemon-legends-z-a">Day and Night Gameplay Changes Pokémon Legends Z-A</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Better earn those wins. Credit to The Pokémon Company </figcaption></figure>



<p>The March 27 gameplay trailer showed us a lot of what we’ve seen from <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-video-games/pokemon-legends-z-a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a> already: The real-time action of Pokémon-catching and Trainer-battling antics. We also know that Pokémon are hiding all over Lumiose City—even on the rooftops.</p>



<p>But now we’ve seen what’s lurking in the city at night. Once the sun goes down, Z-A Royale begins. Trainers come out at night to fight in new Battle Zones.</p>



<p>Trainers are classified with ranks, signifying their status in the new Z-A Royale league system. You need to work your way from Z to A, and you can do so with the newly confirmed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-will-bring-27-new-mega-evolutions-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mega Evolutions</a> we reported a few days ago.</p>



<p>We know <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-reportedly-not-adding-any-new-pokemon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends Z-A reportedly isn’t adding new Pokémon</a>, which is a shame. But the new features make up for this, and it’s still set to launch in 2025.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Marvelous Entertainment announced Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-march-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6377/" data-ref-id="2900-6377">March 2025 Nintendo Direct</a>. The title is a remake of the 2008 Nintendo DS game Harvest Moon: Grand Bazaar. The Story of Seasons remake launches for Nintendo Switch on August 27, 2025. Previous Story of Season remakes, including Friends of Mineral Town, launched on PC and other platforms, though Marvelous didn't say whether Grand Bazaar will as well.</p><p dir="ltr">Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar drops you in a run-down town whose glory days as a center of commerce are long gone. Rather than just running a farm and becoming the center of village life, your goal in Grand Bazaar is revitalizing the marketplace by selling the best items you produce and contributing to everyone else's success as well. The Grand Bazaar remake trailer showcased a visual overhaul--the original 2.5D is replaced with full, detailed 3D models--and sound clips, along with a new way to travel around the valley via a wind glider. Marvelous also said the remake will feature new characters and new events.</p><p dir="ltr">Other remakes, including Friends of Mineral Town, tweaked relationship systems to be more inclusive and added quality-of-life improvements as well, though Marvelous didn't outline other improvements in the reveal.</p>

The rhythm-game series hasn't seen a new title since 2015's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/rhythm-heaven-megamix/" data-ref-id="5000-387128">Rhythm Heaven Megamix</a>, but fans of the musical franchise will be waiting a little while longer, since Rhythm Heaven Groove isn't being released until 2026.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4466443-nintendodirect3.27.2025%E2%80%93nintendoswitch53-43screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4466443" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4466443-nintendodirect3.27.2025%E2%80%93nintendoswitch53-43screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4466443"></a><figcaption>A skipping game in Rhythm Heaven Groove</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4466443-nintendodirect3.27.2025%E2%80%93nintendoswitch53-43screenshot.png"></figure><p>In Rhythm Heaven games, players complete minigames with rhythm mechanics where the gameplay focuses on audio rather than visual cues. Following the rhythm through the level, you're given a score based on your accuracy. Usually, the games are grouped into four or six minigames comprising of predominantly main stages and concluding with a remix. The remix is a compilation or twist on the last few games in the set, all compiled into one level with a different song. In later games, the remixes would feature levels from former Rhythm Games titles.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4466442-rhythm-heaven-groove.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4466442" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4466442-rhythm-heaven-groove.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4466442"></a><figcaption>Rhythm Heaven Groove title screen</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4466442-rhythm-heaven-groove.jpg"></figure><p>Depending on your rhythm and accuracy, the game will rank you one of three titles. Being told to "Try Again" is a failure and demands a repeat of the level. Getting a "Try Again" rank three times in a row usually triggers the option to skip the stage. The "OK" rank is a pass, but only just. The "Superb" rank is reserved for players who have excelled at the stage, and will earn a medal. The medals can be used to unlock additional game modes, including endless games, and makes players eligible to participate in randomly selected Perfect Campaigns, where missing even one beat will cause the level to fail and restart. With only three chances to complete a Perfect Campaign, it's the highest-pressure version of Rhythm Heaven on offer.</p><p>The Rhythm Heaven series began on the Game Boy Advance in 2006 and has been predominantly released on Nintendo consoles since, including the Nintendo DS, 3DS, and Wii. Rhythm Heaven Groove, as the fifth entry in the series, will be the first Rhythm Heaven game to be released on a Switch console. With a 2026 release date, it could also be coming to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/" data-ref-id="5005-154">Switch 2</a>, though that wasn't announced.</p><p>You can find more of the biggest announcements from the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-march-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6377/" data-ref-id="2900-6377">March 2025 Nintendo Direct </a>in our dedicated article.</p>

Nintendo has unveiled a new feature for Switch and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> that'll let players share their digital games with another console or Family Group members in the same way they might swap a physical cartridge. It's called Virtual Game Card and it's coming to Switch 1 in "late April".
</p>
<p>
Here's how it works: once the feature becomes available, any digital purchase made will be added to the associated Switch as a Virtual Game Card. By default, any registered users on the main console can play the game, just as they would with any other digital purchase. But there's obviously more to it than that.
</p>
<p>
Virtual Game Cards are managed on a separate screen, with players able to chose whether they're considered 'loaded' or 'ejected'. An ejected Virtual Game Card can, firstly, be played on a second Switch that's owned by the same main account holder - with users able to freely eject and load cartridges between up to two owned machines. Nintendo notes local communication with the other console is required to enable the feature for the first time.
</p>

<p>
However, Virtual Game Cards can also be lent to anyone within a Nintendo Account Family Group, which can support up to eight Nintendo Account users. Again, this initially requires the lending user to connect to the Family Group member's console locally, after which it's simply a case of choosing the title being lent and who it's being lent to.
</p>
<p>
Only one game at a time can be lent to each member within a Family Group and only for a total of 14 days. After the two weeks comes to an end, a Virtual Game Card will be automatically be returned to its original owner. Expect the Virtual Game Card system to feature in much the same way on Switch 2 when it releases later this year.
</p>
<p>
And speaking of which, we're less than a week away from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-direct-confirmed-for-april-with-more-info-following-todays-brief-reveal">Nintendo's long-awaited Switch 2 Direct</a>, which should provide details on everything from launch titles to a release date for Nintendo's hugely anticipated next machine. Things kick off next Wednesday, 2nd April, at 2pm in the UK - and we'll be keeping tabs on all the important stuff with fingers and eyes.

		<p>Nintendo featured a new trailer for Pokémon Legends: Z-A during the latest Nintendo Direct, giving a look at another, darkerside of the city of Lumios that is the main setting for the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A – Nintendo Direct 3.27.2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tezs2FsIxgA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The trailer covers a lot of ground for what we’ve previously seen of the game, such as the Wild Zones that Pokémon tend to live in within the city – supposedly safe havens, but not when you’re around and have a Pokéball or two… hundred in your pocket. If they’re hostile to this (and why wouldn’t they be?) then you’ve got the overhauled real time combat to indulge in, and the return of Mega Evolutions.</p>
<p>However, Pokémon Z-A will also feature a day-night cycle, and things get much trickier after night. At this time, more challenging rival trainers will emerge to take part in the Z-A Royale, adding a little extra peril to your battling.</p>
<p>Once again, there’s no sign that the gameplay here was captured on anything but a base Nintendo Switch. The trailer only mentions the Switch and uses only the first generation Switch console logo. We obviously expect the game will run on the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> – Nintendo has confirmed backward compatibility – but there’s no mention of Switch 2 enhancements at this time.</p>

		<p>Nintendo shared a new gameplay and story trailer for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, the latest entry in the popular third person take on the genre-defining series. Psychic abilities? A mysterious red and black suit? Tasty…</p>
<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is currently only confirmed for Nintendo Switch and a 2025 release.</p>
<p><iframe title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond – Nintendo Direct 3.27.2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nmwAhBxakw4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond takes Samus to the planet Viewros, trapping her in a jungle with a giant tree at its heart. You’ll scan relics and statues to find the paths forward, while also running into hostile alien creatures that live in the gloom.</p>
<p>Samus naturally has her suit and weapons, which will be enhanced over the course of the game, but there’s also new psychic abilities that will be granted to Samus – she’s got a new story arc as a “chosen one” it seems, which is a bit generic. These could be used to manipulate energy balls and mechanisms in environment, but can also apply in combat, being used to guide the trajectory of weapons fire to hit the target.</p>

<p>Confirmed for release this year, there’s plenty speculation that Metroid Prime 4 will be a cross-gen launch game for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, especially with Nintendo still avoiding pinning an exact date on the game’s launch. Perhaps a second news drop will come next week at the Switch 2 Direct?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/06/13/metroid-prime-4-in-development-for-nintendo-switch/">Metroid Prime 4 was first announced back at E3 2017</a> but the project did not progress as well as expected and was not meeting the company’s high standards in its initial form. As such, they taken the drastic measure of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/01/25/nintendo-reboot-metroid-prime-4-development-with-retro-studios/">restarting the project in 2019</a> with series producer Kensuke Tanabe reuniting with Retro Studios, who had first revitalised the Metroid series with the original Metroid Prime game on GameCube.</p>
<p>While that has slowly but surely come together, there’s been the popular launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/06/metroid-dread-review-switch/">Metroid Dread</a> in 2022, as well as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/10/metroid-prime-remastered-is-a-perfect-reminder-of-this-gamecube-great/">Metroid Prime Remastered</a> in early 2023. Both wetted the appetite for more Metroid games for fans, and it’s great to see Metroid Prime 4’s development has come far enough for Nintendo to pin a release date on it. We can’t wait to see more, though.</p>

			<p>New Metroid Prime 4: Beyond gameplay footage was shared today, providing a new look at the next entry in the series.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmwAhBxakw4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The new footage</a>, shown during today's Nintendo Direct presentation, shows Samus Aran as she lands on Planet Viewros and takes on the many challenges she will find on her journey using mechanics seen in previous entries in the series, such as scanning. The new footage also provided a new look at combat, showing Samus fighting against multiple alien creatures.</p>
<p>The new Metroid Prime 4: Beyond footage also introduced new abilities called Psychic Abilities, which promise to spice up the series' experience considerably. Thanks to these abilities, Samus can operate mechanisms, open doors, and even control the trajectory of beams using the power of her mind. The footage doesn't show a lot of these abilities and their usage, but the possibilities look rather intriguing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the new Metroid Prime 4: Beyond footage didn't confirm the game's release date, which is still scheduled for a generic 2025 release window. With the Nintendo Switch 2 launching this year with full backward compatibility, it wouldn't be surprising to see the game launch alongside the next-generation Nintendo console.</p>

<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond launches on a yet-to-be-confirmed <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-first-trailer-release-date/">2025 release date</a> on Nintendo Switch. We will keep you updated on the game as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

<p>Metroid Prime 4 is alive and well after it was shown off during the March 2025 Nintendo Direct Presentation. It didn’t reveal a precise release date, but we know it’s still locked in for 2025.</p>



<p>As it was predicted, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-wont-be-at-nintendo-switch-2-direct-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metroid Prime 4 Beyond was not shown off during the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a> Showcase. However, Nintendo’s end-of-life Direct—showing off new games and remakes—revealed new gameplay for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-announced-for-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metroid Prime 4 Beyond</a>.</p>



<p>Samus is coming for Metroids and Space Pirates this year.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Pretty. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>One of the biggest reveals during the March 2025 Nintendo Direct was easily <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/Metroid-Prime-4-Beyond-2593922.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Metroid Prime 4 Beyond</a>. The long-awaited sequel was in the wilderness for many years. But June 18 finally gave us a real glimpse of what the developer has been working on, and now we’ve seen more.</p>



<p>The latest gameplay trailer revealed the new Planet Viewros we’ll be traversing, along with new powers, abilities, and weapons. The most eye-catching inclusion is psychic powers, which allow Samus to manipulate the environment, which should make for new and exciting puzzles.</p>



<p>Even though the Nintendo Switch is at the end of its lifecycle, Metroid Prime 4 still looks mightily impressive. The techno soundtrack and thrilling action look like everything we’ve come to know and love about the franchise.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the trailer still states it’s “<strong>Coming 2025</strong>,” so we’ll hopefully learn more throughout the year. Stay tuned for updates, and check out the new gameplay trailer below.</p>

                <p>During today's Switch-focused Nintendo Direct livestream, Nintendo revealed a new trailer for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-everything-we-know/1100-6492292/" data-ref-id="1100-6492292">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>. The trailer was a narrated deep dive with lots of gameplay detailing the new game. The game is still slated for 2025, but no new release date was given.</p><p>The trailer showed Samus exploring a jungle planet with a colossal tree at the center. She has to scan stone figures to make her way through the thick forest while dealing with hostile bug-like aliens. But she'll be helped along by new Psychic abilities, like telekinesis for puzzle-solving and making her way through doors. It seems as if some psychic force is helping her along, and at one point it calls her a "Chosen One." The trailer ends with a brief look at a slick new red and white suit.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Metroid Prime 4: Beyond - Official Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The wait for Metroid Prime 4 has been excruciating for fans of the franchise. The game was first announced during E3 2017, but there was a prolonged period of radio silence after that initial announcement. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4s-development-restarted-with-retro-/1100-6464593/">Development on the game was reportedly rebooted in 2019</a>, and Nintendo went silent for several years on the status of the next Metroid Prime adventure, filling the gap with Metroid Dread in 2021 and a remaster of the first Metroid Prime game in 2023.</p><p>2024 also saw a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-re-emerges-reiterates-2025-release/1100-6527895/">trailer for Metroid Prime 4</a> released, but it was light on details at the time.

First footage of Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2 HD-2D Remake has been revealed, following last year's Dragon Quest 3 remake.
</p>
<p>
While that game ends with a tease of future remakes after the credits, the footage shown at today's Nintendo Direct is the first look at gameplay.
</p>
<p>
The two games will come as a pair, set to release later this year. Though revealed for Switch, the game will also be coming to PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S as with the previous game.

<p>
Why out of order? Dragon Quest 3 was a prequel to the first two to complete what's known as the Erdrick trilogy. So while DQ 1 &amp; 2 were released earlier, DQ 3 is chronologically the first so was the starting point for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s remakes.
</p>
<p>
The company will have high hopes for sales of Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2 HD-2D Remake. The remake of Dragon Quest 3 became the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-already-best-selling-game-in-japan-for-2024-after-just-one-week">best-selling game of 2024 in Japan after just one week</a>.
</p>
<p>
A couple of weeks later, Square Enix announced <a href="https://x.com/DragonQuest/status/1864846226392588539">2m sales globally</a>, while at its following earnings report it stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-exceeded-square-enix-expectations-but-game-sales-drop-overall">the game exceeded expectations</a>.

            <p>
At today's Nintendo Direct, we finally got a first proper look at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a>: Beyond gameplay.
</p>
<p>
It takes place on the Planet Viewros and promises the start of a new story. Most interestingly, Samus will be given new psychic abilities.
</p>
<p>
There's still no firm release date beyond 2025, but the game's inclusion at this Direct - focused solely on the original Switch console - confirms it will be released on the older system. A <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> version is yet to be announced.

<p>
So what about those psychic abilities? The trailer explains Samus can use them to operate mechanisms from afar, open doors, and even control the trajectory of beams in slow motion.
</p>
<p>
Beyond that, Metroid Prime 4 is more 3D Metroid in first-person. So far only a verdant jungle biome has been shown, with Samus scanning flora and fauna, rolling in morph ball form, and shooting alien creatures with her beam weapon.
</p>
<p>
The trailer ends with Metroid in a new scarlet suit, with a mysterious voice stating: "We place our faith in you, Chosen One".
</p>
<p>
Metroid Prime 4 will follow the excellent remaster of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime">Metroid Prime</a> released on Switch in 2023. There's still no news of similar remasters for Metroid Prime 2 and 3.
