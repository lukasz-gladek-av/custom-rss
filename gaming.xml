<figure><a title="Dear me, I was... Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157710/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>A common complaint levied against visual novels is that they’re some of the most text-heavy games one can find on the market. Who wants to spend hours upon hours reading dialogue during precious gaming time? Answer: me, and plenty of other people, but it’s a valid perspective to consider. Visual <em>novels</em> are generally wordy beasts with extended runtimes, which can make their appeal rather limited. That makes the occasional outlier that bucks genre conventions all the more intriguing.</p>
<p>Such is the case with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dear-me-i-was">Dear me, I was…</a>, a fresh <em>visual</em> novel from the minds at Arc System Works that eschews written or spoken dialogue in favour of relying on visuals and music to tell its narrative. It’s a bold stylistic move, but the heartfelt tale that this game weaves stands as a testament to how much a story can say without saying anything at all.</p>
<figure><a title="Dear me, I was... Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157711/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Over the course of its roughly hour-long runtime, Dear me, I was… chronicles the life of an unnamed woman from her early childhood years to adulthood and beyond. The narrative jumps between pivotal points in the protagonist’s life, capturing snapshot moments of joy and sorrow as she develops connections with the world and people around her. Most importantly, it depicts her lifelong journey as an artist and the way in which her relationship with this creative medium evolves as the years go by.</p>
<p>It’s a simple, grounded story devoid of the major twists or melodrama one might expect from the genre, but that’s entirely by design. The woman’s life is one that the average player can likely relate to on some level, and that makes her struggles, discoveries, and experiences all the more resonant. I was genuinely caught off guard by how hard some of the emotional moments hit me, in spite of the game’s abbreviated length. The story tackles themes of loss and self-doubt with an impressive degree of realism and restraint, which makes its heavier beats feel earned rather than coming off as cheap tearjerker attempts.</p>
<figure><a title="Dear me, I was... Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157714/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, the core story of Dear me, I was… is elevated considerably by its unique presentation. With art director Taisuke Kanasaki at the helm, the game’s visual identity evokes shades of Cing classics like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/hotel_dusk_room_215">Hotel Dusk</a> and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/another_code_recollection">Another Code</a> series. This title features an elegant, painterly art style with heavy use of watercolours. Tonal shifts in the story are accompanied by movement between vibrant full colour, cooler blue-and-grey, and black-and-white palettes — a clever way of visually expressing the protagonist’s emotional state.</p>
<p>Characters also display an impressive degree of fluid movements and nuanced expressions thanks to the use of rotoscoping of the live-action cast for animation. These detailed visuals, combined with the melancholy tones of the piano-oriented soundtrack, add another layer of richness and depth to the story while simultaneously keeping everything expressive enough to clearly convey the narrative without words.</p>
<p>In terms of gameplay, Dear me, I was… features a touch of interactivity through the incorporation of basic point-and-click sections. Throughout each chapter, the occasional sequence sees you performing basic actions like eating breakfast or drawing a sketch. You have your choice of button controls, touch controls, or even the Switch 2’s built-in Joy-Con 2 mouse controls for these portions, which is neat.</p>

<p>That said, these scenes usually amount to little more than clicking somewhere on the screen once or twice without much in the way of game essence. Rather, the occasional interactive element serves as a means to deepen the player’s connection with the protagonist’s story by having them perform small actions to progress it. I’m fine with that limited degree of player input, though I would have appreciated some more creativity for these interactive sequences in the vein of the puzzles from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/florence">Florence</a> — a game with a similar tone and format.</p>
<p>All in all, Dear me, I was… is quite the enjoyable audio-visual experience — which, unfortunately, makes its incredibly short duration a bit of a bummer. While it’s priced accordingly and manages to tell a touching little tale in a very limited timespan, it’s tough for me not to feel like I breezed through the whole thing in the blink of an eye. It’s concise almost to a fault, and there are portions of the plot where slowing things down a bit and letting certain story beats breathe could have resulted in an even more compelling narrative.</p>
<figure><a title="Dear me, I was... Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157715/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I suppose that’s part of the game’s point, though — life goes by quickly. Perhaps the fact that I was left wanting more of Dear me, I was… speaks more to the quality of its content than any other compliments I could give it.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In some ways, it feels counterintuitive to write a review of Dear me, I was… — a title which centres upon capturing heavy feelings that can’t be so easily put into words. However, it’s not every day that a visual novel successfully manages to craft a moving narrative about art, life, and the passage of time solely on the merit of its visual and musical storytelling.</p>
<p>Even if the game itself remains silent, Dear me, I was… is worth talking about.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A lot of thought went into when to release Battlefield 6, but EA continued to target this Fall, regardless of Grand Theft Auto VI.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/battlefield-6-release-date-sims-movie-ea-laura-miele-interview-1236475794/">Variety</a>, EA Entertainment president Laura Miele commented on the release date of the highly anticipated next entry in the first-person shooter series, saying that they <em>"have always have been heads down, unblinking about this fall and executing at a level of excellence,"</em> working hard with the development team to not get distracted by anything else happening around them. With the level of effort and investement put into the game, however, the last thing the publisher wanted was to put Battlefield 6 in harm's way or too close to the release of something really large, so EA did have their eye on Grand Theft Auto VI, and were thinking about different scenarios, but weren't allowing these scenarios to impact schedules or development.</p>



<p>The confidence EA is showing in Battlefield 6 definitely seems to be warranted. Kai recently had the chance to try out the game and has found it to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-hands-on-impressions/">a return to proper form</a> after the blunders of the last entries in the series. </p>



<p><em>In a lot of ways, Battlefield 6 is how DICE and Ripple Effect have listened to the feedback from fans and brought back the massive squad shooter in a proper return to form. Despite the mayhem of crumbling infrastructure, this is exactly what I’ve wanted out of Battlefield multiplayer since the days of Operation Metro and Strike at Karkand. Massive maps with the flow of infantry, tanks, and jets all coordinating in tandem, and the constant chatter of squadmates calling for revives or ammo packs.</em></p>



<p>Battlefield 6 launches on <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-october-10-pre-orders-open-two-open-beta-weekends/">October 10</a> for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> is pretty sure plenty of people will hate his upcoming release OD, but he is ok with that in the short term.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-teases-xbox-horror-od-with-enigmatic-first-trailer">Xbox horror game OD was first announced back in 2023</a>, though Kojima stopped short of actually telling us all that much about it. Sophia Lillis, Hunter Schafer and Udo Kier are all tied to the project, and there is also some involvement with director Jordan Peele, who is known for his films Get Out and Nope.</p>
<p>Otherwise, Kojima said it's "a game and at the same time a movie and at the same time a new form of media", so make of that what you will.</p>

<p>The game creator has now shared a little bit more about OD, though I really do mean a little. In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.ssense.com/en-us/editorial/culture/hideo-kojima-death-stranding-interview">Ssense</a>, Kojima said OD was "something totally different", and people are going to either "love it or hate it".</p>
<p>The publication added Kojima will of course digest all the various reactions to OD when it comes out, citing platforms like YouTube and X, but as for the actual reception to the game when it releases? Well, apparently that won't matter to Kojima, at least for another decade or so.</p>
<p>"The real evaluations come after - 10 or 20 years from now," Kojima told the publication. This attitude isn't new for Kojima. Earlier this year, following positive playtests for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-isnt-interested-in-appealing-to-the-mass-market-but-death-stranding-2-playtests-proving-popular">Kojima said he wasn't "interested in appealing to the mass market"</a>.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting, the critical reception to the first Death Stranding has warmed since its release, so perhaps we'll see the same with OD in future.</p>

<p>As well as OD on Xbox, Kojima also has an action-espionage game in the works with PlayStation known as Physint. This game came about when the designer - who is among many things known for his part in bringing the Metal Gear games to life - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-says-he-decided-to-make-physint-for-fans-after-sickness-made-him-reconsider-his-priorities">experienced a period of sickness and surgery which when combined with thoughts of his own mortality convinced him to reassess what his priorities are</a>, and instead do something fans had been asking him to do for years.</p>
<p>"Every day on social media, from users all around the world, people have been asking me to create another Metal Gear and stuff like that," Kojima said last year.</p>
<p>More recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review">Kojima released Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>, to wide acclaim. As for Konami's upcoming remake of the third Metal Gear Solid game, no, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-hideo-kojima-wont-be-playing-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Kojima will not be playing it</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/like-marmite-hideo-kojima-says-you-will-either-love-or-hate-od]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo’s latest quarterly report has come with the first sales figures for the Nintendo Switch 2, which is now confirmed to have set a towering new record for sales through the first month.</p>
<p>From its 5th June launch through to the end of the quarter on 30th June, the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> sold a whopping 5.82 million consoles globally, completely outpacing the PS5 and PS4 in the process – they took seven weeks to ship 4.5 million consoles, from their mid-November launches to the end of December. Of course, Sony was struggling to meet demand in 2020 through a semiconductor shortage, but this is still seriously impressive stuff.</p>


<p>Of course, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has also sold incredibly well, with a close to 100% attach rate. As the main exclusive title and primary reason to buy a Switch 2, and the fact that the game was bundled in as part of hardware bundles, the 5.63 million copies of Mario Kart World sold makes a 96.7% attach rate.</p>
<p>While the new console took the headlines, the original Nintendo Switch continues to plug away as well, with 0.98 million further sales in the last three months that bumps the total sales up to 153.10 million, and it is now sure to eclipse the Nintendo DS 154.02 million consoles sold by the end of this year. Given how sales are likely to tail off, it’s unlikely that the PS2’s 160 million will be overtaken, though.</p>

            <p>Avast, fellow salty sea-dogs. Some legally-minded landlubbers may have had words with Edward Kenway, captain of The Jackdaw and protagonist of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">Assassin's Creed: Black Flag</a>. Well, Kenway's voice actor Matt Ryan at any rate, who's been filmed at a convention saying that Ubisoft threatened to sue him over a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rumoured-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-seemingly-teased-by-actor-whos-pretty-chill-about-loose-lips-sinking-ships">previous video from another convention</a> in which he teased a remake of the game.</p>
<p>If you're out of the loop, this is the Black Flag remake the publisher haven't confirmed is coming, but has been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-might-be-remaking-their-swashbuckling-pirateventure-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">reported to be in development</a> several times over the past couple of years.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"I don't know, mate," Ryan said when asked about said remake in this latest instance of a convention goer pointing a phone at him while he signs stuff. "Well, the thing is, that when that happened, someone was doing this [points towards the phone filming this exchange], and I was being very free and open, but I didn't know that they actually were recording me on their phone. Then the company threatened to sue me. So, [now] I say nothing."</p>
<p>It's not quite clear whether Ryan's unaware he's being filmed this time around, as he does directly acknowledge that the convention goer who's doing so has their phone camera pointed at him. This latest clip was originally uploaded to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kylo_hd659/video/7532502046889528598">TikTok</a> and since looks to have been taken down there, but not before it was reposted onto what remains of Twitter.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Damn so it seems like Matt Ryan (voice actor for Edward Kenway) got into deep trouble with Ubisoft for hinting at the Black Flag Remake to that other guy..</p><p>He didn’t realize he was being recorded😵 <a href="https://t.co/2Vy8g6pMRr">pic.twitter.com/2Vy8g6pMRr</a></p></div>— The Hidden One (@TheHiddenOneAC) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheHiddenOneAC/status/1950940394310545618?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 31, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>We've reached out to Ubisoft for comment.</p>
<p>It's not nice to hear about anyone allegedly having Lionel Hutzes on their case over something like this, so here's hoping Ryan doesn't end up in any more hot water over this latest clip. If you approach him at a convention with your phone pointed right at his mug in the near future and try to chat Black Flag remakes, I'd expect he might have less to say.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-voice-actor-claims-ubisoft-threatened-to-sue-him-over-remake-tease]]></content:encoded>

<p>As satisfying as a successful real-time strategy game campaign can be, dealing with a complex RTS map can often be overwhelming. Keeping track of multiple far-flung resource-production bases, groups of units, upgrade trees, and surprise encounters with the enemy requires a level of attention-splitting that can strain even the best multitaskers.</p>
<p>Then there's <em>The King is Watching</em>, which condenses the standard real-time strategy production loop into an easy-to-understand single-screen interface, complete with automatic battles. The game's unique resource management system—combined with well-designed, self-balancing difficulty and randomized upgrades that keep each run fresh—makes <em>The King is Watching</em> one of the most enjoyable pick-up-and-play strategy titles I've encountered in a long time.</p>
<h2>What is the king watching, exactly?</h2>
<p>The bulk of the action in <em>The King is Watching</em> takes place on a small, 4x4 grid of squares representing your castle. That's where you'll place blueprint tiles from your hand that then start producing the basic and refined resources necessary to place even more blueprints. Those resources also power the factories that crank out defensive units that automatically fight to protect your castle from periodic waves of enemies (in adorable pixelated animations that take place on a battlefield to the right of your castle).</p>
<figure>
    <div id="caption-2109618"><p>
              A lot of good resource tiles there, but the king can only look at five squares at a time here.

                                  </p>
                          </div>
          <figcaption>
        <div>

          </p>
  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>Sounds simple enough. But the entire castle can't be actively productive at once. Instead, only a few contiguous tiles within the area of the "king's gaze" can make resources and/or units at any one time.</p>
<p>That means you have to constantly and actively drag and rotate your "gaze" around your castle, prioritizing the resources and units you need immediately and leaving others that can wait for the king's attention. You have to be careful with the relative positioning of your blueprints so that units and resources that complement each other can be produced in the same "gaze" without a lot of unproductive downtime (say, when you've hit your unit limit) or resource droughts.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>You might start off with one corner of the grid devoted to basic resources and another to basic unit production, shifting your gaze quickly between the two as your unit numbers and/or resource stockpiles dwindle. Later, you might add a market to generate the gold you'll need for the squares that produce stronger units or a crystal mine that will help supply powerful magical units you create later in the run.</p>
<figure>
    <div id="caption-2109617"><p>
              If you can upgrade all the way to a Tesla towers (seen here), you're probably in OK shape...

          </p>
  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>You might also invest your treasure in upgrades that make certain tiles produce more quickly or on global upgrades that expand your gaze or let you station more troops on the field at once. And as your grid fills up, you must figure out which underpowered or less-useful tiles to destroy to make space for the more powerful blueprints you've hopefully earned or generated to replace them.</p>

<h2>Try to keep up</h2>
<p>Shifting your gaze and adjusting your production tiles plays out like a simple puzzle game, requiring effective juggling of both time and space to be maximally efficient. You need to constantly split your attention between your present resource and unit needs and your near- and far-future plans for upgrades. As frantic as this can get, it never feels unmanageable, thanks in large part to an excellent user interface that packs practically everything you need to know onto a single screen, no camera-fiddling or complex keyboard shortcuts required.</p>
<p><em>The King is Watching</em> also makes use of an ingenious kind of partially self-selecting difficulty system, where you periodically pick from a randomized set of "prophecies" to "predict" how many and which enemies will come in the next few waves (and which potential upgrades they might give you when they're gone). This leads to a delightfully fraught balance of risk and reward, forcing you to ride the edge of survivability in each wave. Choose too many enemies and you could be overwhelmed before your defensive units are built up. Choose too few and you won't earn the requisite upgrades needed to work through the overpowered boss waves later.</p>

          
                  </div>

      </figure>

<p>Those inter-wave upgrades are also randomized in each run, adding some roguelike unpredictability that means no two play sessions develop quite the same way. You have to be flexible, adapting to the blueprints and units you're given, while being willing to abandon plans that are no longer feasible.</p>
<p>Between waves, you'll often get the opportunity to buy emergency resource drops, useful upgrades that last through the whole run, or one-time spells that can strengthen your units or hinder the opposition. Figuring out the best potential upgrade paths requires a lot of trial and error, and you'll need a little luck in drawing some of the more powerful upgrade options. While experience and skill can make things more manageable, some runs end up a lot more winnable than others.</p>
<p>Playing through successful waves also earns you tokens you can spend between runs on permanent upgrades (including crucial expansions of that 4x4 grid) and new selectable kings with their own unique gaze shapes and special powers. But even as these upgrades make it easier to succeed in successive runs, the game cranks up the "threat level" in turn to raise the enemy strength level (and the stakes) accordingly.</p>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CZXjQRcu2B8?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p></figure>
<p>That kind of self-balancing means <em>The King is Watching</em> always manages to feel engaging without coming off as totally unfair. And individual runs are zippy enough to not wear out their welcome; you can make it through a full run of two or three bosses in about 30 minutes or so, especially if you use the "fast forward" option to speed up the routine resource production between enemy waves.</p>
<p>Best of all, those 30 minutes are so dense with important decisions and split-second management of your kingly gaze that you never have time to feel bored. <em>The King is Watching</em> perfectly rides the fine line between engrossing and overwhelming, making it perfect for quick, lunch-break-sized brain breaks that combine positional reasoning, reflexes, and strategic planning.</p>

He also claimed the country is still "yearning" for an anchor in the form of a large employer that can help spread expertise through the area.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The challenges facing devs in the region, however, are slightly different from the ones encountered by Provost when he was kickstarting Compulsion in Canada.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/the-methodical-marketing-beats-behind-overnight-success-balatro" target="_self" data-discover="true">How Balatro publisher Playstack delivered a marketing masterclass</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"When I started in 2009 the biggest problem was getting on shelves in Walmart.

"We build all of our trailers internally, for example. We make that part of our pre-production pipeline.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Rockstar Games is reportedly planning to implement age verification in GTA Online to play the game or access some of the online game's features.</p>



<p>As reported by Tez2 on X, users may need to verify their age in the future to play the game or access certain features like phone messages, text chat, and Snapmatic. Tez2 couldn't say which regions could be targeted for these age verification checks, but there's little doubt players in the UK will be the first to be impacted by age verification if it goes into effect, considering the enforcement of the Online Safety Act is expected to ramp up in the coming months.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Jokes aside, Rockstar is planning to implement age assurance checks in the near future, rolling them out by region.</p><p>You may need to verify your age to access <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GTAOnline?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GTAOnline</a>, or certain features, like phone messages, text chat, Snapmatic, may be restricted until you verify your age. <a href="https://t.co/v0wLwV8nyh">https://t.co/v0wLwV8nyh</a> <a href="https://t.co/QYVaydlbhZ">pic.twitter.com/QYVaydlbhZ</a></p></div>— Tez2 (@TezFunz2) <a href="https://twitter.com/TezFunz2/status/1951058585359634459?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 31, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Although age checks are yet to become mandatory, select publishers and developers already started implementing some form of age verification ahead of time, like Roblox and Epic Games, to prevent younger players from accessing to some features like voice and or text chat, so it wouldn't be surprising for Rockstar Games to do the same in GTA Online, considering the game is constantly under intense scrutiny due to its setting and content. As the developer is also said to be working on a new version of their online game to coincide with the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-online-sold-separately-30-fps-target/">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> next year, it will be interesting to see how age verification will impact this new project in some way.</p>



<p>GTA Online is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One. You can learn more about the game's latest updates on its official website.</p>

                <p>The first big game of the Switch 2 era has emerged, as Nintendo has sold almost as many units of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/" data-ref-id="5000-658545">Mario Kart World</a> as actual Switch 2 consoles. In its Q1 financial results for the three months that ended on June 30, <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250801_2e.pdf" rel="nofollow ">Nintendo reported</a> that it had sold 8.67 million units, with Mario Kart World being responsible for 5.63 million of those sales. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-sales-blast-past-expectations-now-6-million-globally/1100-6533625/" data-ref-id="1100-6533625">This is almost as many units sold as Switch 2 consoles sold</a>, indicating a very high attach rate.</p><p>To put this into context, it is worth noting that Nintendo launched the Switch 2 with a bundle deal that included Mario Kart World. Given that the game has an MSRP of $80--and Nintendo rarely drops the price on its evergreen titles--it did make financial sense to grab the bundle and save $30 in the process.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Mario Kart World – Official Gameplay Reveal Trailer | Nintendo Switch 2</p>
      </div>
<p>The game also has a long way to go before it dethrones Nintendo's best-selling game of all time, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. The Switch game has reached lifetime sales of 68.86 million units, but these are still very early days for Mario Kart World. There will be some competition on the way with Drag X Drive, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, and Pokemon Legends: Z-A this year, but it'll be interesting to see if Mario Kart World will enjoy the same level of longevity as its predecessor. There are also plenty of third-party games on the way, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-july-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6828/">as this week's Nintendo Direct</a> showed off 25 games headed to the Switch 2 throughout the year and well into 2026.</p><p>Overall, business is good for Nintendo as sales during the quarter that ended on June 30 reached roughly $3.8 billion and operating profit grew 4% to $378 million. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-reveals-how-many-switch-2-consoles-it-expects-to-sell-during-its-first-year/1100-6531389/">Nintendo is still predicting that it'll sell 15 million Switch 2 consoles</a> by March 2026, even during turbulent financial times brought on by US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs.</p>

            <p>Nintendo sold 5.82m <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> consoles worldwide in its first month of release and 5.63m copies of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, meaning the launch title has an attachment rate of around 97 percent.</p>
<p>The figures come from <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html">Nintendo's latest earnings release</a> as of 30th June, where the company added software sales for Switch 2 reached 8.67m units in that same period. That means Mario Kart World accounts for 65 percent of all software sales on the new console.</p>
<p>Nintendo added, in the seven weeks since launch, the Switch 2 has sold over 6m units worldwide. Even so, Nintendo has noted demand is exceeding supply in many countries.</p>

<p>Clearly the console and racing game bundle has proven a popular option for customers. Mario Kart World was the primary launch game for the new console, and was also available to buy separately.</p>
<p>Shortly after the console's launch, Nintendo announced the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-is-nintendos-fastest-selling-hardware-ever">Switch 2 was the company's fastest-selling hardware ever</a>, moving 3.5m units worldwide in its first four days on sale. Last week, it was reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-has-become-the-fastest-selling-video-game-hardware-device-in-us-history-usurping-the-ps4">Switch 2 is the fastest-selling video game hardware device in the US</a>, beating the PS4.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, sales of the original Switch console have now reached 153.10m units.</p>
<p>This year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-expects-switch-1-to-become-its-best-selling-hardware-ever-this-year-but-fall-just-short-of-ps2-record">Nintendo expects to sell 4.5m Switch consoles</a>, which would see the console usurping the Nintendo DS as the company's highest-selling piece of hardware - it's now less than 1m sales behind. That's still quite a way from the PS2, though, which is estimated to have sold 160m units as the best selling console of all time.</p>
<p>Overall, Nintendo's net sales grew by 132.1 percent year-on-year thanks to the Switch 2's launch, while gross profit increased by 21.4 percent to 185.1bn yen. The gross profit margin declined due to a lower profit margin of the Switch 2 compared with the previous console.</p>
<p>Digital sales decreased by 13.5 percent, but still account for 59.3 percent of all software sales. Nintendo attributes this to a "decrease in sales of downloadable versions of packaged software".</p>
<p>Nintendo has not changed its financial forecast for the remainder of the fiscal year, where it expects to sell 15m Switch 2 consoles worldwide. This has not been impacted by US tariff measures, echoing a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-sales-forecast-not-affected-by-production-or-tariffs-nintendo-reiterates">statement from Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa in May</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mega-dragonite-debuts-in-fresh-look-at-pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a> will be released on Switch consoles on 16th October, as one of Nintendo's key first-party games. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-pops-up-on-the-korean-ratings-board-sparking-hope-well-get-a-firm-release-date-soon">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> remains a 2025 release without a specific launch date.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Nintendo revealed more third-party games due for release this year - here's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-todays-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase">everything shown at the Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/almost-all-switch-2-users-have-bought-mario-kart-world-as-sales-of-new-console-pass-6m-worldwide]]></content:encoded>

		<p>The Battlefield fanbase experiences the rollercoaster highs and lows of game releases like almost no other. Over the past 15 years, each game’s launch is greeted with a degree of dismay, the team having to go back and pour even more effort in to rectify issues and pull it into shape, and then, just as it’s become a beloved entry in the series, you crest the big drop and go hurtling back down to the depths of gaming despair as a new game arrives to start the journey all over again. But there’s hope for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a>. Dreams that this beloved open war shooter really is back to the rose tinted glory days of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2011/10/31/battlefield-3-multiplayer-console-review/">Battlefield 3</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2013/11/04/battlefield-4-review/">Battlefield 4</a>. Are we back? I think we might be back.</p>
<p><iframe title="Battlefield 6 Official Multiplayer Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wFGEMfyAQtI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Battlefield 6 brings us a contemporary war setting, taking place in an utterly implausible 2027, from a current geopolitical viewpoint, where the steadfast bastion of Western military cooperation that is NATO is suddenly under threat from…um… a really rich private military corporation? No China, no Russia, it’s the mercenaries of Pax Armata that are the baddies, managing to chip away at the allies, the war that breaks out stretching from the Middle East, from Egypt, through Gibraltar and even coming to US shores with a battle in Brooklyn. Truthfully, it doesn’t matter who the goodies and the baddies are for the multiplayer, but it does feel a bit toetippy and safe after the games of the early 2010s.</p>


<p>What really matters is what the combat and action is like, and here it’s classic Battlefield. There’s four classes – Assault, Engineer, Support and Recon – and you’re in squads of up to four, trying to use your different roles and skills to complement one another and with a squad leader marking objectives to try and coordinate your efforts. Assault is about crashing into situations, able to boost themselves with a shot of adrenaline and coming with two main weapons, Engineer has the rockets and blow torch, Support bundles together the old Medic healing, ammo resupply and barricades, and Recon is all about scoping out the enemy with drones, placing spawn points, and the like. There’s the usual remixing of familiar abilities into these four buckets, and outside of the smushed together duties for the Support class, it’s a lot like the good old days… specifically the good days of Bad Company 2’s classes. Assault does have a personal health stim, but needs Recon to take out tanks and Support for healing and ammo.</p>


<p>Alongside the gadgets of your class, there’s also a new score-based perk system in Field Specs that rewards you with passive and active boosts. These start small, like starting your own health regen when you revive an ally as a Medic, hampering enemy vehicle repairs when damaging them as an Engineer, or building up to a top tier ability that you manually trigger, like Assault’s Combat Stimulant which highlights nearby sounds and reveals enemies. These feel like they’ll be gameplay style enhancements instead of wholesale class mods, but we’ll have to wait and see.</p>
<p>But there’s still some controversy. You see, where weapons used to be locked to particular classes in Battlefield V and before, that’s no longer the case. Each class still has a “signature” weapon type, and there’s boosters for embracing that synergy, so engineers have better hip-fire control with the SMGs, and Assault can draw and switch weapons quicker with an assault rifle, but you’ll also have the freedom to pick from the full selection of weapons. It’s something that a vocal part of the community has railed against for months, but really it makes sense. Having weapon freedom makes it a smidgeon more likely that someone will sacrifice being an Assault when your squad is faced by a tank.</p>

<p>Bouncing back and forth between roles and weapons, it’s a bit like putting on an old pair of slippers, but there’s plenty of fine details to adjust to as well. The one I particularly appreciate was how marking enemies works. Instead of spamming a ping button, you instead mark enemies by shooting at them, in turn giving away your position. I wish you could still just point out a tank, but this is a great change in general. I also really like the new revive system, where you can drag a fallen buddy out from the open and into cover, making you both at least be slow moving targets.</p>
<p>And if we’re really getting into the week, I love that the end of match screen that highlights squads and achievements has a line chart representation of how tickets were depleted through a match of Conquest.</p>

<p>But really there’s just all the bombast of Battlefield’s trademarked all-out warfare. Infantry plays a big role, but so too do vehicles, tanks, helicopters and fighter jets. I can absolutely see myself spending time manning the LMG for a buddy driving a tank, holding down a key position in Conquest and hopping out to fix them up when we take hits. But I also just enjoyed marauding, hopping onto an AA emplacement to take out a pesky helicopter.</p>
<p>The map I played a couple matches on was on the rocky mountainside of Liberation Peak, a set of six control points littered with military defences and buildings. There was some of the destruction available here, but it would really be for the urban battles where this will be felt the most, where entire facades of buildings can collapse in spectacular fashion.</p>

<p>Battlefield 6 will arrive with 9 maps, and almost as many game modes. Conquest, Rush and Breakthrough return as the series staples, but there’s the small ball of TDM, Squad DM, Domination, KOTH and something new called Escalation. And of course there will be seasons of content with new maps, modes and events.</p>
<p>So, is Battlefield back? At first blush, it certainly feels like it might be. Thankfully it won’t be long before we can spend more time with it, with two beta weekends kicking off in August, and there’s sure to be plenty more to be said about this once we’ve played more. But also, there’s stuff still to really be revealed and explored that will only emerge for the full release. How are weapon unlocks going to play out? How with Field Specs modify each class? What balance changes can DICE really make from the beta to the full game in time for October?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It has been a while since new information was unearthed regarding the HLX project at Valve, which is thought to be Half-Life 3. Despite the lack of new details, however, work on the project seems to have been proceeding steadily, and development may have reached the final phase, judging from some recent findings.</p>



<p>In new videos shared yesterday by Tyler McViker and Gabe Follower, it is reported that Counter-Strike 2's massive July 29 update not only brought changes and improvements to the competitive game but also some behind-the-scenes changes to the Source 2 engine related to the Half-Life 3 HLX project. One new line of code in particular, the one mentioning thumpers to scare antlions, which mirrors a line of code in Half-Life 2, seems to be a direct message to dataminers, and further confirmation that the project continues to be in active development.</p>



<p>Not only does the HLX project continue to be in active development, but it may have reached the final phase of development. The most significant change introduced in the new Source 2 engine update is the complete refactoring of AI scripting in the FGD and localization token files. This is pretty significant, as this refactoring has changed how NPCs react to in-game events, going from sounds to what are not called AI events. This has been known to be an HLX feature for a while, but the difference now is that there's a definition file for these AI events, which suggests that the feature is done and polished up to a point that it can be used in scripting and map-making. Hammer, Valve's level design tool, was also recently updated to support many of the Half-Life 3 HLX features discovered in the past few months via datamining, such as vehicle mechanics, wind mechanics, model deformation, thermodynamics mechanics, and more. The fact that the new documentation reads like a tutorial to explain how to use the development tools properly to take advantage of these features also adds more fuel to the fire and even suggests how mod support could be coming not too long after the project launches. Ultimately, this sort of polishing and development tool updates usually happen at the end of development, but considering how differently Valve operates compared to the vast majority of game developers, it cannot be said for certain if the game is close to being announced and released.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Other recent happenings may also suggest that the HLX project thought to be Half-Life 3 could be in the final phase of development. Gabe Follower claims in their video that some parts of the project are already finished and need only to be polished, and developers have started moving on to other projects. Usually, this means the project may have been abandoned, but Gabe Follower believes these developers are moving on to other projects because their work on HLX is no longer needed.</p>

<p>As mentioned, Valve operates differently from other game development studios, so even if the game is in the final phase of development, an announcement and release timeline for the HLX project, thought to be Half-Life 3, remains unknown. Hopefully, it won't take much longer to learn more about what's next for one of gaming's most celebrated series. </p>

In its Q1 financial results for the three months that ended on June 30, Nintendo says it sold 6 million Switch 2 units globally in the seven weeks since launch, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-has-become-the-fastest-selling-home-console-of-all-time-in-just-four-days/1100-6532341/">which has led to several records being broken</a>.</p><p>The hybrid console has been a hot commodity since it went on sale, exceeding the expectations of Nintendo. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-reveals-how-many-switch-2-consoles-it-expects-to-sell-during-its-first-year/1100-6531389/">The company says it still expects to sell 15 million Switch 2 consoles</a> during its current financial year, which ends in March 2026. Meanwhile, Nintendo sold 0.98 million Switch consoles, pushing the lifetime sales of that device up to 153.10 million units sold.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4542007-witch-2-sales.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542007" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4542007-witch-2-sales.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542007"></a><figcaption>Switch 2 lifetime sales to date</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4542007-witch-2-sales.jpg"></figure><p>"Currently, demand for Nintendo Switch 2 is exceeding supply in many countries, and we regret the inconvenience this is causing our consumers," <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250801_2e.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo said</a>. "We will continue to strengthen our production and supply systems to deliver as much Nintendo Switch 2 hardware as possible."</p><p>In the games department, things are also looking good as Nintendo says it has reached sales of 8.67 million units. Mario Kart World made the bulk of these sales at 5.63 million units sold, but that's not too surprising given that the game was available via a bundle console deal.</p><p>Looking ahead, there'll be plenty more reasons to grab a Switch 2 this year with exclusive games like Drag X Drive, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, and Pokemon Legends: Z-A. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-july-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6828/">Nintendo also held a Direct livestream this week</a>, dedicated to games from third-party studios and developers.

            <p>Itch.io - the digital distribution platform known for its focus on independent game developers and other artists - is today re-indexing adult NSFW (Not Suitable For Work) content that is available for free.</p>
<p>In addition, it is currently in discussions with payment processors who are comfortable with adult material, and will be reintroducing paid content "slowly" to ensure it can "confidently support the widest range of creators in the long term".</p>
<p>Itch.io noted that payment processor Stripe has said it will not support adult content that has been "designed for sexual gratification".</p>

<p>In a statement shared with Itch.io, Stripe said:</p>
<p>"Stripe is currently unable to support sexually explicit content due to restrictions placed on them by their banking partners, despite card networks generally supporting adult content (with the appropriate registrations). Stripe has indicated that they hope to be able to support adult content in the future."</p>
<p>In the meantime, Itch.io said those who wish to have their pages eligible for today's re-indexing process must ensure they have the "no payments" option checked.</p>
<p>The platform is also putting a new content warning system in place for pages tagged as being NSFW. It states this refers to pages that have the "contains sensitive material" option checked, as well as tags that suggest the project includes adult content such as "porn" and "fetish".</p>
<p>Itch.io said anyone wanting to be eligible for re-indexing is "required to complete this". The platform added the feature is not quite ready as yet, but those who had their pages previously indexed will be given enough time to complete all the necessary processes "to avoid going in and out of indexing".</p>
<p>You <a href="https://itch.io/t/5149036/reindexing-adult-nsfw-content">can find further information on the platform's re-indexing efforts via Itch.io</a>.</p>
<p>Today's update from Itch.io follows last week's news that the platform had "deindexed" all NSFW content following discussions with payment processors contacted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/we-approached-payment-processors-because-steam-did-not-respond-australian-pressure-group-collective-shout-claims-responsibility-for-steam-and-itchio-nsfw-game-removal">the same Australian pressure group that recently targeted Steam</a>.</p>
<p>In June, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/itchio-deindexes-all-nsfw-games-blames-same-anti-porn-group-that-campaigned-against-steam">itch.io creators began reporting their NSFW games were no longer being displayed in search results on the platform</a>. At this time, platform founder Leaf Corcoran said: "We are truly sorry for the frustration and confusion caused by this change."</p>
<p>Itch.io's movement followed on from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-introduces-vague-new-rules-banning-certain-kinds-of-adult-content-to-appease-credit-card-companies">Valve "retiring" unspecified NSFW titles and introducing vague new rules banning "certain kinds of adult content" from its own PC storefront</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/itch-begins-re-indexing-free-adult-nsfw-content-as-it-seeks-alternative-payment-processors]]></content:encoded>

<p>While surpassing the DS would put the Switch on <em>Nintendo</em>'s podium of all-time sellers, it will still have some way to go if it is to ever overtake the PlayStation 2's 160+ million units sold — which, let's not forget, got a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/04/as-switch-approaches-the-ps2s-lifetime-sales-sony-moves-the-goalposts">generous five million boost</a> from PlayStation's ex-CEO Jim Ryan last year.</p>
<p>The big 160 feels a long way off for the Switch 1 (Nintendo only forecasts an additional 4.5 million hardware sales for the system in FY 2026), but we'd be surprised if we're <em>not</em> looking at a new Nintendo gold medallist in the next one or two financial reports.</p>

Following its launch in June, the Switch 2 console has now sold 5.82 million units according to <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250801_2e.pdf">Nintendo’s Q1 earnings report</a>, more than double the 2.7 million unit sales achieved by the original Switch in its first month.</p><p>“Currently, demand for Nintendo Switch 2 is exceeding supply in many countries, and we regret the inconvenience this is causing our consumers,” Nintendo said in its report, pledging to strengthen production. While Switch 2 preorders sold out across major retailers in the US ahead of the launch, some limited stock was still available on launch day, likely because Nintendo had built up enough inventory to meet initial demand.</p><p>That success is driving a 132 percent surge in quarterly revenue, which increased to ¥572.3 billion (around $3.8 billion) between April-June, compared to ¥246.6 billion (around $1.6 billion) for the same period last year. Nintendo says it’s still forecasting to hit 15 million Switch 2 sales by the end of its 2026 financial year, despite uncertainties like Trump’s tariffs.</p><p>Yesterday, the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/07/further-modifying-the-reciprocal-tariff-rates/">White House announced</a> that a 20 percent tariff on goods from Vietnam — where Nintendo produces its Switch 2 consoles — will begin next week. That’s double the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/646693/trump-tariffs-pause-nintendo-switch-2">10 percent baseline tariff</a> introduced in April that Nintendo used to forecast earnings for the current fiscal year.</p><p>“While there have been changes in the market environment since we announced our initial forecast for the fiscal year, such as the US tariff measures, at this time there is no significant impact on our earnings forecast for this fiscal year,” <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250801_2e.pdf">Nintendo said</a>.</p><p>The Switch 2’s popularity at launch has made it the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685162/nintendo-switch-2-sales-figures-record">fastest-selling game console</a> of all time. Meanwhile, people are still purchasing the first Switch console, which has now hit 153.1 million units in lifetime sales — inching closer to dethroning the DS as Nintendo’s most successful console, which sold 154.02 million units. The Wii U sold just 13.7 million units over its entire lifetime.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTU="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jess Weatherbed</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/717163/nintendo-earnings-q1-2025-switch-2-sales]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Right, so. It's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-order-should-you-play-the-yakuza-games">supposed to go</a> as follows: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-0">Yakuza 0</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-kiwami">Yakuza Kiwami</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-kiwami-2">Yakuza Kiwami 2</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-3-remaster">Yakuza 3 Remastered</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-4-remaster">Yakuza 4 Remastered</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-5">Yakuza 5</a> Remastered, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-6">Yakuza 6: The Song Of Life</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-like-a-dragon">Yakuza: Like A Dragon</a>, then off into full-blown Like A Dragon land, and on to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii">Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza</a>. Easy. Except right now in my Steam library, it's not. The Kiwamis are cheekily lurking behind Yakuza 6, and the LADs are before all of their more Japanese gangsterly-named siblings.</p>
<p>It's chaos and anarchy. I can't live like this. The good news is that thanks to the update Steam's Client Beta has just gotten, it looks like I'll no longer have to.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Added a customisation tab to game properties," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4397053/view/545616353498759462?l=english">the notes</a> for it read, "The customisation tab allows users to view and set custom artwork for the game and set a custom sort title that will be used instead of the actual title when sorting games in the library."</p>
<p>Cue <a href="https://x.com/chibilawl/status/1951056729778823585">many</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1meelqh/theyre_finally_doing_it_oh_my_god/">many</a> folks who've been frustratedly looking at the alphabetically misbehaving names in their library letting out a big sigh of relief. To be clear, the custom name you add won't overwrite the game's display name in your library, it's just hidden away behind-the-scenes, letting the storefront's inner workings know not to put 2016's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rise-of-the-tomb-raider">Rise of the Tomb Raider</a> above 2013's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-tomb-raider">Tomb Raider</a>.</p>
<p>Outside of that, this Client Beta update's all about useful but unglamourous fixes for various issues you might run into when Steaming. Some are specifically aimed at big picture mode, recording games, and Linux, with a good chunk of them being interface-related.</p>
<p>Oh, and the top genres list in the store menu should now be "more relevant and dynamic", which I assume means you'll know in an instant if Steamers all over the world suddenly get way more into shmups.</p>
<p>If you've taken one look at the new sorting powers on offer and are currently salivating at the prospect of getting your librarian on, instructions to opt into the Client Beta can be found <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/276C-85A0-C531-AFA3">here</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/praise-the-kiryu-steams-latest-client-beta-update-will-finally-let-you-sort-like-a-dragons-and-yakuza-into-the-right-order]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> is set to go up against Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 later this year, and while both are military first-person shooters, it sounds like there will be at least one significant point of difference: skins.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty’s foray into goofy skins territory is not a new phenomena, although recent releases have certainly amped up the conversation around them. With the likes of Beavis and Butt-Head and American Dad hitting the game this year shortly after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-dutys-ongoing-420-obsession-sparks-debate-among-fans-some-have-had-enough-others-really-want-that-seth-rogen-skin">weed-obsessed bundles starring Seth Rogen</a>, some fans have said they’ve had enough of what they call the 'Fortnite-ification' of their beloved Call of Duty, and have pleaded with publisher Activision to return to its mil-sim roots.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Enter Battlefield 6, a game EA is pitching as having a “gritty realism” aesthetic. But will this extend to skins? In an interview with <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/battlefield-6-dev-responds-to-fears-of-unrealistic-beevis-and-butthead-skins-we-listen/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VideoGamer</a>, UX director Alan Pimm said he was unaware of any internal plans to release crossover skins that would break the aesthetic Battlefield 6 is going for, and promised the developers were listening to fan feedback.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“What I can tell you is I don’t know of any plans and, at the moment, that package is the ‘gritty realism’ and that we listen. That I can tell you,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, we must also bear in mind that there is enormous pressure on Battlefield 6 to do the business for EA. Indeed the company has said it’s all in on the game, which it sees as a platform just as Activision does with Call of Duty. It would be naive to expect EA to resist the temptation to release eye-catching skins, and even crossover with other IP for bundles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question is, how far will it go? Will EA, when all is said and do, stick with Battlefield 6’s “gritty realism” when it comes to skins, as Call of Duty initially set out to? Or will it buckle and end up going down the same path with 90s cartoon skins of its own?</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/01/f2dyabzwaaa5-ec-1754039802526.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Nicki Minaj hit Call of Duty in 2023.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a separate interview with DBLTAP, Battlefield 6 design director Shashank Uchil doubled down on EA's committment to grounded realism, and even pointed to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nicki-minaj-is-call-of-duty-season-5-snoop-dogg">Call of Duty's infamous Nicki Minaj skin</a> as something Battlefield 6 doesn't need.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It has to be grounded," he said. "That is what BF3 and BF4 was — it was all soldiers, on the ground. It’s going to be like this,” Uchil said, pointing at the key art featuring soldiers in soldier gear looking out over a wartorn New York City.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He added: “I don’t think it needs Nicki Minaj. Let’s keep it real, keep it grounded.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more on Battlefield 6, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-preview">a hands-on preview</a>.

Nintendo said demand for Switch 2 is exceeding supply in many countries, and it apologizes to consumers. “We will continue to strengthen our production and supply systems to deliver as much Nintendo Switch 2 hardware as possible,” the company said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a fantastic result for the Switch 2 hardware itself, which is comfortably the fastest-selling in Nintendo history. Nintendo said demand “has surpassed our expectations.” Still, it’s sticking to its forecast of selling 15 million Switch 2 units in the financial year ending March 2026.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for games, Nintendo said Switch 2 software sales reached 8.67 million units. Launch title Mario Kart World made up the bulk of those game sales, shifting 5.63 million units (almost as many as the Switch 2 itself has sold). But it’s worth noting that figure includes units bundled with the hardware.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The end result is that overall sales totaled 572.3 billion yen (approx. $3.8 billion), and operating profit grew 4% to 56.9 billion yen ($378 million) for the three months ending June 30. After all the furore over Trump’s tariffs and changing product prices, in its financial report Nintendo said “at this time there is no significant impact on our earnings forecast for this fiscal year.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, demand for the OG Switch has remained even after the launch of the Switch, and sales of the console inched ever higher, and are now at 153.1 million. The number of annual playing users between July 2024 and June 2025 has remained above 100 million, which means Nintendo launched Switch 2 into an environment where a huge number of people were already playing Switch.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 System and Accessories Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Upcoming Switch 2 exclusives include Drag x Drive, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, Kirby Air Riders, and FromSoftware's The Duskbloods.

Tencent describes the game as taking place in a "world overrun by colossal machines" on its Steam store page. Sound familiar? Sony wants a court to prevent Tencent from marketing and distributing the title, and in a wild twist even alleges that Tencent sought to license the Horizon IP in 2024 before revealing Light of Motiram a few months later.
