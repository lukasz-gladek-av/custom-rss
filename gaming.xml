            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/607154/stop-motion-video-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>One of the biggest lessons of working on stop-motion video games? Rolling up your sleeves — literally.</p><p>“It’s such a nightmare,” Talha &amp; Jack Co developer Jack King-Spooner told me over a video call. “You spend maybe half an hour doing one of the cutscenes. The cutscenes are the most precarious things because you have to have everything in the scene exactly the same. And then your sleeve catches something and you’re like <em>ah, Jesus, and I have to do everything again</em>.”</p><p>King-Spooner worked with Talha Kaya on 2024’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1960900%2FJudero%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Judero</em></a>, an action-adventure game based on the folklore of the Scottish Borders. Now, the creative duo is running a Kickstarter campaign for its new project, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/637042083/mashina"><em>Mashina</em></a>, centered around a cute robot who has to drill. It’s a stop-motion game again, but this time, the team is facing the laborious process with some hard-learned lessons.</p><p>The seemingly innocuous gesture of rolling up your sleeves is one of many considerations that studios need to keep in mind when experimenting with handmade characters, objects, and scenes for their games. Stop-motion games aren’t new — the likes of <em>The Neverhood</em>, <em>The Dark Eye</em>, and <em>Skullmonkeys</em> have been toying with this physical-meets-digital marriage since the ’90s. But there’s been a resurgence in recent years due to projects with prominent Kickstarter crowdfunding campaigns, such as <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/esbenkongorange/vokabulantis"><em>Vokabulantis</em></a>, and smaller teams keeping the momentum going, resulting in a sparse but steady presence thanks to games like <em>Hylics</em> and its sequel to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/11/14/7217199/the-dream-machine"><em>The Dream Machine</em></a>.</p><p>To Talha &amp; Jack Co, there are a few reasons behind the popularity of this art style. Aside from the clear promotional aspect of standing out in an ever-increasing crowd, the team is fond of the playful and physical nostalgia of action figures. When I spoke to them, they’d occasionally open drawers to grab figures and individual pieces, from small feet to mountains made of clay, proudly showing them to the webcam and fiddling with them while they spoke.</p><p>“Gaming has been for a long time just an extremely digital thing that you do only by sitting at your computer and changing pixels or programming,” Kaya said. “Now we are in this age where anything can go into a video game, and when you put a lot of literally and metaphorically interesting textures, it just becomes a more interesting work. Stop-motion is a great way to do that.”</p><p>For the team behind the point-and-click adventure <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24131922/harold-halibut-review-ps5-xbox-steam"><em>Harold Halibut</em></a>, the reason was more simple: it’s what they knew. The developers didn’t have experience with 3D or drawing, but they knew how to build physical things. That philosophy was the foundation of a development period that spanned over a decade. When it came to animating these handcrafted creations, however, they decided on a different approach.</p><p>Initially, <em>Harold Halibut</em> was supposed to be animated in traditional stop-motion. The proof is in Slow Bros. cofounder and CEO Onat Hekimoglu’s shelf behind him, the namesake character standing inside a display case with his arms pointing down. Hekimoglu tells me that you can actually move his arms and legs, as opposed to the other characters alongside him, which are T-posing.</p><div><p>“When you put a lot of literally and metaphorically interesting textures, it just becomes a more interesting work”</p></div><p>“In the beginning, we were using actual stop-motion animation, but it all felt too static, and also too much like a Photoshop collage, and we wanted to have a modern-looking feel that fits the time we are in, right?” Hekimoglu said. “Dynamic lighting, dynamic camera work, and all that stuff.”</p><p>Eventually, the developer diverged from the original idea to embrace “the best of both worlds,” according to Hekimoglu, taking handcrafted assets and scanning them in a process called photogrammetry. Instead of photographing every animation from different angles, the process involved taking pictures of objects and characters to create digital 3D models.</p><p>“I think actual stop-motion is not very suitable for games,” he adds. “When you are working on a film, everything that happens is inside that one image, that’s why everything feels consistent. You can never have that situation in a video game unless you do a full-motion video game.”</p><p>Hekimoglu’s point of view resonates with some obstacles that studio Wooly Games is encountering. Development for <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F3159860%2FFeltopia%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Feltopia</em></a> started in the summer of 2023, and the four-person team has been experimenting with an array of handcrafted felt objects in stop-motion fashion since. <em>Feltopia</em> is a shoot-’em-up, traditionally a fast-paced genre, which clashes with the slower nature of stop-motion.</p><p>“I animate at 12 frames a second, and when you have your game going at 60 frames a second, there’s sort of a little bit of mixing and matching that goes along there,” creative director Andrea Love tells me. “So we are exploring some slower types of gameplay, more like 2D platformers, and we’ll see how that goes.”</p><p>Love has been working on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/andreaanimates/">stop-motion animation</a> for over a decade, but doing so for a video game is “very different.” Usually, she would build the puppets and sets and put them all together for a composed scene. For <em>Feltopia</em>, everything has to be an isolated sprite or piece of scenery, so she photographs and animates objects as individual assets. “It’s like taking all these different little things and making a felted interactive collage,” Love says.</p><p>Stop-motion requires patience. A little blob that undulates in <em>Feltopia</em> takes around 15 to 20 minutes to make. The animation cycles of the Skyrider, the main hooded character who flies on a pegasus, took around a day, while a boss fight scene unfolded between two to three days. Love also has to create the puppets using wire armatures to rig them up and then remove the wires in postproduction.</p><p>But things get easier with experience. During the first animation tests of <em>Judero</em>, it would take King-Spooner around 10 hours to do one animation. As he became faster and more practical in his workflow, the team was able to increase the scope of the game, adding cutscenes and more elaborate characters. Still, considering that each frame involved at least eight photographs, the total count was in the hundreds.</p><p>“When you’ve taken 200 photos and then you sit back and press play and all of a sudden it’s actually animated, and then it’s even got an extra step when I throw it over to Talha and we get it in the game, and not only is it moving, we’re controlling it, it’s so fun,” King-Spooner said. “It’s kind of magic.”</p><p>Upcoming games like Compulsion Games’ <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24350382/xbox-developer-direct-january-2025-doom-ninja-gaiden-trailers"><em>South of Midnight</em></a> and MoonHood’s <em>The Midnight Walk</em> are taking cues from games like <em>Harold Halibut.</em> They blur the line between stop-motion and the technical or visual expectations of modern games, keeping traditional art style without restricting movement or animations. But for those who are sticking with the craft of stop-motion — whether it’s trying to adjust the lighting of a scene due to different weather affecting photographs across multiple days or figuring out the exact density of felt so puppets don’t fall apart — they’re finding joy in the process, while embracing the work involved.</p><p>“That’s usually people’s first reaction,” Wooly Games project manager Michelle Hagewood says. “Why in the world are you doing this to yourself?”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He’ll stretch his arms out to hit enemies in close and medium range and it will be your go-to for dealing “filler” damage when Spore Bomb is on cooldown.</p><p><strong>Strangling Prison:</strong> This Ultimate grabs nearby enemies and pulls them together to wherever you aim the ability, dealing steady damage for a while. It’s a great opportunity to group enemies up so they can be taken out by Iron Man, Scarlet Witch, and many other Ultimate abilities.</p><p><strong>Thornlash Wall:</strong> This ability places a small wall at the target location. You have several charges of this one, so multiple walls can be placed. It can be angled several different ways and will Awaken when Groot is nearby, causing it to attack nearby enemies. Use it to block off locations and, ideally, separate healers from the rest of their team. Divide and conquer, baby. If a Duelist gets too greedy and runs ahead of the pack, place a wall behind them to make them easy to knockout.</p><p><strong>Ironwood Wall:</strong> This ability places a larger Ironwood Wall at the target location. You can only place one of these at a time, so think strategically. It can also be angled, and when Groot is nearby, the Ironwood wall will awaken to grant Groot and his nearby allies bonus health based on the damage they deal. While the Thornlash Wall is good to keep nearby, you definitely want to keep Ironwood near points you are guarding.</p><p><strong>Furious Flora:</strong> This is Groot’s melee attack. Hold this down and Groot will perform a three-hit melee combo. The last hit launches into the air, but there isn’t really a reason to use this instead of Vine Strike.</p><p><strong>Spore Bomb:</strong> - This is a grenade-like projectile that explodes, dealing AOE (area-of-effect) damage. Three smaller explosives spread out and detonate again, making this a great tool to throw into groups of enemies. With a short, 6-second cooldown, you should use this basically every time it’s available.</p><p><strong>Flora Colossus (Passive):</strong> This passive awakens spawned walls near Groot, activating their secondary abilities.</p><p><strong>Friendly Shoulder (Team-Up Ability: Passive):</strong> If Jeff the Land Shark or Rocket Raccoon are on your team, they can ride on Groot’s shoulders, taking less damage than they otherwise would. It’s also incredibly cute, which is a bonus all by itself.</p><h2 id="h548"><a id="play"></a>How should you play Groot?</h2><p>Groot is one of the best Tanks in the game if played correctly. He can solo Tank with steady healers and has lots of versatility due to his ability to create walls. The most potent part of his kit, and the one which takes the most practice, is creating line-of-sight obstructions to cause problems for healers on the opposing team. </p><figure id="" data-id="b7295457df6d84c5a5801286495f5816" data-recommend-id="image://b7295457df6d84c5a5801286495f5816" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Groot summons a wall before another character." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Groot summons a wall before another character." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b7295457df6d84c5a5801286495f5816" data-recommend-id="image://b7295457df6d84c5a5801286495f5816" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Groot summons a wall before another character." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Use walls to defend key points, forcing enemies to waste time attacking your wooden constructs to make it through narrow hallways.

And this was the case for decades. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD7D6B263E852D5FA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD7D6B263E852D5FA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Then Super Bowl commercials became bigger and bigger in the 2000s</a></span> and companies spent more and more to create a viral, popular ad. And as this was happening, the lines between TV, movies, and internet content started to blur, while streaming services and YouTube grew in popularity. Hustle culture—the belief that as long as you were getting paid it was worth it—also grew during this time.<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/WytGsPMPs24?list=PLCeYpRAW8Efo9ZormvxTt70EhGHCoQlHN&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/WytGsPMPs24?list=PLCeYpRAW8Efo9ZormvxTt70EhGHCoQlHN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> I remember people in 2015 cheering Kim Kardashian</a></span> for appearing in a big Super Bowl ad and celebrating that she “got paid!”</p><p>That has led us to 2025 and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCeYpRAW8EfqOdmUc9Z0QIFT4mCuDUEYB&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCeYpRAW8EfqOdmUc9Z0QIFT4mCuDUEYB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nearly every damn Super Bowl ad</a></span> including famous people to help sell soda or crackers. And it’s all so sad. Watching Harrison Ford, an actor whom I really like and who has turned in some incredible performances, try to connect being a hero to owning a Jeep made me want to throw my TV out the window. Being assaulted with 20 different variations on “Actors and celebs behaving wacky while holding branded products” made me want to throw my phone out the window. </p><p>I think what really drives me nuts about these ads is how transparently greedy it all is. A lot of the people appearing in these commercials don’t need the money and yet, they likely got paid quite a bit to appear. And they just don’t care anymore about even pretending to look like artists or creators with backbones and morals.</p><p> They know that most people don’t care anymore. Everything we watch appears on the same tiny phone screen. The delineation between movies and TV and random viral videos is gone. It’s been gone for awhile. And that means there isn’t anything stopping someone like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/LC5V4aIoWes?list=PLCeYpRAW8EfqOdmUc9Z0QIFT4mCuDUEYB&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/LC5V4aIoWes?list=PLCeYpRAW8EfqOdmUc9Z0QIFT4mCuDUEYB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Barry Keoghan appearing in an ad for Square Space</a></span>. It won’t ruin his career or cost him fans or make him less of an artist anymore. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/RIXB-7RHjBY?list=PLCeYpRAW8EfqOdmUc9Z0QIFT4mCuDUEYB&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/RIXB-7RHjBY?list=PLCeYpRAW8EfqOdmUc9Z0QIFT4mCuDUEYB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Actors can freely dig up past roles and characters</a></span>, skin them, and prance about for 30 seconds recreating some moment you might remember, and get paid a lot to do it while suffering no negative consequences.</p><p>You might wonder “Who does this hurt?” or “What’s the harm of celebs getting paid to do commercials?” And to be clear, none of this is really hurting anybody. There are certainly bigger problems in the world right now. But that doesn’t change that it sucks shit—it hurts <em>art</em>. Hawking products for cash makes you a salesperson, not an artist.</p><p>So my suggestion is simple: Let’s start making fun of celebs for selling out and reminding them that its gross. It’s going to take a few years to build up momentum and change anything, but if we pull this off and we go back to making actors and artists feel shame again, we all might be able to avoid shit like Seal appearing as a seal in a fucking soda ad. </p><p>Doesn’t that sounds like a future you want to live in? <br></p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-developers-detail-season-and-half-season-ranks/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>With the first half of Season 1 drawing to a close, Marvel Rivals developer NetEase has published a new update regarding ranks. This update helps players understand what to expect at the end of the half and in the second half of the inaugural season and beyond.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20250210/40954_1210988.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the game’s website</a>, the studio said that the first half of the season will end on February 21. At that time, all rankings will be locked and players ranked Gold and higher will get a costume reward. Those Grandmaster and higher as well as the Top 500 will receive the “Crest of Honor”.</p>



<p>“In the second half of the season, we will be rolling out new costume rewards for Gold rank players, along with brand new Crests of Honor,” NetEase said. “These Crests will recognize players at Grandmaster, Celestial, Eternity, and One Above All (the top 500), each with its own unique design to celebrate your skill!”</p>



<p>After the first-half ranks are settled, they will all be reason when the second half of Season 1 starts that day. When it starts, NetEase says  that players will see their rank drop by four divisions. In future seasons, that drop will be six divisions at the beginning and then a drop of four at the start of the second half of each season.</p>



<p>Lastly, the studio says that in order to make sure only players who actually play during the current season can earn rewards, players will need to play at least 10 matches in competitive mode along with meeting required ranking conditions.</p>



<p>What do you think of how Marvel Rivals is handling in-season ranks? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

            <p>
Relic Entertainment, the studio behind the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/company-of-heroes">Company of Heroes</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warhammer-40000-dawn-war">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War</a>, has outlined its future plans as an independent studio - including a greater focus on smaller titles and older games - following its separation from Sega last year.
</p>
<p>
Relic was founded in 1997, and become known for its work in the real-time strategy genre as the years went on. In 2013, the studio was acquired by Sega - but the companies last year announced they would be parting ways, with Relic becoming independent once more.
</p>
<p>
Since then, Relic has undergone a period of downsizing, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ex-sega-studio-relic-hit-by-fresh-layoffs-following-sale">laying off 41 staff</a> last year (a move that followed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-lays-off-121-employees-at-company-of-heroes-studio-relic-entertainment">major round of redundancies</a> in 2023), but now the studio has reemerged to discuss its future plans, announcing a "bold" vision that'll see it focusing on three key areas.

<p>
Part of the studio's new strategy will see it 'actively pursuing' the development of "smaller-scope, in-house games" alongside the larger, more complex strategy titles it's known for - all in order to "explore new genres and gameplay experiences".
</p>
<p>
It also intends to 're-imagine classics', through the likes of re-releases, remasters, and "brand-new franchise experiences that capture the spirit of the originals while appealing to a new generation of players." That's alongside Relic's third focus: a "deepening commitment" to and "robust support" for its existing titles, starting with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/company-of-heroes-3">Company of Heroes 3</a>.
</p>
<p>
The studio has already announced a new update and new DLC for Company of Heroes 3, both launching this month. Fire &amp; Steel, as the DLC is known, promises four new Battlegroups for multiplayer and co-op/skirmish vs. AI. There's the Heavy Weapons Battlegroup (US Forces), Terror Battlegroup (Wehrmacht), Canadian Shock Battlegroup (British Forces), and Panzerjäger Kommand Battlegroup (Afrikakorps), with more to be revealed closer to release.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/10/phasmophobia-2025-roadmap-features-chronicle-update-new-maps-sound-recorder-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There’s a packed year of updates and new content coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a> with its 2025 roadmap, starting with the Chronicle update, and extending to new maps, various map, character and event reworks, and more.</p>
<p>Alongside the roadmap reveal, Kinetic Games also announced that the game has passed 2 million sales on consoles, and over 22 million sales across all platforms. That’s great going!</p>



<p>The first major update of the year will be Chronicle, which was previewed at the end of 2024. This update will overhaul how evidence is collected, with a new Media tab that will gather together all the photos and videos you’ve collected, as well as audio recordings from the new Sound Recorder tool.</p>
<p>The second update in 2025 will the bring a player character overhaul, refreshing the character models, improving the animations, but stopping short of full player customisation, which will now come in 2026. That will allow the team to focus on the Horror 2.0 update that is also expected in 2026.</p>

<p>But there’s plenty more for 2025 still. A brand new map will be added, and there will be updated version of Bleasdale Farmhouse (arriving in March), Grafton Farmhouse and 6 Tanglewood Drive. The first of which, Bleasdale, will be releasing in March. each will have a complete artistic overhaul, new assets, new animations and a few layout changes to refresh how hunts progress.</p>
<p>Seasonal Events are also getting a bit of an overhaul for 2025, taking the first iteration of these from 2024 and adapting them to player feedback. There will be events for Easter, Halloween and Winter. While the actual event modifiers and goals will be similar, there will be personal rewards, wider map rotations, and more.</p>
<p>We had a great time <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/28/phasmophobia-early-access-console-review-ps5-xbox-series-x/">exploring Phasmophobia for its console launch</a>, saying, “There’s a bunch of rough edges from adapting the controls to gamepad, and from that initial learning curve, but Phasmophobia is absolutely that kind of game – grab a few friends, go to a spooky house, and run around in the dark calling out to “Susan” or whatever their name was. You’ll have a hell of a time while you do.”</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Dead by Daylight | 2v8: Resident Evil Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The Dead by Daylight collaborations take place outside of Resident Evil continuity, so the game doesn't have to explain how any of this fits into RE's storylines. But the 2v8 mode does feature a map from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-2-review-re-vived-nightmares/1900-6417071/" data-ref-id="1900-6417071">Resident Evil 2</a> and Resident Evil 3 that recreates Raccoon City's Police Department. Additionally, Resident Evil's green and yellow herbs can be found and used for healing by the heroes. But if either Wesker or Nemesis find the herbs first, they can destroy them and get a boost of speed.</p><p>Behaviour Interactive has previously stated that there will be two survivor bots on every team in this 2v8 mode in order to reduce the killer queue time. The current Dead by Daylight x Resident Evil collaboration is only running through February 25. But we know of at least one big crossover coming down the line this summer: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-by-daylight-and-five-nights-at-freddys-are-finally-crossing-over/1100-6525552/" data-ref-id="1100-6525552">Dead by Daylight x Five Nights At Freddy's</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Kendrick Lamar's Super Bowl LIX performance has generated a lot of online chatter, and surprisingly, not all of it has to do with Drake. When the Grammy-winning rapper took the stage for the halftime show, the stage itself took the form of a tic-tac-toe board--but X's and O's were accompanied by a triangle and a square, which were meant to evoke the aesthetic of a "PlayStation-style controller," according to the show's coordinators and set designers. The idea--which Lamar personally dreamed up--was meant to represent the rapper's life as though it were a video game.</p><p dir="ltr">"I think the [video game theme] was symbolic, his way to reach young people," art director Shelley Rodgers told <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/true-story-behind-kendrick-lamar-super-bowl-halftime-show/" rel="nofollow ">Wired</a>. "A lot of it is showing his journey, [showing him] traveling through the American dream."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1888967930047594584" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><div dir="ltr"><p>Kendrick Lamar's Super Bowl halftime show set was inspired by the PlayStation controller, show's art director says </p><p>"Each performance space was shaped like a button on a PlayStation-style controller, a performance intended to portray Lamar’s life as a video game." </p><p>Via: <a href="https://twitter.com/WIRED?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@WIRED</a> <a href="https://t.co/OhQZmjTWEM" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/OhQZmjTWEM</a></p></div>  — CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1888967930047594584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 10, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">Creative director Mike Carson added that Lamar and his production company, pgLang, are "really into keeping things clean and minimal."</p><p dir="ltr">"We went with a monochromatic concrete look and allowed the video game motif to come alive through dialogue, lighting, choreography, and music," Carson said.</p><p dir="ltr">But despite the stage's streamlined, minimalist design, the folks running the show had several difficult hurdles to overcome. Lamar, his backup dancers, the lighting, and the stage itself had to be set up and ready to go in under eight minutes. Once the performance ended, production had had roughly six minutes to get everything off the field--without messing up the turf. Even though the Superdome's turf is synthetic, protecting it was still no small task, especially given the fact that part of the set dressing was a real GNX that had been heavily modified to allow Lamar's numerous backup dancers to enter the stage in a clown car-esque manner.</p><p dir="ltr">"They were on board with our vision from day one," Carson said of Shelley Rodgers, who worked to bring the vehicular optical illusion to life. "Even with this being one of the largest halftime footprints ever, Shelley and team came with clever ideas and guidance to help us maintain the design integrity and get this beast across the finish line."</p><p dir="ltr">But every good game needs a villain, and the halftime show appeared to serve as the final act in Lamar's seemingly endless beef with fellow rapper Drake. At one point in the show, Lamar told his female backup dancers that he wanted to perform "Not Like Us," but had decided against it because "people like to sue." But near the end of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDorKy-13ak" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his 13-minute performance</a>, Lamar performed a lightly censored version of the incredibly popular diss track. The "life as a video game" theme also resurfaced at the end of the show, with Lamar yelling "Game Over!" as the same words appeared in lights across the stadium.</p><p>Drake has yet to make a statement about the halftime performance. Lamar's rival was <a href="https://athlonsports.com/entertainment/drake-kendrick-lamar-reaction-halftime-show-super-bowl-beef" rel="nofollow ">reportedly out of the country</a> during the Super Bowl.</p>

			<p>Last Friday saw the release of the newest dungeon in Destiny 2, titled Sundered Doctrine. In this dungeon, Savathûn guides the Guardians through a Pyramid ship filled with Dread. Alongside the release of this dungeon, an official Dungeon Race will take place, where fireteams will be competing against each other to complete the activity with Contest Mode enabled. The first verified team that finishes the dungeon will receive a customized trophy. Those who complete Contest Mode within the first 48 hours will receive a special emblem and Exotic Weapon. Once the Contest Mode has been completed by a fireteam, Normal Mode will then unlock.</p>
<p>This content launched alongside Heresy, the new episodic content in Destiny 2 which followed on from<a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2s-revenant-act-1-comes-up-short-for-players/"> Revenant</a> and Echoes.</p>
<p>For those who want to see the teams that competed, you can watch it on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/evanf1997" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@cbgray" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a> or <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@cbgrayYT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tiktok</a>.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>For anyone who completes the dungeon by 9:59 AM PDT / 12:59 PM EDT / 6:59 PM BST will earn the <a href="https://bungiestore.com/rewards" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bungie Rewards</a> offer that will allow you to purchase the Sundered Doctrine assortment, which includes a work shirt, dungeon bracelet, and pin. Additionally, those who complete the Delver Title by 9:59 AM PDT / 12:59 PM EDT / 6:59 PM BST will earn the Bungie Rewards offer to purchase the Sundered Doctrine Title Pin. Above is a picture of some of the gear that you can purchase should you complete the dungeon in the required timeframe.</p>
<p>Along with the Sundered Doctrine dungeon being launched in Destiny 2, Destiny 2: Heresy launched, which takes Guardians back to Oryx's flagship named the Dreadnaught. Along with this comes new weapons, gear, and subclass Aspects. There will also be new artifact mods to collect and help you become more powerful in-game.</p>
<p>For those who like group content, The Nether debuts as a three-player activity that you can participate in, where players are able to harness the power of the Taken and utilize it to disrupt Anchors and stop the Taken invasion. This event is inspired by the events of Shattered Realm and The Coil.</p>

            <p>
Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick has hailed PC gaming's "increasing share of the market", in what you could optimistically interpret as the prelude to a GTA 6 PC release date announcement, and less optimistically, as a simple reassurance to investors who are fretting about the decline of console game sales.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto">Grand Theft Auto</a> is slated to release on Xbox and PlayStation in fall 2025. As per Rockstar Games tradition, the PC release remains TBA. For context, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> released on PC around 18 months after hitting Xbox 360 and PS3, while GTA 4 took an extra eight months or so, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> a year. 
</p>
<p>
This strategy of releasing PC versions late persists despite Zelnick's comment in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-unconcerned-by-plummeting-ps5-and-xbox-sales-insists-gta-6-will-cause-a-meaningful-uptick-in-console-sales-in-2025">Ian Games</a> that the PC version of a multiplatform game can account for over 40% of overall sales. "We have seen PC become a much more and more important part of what used to be a console business, and I wouldn't be surprised to see that trend continue," he told the site. "Of course, there will be a new console generation." 
</p>
<p>
Here is some slapdash background on the console biz, which is undergoing something of an evolutionary slow period. Only Nintendo - who basically operate their own games industry nested matryoshka doll-style inside the regular games industry - have announced their next big piece of hardware. We've yet to hear about PS6 and whatever Microsoft call the Nextbox, so there's a bit of a gap on the industry earnings forecast. In the meantime, the existing consoles are slowly petrifying like forgotten dragons, shipping fewer and fewer copies between them.
</p><p>
Zelnick reckons the release of GTA 6 might help with flagging console sales, even in a year when the US presidency is <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/esa-warns-of-negative-impact-to-come-with-trump-s-video-game-tariffs">picking lots of fights with trading partners</a>. And if it doesn't, hey, there's always the apparently thriving PC market.
</p>
<p>
"When you have a big title in the market and we have many of them coming, historically that has sold consoles," he told IGN. "And I think that will happen this year. I don't think tariffs are going to be our friend, but I think there will be a meaningful uptick in console sales in calendar 25 because of the release schedule, not just coming from us, but coming from others. So I'm not concerned about that [console sales falling]. I think the trend that you'd want to focus on is this increasing share of the market that is reflected in PC."
</p>
<p>OK, so, once more with feeling: GTA 6 PC release date when? Being a bear of little brain, I can't really explain Rockstar's tendency to show up late on PC, but I imagine it's not a resource question, given that Rockstar have thousands of developers and still earn megabucks from GTA 5 re-releases and GTA Online. The explanation that makes most sense to me is simply that shipping on PC "late" is an excuse to double-dip - max out the console sales initially, then polish up the tech for re-release on more capable PCs and, presumably, the next generation of consoles.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Some of the biggest games of 2025 are out this month, as well as some of the longest, with February bookended by massive RPGs that many players may spend all year slowly chipping away at. </p><p>Fans of open-world games are getting a slight reprieve.<em> Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>was originally also going to drop this month but was pushed to March at the last minute. That will free players up to take on sprawling adventures like <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em>, <em>Avowed</em>, and <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> instead. But there are a lot of cool-looking smaller games to checkout this month as well, at least a few of which could become sleeper GOTY contenders in their own right. Here are all the major game releases in February 2025:<br></p></div></div><div><p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em> is one of those sequels that takes the first game and tries to make it bigger, more detailed, and more immersive in every way. Based on early reviews, it basically accomplishes that. The medieval RPG sim is bursting with detailed side quests and gameplay friction that makes merely surviving a challenge. It’s been topping the Steam charts this month, even if its grueling realism won’t be everyone’s cup of tea. </p><p><strong>Developer:</strong> Warhorse Studios</p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> Deep Silver</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC</p></div><div><p>The Nintendo Switch exclusive is now on PC. Where <em>Crypt of the NecroDancer</em> was a rhythm-based dungeon crawler,<em> Rift </em>is a more familiar <em>Guitar Hero</em>-style puzzle adventure. It takes the enemy pattern recognition of the previous game and applies the escalating anxiety of combat that doesn’t end until the song’s over. It’s really great. </p><p><strong>Developer: </strong>Brace Yourself Games, Tic Toc Games</p><p><strong>Publisher: </strong>Klei Publishing</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Switch, PC</p></div><div><p><em>Momodora: Moonlit Farewell</em> is the latest entry in the <em>Momodora</em> series. Released on PC last year, the 2D, magic-infused anime Metroidvania is now on consoles as well. In a crowded genre, it manages to stand out thanks to beautiful art and fun exploration. </p><p><strong>Developer: </strong>Bombservice</p><p><strong>Publisher: </strong>Playism </p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, PC</p></div><div><p><em>Civilization VII</em> is the first new 4X game in the franchise in roughly a decade, and looks to streamline some of the strategy series’ gameplay while also making important changes like altering how historical eras work and adding new crisis events that can upend how things progress. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/civ-7-civilization-6-steam-reviews-ui-early-access-1851757977&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/civ-7-civilization-6-steam-reviews-ui-early-access-1851757977">Early players have hammered it</a></span> for its UI and other elements feeling “unfinished,” but it has a strong foundation to build on. </p><p><strong>Developer:</strong> Firaxis Games</p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> 2K</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, PC</p></div><div><p><em>Urban Myth Dissolution Center </em>is a visual novel in which you investigate cursed relics and paranormal anomalies against the backdrop of creepy, lo-fi cutscenes. As Azami Fukurai, you take on the role of detective, working for a <em>Ghostbusters</em>-like organization where you scrape social media to unravel urban legends. I hope it’s basically <em>X-Files</em> with cool psychedelic pixel art.</p><p><strong>Developer: </strong>Hakababunko</p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> Shueisha Games</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, Switch, PC</p></div><div><p>Slimes are usually introduced early on in RPGs as the easiest enemies to kill. In <em>Slime Heroes</em>, however, you actually play as one. It’s a souls-like action-RPG platformer in which you collect gems to unlock new abilities and enact your revenge on a colorful, uncaring world. There’s also local and online co-op. Slime buddies unite!</p><p><strong>Developer: </strong>Pancake Games</p><p><strong>Publisher: </strong>Whitehorn Games</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, Switch, PC</p></div><div><p><em>The Legend of Heroes: Trails Through Daybreak II</em> is the latest turn-based RPG in the sprawling <em>Trails</em> series. It takes place directly after the events of the first game, and includes cameos from veteran characters that will be harder to appreciate unless you’re up to speed on the previous entries. But if you’re looking for a long, intricate JRPG, this one’s for you. </p><p><strong>Developer: </strong>Nihon Falcom</p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> NIS America </p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, Switch, PC</p></div><div><p>The second batch of remastered classic <em>Tomb Raider</em> games has arrived. <em>Tomb Raider IV–VI Remastered</em> charts the action-adventure series’ shift from PS1 to PS2 and will include some of the bumpier games in the series history. Hopefully, the remastered elements make them easier to appreciate in a new light. </p><p><strong>Developer: </strong>Aspyr, Crystal Dynamics</p><p><strong>Publisher: </strong>Aspyr</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, PC</p></div><div><p>It’s been a while since we had a big, meaty first-person fantasy RPG. <em>Avowed,</em> from the studio behind <em>Fallout: New Vegas </em>and <em>The Outer Worlds</em>, will combine <em>Skyrim</em>-like gameplay with the world and lore of <em>Pillars of Eternity</em>, with a heavy emphasis on side quests and negotiating between various factions. It’ll be on Game Pass day one for PC and Ultimate subscribers. </p><p><strong>Developer:</strong> Obsidian Entertainment </p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> Xbox Game Studios</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Xbox Series X/S, PC</p></div><div><p>Four friends reunite later in life to retrace their memories of a pivotal summer long ago. <em>Lost Records</em> seems like <em>It</em> for ‘90s kids, leaning more into tech-fueled alienation than occult horror. It’ll be out in two parts with the first one coming this month. I don’t normally mesh well with narrative-driven adventure games but this one has me more intrigued than most. </p><p><strong>Developer:</strong> Dontnod </p><p><strong>Publisher: </strong>Dontnod</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC</p></div><div><p>  “War is over. War is just beginning.” That’s the slogan of <em>Stories from Sol: The Gun-Dog</em>, a retro sci-fi love letter to ‘80s anime where you manage a patrol ship on the edge of space investigating a strange new anomaly. It’s narrative-focused, so be ready for lots of reading, but the pixel-art animations of everything from ship console controls to mechs fighting in space look incredible. </p><p><strong>Developer: </strong>Space Colony Studios</p><p><strong>Publisher: </strong>Astrolabe Games, Meridiem Games</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, PS4, Switch, PC</p></div><div><p>When it comes to <em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</em>, you either know or you don’t. If you don’t, all that matters is it’s a real-time action spin-off taking place after the events of <em>Infinite Wealth</em>. It follows beloved side-character Goro Majima as he sails around to various islands taking on the local criminal underworld. </p><p><strong>Developer: </strong>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio</p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> Sega</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC</p></div><div><p>The once-forgotten Game Boy Advance exclusive is finally back. Action platformer <em>Ninja Five-O</em> was one of the Nintendo handheld’s most underrated games. Now players can once again step into the shoes of ninja Joe Osugi as he takes down a group of mystical terrorists in retro side-scrolling levels. </p><p><strong>Developer: </strong>Limited Run Games</p><p><strong>Publisher: </strong>Konami</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, PS4, Switch, PC</p></div><div><p>With an emphasis on wild movement, <em>The Local </em>is a first-person open-world shoot-em-up that looks super rad. All your favorite movement types are here including rail grinding,  sliding, wall running, climbing, air strafing, and bunny hopping. There’s also multiplayer and a leaderboard for chasing high scores. </p><p><strong>Developer: </strong>Tobey Gronow</p><p><strong>Publisher: </strong>JINC</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC</p></div><div><p>It’s time to duel! Yugi Mutou returns to card battling in a collection of over a dozen of the franchise’s earliest games, now with online play, save anywhere, rewind, and other modern quality-of-life features. </p><p><strong>Developer:</strong> Digital Eclipse </p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> Konami </p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, Switch</p></div><div><p><em>Monster Hunter </em>is finally makings its current-gen debut with <em>Wilds</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>built from the ground up for modern high-end consoles and gaming PCs. If you’ve never hopped on the monster hunting train before, now is probably the time. <em>Wilds</em> is shaping up to be one of the more visually impressive and mechanically rich entries in the action-RPG series. </p><p><strong>Developer:</strong> Capcom </p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> Capcom </p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC</p></div><div><p>The biggest (and only real) golfing franchise returns this month with its latest entry.<em> PGA Tour 2K25</em> overhauls the MyPlayer creation options and adds new swing settings and other tweaks. </p><p><strong>Developer:</strong> HB Studios</p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> 2K</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But sandwiched between the game’s four quarters was a spectacular performance by rapper Kendrick Lamar. Lamar’s performance transcended sports circles and was the talk of the internet last night. For most, it was a final nail in the coffin of the rapper’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kendrick-drake-beef-rap-battle-memes-internet-reactions-1851458972&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kendrick-drake-beef-rap-battle-memes-internet-reactions-1851458972">highly-publicized beef with Canadian rapper Drake</a></span>, but it also had a lot of commentary on the state of America, with President Donald Trump in the audience.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Let’s get the collective cultural catharsis out of the way first. The viral moment of the show was Lamar performing his now five-time Grammy-winning song “Not Like Us.” The song is one of many Lamar released during a public feud with Drake back in 2024, and has become a cultural phenomenon. With over a billion streams and multiple clips of entire crowds performing it (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HtmXTNn2Rw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HtmXTNn2Rw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">including the Grammy’s audience</a></span>), millions of people are celebrating a song that accuses Drake of being a culture vulture pedophile in reference to years of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.stylist.co.uk/people/millie-bobby-brown-drake-texting-relationship-friendship-stranger-things-grooming-twitter-controversy-paedophile-metoo-backlash-celebrity-news/228170&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/people/millie-bobby-brown-drake-texting-relationship-friendship-stranger-things-grooming-twitter-controversy-paedophile-metoo-backlash-celebrity-news/228170" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">allegations of grooming young women</a></span> in the entertainment industry. The song is a scathing diss on its own, but when it goes on to become a record-breaking, award-winning hit, that’s when you know you’ve lost the rap battle.</p><p>Lamar’s performance of “Not Like Us” was a big moment for the show in a few ways. At the midpoint of the show, Lamar had a brief intermission with some of the show’s dancers, during which he said he wanted to “perform their favorite song, but you know they love to sue,” while the instrumental “No Like Us” briefly played. This was seemingly a reference to Drake’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/drake-UMG-defamation-complaint.pdf&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/drake-UMG-defamation-complaint.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multiple lawsuits regarding the song</a></span>, and at first, it seemed to imply that Lamar was barred from playing it at the show. He then transitioned into a medley of “Luther” and “All the Stars” featuring the immaculate R&amp;B singer SZA, my queen, and it seemed like that was it. Lamar would omit his biggest hit seemingly to avoid further controversy…until about three minutes later, when he went to chat with his dancers one more time, said this was “bigger than the music,” and that someone “tried to rig the game, but you can’t fake influence.” Again, this was seemingly about Drake’s lawsuit trying to muzzle the song’s cultural impact.</p><p>Then he starts rapping and the crowd goes wild. In Super Bowl halftime shows, artists have to trim down their songs to maybe a minute or two, and the section of “Not Like Us” Lamar chose to perform is the most explicitly aimed at Drake, even calling him out by name. One popular meme is the point when Lamar looks into the camera with a devilish, shit-eating grin and says, “Hey Drake, I hear you like ‘em young.” The word “pedophile” was left out of the song, replaced by a wordless shout in the live show, but he still had the entire Caesars Superdome crowd singing along to, “Trying to strike a chord and it’s probably A Minor.” Fatality.</p><p>Lamar’s cocky strut while he smiles into the camera became an instant meme, but the entire show was a victory lap in a year-long campaign to bury Drake.</p><p>Hopefully not lost in the sauce is that this was also a commentary on the state of the United States and its attempts to silence Black voices. Samuel L. Jackson made multiple appearances during the show as the U.S. propaganda character Uncle Sam. He starts off emphasizing that the Super Bowl is “The Great American Game,” followed by Lamar rapping the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7liwdjvhWc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7liwdjvhWc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>GNX </em>teaser</a></span> that was released before his latest album, but has yet to be put on streaming services. However, he included a new lyric: “The revolution about to be televised. You picked the right time but the wrong guy.” This was seemingly a dig at fear-mongering President Donald Trump, who was in the audience but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/trump-super-bowl-chiefs-eagles-b2695214.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/trump-super-bowl-chiefs-eagles-b2695214.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">left during the second half</a></span>.</p><p>Uncle Sam returns after Lamar performs “Squabble Up,” one of his more rap-heavy tracks, and calls it “too loud, too reckless, too ghetto.” Then Lamar’s dancers, dressed in red, white and blue, arrange themselves to look like the American flag while he raps. Uncle Sam shows up a few more times to berate Lamar for not playing up what America believes the Super Bowl to be about. After the SZA medley, Sam appears one more time to say that “nice and calm” melodic songs are “what America wants.” He then proceeds to drag Drake across an entire football field. . As incredible as it was to see Drake get bodied on the biggest stage possible, this was a critique of the current state of America and the country’s history of policing Black art and voices. A lot of fans are hoping the overarching message of the show isn’t lost.</p><p>Lamar has had an incredible year and isn’t slowing down. Both he and SZA are preparing to embark on a co-headlining tour starting in April, and after seeing this show I might be about to buy tickets. Stream <em>GNX</em> and also SZA’s <em>Lana</em>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>New updates for Phasmophobia aren’t ending anytime soon as developer Kinetic Games has released its planned roadmap for 2025.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://www.kineticgames.co.uk/blog/phasmophobia-2025-roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the game’s website</a>, Kinetic went into details on what Phasmophobia players can expect throughout the year. That includes two major updates, new maps and reworks, and seasonal events.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The first major update is called Chronicle. This update is a revamp to how evidence is recorded during your hunt such as replacing the Photos tab with a Media tab that captures photos, videos, and sound.</p>



<p>“Chronicle will also bring with it a few extra bits aside from what we’ve mentioned, but we’re keeping those a secret until we’re closer to launch,” they said while pointing to a <a href="https://www.kineticgames.co.uk/blog/phasmophobia-dev-preview-18" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">prior development diary</a> with more information.</p>



<p>Regarding player characters, the studio is “refreshing character models, improving animations and adjusting the overall experience when it comes to your Phasmophobia character.” A planned full character customization feature is being pushed to 2026 to allow focus on the Horror 2.0 update. </p>



<h2 id="h-more-map-changes-are-coming">More Map Changes Are Coming</h2>



<p>Moving on to the map changes coming this year, Kinetic Games is reworking 6 Tanglewood Drive, Bleasdale Farmhouse and Grafton Farmhouse. Bleasdale will be released first in March with the other two reworks coming later this year.</p>



<p>“These reworks are all about bringing these maps in line with our full vision for them,” the developers said. “So you can expect to see complete artistic overhauls of each map, including new assets and animations, a high level of visual detail as well as a few layout changes. They’ll still be the maps you’ve grown to love through endless investigations, however.”</p>



<p>There will also be a new small map added to the game.  The studio says that all future maps will be “relatively small”  in order to push out new maps more frequently.</p>



<h2 id="h-beyond-2025">Beyond 2025</h2>



<p>Despite the latest updates being about 2025, Kinetic Games is also focused on the future of Phasmobia, including what’s to come in 2026. The studio is working on its major Horror 2.0 update for the year that includes more new maps and reworks. Details on all of that will come later on, though no timeframe was given.</p>



<p>What do you think of the 2025 roadmap for Phasmophobia? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/shovelware-playstation-crack-down-spam/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-might-be-cracking-down-on-%E2%80%98shovelware%E2%80%99-spam-games.1105041/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/shovelware-playstation-crack-down-spam/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In recent months, digital storefronts across all gaming platforms have seemingly become inundated with AI-generated games, ‘shovelware’, and rip-off titles. Many games that make it to these storefronts are questionable at best, boasting copy-and-paste assets, paltry mechanics, and rinse-and-repeat content.</p>



<p>IGN carried out a recent investigation into the state of the quality assurance processes protecting these storefronts, focusing most specifically on PlayStation and Nintendo stores. It was noticed in the last couple of days that some of these ‘spam games’ have been silently stripped from the PS5 store.</p>



<p>Are we about to witness a mass exodus of shovelware games from our digital stores?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-churn-them-out">Churn Them Out</h2>



<p>PlayStation users were complaining about a shovelware epidemic on the platform’s digital storefronts <strong>years ago</strong>. It’s a problem that has been brewing for a while, but it peaked recently with an investigation that was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-could-make-fart-fart-boobie-fart-the-game-and-maybe-it-would-eventually-get-taken-down-devs-reveal-why-the-consoles-are-drowning-in-eslop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">carried out by IGN</a>. It seems that QA processes are slacking, encouraging ‘developers’ to push dozens of asset-flip, AI-generated games to storefronts.</p>



<p>PS4 and PS5 users have noticed the vast amounts of shovelware winding up in their search results – and some developers are standing out as the key culprits.</p>



<p>For instance, <a href="https://www.truetrophies.com/publisher/RandomSpin-Games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">RandomSpin Games</a>, which releases multiple ‘games’ a month, all of which are low-effort, mostly pointless creations. <a href="https://www.truetrophies.com/publisher/breakthrough-gaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Breakthrough Gaming</a> is another name. This developer was releasing two or three ‘RPG’ games a month at its peak. How about <a href="https://www.truetrophies.com/publisher/zakym" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Zakym</a>, which in the last five or six weeks has released around a <strong>dozen games</strong> – you can likely imagine how bad they all are.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-quietly-removes-slop-shovelware-ps5-games-following-investigation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a> noticed today that stacks of titles from RandomSpin Games, one of the biggest offenders on PlayStation, have been removed on the DL. It hasn’t been highlighted <strong>why </strong>they’ve been removed, but it <strong>could be </strong>a knock-on impact from IGN’s investigation, and PlayStation’s store operators are getting wiser about these deceptive practices.</p>



<p>Now, what will they do about the ‘scam’ copies that pop up, like the fake Black Myth game or the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-switch-clone/">rip-off version of The Last of Us</a> on Nintendo Switch? </p>

                <p>Valve has seemingly introduced new rules that ban games that require users to watch paid ads (or rely on other such ad-based revenue models) from Steam. However, some sources report that these rules may have already existed, and that Valve has merely created <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/advertising" rel="nofollow">a dedicated page</a> on Steamworks to clarify this policy.</p><p dir="ltr">The page explains that Steam does not contain paid advertising, and that advertising-based revenue models are not allowed on the platform. It further states that developers are also prohibited from using advertising as a way to provide value to players, such as giving players an in-game reward for watching or engaging with ads.</p><p dir="ltr">"Developers should not utilize paid advertising as a business model in their game, such as requiring players to watch or otherwise engage with advertising in order to play, or gating gameplay behind advertising," the rule reads in part. "If your game's business model relies on advertising on other platforms, you will need to remove those elements before shipping on Steam."</p><p dir="ltr">This apparent change in Valve policy was first reported by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/valve-ban-advertising-based-business-models-on-steam-no-forced-adverts-like-in-mobile-games/" rel="nofollow">GamingOnLinux</a>. However, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/steamdb.info/post/3lhsxkmaj7c2c" rel="nofollow">SteamDB</a> posted screencaps on BlueSky that seem to show that this policy has been in effect for at least five years on a different page, and that this new page is a dedicated space for it that states it in a different way. Regardless, Valve did recently introduce a significant change to its storefront: warnings that note if a game in Early Access <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1iibeow/steam_now_warns_about_early_access_that_have_not/" rel="nofollow">hasn't been updated</a> in more than a year. These alerts are ostensibly intended to inform users that the development timeline described on a game's page might not have come to fruition, or if the game has been outright abandoned.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-roadmap-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kinetic Games has shared the&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>roadmap for 2025, showing what you can expect from the multiplayer-focused ghost-hunting horror game throughout the rest of this year.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.kineticgames.co.uk/blog/phasmophobia-2025-roadmap" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on its blog, Kinetic splits said&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>roadmap into three elements: major updates, maps and reworks, and seasonal events. In the first column, you can look forward to the Chronicle update first, which will revamp evidence recording and bring "a few extra bits". It has no release date yet, sadly.</p>

<p><em>Phasmophobia</em>'s second major update this year will bring a player character overhaul to give you more choices when it comes to your ghost hunter. You can expect refreshed models, improved animations, and more. Full customization, however, isn't coming until 2026.</p>

Kinetic is keeping its cards close to its chest, but the developer does say the map will be "small" and based in a "totally unique" location.</p>

<p>Reworks are also coming for several maps. You can expect redone versions of Bleasdale and Grafton Farmhouses, as well as 6 Tanglewood Drive.</p>

<p>The first rework for Bleasdale Farmhouse will arrive sometime in March, Kinetic says, and the latter two will be coming sometime later in the year. In 2026, more map reworks and new maps will be coming, although Kinetic doesn't share any details about those.</p>

<p>Finally, the new 2025&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>roadmap looks ahead to seasonal events, with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-crimson-eye-update" rel="nofollow">Halloween</a> and winter events repeating "with the same themes" this year. A "new take" on the Easter event will also be coming in April.</p>

However, Hindenburg claims Roblox “intentionally conflates” actual people with daily users, as that number could also include alt accounts and bots.

I worry this feature could be used for bad, but the company says videos must adhere to its community standards.</p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NDg3NzM=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/17/23921001/roblox-employees-return-to-office-metaverse-isnt-good-enough">Roblox says employees must return to office because the metaverse still isn’t good enough</a></h2><div><p>Roblox — a company that builds a hugely popular virtual experiences platform, recently introduced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/8/23864026/roblox-connect-video-chat">its own spin on video chat</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/10/23827740/roblox-virtual-career-center-job-interviews">even created an in-<em>Roblox</em> career center</a> — is “transitioning away” from remote work and will be asking “a number of our remote employees to begin working from our headquarters in San Mateo by next summer,” CEO David Baszucki wrote in an email to staff <a href="https://blog.roblox.com/2023/10/future-work-together-roblox/">shared publicly on Tuesday</a>.</p><p>Like many other companies, Roblox will be shifting to a model where employees are expected to work three days in the office (Tuesday through Thursday). Staffers will have until January 16th, 2024, to decide if they want to stay on at the company under the new rules. If an employee chooses to stay at Roblox and relocate, the company will help with relocation costs and expects them to report into the company’s San Mateo, California, offices by July 15th, 2024.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/17/23921001/roblox-employees-return-to-office-metaverse-isnt-good-enough">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Roblox is now available on PlayStation.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>The CEO of Bumble says that the metaverse is “kind of contrary to everything I believe in in terms of getting humans to look each other in the eye.”</p><p>Roblox CEO David Baszucki thinks people <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/8/23864858/roblox-ceo-prediction-adults-dating-experiences-rdc-2023">will be dating in Roblox</a>, but at Code 2023, Bumble CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd doesn’t sound like a fan of that idea. “Maybe that is how people will originally connect,” she said, but noted that “I will be much more sad for humanity than myself if people just stop really meeting in real life.”</p></div></li></ul><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23864790/roblox-news-announcements-updates/archives/2"><span>More Stories</span></a></section></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
