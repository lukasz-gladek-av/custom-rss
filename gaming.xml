<figure><a title="Switch 2 / Vita" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/210b61a9a6315/switch-2-vita.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Despite Sony's PS5 being on the market for nearly five years at this point, it still somehow feels <em>way</em> too soon to be talking about the inevitable PS6 – who even wants or needs one yet? Alas, here we are.</p>
<p>The latest rumour from YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead">Moore's Law is Dead</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/08/rumour-ps6-handheld-device-can-be-docked-like-nintendo-switch-2">Push Square</a>) is particularly significant, because it seems to hint that Sony is planning to launch a variant of the PS6 that will not only be handheld, but can be docked – just like the Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>Codenamed 'Canis', the handheld is supposedly one of three SKUs planned for the PS6. The main one will be the 'Orion', which will be your bog-standard 'flagship' console with <em>all the specs</em>. The second is the 'Canis' handheld, and the third is the 'Canis' console, or the 'PS6 S'.</p>
<p>The latter two will share similar specs and will likely lean closer to what Sony is currently offering with the PS5/PS5 Pro, albeit with a few minor upgrades here and there.</p>
<p>So essentially, rather than focusing on sheer power – because if it ain't obvious by now, we're very much in the era of diminishing returns – Sony is seemingly looking to capture both the console and handheld market. Hopefully this might also mean that it's is able to offer slightly cheaper options, because if the so-called 'Orion' is going to retail at a similar price to the PS5 Pro ($749.99 / £699.99), Sony's going to have a real hard time shifting many of them.</p>
<p>Still, it's early days yet. It's best to take these rumours with a grain of salt for now until Sony officially reveals its plans.</p>
<p>Tell you what though, we know we said it's still way too early for a PS6, but a proper, native handheld PlayStation sounds awfully tempting...</p>

            <p>A group of more than 450 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo</a> developers have voted to form a union at Blizzard, under the banner of the Communications Workers of America (CWA).</p>
<p>According to a CWA press release, the new union is made up of game developers, artists, designers, engineers, and support staff across the Diablo series, and has already been formally recognised by Blizzard parent company Microsoft. These workers join the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/over-500-world-of-warcraft-developers-at-blizzard-have-voted-to-form-microsofts-biggest-wall-to-wall-union">over 500</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/overwatch-devs-have-formed-an-almost-200-person-strong-union-with-the-cwa-called-the-overwatch-gamemakers-guild">almost 200</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> devs who each formed their own unions earlier this year.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As you'd imagine, Microsoft's recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">mass layoffs</a> were a big factor in these Diablo staffers opting to union up now, with other concerns including the avoidance of crunch and a "passion tax" that centres around the idea you might feel obligated to accept less for a dream job.</p>
<p>"With every subsequent round of mass layoffs, I've witnessed the dread in my coworkers grow stronger because it feels like no amount of hard work is enough to protect us," said Kelly Yeo, a Diablo game producer and member of the organising committee member. "I am overjoyed that we have formed a union—this is just the first step for us joining a movement spreading across an industry that is tired of living in fear. We are ready to begin fighting for real change alongside our Diablo colleagues."</p>
<p>Ryan Littleton, another Diablo game designer and committee member, added:</p>
<blockquote>The day after the third round of mass layoffs, I walked into the office, and when I tried to open the door to the cafeteria, my badge was denied. For a moment, I wondered if getting breakfast was how I'd find out I was part of that round. While luckily it was just a technical issue, none of us should have to live with that constant worry that we might be let go at the drop of a hat. A union allows us to organize across the industry to make great games and protect the developers who create them from the constant pressures of layoffs, passion tax, and crunch.</blockquote>
<p>Teams at Blizzard aren't the only folks at Microsoft who've moved to unionise recently. Staff at the likes of Call of Duty developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/raven-software-qa-staff-win-their-fight-for-union-vote">Raven Software</a>, Fallout and Elder Scrolls studio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bethesda-game-studios-developers-ecstatic-to-announce-a-241-strong-wall-to-wall-union">Bethesda</a>, and Elder Scrolls Online developer ZeniMax have also opted to seek protections. In the case of unionised ZeniMax staff, their union claimed it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-union-say-theyre-fighting-for-staff-left-in-limbo-by-microsoft-cancelling-mmo-as-part-of-mass-layoffs">fighting for the jobs of workers</a> left in limbo by the abrupt cancellation of an unannounced MMO as part of Microsoft's July mass layoffs.</p>
<p>Solidarity to these freshly-unionised Diablo devs.</p>

            <p>
Red Hook have just released the third and final part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkest-dungeon-2">Darkest Dungeon 2</a>’s Kingdoms mode - a boardgame-style add-on experience that sees you moving a stagecoach around a map’s worth of benighted inns, fending off pigmen, witches and - as of this update - giant mosquitos. 
</p>
<p>
To celebrate, they’ve also made the base roguelike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> free on Steam until September 1st. Admittedly, being offered Darkest Dungeon 2 for free is a bit like somebody warmly offering to give you the plague. But this is the fun kind of plague, a plague rich in dicey turn-based battles, grindy but engrossing character development, and suppurating vistas of cthulhoid swampfields.

<p>
I think that, on balance, I prefer the first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkest-dungeon">Darkest Dungeon</a>’s cliffside ambience and town/dungeon format. I find the older side-scrolling dungeons less fussy than the second game’s branching 3D road systems, and I think the original game’s handling of sanity and darkness is expressed more compellingly through the layered dungeon soundtrack. Here is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/darkest-dungeon-review">what Joe Donnelly thought about it</a> in 2016: "You’ll cry. And cry and cry and cry. But I think you’ll love it."</p><p>I think the second game’s combat system is superior, though – it boils off some of the numberfluff and introduces a more readable system of HUD tokens, while retaining the same, diabolical relationship between party member positioning and skill availability. Laena Hafer summarised the game thusly in our 2023 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/darkest-dungeon-2-review">Darkest Dungeon 2 review</a>: "A roguelite sequel that takes a few steps forward and one or two back from the original, but keeps the gloomy but intense spirit alive."
</p>
<p>
If you’ve played neither, both are fine, gruelling RPGs with amazing narration and glorious visuals cut straight from the pages of Hellboy. Kingdoms brings back a little of the first game’s feel, married to the second game’s wagoneering, but is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/darkest-dungeon-2s-free-kingdoms-mode-is-out-now-and-its-got-its-red-hooks-in-me-already">pretty much its own thing</a>. You must defend inns as they come under siege, while travelling about to gather party members and complete a central questline before the map is swamped by nasties. Speaking of which, here's what they're adding in the third major Kingdoms update Curse of the Court, which is available now:
</p>
<blockquote>Swarms of Bloodsuckers have descended upon the Kingdom, bringing with them a supernatural contagion that can inflict your heroes with the dreaded Crimson Curse! Players will be challenged in an all-new questline to find a cure for this rapidly spreading infection and exterminate The Bloodsuckers before time runs out! Additionally, this release features new achievements to earn, and three new Kingdoms maps, each with a different layout that presents a unique set of challenges. These new maps are playable on any of the three different Kingdoms modules.</blockquote>
<p>
If you come down with a severe case of Dankest Sturgeon 2 this weekend, take comfort in the knowledge that they’re running a discount alongside the free timed promotion - 63% off, or more if you buy a bundle with all the DLC.

Both battles appear to be from different parts of the game, allowing you to try out both basic and advanced abilities. The first fight is against the Rose Queen, a quick enemy who deals out "flurries of rapid strikes." You can try out some late-game abilities and a two-handed greatsword in the second boss battle against Holy Knight Commander Victor and the Ancient Mecha. Keep in mind that your progress in the demo will not transfer to the full game.</p>

            <p>Earlier this year, the team at CD Projekt Red announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> would be a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> launch title. Not only that, the studio was going to offer those interested a physical game cartridge to purchase, with the actual game on it.</p>
<p>This decision put CD Projekt in the relative minority, as many other third party studios were instead favouring 'key cards' for their own Switch 2 releases. These key cards don't actually contain game data, and instead trigger a download from the Nintendo eShop when they are popped into the device.</p>
<p>And, this move has paid off. Last night, CDPR released its latest <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/pl/wp-content/uploads-pl/2025/08/prezentacja-wynikowa-h1-2025-en.pdf">financial results</a> and it turns out that the Switch 2 community really does like its physical media. Of Cyberpunk 2077's Switch 2 sales in June, over 75 percent were physical.</p>

<p>As you can see in the image below, only 24.6 percent of the games Switch 2 sales were digital.</p>
<p>While we don't have sales figures for Cyberpunk 2077, back in June it was reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-third-party-sales-reportedly-very-low-despite-record-breaking-console-launch">CD Projekt's Cyberpunk 2077 was the "best-selling third-party game during the launch of Switch 2"</a>, and did "reasonable numbers" on Nintendo's latest console.</p>
<p>Prior to its Switch 2 debut, CD Projekt's VP of business development Jan Rosner said having Cyberpunk 2077 as a "cartridge with a plug and play experience" on Switch 2 was "the right thing to do". At this time, the studio exec noted that physical games remain vital to Nintendo's player base, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-developer-comments-on-switch-2-key-cards-says-having-proper-cartridge-with-a-plug-and-play-experience-is-right-thing-to-do">developers should not "underestimate" this</a>.</p>

<p>CDPR isn't the only studio to buck the third-party 'key cards' trend. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-racing-crossworlds-will-buck-third-party-switch-2-trend-with-full-game-on-card">Sega announced Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds' release will have the full game on the Switch 2 card</a>.</p>

            <p>
Blizzard's Diablo team is the latest group of Microsoft workers to form a union, with over 450 developers voting in favour of representation with the Communications Workers of America.
</p>
<p>
The decision follows <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-june-2025-tracking-the-situation-as-it-happens">mass layoffs at Microsoft back in June</a>, with workers at the company seeking fair compensation, job security, and an opportunity to improve workplace conditions.
</p>
<p>
Other unions formed by Microsoft workers include Blizzard's story and franchise development team, as well as employees at ZeniMax Media and Raven Software. There are now over 3,500 employees at Microsoft in CWA organised unions.
</p>
<p>
"With every subsequent round of mass layoffs, I've witnessed the dread in my coworkers grow stronger because it feels like no amount of hard work is enough to protect us," said Kelly Yeo, a game producer on Diablo and organising committee member. "I am overjoyed that we have formed a union - this is just the first step for us joining a movement spreading across an industry that is tired of living in fear. We are ready to begin fighting for real change alongside our Diablo colleagues."
</p>
<p>
The union includes developers, artists, designers, engineers, and support staff working across the Diablo franchise.
</p>
<p>
"My entire career as a developer has seen my peers and I paying the 'passion tax' for working in an industry that we love," said Nav Bhatti, a senior software engineer and organising committee member. "At some point you have to choose between fight or flight, and forming a union is us doing just that - standing our ground in the industry."
</p><p>
"Diablo workers are the latest to show that California has become a hub for video game worker organising," said CWA local 9510 president Jason Justice. "What's happening here is part of a much larger story about turning the tide in an industry that has long overlooked its labour. Entertainment workers across film, television, music, and now video games are standing together to have a seat at the table. The strength of our movement comes from that solidarity."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pay-rises-ai-regulation-and-layoff-protection-what-activision-blizzards-newly-unionised-employees-want-from-microsoft">spoke to members of Blizzard's story and franchise development team about their union</a>, discussing their demands from Microsoft.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>True adventure isn’t that easy to come by, but perhaps if you’re a squire to the world’s greatest knight, things are just that little bit easier. It sure seems that way at the opening of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-knightling">The Knightling</a>, the latest third-person action adventure from the team at Twirlbound. Out on patrol with Sir Lionstone, you’re ambushed by an Earthborn creature, nearly dying at its hands were it not for Sir Lionstone throwing his shield, Magnustego, in front of you. As your liege gives chase and disappears, you’re faced with a trek back to town, heavy shield in tow, and the slight sinking feeling that he’s not going to be back for a while.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Knightling - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DFjhAL2m8uI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It’s a gut instinct you should listen to, as The Knightling embarks on his own adventures in the absence of Lionstone. Starting off small and learning the tricks and techniques to owning a massive shield, you’re soon making yourself indispensable to the local townsfolk before starting to impress the Queen and the landed gentry, all the while keeping a watchful eye on the horizon in the hope of your mentor returning.</p>


<p>The Knightling is immediately endearing. It’s hard to explain what it is that gets straight under your skin. Perhaps it’s the chunky, characterful art design – there’s a dash of Breath of the Wild and a hint of Darksiders here – or the animated facial movements of the Knightling despite only really being a pair of eyes. It may be just incredibly relatable. That position as an apprentice who’s thrust into bigger and tougher tasks without any real guidance, is one that few could forget.</p>
<p>The Knightling manages to evoke an incredible sense of scale with its chunky, playful visuals. Huge chasms, immense palaces and never-ending fields are laid out in front of you, simply begging to be explored, whether bouncing and jumping to the highest point, riding the wind, or slip sliding all the way down on the back of your shield. Movement is one of the game’s greatest achievements, and just getting from one point to another, working out the best route, and playing with the different systems is fun from start to finish.</p>


<p>That sense of scale is enhanced by a light approach to side quests and additional tasks. There are plenty of things to find, discover and do out here, from discovering treasure to taking part in races on your shield, but they get the balance right between things to distract and things that are meaningful and interesting.</p>
<p>Side Quests often leave you with artefacts which stand as a reminder of the people you’ve helped along the way, giving each activity a permanence that many games simply don’t manage all the way through. In fairness, I’d actually have liked a few more, but the focus and scope here remain tight, presumably, in part, due to the game’s budget.</p>
<p>There’s a strong sense of forward motion at all times, with the Knightling and Magnustego both capable of growth, upgrading each through different collectables and growing your range of offensive and defensive skills.</p>

<p>You’ll need to utilise and maximise every one of them too, with combat in The Knightling proving to be no slouch, despite the welcoming visuals. Blocking, parrying and dodging play a key role, while you steadily grow more proficient at bashing everything in sight with your immense shield.&nbsp;It builds into a serious task as you struggle to handle large groups of bandits and creatures at the same time, but it rarely feels unfair, and save points are generous enough that you don’t lose too much progress when they take you down.&nbsp;There’s not a huge breadth of enemies, but those that are here, particularly the larger boss characters, retain the same idiosyncratic characterisation as the central cast, and they look great.</p>
<p>Besides fighting, there’s a lot of platforming, with the Knightling capable of a reliable double jump, before expanding his moveset to include a handy glide ability. Getting to the top of things is often part of an area’s allure, and, barring a few annoying sections, movement remains continually fun. That’s helped by the various races that appear throughout the game, lending the game an old-school Banjo or 3D Mario feel, and going fast is often rewarded with a heap of treasure. They’re very addictive, and the kind of thing you find yourself losing serious time with in the quest for the gold.</p>

<p>Mention has to go to the orchestral soundtrack, with the Tumult Kollektiv trio – made up of Jonathan Howe, Leonhard van Voorst and Alexander van der Kruijf – providing a stream of beautiful compositions shifting between playful, dramatic and epic with barely a pause. Exploration in particular gives you a real chance to appreciate the melodies and nuance of each piece, and the sense of scale, drama and adventure here wouldn’t be the same without them.</p>
<p>The Knightling’s only occasional misstep is in performance, and on standard PS5 there are occasions where the frame rate dips, or there’s pop-in of textures and details. It’s actually moderately power-intensive – based at least on my experience of playing it for preview on my 3070-equipped PC – but they’re minor kinks that feel as though a patch would smooth them out. They’re few and far between enough not to detract from the experience, as is the very occasionally wayward camera, and they’re easy things to forgive when the rest of the game is so enjoyable.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-shown-new-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lost Soul Aside</a>, the long-anticipated action game developed by Ultizero Games (and initially made by a single man, Yang Bing), is finally out now on PC and PlayStation 5. The developer has released a free demo on both platforms to give users a taste of the game before committing to the full expense of $59.99 (for the base edition; the deluxe one is $10 more expensive). According to the studio, the demo allows players to experience selected combat encounters from the full game, try out different abilities and weapons, and face challenging boss fights.</p>



<p>To celebrate the launch event, there's also a launch trailer, which we've embedded below. However, earlier user reviews on the Steam platform are not promising. Only 54% of 247 reviews submitted up to this point are positive. In most cases, users report their first impressions of a game that is still rough, unpolished, and with performance issues. That perhaps explains why publisher Sony did not send out review codes in advance to the press, as they practically always do.</p>

<p>The official X account of Lost Soul Aside has already <a href="https://x.com/Lost_Soul_Aside/status/1961327660228821305" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">addressed</a> a specific bit of feedback regarding cutscene issues that will be fixed with an upcoming patch:</p>



<p><em>We have received your feedback regarding the performance of certain cutscenes in the prologue of Lost Soul Aside. Currently, some of these cutscenes are pre-rendered 4K/30fps videos, which may cause occasional stuttering during playback. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate your understanding. The Lost Soul Aside team is actively working on optimizations, and future updates will address this to deliver a smoother gameplay experience.</em></p>



<p>It sounds like it may be best to wait a while longer before jumping into the game and trying to rescue Kaser's sister, Louisa, and save humanity in the process.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, HoYoVerse (previously known as miHoYo) has announced a new creature collector strategy game titled Honkai: Nexus Anima. As you can guess from its title, it is set in the same universe as <a href="https://wccftech.com/honkai-star-rail-version-2-6-update-launches-october-23/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Honkai: Star Rail</a>, the free-to-play gacha RPG launched in 2023.</p>



<p>This game will play very differently, though, as you can see in the footage embedded below. Here's the official description provided by the development team: </p>



<p><em>In the game, players take on the role of a plane-hopping traveler who has escaped captivity, embarking on an all-new adventure. The journey begins in a tranquil town that opens into uncharted realms. As players advance, they encounter Anima companions with distinct personalities and forge bonds that carry through both exploration and combat. In Nexus Battles, these companions stand beside players as the story uncovers the mysteries of the protagonist’s past. As the latest major entry in the Honkai series, Honkai: Nexus Anima continues to deliver the franchise’s signature high-quality storytelling and artistic style, and it also marks a bold new chapter in both gameplay and worldbuilding.</em></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="In-game footage from Honkai: Nexus Anima" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dGfTS72aEOs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>HoYoVerse is currently recruiting for a 'Nexus Bond' test that will be available via PC and iOS devices, with the studio sharing these recommended PC specs: Intel i5 (11th Gen)/AMD Ryzen 5 5000 series or higher CPU, a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060/AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT or higher graphics card, and 16GB RAM. Windows 10 64-bit or higher and 15GB of space are also required. For iOS, you will need an iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 13 Pro, or any later model (excluding iPhone 13 and 13 mini). The app requires iOS 14.0 or above, 6GB of device RAM, and 10GB of space.</p>



<p>Signups are open <a href="https://hna.hoyoverse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the official website</a> through Friday, September 12. Honkai: Nexus Anima is definitely one game to watch, especially after the enormous success of Genshin Impact and, to a lesser extent, Zenless Zone Zero.</p>

In this world, Nexus is the unseen bonds woven between paired concepts, such as Love and Hate, Light and Dark, Life and Death, among many others. However, this balance is unexpectedly shattered when a sudden rupture severs those connections, scattering their remnant powers across the land in the form of Anima. From this fractured order, players embark on a journey: through missions and combat, they forge bonds with these Anima, unlocking abilities that reflect the unique concepts each embodies. Moreover, these abilities can be combined to create diverse battle tactics and influence how players explore and engage with the expansive overworld.</p><p>In the game, players take on the role of a plane-hopping traveler who has escaped captivity, embarking on an all-new adventure. The journey begins in a tranquil town that opens into uncharted realms. As players advance, they encounter Anima companions with distinct personalities and forge bonds that carry through both exploration and combat.

As the latest major entry in the <em>Honkai</em> series, <em>Honkai: Nexus Anima</em> continues to deliver the franchise’s signature high-quality storytelling and artistic style, and it also marks a bold new chapter in both gameplay and worldbuilding.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the first trailers below.

<p>"The guild authorizes a special collaboration"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Recently, it was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> content appearing in <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/monster_hunter_wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, and now Capcom is flipping this crossover around.</p>
<p>The developer will be bringing the hunt to its latest Street Fighter entry, dressing the fighters up with new EX colours, "new gears" and more. This limited-time event will be taking place between <strong>1st September 2025</strong> and <strong>30th September 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Here's some PR about what exactly you can expect, and you can see it all in motion in the video above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The guild authorizes a special collaboration between Street Fighter 6 and Monster Hunter Wilds, the latest installments in both of these iconic franchises!</p>
<p>All players who log in during the event period will get special collab items! The Shop will also be stocked with special EX colors for Blanka, Akuma, Manon, Cammy, and Ken inspired by some wild creatures.</p>
<p>During this event, the Battle Hub will also get a new makeover while we run a special Street Voter event. Finally, the Monster Hunter 20th Anniversary Fighting Pass will return for the collab!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As noted, the game's online Battle Hub is also getting a themed makeover, and the 20th Anniversary <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/monster_hunter_rise_sunbreak">Monster Hunter</a> Fighter Pass will be making a return, so join in on the festivities while you can.</p>
<p>This follows on from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/street-fighter-6s-first-season-3-dlc-character-is-out-now-heres-a-look">recent release of the DLC fighter Sagat</a>, with multiple other characters also on the way as part of the Season 3 update. When we see and hear more about these additional fighters joining the roster, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>Although there's no word about Monster Hunter Wilds making its way to the Switch 2, Capcom did recently announce <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3</a> for the platform. It will be arriving on Nintendo's new hardware at some point in <strong>2026</strong>.</p>

<p>Go shopping with Kirby</p>

<p>Nintendo has been celebrating Kirby in all sorts of ways recently, and apart from the return of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a> on the Switch 2 this week, it's also been restocking its online shops with some goodies.</p>
<p>The item above, which first appeared in 2022, might not be the most exciting, but hey – we're sure some fans out there will appreciate "shopping bag" Kirby. You can get this "exclusive" My Nintendo Store product in the US and Canada for <strong>600 Platinum Points</strong> (<a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1961104654101627083">thanks for the heads up, Wario64</a>).</p>
<p>Here's a bit more about it, along with another look. One other thing to note is <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/15575?_gl=1*l9scot*_gcl_au*Mzc3MzcxMjUxLjE3NTY0Mjg1MDc.*_ga*MzM2MjI1NS4xNzU2NDI4NTA4*_ga_F6ERC4HMNZ*czE3NTY0Mjg1MDckbzEkZzEkdDE3NTY0MzAxNTAkajU4JGwwJGg5NDQ5MDE5MzI.">shipping fees apply</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kirby and the Forgotten Land Shopping Bag - This handy reusable bag features Kirby looking ready to transform to mouthful mode… perfect for shopping! Size: 23" x 16” (folded – 5 x 5”)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This follows some news about an update to the My Nintendo Store in Australia and New Zealand, which added all sorts of Kirby merchandise.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/kirby/related-articles:187151 @ 1756460306 -->
<p>And if this wasn't already enough Kirby news for one week, Nintendo has also recently revealed it will be releasing a Kirby update for its sound clock, Nintendo Alarmo. Additionally, there's a Kirby event taking place in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tetris_99">Tetris 99</a> this week, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a> recently got updated with some more Forgotten Land tracks.</p>

<p>The third-party title got a full cartridge release</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Cyberpunk 2077" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6b1cb4e9b9f45/cyberpunk-2077.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: CD Projekt Red</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Switch 2 generation has got off to a solid start, but not everything has been rosy – with Game-Key Cards becoming a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-will-you-be-buying-any-game-key-card-switch-2-games">huge talking point within the community</a>. Many third-party developers are currently shipping their games on these cards, but have also come under fire for not offering <em>proper</em> physical releases.</p>
<p>Of course, outside of first-party Nintendo games, there are a handful of teams offering their titles on full game cards, so what's the pay-off? While we haven't really had any information about this up until now, CD Projekt Group's latest financial report has shared data about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s digital and physical sales in the Switch 2's launch month.</p>
<p>According to a graphic on the fourth page of this report, approximately <strong>75.4%</strong> of Switch 2 users who purchased this title in June bought the physical version, which contained the entire game on the cartridge. As you can see, <strong>24.6%</strong> opted to purchase the game digitally last month, with the game also hovering at the top of eShop purchases in its opening month.</p>
<figure><a title="Cyberpunk 2077" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bd341d2a7cee8/cyberpunk-2077.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: CD Projekt Red</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>One thing this report didn't reveal was the exact sales figures, but according to some other sales updates in select regions recently, Cyberpunk 2077 has been featured in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/switch-2-launch-helps-boost-us-video-game-spending-to-record-june-high">best-selling charts in its opening month</a> on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>This follows comments by CDPR's Vice President of Business Development Jan Rosner, who <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/cyberpunk-2077-dev-tells-studios-do-not-underestimate-the-physical-edition">spoke earlier this year about offering a "complete" physical edition</a> of Cyberpunk 2077 for Switch 2 – stating at the time how "Nintendo at physical retail is still strong, and retail is, in general, not going anywhere".</p>
<p>He further noted how physical releases are "especially important for the Nintendo audience", acknowledging how "the right thing to do" was to have Cyberpunk 2077 "on the cartridge".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Electronic Arts revealed earlier this year that <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-college-basketball-march-madness-return-2028-ps5-1851785339">it’s planning to add a college basketball game</a> to its ever-expanding roster of sports franchises. Then 2K Games came out hours later and indicated <a href="https://kotaku.com/2k-college-hoops-ea-college-football-26-1851784967">it was doing the same</a>. Now new reporting suggests both publishers have been at war behind the scenes trying to lock up the deals needed to make an NCAA basketball game a reality.</p> <p><a href="https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Articles/2025/08/28/sources-ea-sports-college-basketball-video-game-talks-hit-snag/"><em>Sports Business Journal </em>reports</a> that while EA won a bidding round earlier this year with the Collegiate Licensing Company for the rights to the NCAA brand, 2K Games has moved forward with its own college basketball game by trying to negotiate brand partnerships with individual colleges like UCLA.</p> <p><span data-testid="content-text">“UCLA Athletics and UCLA Trademarks &amp; Licensing, an enterprise of the </span><span data-testid="content-text">Associated Students UCLA</span><span data-testid="content-text">, have announced a long-term collaboration with&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text">2K</span><span data-testid="content-text"> which will see the UCLA Men’s and Women’s Basketball programs bring the rich legacy of Bruins basketball to a future project,” the school <a href="https://www.licenseglobal.com/basketball/ucla-men-s-and-women-s-basketball-confirmed-for-2k-college-basketball-project">announced on Thursday</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bring the Madness.

According to <em>Sports Business Journal</em>, it wanted the rights to everything in NCAA divisional basketball on both men’s and women’s leagues, which would give it the sort of exclusivity stranglehold it long had with the NFL in its <em>Madden</em> series. And if EA doesn’t get its way, sources told <em>Sports Business Journal</em> the publisher might abandon the upcoming game altogether.</p> <p>“The opportunity that’s excited us in college basketball is to deliver a full, standalone experience that captures everything that makes the sport so special,” EA Sports VP Sean O’Brien told <em>SBJ</em> in a statement. “The approach we’ve proposed is to create a game that includes all 350-plus NCAA Division I schools—both men’s and women’s teams included—with name, image and likeness compensation for all athletes, 32 conferences, the NCAA and all things that make ‘March Madness’ the most exciting month of sports and all the traditions and pageantry fans love.”</p>

 <p>Basically, 2K Games, which was reportedly part of the NCAA bidding war but lost to EA, has decided to move ahead with a college basketball game regardless. While it abandoned its<em> Hoops</em> franchise over a decade ago, it’s been releasing<em> NBA2K</em> every year and could quickly spin off a new version of it for college teams or, as <em>SBJ</em> reports, possibly position it as an add-on or expansion for the existing franchise.</p> <p>EA, which also abandoned its basketball franchise over a decade ago, will have to start from scratch. <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2025/08/26/ea-sports-college-basketball-video-game/85645694007/">Recent reporting</a> suggests a new game would be years away at best and possibly <a href="https://x.com/ChrisVannini/status/1939704916269818312">not arrive until 2028 or later</a>. Unless it can get the NCAA and its member schools to pull the plug on 2K’s game, it’ll be coming in late. A big part of what helped <em>EA Sports College Football</em> explode in popularity last year was years of pent-up demand. Now both publishers are in a race to see who can cash in on the latest untapped market for annual sports games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I love it when a game comes out of nowhere and surprises me. Earlier this month, that is exactly what happened when I saw the trailer for <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-onl-2025-resident-evil-silent-hill-silksong-2000618460"><em>VoidBreaker</em> during Gamescom Opening Night Live</a>. I downloaded the fast-paced sci-fi roguelike FPS shortly after seeing it, and not only is it good, but it might be one of the best shooters I’ve played all year. And it was made almost entirely by one guy, Daniel Stubbington.</p> <p><em>VoidBreaker</em> is an incredibly fast and sleek first-person shooter available now in early access on Steam and Game Pass PC. The game is set inside a large, highly advanced AI program that is using human test subjects to gather data on combat and warfare. This involves you endlessly fighting and dying over and over again through “runs” of the program’s randomly generated gauntlets filled with various robotic enemies and other odd cyber-opponents. Luckily, very early on, a previous human who was trying to escape the program contacts you to help take the AI down and get out alive. Sadly, your ally is just the digital remains of a very dead person who has a skeleton hiding in your cyberjail’s basement. But while he’s dead, his mind is still in the program and helps you hack the system, slowly unlocking permanent bonuses and new weapons to help you get further during each action-filled run.</p> <p>If some of that sounds silly, it is! And that’s the point. <a href="https://kotaku.com/kotaku-games-to-play-pacman-silent-hill-hollow-void-2000619570"><em>VoidBreaker</em></a> leans into the absurd and strange situation you find yourself in, with plentiful jokes delivered by a dry robot announcer during runs. Messages include the program explaining how living forever in pain is better than dying, and how you aren’t alone because the AI is always watching you. It strikes that perfect balance between silly and dark that <em>Portal</em> nailed so many years ago.</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="VOID/BREAKER | Launch Trailer | PC Game Pass" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/44fxNXBOvIQ?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <h2>Another run, another run, another run….</h2> <p>The gameplay loop of <em>VoidBreaker</em> will feel pretty familiar if you’ve played <a href="https://kotaku.com/deadzone-rogue-roguelike-steam-pc-shooter-destiny-2000617173">any roguelike game</a> in the last few years. Each run feels different, as enemy encounters and other sections of the digital gauntlets are randomly generated. As you progress through these runs, you find mods of various rarity levels that give you new abilities, make you stronger or faster, or even change how your gun works. And of course, as in most roguelikes, there’s a currency you earn that can only be used at shops that randomly appear on your path during that run. There’s also a currency that lets you unlock permanent upgrades in the aforementioned secret dead guy basement.</p> <p>So yeah, nothing groundbreaking in <em>Voidbreaker</em>. Instead, the reason to play this new FPS is for the gameplay and combat. Movement in <em>VoidBreaker</em> is incredibly smooth, snappy, and satisfying. This is the kind of game where it’s just fun to run around and jump, even outside of a fight. And gunplay is equally fantastic, with the assault rifle you unlock fairly early into the game being a loud and hectic death machine that sprays enemies with bullets in a way that always makes me happy. Buildings and other structures you spot in the levels can also be <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-preview-destruction-classes-bf3-bf4-1851787384">destroyed à la <em>Battlefield</em> and crumble upon enemies</a>, stunning or even killing them. Oh, and you can pick up most items using a <em>Half-Life</em>-like Gravity Gun mechanic and fling them back at baddies, too.</p>

 <p>As you upgrade your character during runs, adding ice bullets, improving your Gravity-Gun-thingy, unlocking fire attacks, and collecting super-powerful grenade mods, the action in <em>VoidBreaker</em> can become extremely chaotic. At times, it became nearly too much for my eyes to keep track of as my rifle spat out electrically charged bullets covered in energy fields, buildings collapsed around me, and enemies filled the arena with various red projectiles that can do a lot of damage if you aren’t careful. It can be a lot, and I think for some it might be too much. But I enjoyed every moment of it, even if there were definitely times when I was just spamming my abilities and grenades toward a massive cloud of destruction and death and hoping for the best.</p> <p>But the chaos is part of the fun, and death isn’t that big of a deal in <em>VoidBreaker</em>. After all, it just gave me another excuse to load back up in my weird, sparse cyber apartment/prison and quickly say hi to the skeleton in the basement before hopping back out for one more run. I’m excited to see how the game expands in early access. Now, I need to go and play more <em>VoidBreaker</em>. Just one more run. I’ll go to bed eventually. It’s only 2 a.m….</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fans may have to pump the brakes on the EA Sports College Basketball game. Just days after EA Sports’ Vice President of Business Development Sean O’Brien said that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-sports-is-up-for-the-challenge-of-bringing-back-college-basketball" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA was “up for the challenge”</a> on building a game, a new report suggests that the game has hit a snag.</p>



<p>Sports Business Journal (SBJ) reports that schools are <strong>“weighing with rival video game developer 2K Sports for a separate product.”</strong> </p>



<p><a href="https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Articles/2025/08/28/sources-ea-sports-college-basketball-video-game-talks-hit-snag" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">According to the report</a>, one of the big issues involves EA Sports’ proposal, including an exclusivity license. EA’s College Basketball game was planned to be the only “action simulation” college basketball game, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-ceo-college-basketball-include-all-350-programs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">involved all Division 1</a> men’s and women’s programs.</p>



<p>Though talks remain <strong>“active and fluid”</strong>, there is the potential that EA Sports walks away from the game altogether if it can’t retain the exclusive license. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming had been working on a similar story ahead of SBJ’s report dropping, and <strong>can corroborate that 2K has continued</strong> to become a serious contender for the rights to college basketball. As <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/report-2k-sports-plans-college-basketball-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported in the past,</a> 2K Sports believes it can turn around a standalone game more quickly than EA, due to its already built-in engine used for the NBA 2K franchise.</p>



<p>Those who spoke under the condition of anonymity believe that, if 2K wanted to and a deal was reached with schools, a game could come by 2027, at the earliest. </p>



<p>Said one source on Thursday, <strong>“Once EA put out the announcement, it lit a fire to increase the push and try and get something done.”</strong></p>



<p>Originally, 2K’s proposal to the College Licensing Company called for a non-exclusive license that would see College Basketball be added to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/2k-sports-wants-to-add-college-basketball-to-nba-2k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NBA 2K in the form of DLC</a>. This DLC, as per the proposal, would initially start with limited teams before expanding each year, potentially culminating in a full college basketball game should it reach certain milestones.</p>



<p>This standalone game would likely not include every Division 1 program, and instead focus on larger schools, with “more than 100 men’s and women’s teams that would all receive ‘fair market value’ as well for their NIL”.</p>



<p>One program already aboard with 2K is UCLA, which <a href="https://www.licenseglobal.com/basketball/ucla-men-s-and-women-s-basketball-confirmed-for-2k-college-basketball-project" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced on Thursday</a> that it had signed a deal with the publisher. </p>



<p><strong>“We’re excited to confirm we’ve entered into non-exclusive long-term partnerships with multiple elite colleges, including UCLA with more to be announced soon, as we embark on a new college basketball project,”</strong> a representative from 2K told SBJ. <strong>“We’ve been building NBA 2K into more than a game for decades, representing all that is basketball on and off the court along with basketball culture at-large. It’s a platform driving the sport and culture forward, and we intend to do the same for the college experience too. We look forward to sharing more about our plans for our college basketball project in the future.”</strong></p>



<p>In a statement, the NCAA said that it was “negotiating a comprehensive licensing agreement” that would benefit both men’s and women’s student athletes. </p>



<p><strong>“[While] the NCAA remains open to working with a gaming partner to do that, it appears the market has chosen to go in a different direction for the time being,” </strong>the organization said.</p>



<p>2K’s interest in a college basketball game, along with EA’s, <a href="https://x.com/MikeStrawMedia/status/1869824116339159465" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">was first reported</a> in December 2024.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to EA and 2K for comment on the latest report surrounding the future of College Basketball games. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Plus, massive discounts on the PlayStation Store. </h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">We’re coming up on Labor Day weekend, which closes out the summer and tends to be a popular occasion to drop prices. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/labor-day-sales-2025">Labor Day sales</a> have already gone live at most major retailers, with deals worth checking out on everything from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/target-lego-deals-labor-day-sale-2025">LEGO sets</a> to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/walmart-gaming-pc-labor-day-sale-2025">gaming PCs</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, the first thing I’m looking for in any of these sales is discounts on physical games. Surprisingly enough, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-labor-day-sale-2025">Amazon's Labor Day sale</a> has listed first-time discounts on some of the latest and greatest PS5 games, while the PlayStation Store has launched its own sale on digital editions. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Amazon Drops Prices on the Latest PS5 Games</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The physical games I’ve listed above are all at or close to their lowest-ever prices. The discounts aren’t mind-blowing, I know, but they are the first price drops we’ve seen on recent releases like Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 and College Football 26, both of which just came out in July. The Tony Hawk remake has been especially popular here at IGN, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-review">Luke Reilly’s review</a> saying it "proves yet again the series’ over-the-top skateboarding formula is totally timeless." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another personal recommendation is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/split-fiction-review">Split Fiction</a>, the latest two-person adventure from It Takes Two developer Hazelight Studios. This discount is made all the better by the fact that the co-op game only requires one person to buy it, while the other can download the game through Friend’s Pass. You could go 50/50 with a friend and grab the GOTY contender for $20 each. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Split Fiction - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">SEGA is generally going hard on the discounts right now, with an ongoing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/SEGAPublisherSale2025" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">publisher sale on Steam</a> and price cuts on those games at pretty much every retailer. Last year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a> is the highlight I've included here, but you can also find discounts on the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-games-in-order">Persona games</a> as well as the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-games-in-order">Yakuza series</a>. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Playstation’s Ready, Set, Play! Sale: Up to 75% Off Digital Games</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While not branded as having anything to do with Labor Day, the Playstation Store has launched its Ready, Set, Play! sale at the same time as the holiday weekend. The promotion mainly applies to digital games and features separate discounts from what you’ll find on physical games at retailers like Amazon. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You won’t find as many discounts on new releases (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-september-2025">PlayStation Plus</a> is the way to go for those), but the deals you will find are pretty massive. I’d take it as a good opportunity to do some homework before the big sequels we have coming up. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A bundle of the two most recent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-games-in-order">Resident Evil games</a> (outside of remakes) has dropped to just $19.99, giving you a solid gateway to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, while The Witcher 3 drops below $8 as we get ready for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-iv">The Witcher 4</a>. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">What About PS5 Console Deals? </h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, I haven’t seen any discounts on PS5 consoles, which isn’t too surprising in light of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-playstation-5-price-rises-for-us">recent price hikes</a>. If you're desperate for the console, I highly recommend checking out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/certified-refurbished-ps5-deals-at-playstation">PlayStation's Certified Refurbished options</a>.

			<p>Dying Light: The Beast is due out in a little less than a month from the time of this writing, as it'll arrive on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on September 19, 2025. As part of the road to launch, developer Techland has debuted a new trailer, and more interestingly, shown off some behind-the-scenes concept art, and gone into detail about the team's design intentions with multiple elements of the game in a <a href="https://pilgrimoutpost.techlandgg.com/news/dev-blog-they-tried-to-break-him">new developer blog</a>.</p>



<p>Techland delves into Kyle Crane's return, and the artistic direction behind what he looks like now after a decade of imprisonment, and how to tell the story of his time in captivity without the player being able to constantly look at his face in what Techland refers to as an FPP game (first-person parkour). Kyle's arms, then, were given great focus.</p>

<p>"<em>In an FPP game, it’s difficult to convey the appearance of a character, since one of the few elements visible are the hero’s hands. That’s why we put a lot of effort into the details here. A special shoutout to Charidimos Bitsakakis, who, accompanied by other artists, spent countless hours perfecting them. We recreated Kyle’s hands from the first game, but added scars and other marks reflecting the torture he endured in the Baron’s lab. The experiments also gave rise to the Beast Mode, which we wanted to be visible in FPP as well - we looked for a visual language to represent his transformation and decided on black veins, dark and menacing, perfectly reflecting Kyle’s nature and what he sees when he becomes the Beast.</em>"</p>

<p>The blog also digs into the ways Techland looked to evolve gameplay in Dying Light: The Beast through tweaking and adjusting Kyle's animations, that they should both "<em>be inspired by DL1 Kyle - reflecting his muscle memory, personality, and fighting style</em>," and have "<em>a clear contrast between Kyle in the beast mode - brutal, uncontrolled, overconfident - and Kyle outside of it - pragmatic, precise, and confident</em>."</p>



<p>It's alltogether great dive into Kyle Crane and Dying Light: The Beast for fans who are eagerly anticipating the game's release next month.</p>



<p>When Wccftech checked out Dying Light: The Beast in <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-final-hands-on-pc-preview/">a preview earlier this year</a>, Kai Tatsumoto found that Crane had indeed been turned into a beast, saying it was the one "<em>certain</em>" thing about the game, even after only checking out an early portion.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new pair of third-party books is available for pre-order on D&amp;D Beyond. The <em>Grim Hollow: 2024 Bundle</em> brings a revised version of Ghostfire Games' dark fantasy world of Etharis to the platform. Notably, it is the first third-party book to use the new 2024 ruleset.</p>

<h2>The <em>Grim Hollow: 2024</em> Bundle Announcement</h2>

<p>According to the <a href="https://marketplace.dndbeyond.com/category/CBGCH9A2W" rel="nofollow">store page</a>, the <em>Grim Hollow: 2024 Bundle</em> will contain two books: the <em>Grim Hollow: Player's Guide</em> and the <em>Grim Hollow: Campaign Guide</em>.</p>

This is not to be confused with the <em>Grim Hollow: Player Pack</em> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/two-ghostfire-gaming-adventures-are-now-available-to-purchase-on-dd-beyond-continues" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Lairs of Etharis</em></a> material, which were designed with the 2014 rules in mind. If you already own this material, it is still compatible with this new edition.</p>

<p>The <em>Grim Hollow: 2024 Bundle</em> is packed with material for players who want to add darker themes and horror to their <em>D&amp;D</em> game. This includes 21 new player species, 40 new subclasses, 25 backgrounds, 41 feats, 102 new spells, 113 dark fantasy-themed magic items, and 82 advanced weapons. The <em>Player Guide</em> even includes a new character class: the Monster Hunter.:</p>

<p>For GMs, there is plenty to enjoy as well. There are 24 monsters, 10 detailed battlemaps, in-depth lore of the seven different regions of the land of Etharis, and grittier rules for resting, wounds, and corruption. Will your adventurers resist, or fall into murky moral greys?</p>

<p>The corruption isn't metaphorical either. The unique selling point of <em>Grim Hollow</em> are rules where players can slowly become monsters, including vampires, werewolves, demons, liches, avenging angels, and more.</p>

<p>The <em>Grim Hollow: 2024 Bundle</em> is available for pre-order now at an MSRP of $69.99. The <em>Grim Hollow: Player's Guide</em> is available now and can be bought separately for $39.99. The <em>Grim Hollow: Campaign Guide</em> will be available on the platform on September 30.&nbsp;</p>
