            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Today we got an in-depth look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a>, the upcoming Switch 2 exclusive which launches on 5th March 2026.</p>
<p>And the Extended Trailer didn't skimp on details; in Pokopia, you'll be teaming up with Professor Tangrowth to help restore an island that was once populated by people and Pokémon. That involves rebuilding structures, watering the grass, setting up fishing rods, laying rocks, grass, and flowers, and tons more.</p>
<p>You'll be able to play with the Pokémon you bring to your island, but you'll also need to help some 'mons adjust to life or get out of sticky situations. You'll need to fulfill requests for them, which in turn will help develop the island.</p>

<p>Your Ditto will also be able to transform into other Pokémon, and in this trailer, we saw the little blob (well, blob disguised as a human) become a Lapras and a Dragonite.</p>
<p>Lapras allows Ditto to travel to other islands via the ocean, while Dragonite lets Ditto travel even further, flying to the furthest corners of the world.</p>

<p>Your Ditto avatar also doesn't need to stay pink, either; you'll be able to customise your character as you see fit, with different outfits, hairstyles, and hair colours.</p>
<p>And multiplayer sounds fantastic, too — four friends can play together to help build structures or just show off their islands. And Pokémon Pokopia is GameShare ready, meaning you can play with a friend who has a Switch 1 <em>or</em> 2 and who doesn't own the game.</p>

<p>But the biggest reveal came at the end of the trailer — three brand new Pokémon forms for a few beloved 'mons. If you don't count Professor Tangrowth, that is.</p>
<p>Pikachu, Snorlax, and Smeargle are each getting a unique form in Pokopia names Peakychu, Mosslax, and Smearguru. What role they'll play in the game remains to be seen, but let us say that, right now, Mosslax is a <em>mood</em>.</p>

<p>Today's trailer was teased by The Pokémon Company <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/pokemon-pokopia-gets-march-2026-release-date-brand-new-trailer-coming-this-week">back on Tuesday</a>, when it also revealed the 5th March 2026 release date. We also know this will be the first game published by Nintendo in the West to be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/pokemon-pokopia-is-nintendos-first-game-key-card-release">a Game-Key Card release</a>.</p>

The console is Analogue’s reimagined and upgraded version of the Nintendo 64 with 4K output and full compatibility with original N64 cartridges from every region, including both PAL and NTSC versions.</p><p>Exactly a year after the original announcement, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24265587/analogue-3d-nintendo-64-price-preorder-date">Analogue shared more details about the Analogue 3D</a> including the console’s design, which looks similar to the N64’s. As with the company’s other <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22831589/analogue-pocket-review">consoles like the Pocket</a>, the Analogue 3D uses <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22323002/mister-fpga-project-retro-computer-console-early-pc">FPGA technology</a> to exactly replicate the functionality of Nintendo’s original hardware which has proven to be notoriously difficult to accurately emulate, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22746897/nintendo-switch-online-n64-emulation-quality-bad">even for Nintendo</a>. It also has four N64 controller ports plus Bluetooth for those wanting to play wirelessly, and includes optional display modes that mimic the appearance of games played on older CRT TVs.</p><p>Preorders for the $249.99 Analogue 3D opened on October 21st, 2024 with shipping expected sometime in Q1 2025, but that was followed by a string of delays that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/631816/analogue-3d-delay-nintendo-64-modretro-teaser">pushed the console’s release to July 2025</a>, and then <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/707586/analogue-3d-4k-n64-delay-august-2025">August 2025</a>, and then <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/762883/analogue-3d-delay-q4-2025">sometime in Q4 2025</a>. Last month Analogue confirmed the 3D was<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/801174/analogue-3d-4k-nintendo-n64-console-q4-2025-shipping"> still on target to ship in Q4 2025</a>, but yesterday the company finally locked down November 18th, 2025 as the console’s official ship date.</p><p>If you’ve been dragging your feet on preordering the Analogue 3D until you were confident it would ship, you’re unfortunately now out of luck as both the white and black versions are listed as sold out on the company’s online store. However, Analogue has expanded production runs of its previous consoles, and has released several versions of the Analogue Pocket in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24236829/analogue-pocket-handheld-gaming-game-boy-color">different colors</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/12/24197135/analogue-pocket-aluminum">finishes</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/819903/analogue-3d-nintendo-64-console-ship-date-november-18]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Oh shit, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty Black Ops 7</a> comes out tomorrow, November 14th. As you'd expect, Activision have been busy yelling about it amid the deafening din of about 10,000 other games whizzing past per minute. There are some launch day patch notes and a rundown of what the mode you unlock if you beat the single-player bit involves. Let's take a gander.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First of all, the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-preseason-patch-notes">day one patch notes</a> can be found here, running through the myriad of adjustments which have been made since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/97-of-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-betas-early-cheaters-were-caught-within-30-minutes-of-sign-in-activision-say">the beta</a>. There's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFtHucpVlJM">video</a> too. Things like the strength of rotational aim assist, increases to the rate at which weapon XP's earned, and a general slowing dow of player slideage are talked about. "Adjusted mantling for smoother, faster, and more consistent mantles" is fun to read, especially if you assume it means mantling in <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Mantling">the Elder Scrolls sense</a>. There are also specific sections for multiplayer and zombies, if only one of those is your bag.</p>
<p>I'm not here for any of that, though. You see, a lot of the notes focus on outlining adjustments to certain weapons, and the formatting's very much the text on a screen equivalent of a candlelit diner. "My name's M15 MOD 0," an assault rifle says coyly. "I've gotten a new mid damage range. This will make it more difficult to achieve a 4-shot kill with headshots beyond close range." Ooh, saucy. May I pour a bit more wine for you to slurp up via one of your many attachments, which have also been tweaked?</p>
<p>They keep coming (ooh, Matron!). The MXR-17, the Peacekeeper Mark 1, the Ryden 45K, the Dravec 45, the M10 Breacher. Each showing off their fancy damage numbers and range stats, both old and new. They've changed, you see. "Do you love me now?" each asks. I dunno. You're just guns in a video game. That's a lot of commitment.</p>
<p>They're just too much, man. I've had to pull myself away and look at another Black Ops 7 thing Activision have been talking about this week.</p>

<p>As outlined in the dev chat above, it's called endgame. Basically, once you've finished Blops 7's campaign, you unlock a multiplayer mode revolving around a big fight with up to 32 players slugging it out across a huge map. Said map's a weird Frankenstein's monster of locations around fictional Call of Duty city-state <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avalon">Avalon</a>, with maps from previous Blopses grafted onto it various places, for maximum nostalgia. "We wanted to continue the campaign in a replayable way," design director Kevin Drew.</p><p>There are "four escalating zones of difficulty" top work through, each of which has "more toxin, more enemies, harder challenges, and better rewards". You can also hop in with friends who haven't completed the campaign, so long as you have and are the host in order to invite them.</p>
<p>Oh no. Now all of those guns from before are asking me if I love them enough to invite them into endgame. Ah, uh, sorry, I'm gonna be washing my hair when Blops 7 launches at 5AM GMT / 12AM ET / 9PM PT on November 14th.</p>

              <p>The first <i>Red Dead</i> <i>Redemption</i> seems to be anything but dead based on a recent rating by the folks over at the ESRB. As one of those iconic open-world games of the Xbox 360 era, that’s good news for those who remember it fondly and those of us who stubbornly still haven’t gotten around to playing it.</p> <p>With <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40987/red-dead-redemption/">an M-rating</a> indicating all the messy blood and gore a Rockstar game typically comes with (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-red-dead-redemption-rating-suggests-remaster-on-the-way-to-ps5-xbox-series-xs-and-switch-2">h/t <i>Eurogamer</i></a>), the filing indicates the presence of zombified action as well, so it seems natural to expect <i>Red Dead</i>’s popular <i>Undead Nightmare</i> expansion to be included:</p>

 <p>This is an open-world action-adventure game in which players assume the role of a reformed criminal capturing the remnants of an outlaw gang and combatting a zombie plague.</p> <p>The first <i>Red Dead Redemption</i> received Switch and PS4 versions in 2023, and a PC release a year later, though it did not come to Xbox Series consoles.</p> <p>The game’s highly praised sequel, arguably more available due to its backwards compatibility of modern consoles and the 2019 PC release, has also been slow to receive any kind of major graphical update in the way <i>Grand Theft Auto V</i> did only two years following its premiere on PS3 and Xbox 360. Then again, <i>RDR2</i> is still a visual treat several years after its release, while its predecessor is certainly long in the tooth by now.</p>

              <p>Long gaming sessions or workdays at your desk lead to back pain, neck strain and overall discomfort that ruins your focus and enjoyment. Right now, the <em>N-Gen</em> gaming chair costs less than most standard office chairs you’d find at furniture stores which makes zero sense when you compare the features.</p>
<p>Amazon dropped <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5562/">this early Black Friday deal to $99, down from $139, which marks a record low for a chair with a 4.5 star rating</a> from over 1,600 buyers. This pricing puts ergonomic support, adjustable comfort and durable construction within reach of anyone who spends serious time at a desk.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5562/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Ergonomic Features That Prevent Pain</h2>
<p>The high-back racing design <strong>supports you from your tailbone right up to your shoulders</strong>&nbsp;and caters to the full length of your spine, rather than just one section. That comprehensive coverage is important because when you slouch in those unsupported chairs, it creates a domino effect, or ripple, of posture problems originating in your lower back and radiating upward. When seated for prolonged periods, the removable headrest cushions your neck to avoid the forward head posture that causes tension headaches and shoulder pain. A <strong>lower back pillow targets the lumbar region</strong>&nbsp;where most people have chronic discomfort from sitting, with the curve support that keeps your spine naturally aligned.</p>



<p>The <strong>pull-out footrest turns the chair into a reclining station</strong> where you can take breaks without leaving your setup. You can lean back during loading screens, between work calls or when you just need to let your eyes rest and stretch. This integrated footrest eliminates the need for an additional ottoman or footstool, freeing up space while giving you the option of bringing your legs up and improving circulation.</p>



<p>High-density foam cushions keep their shape and support over months and years of daily use. Cheap chairs flatten out in no time and you end up sitting on a barely padded surface that feels just about like a wooden bench. The breathable PU leather covering remains comfortable against your skin without the sticky feeling that develops with lower-quality materials on hot days or during long sessions of gaming.</p>
<p>Adjustable comfort comes through multiple mechanisms that let you customize the chair to your body: The recline function with linkage armrests means the armrests move with you when you lean back, maintaining proper arm support in any position. Height adjustment uses an <strong>SGS-certified gas lift rated to support up to 300 pounds safely</strong>, and gives you confidence that the mechanism won’t fail suddenly and drop you to the floor. The <strong>360-degree swivel and smooth-rolling wheels</strong> let you pivot between monitors, reach for items or move around your space.</p>
<p>Assembly usually takes about 20 to 30 minutes with basic tools and is simple enough which means you won’t require any pro help. The chair comes complete with all the hardware you’ll need, along with clear instructions on attaching the base, mounting the seat, installing the backrest, and connecting the armrests. Once assembled, the chair feels solid and substantial rather than rickety or questionable like self-assembly furniture sometimes does.</p>
<p>At $99, you’re paying less than basic office chairs from big box stores while getting adjustable features, ergonomic support, and build quality that typically costs $200 or more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The PS5’s best-selling catalog is a who’s who of AAA royalty. But PlayStation Senior Vice President Eric Lempel has effectively put the PS5 community on standby by declaring the best-selling game is still to come.</p>



<p>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart, Ghost of Yotei, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shuhei-yoshida-absolutely-wanted-stellar-blade-on-playstation-after-playing-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stellar Blade</a> barely scratch the surface of games that shipped several million copies on PS5. Sony’s newest hardware has proven to be another hall-of-fame-worthy hardware hero. With more big games still to come, Eric Lempel thinks the PS5 console’s future is bright and sunny, and hasn’t even begun to peak.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-ps5-s-biggest-release-hasn-t-happened-yet-says-playstation-svp">The PS5’s Biggest Release Hasn’t Happened Yet, Says PlayStation SVP</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Astro Bot is one of many success stories. Credit to PlayStation</figcaption></figure>



<p>You’ve likely heard the name Eric Lempel at some point, as the current Senior Vice President at PlayStation has been with the company for over 25 years.</p>



<p>They sat down to speak to the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy7e352emrro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BBC</a> in celebration of the PS5’s fifth anniversary. The console—and Pro models—have now surpassed ‘More than 84 million units worldwide,’ meaning this generation is slowly closing in on the PlayStation 4, slowly but surely.</p>







<p>Lempel said that Sony and PlayStation are “Really hitting our stride now” and that “A lot of great content” is still to come. The most eye-catching part of the interview is when Lempel revealed that the PS5’s best-selling game hasn’t even been revealed yet.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>“I’m not going to tell you which one, but I think it’s still to come,” </strong>he said.<strong>“</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Now, this could literally be anything, in reality. We know <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvels-wolverine-gta6-fall-2026-insomniac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wolverine</a> is moving along nicely in its development and could be a huge first-party winner. More big-time exclusives could be in the pipeline, or it could be a careful—but realistic way—of saying <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-delay-could-impact-halo-remake-gears-e-day-next-call-of-duty/">GTA 6</a> will be the mystery title. Again, it’s unclear if he means first-party or third-party games.</p>



<p>If it’s intended as first-party, then this will likely get people talking about what other surprises PlayStation has up its sleeves. Uncharted? The Last of Us? Killzone? God of War? Your guess is as good as ours. If you have any thoughts or picks, head on over to the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a> and let us know!</p>

Even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/space-marine-2-made-millions-for-games-workshop-now-its-on-the-hunt-for-the-next-big-warhammer-video-game"><u>Games Workshop itself has talked about the money it’s made from Space Marine 2</u></a>, and protagonist <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-workshop-just-promoted-titus-from-space-marine-2-with-a-fancy-new-trailer-that-sets-up-the-next-narrative-expansion-for-warhammer-40000">Titus is now leading the charge on the next narrative expansion of the Warhammer 40,000 setting</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Space Marine 3 was announced in March, six months after Space Marine 2 came out. Some Space Marine 2 fans were left concerned about the timing of the announcement, but <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/glahjvsr/space-marine-3-is-officially-in-development/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Games Workshop has said</u></a> Space Marine 3 "is likely years away from release,” and Saber has promised to continue to support Space Marine 2 for some time to come.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking on the latest episode of Games Workshop’s <a href="https://warhammertv.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Warhammer TV</a> show, Deep Strike, Saber Interactive creative director Oliver Hollis-Leick was asked why Space Marine 3 was announced so early instead of going down the DLC route (story DLC expansions, for example) for Space Marine 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Announcing a third game doesn’t in any way mean that we’re not going to continue creating content for the existing game,” Hollis-Leick responded.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The thing is the development cycles for these projects are long. For Space Marine 2 it was something like four years. And so, for Space Marine 3 it’s going to be the same.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We announced it to in one way keep people aware of the fact we’re going to continue this, that there’s going to be more coming. But we’re also doing the same thing with DLC. There’s lots already been created and there’s lots more to come. They’re definitely not competing for resources.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s a crowdpleasing comment, but what is the actual situation when it comes to Space Marine 2 support? In August, publisher Focus Entertainment revealed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-year-2-roadmap-reveals-content-plan-for-patch-10-right-up-to-2026s-patch-15-including-new-weapons-a-new-class-and-much-more">Space Marine 2’s second year of DLC</a>, confirming patches 10 all the way up to 15.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Patch 15 takes players up to the end of the second quarter of next year (June 2026). Highlights include the new Techmarine class, now set for release during the first quarter of 2026, a new Battle Barge expansion during the same period, and a new Siege map coming Q2 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Space Marine 3, however, looms large over the horizon. Based on Oliver Hollis-Leick’s comments, we’re looking at a four-year development cycle, which means we may not see the game until 2029. That’s a big gap!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what can we expect from Space Marine 3? Will we see new factions? Will Saber expand co-op beyond the three-player limit? Will there be actual meaningful PvP?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-fans-have-a-good-idea-which-enemy-faction-theyll-fight-in-space-marine-3">Most fans believe the Necrons will make an appearance in Space Marine 3</a>. That’s because one mission in Space Marine 2 sees Titus and co delve deep within the bowels of an alien planet, which contains ancient and mysterious wall markings that are a clear nod to the Necrons. Some players even suspected the xenos would make a surprise appearance as a third enemy faction in the Space Marine 2 campaign, given the nature of the mission.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, it turns out that the Space Marine 2 story sort of revolves around the Necrons. The Techpriest who goes off the rails in the story is trying to use an ancient Necron artifact to nullify the influence of Chaos by closing off the warp, the hell dimension from which Chaos spews forth. At least that’s what the Techpriest thinks the artifact does (it doesn't, then it does).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the episode of Deep Strike, Oliver Hollis-Leick was asked straight up if this nod to the Necrons means they’ll turn up at some point. He was coy in his answer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“One of the things about this universe is it’s vast,” he said. “It’s almost timeless. And so if you go digging deep down below the surface of a planet, you could find all kinds of things. And so finding what appears to be a Necron tomb, or at least Necron technology below the surface of a world, is not an outrageous thing to happen. But also in the narrative they’re dealing with what seems to be Blackstone-like technology, although it’s never expressly stated. And so that directly links to the Necrons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As to whether we’ll see any more of them, that I cannot say. But it certainly was a nice thing to see at the end of the game there.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oliver Hollis-Leick then went on to explain why Saber included all those cool Necron bits and bobs in Space Marine 2 for players to discover.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s really important to show that the Imperium don’t know everything,” he said. “They seem incredibly advanced, incredibly well equipped, but there is an enormous amount about this galaxy and the history of the galaxy they simply don’t know, and never will know. Even the audience who read these books, even they don’t know. It’s not stated. That’s one of the things I love so much about this universe, is that there’s so much ambiguity. And so I liked including something like that in the game, so we get a sense of the mystery still out there.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Two characters from Space Marine 2 we won't see in Space Marine 3 alive and kicking are Sevastus Acheran and Lieutenant Chairon, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-there-anything-more-grimdark-than-to-die-offscreen-games-workshop-just-killed-two-space-marine-2-characters-via-a-brief-lore-update-post-and-warhammer-40000-fans-are-in-tatters">who were killed off-camera via a lore post on the Warhammer Community website</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

<p>Valve has been making headlines this week with its latest lineup of hardware, and rumours suggest that the company isn't done with the announcements just yet...</p>
<p>Assuming for a moment that we're probably not going to get <strong>Half-Life 3</strong> or <strong>Portal 3</strong> anytime soon, however, we're quite happy with the news that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/chromagun-2-dye-hard">Chromagun 2: Dye Hard</a> will be making its way to the Switch 2 on <strong>12th February, 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>If you've played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/chromagun">the first entry</a>, then you'll probably know the gist already. Chromagun 2 is a homage of sorts to Valve's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/portal_companion_collection">Portal</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/portal_companion_collection">Portal 2</a>, but instead of portals, you'll be messing around with colours. Essentially, by matching coloured items found within the levels, they'll attract via magnetism and allow to you solve intricate puzzles.</p>
<p>The first game was pretty neat and we awarded it a solid score of 8/10. So we're expecting some good things with the upcoming sequel! Now let's check out the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- A one-of-a-kind tool - The ChromaGun: Wield the titular "ChromaGun," a versatile paint-gun used to shoot primary colors onto surfaces and objects, mixing them to manipulate the environment</p>
<p>- Magnetoid Chromatism: Master the key mechanic of "Magnetoid Chromatism" - a proprietary concept where Droids and other objects are magnetically attracted to walls of the same color.</p>
<p>- Multiverse Puzzles: Travel through time and space across different dimensions and parallel universes, each introducing new physics and increasingly complex mechanics.</p>
<p>- State of the art accessibility: Pixel Maniacs developed a unique accessibility game mode overlaying symbols on colored objects to help color blind players to enjoy the game too! With this well thought feature, ChromaGun 2 Dye Hard won the Horizon Award for Technical Innovation at GG Bavaria 2025!</p>
</blockquote>

			<p>Another week, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-call-of-duty-black-ops-7/">another batch of games added to NVIDIA's GeForce NOW streaming service</a>, though this week is arguably a bigger one than most. Not only are there 12 games in total joining the service this week alone, but one of the biggest releases of the year headlines this week's additions: Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 is, of course, the biggest addition to GeForce NOW this week, though there is something to be said about playing a competitive shooter over cloud streaming, which is just that your mileage may vary. What's perhaps a better choice of game to play over NVIDIA's cloud streaming, and a game that's also joining the list of GeForce NOW titles that are RTX 5080-ready, is Anno 117: Pax Romana.</p>



<p>And as of this week, GeForce NOW users in Phoenix will be able to take advantage of those RTX 5080 cards, as Phoenix, Arizona, is the latest region to join the ever-growing list of places RTX 5080 servers are available. On deck is Stockholm, and if you're curious about when your region can be added, you can <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/server-upgrade/">check out the server rollout page on NVIDIA's website</a> to see where RTX 5080 servers will be available next.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Image credit: NVIDIA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Here's the full list of titles joining GeForce NOW this week:</p>



<ul>
<li>Surviving Mars: Relaunched - Nov. 10</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Over the last five years, <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> games have gotten a bit strange. Cards featuring characters from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/690509/how-to-play-final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-set"><em>Final Fantasy</em></a>, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/tabletop-gaming/magic-the-gatherings-spider-man-set-is-only-just-fine-which-isnt-good-enough/">Spider-Man</a>, and, in a few weeks, <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> are starting to show up with increasing frequency, making a typical Friday Night <em>Magic</em> game look more like a match in <em>Fortnite</em>. For some, this is a welcome change, allowing <em>Magic </em>to entice newcomers and invigorate existing players with properties they know and love. But others feel this focus on licensed sets comes at the expense of <em>Magic</em>’s identity, quality, and longevity.</p><p>Depending on who you talk to, <em>Magic</em> crossover sets have been around since the early days of the game with the Arabian Nights set released in 1994. But the modern idea started in 2020 with <em>Magic</em>’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/11/25/magic-the-gathering-reveals-new-secret-lair-drop-series-with-wild-art">Secret Lair</a> product. Originally, Secret Lair products weren’t full sets, or even original cards. Existing <em>Magic</em> cards were revamped with new art from popular artists or IPs and sold at a premium as collector’s items. However, with <em>The Walking Dead</em> Secret Lair, <em>Magic</em> publisher Wizards of the Coast decided to create totally new cards set within Robert Kirkman’s zombie universe — and it blew up.</p><p>“From Wizards’ side, it was a slam dunk,” said <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/shivambhatt.bsky.social">Shivam Bhatt</a>, an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@casualmagicwithshivambhatt"><em>MTG</em> content creator</a> and former <em>MTG</em> consultant who’s been a player for most of the game’s 30-year history. “Make six cards, sell a gillion of them, and you get a chance of getting people to come into the game.”</p><p>From there, <em>Magic </em>expanded on that formula, going from six-card Secret Lair drops to developing whole decks for the game’s Commander format. To set this new family of cards apart from cards set within <em>Magic</em>’s own storytelling universe, Wizards of the Coast called these crossovers <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/magics-voyages-universes-beyond-2021-02-25">Universes Beyond</a>, or UB. These experiments sold so well that <em>Magic</em> decided to expand again into full sets, starting with <em>Lord of the Rings</em>, which, at the time, became <em>Magic</em>’s best-selling set ever. It was official: UB was a hit, which was a good thing for Wizards’ parent company, Hasbro.</p><p>“Ultimately, the reason Universes Beyond exists is because Hasbro is a dying company,” said <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/content/author/Emma-Partlow?srsltid=AfmBOorhzPSruQd-Yq23nG7zXmKUkofHXwwTJwJ54XwkR_jDRhqjkXLv">Emma Partlow,</a> <em>MTG</em> content editor at TCGPlayer, one of the biggest resources and retailers for collectible card games. “But if you put Wizards of the Coast in that they’re just breaking records every quarter, they’re one of the only things keeping Hasbro afloat.” (Hasbro’s <em>Monopoly GO!</em>, frequently at the top of most-downloaded mobile games lists, <a href="https://investor.hasbro.com/news-releases/news-release-details/hasbro-reports-second-quarter-2025-financial-results">is the other</a>.)</p><p>These successes led to WotC going all in on Universes Beyond, so much that it’s starting to cause concern among <em>Magic</em>’s core player base. <em>Magic</em> is a heavily stratified game with different formats in which different sets of cards are legal to use. These different sets were arranged on two different release tracks: standard and supplemental. On the standard track are all the sets that are legal in the Standard format — the main competitive format of <em>Magic</em> — and form the core of <em>MTG</em>’s yearly release schedule. The supplemental tracks are the sets that are for different formats, like Commander and Modern.</p><p>Up until this point, Universes Beyond has largely been kept on the supplemental track, and in 2021, Wizards of the Coast said that’s where it’ll stay. “Universes Beyond cards will not be Standard legal,” <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/magics-voyages-universes-beyond-2021-02-25">read a blog explaining Universes Beyond</a>. “This is purely a cool thing we’re doing in addition to all the other cool things we’re already doing.”</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The </em>Final Fantasy MTG<em> set was the best-selling set in the game’s 30-year history.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>But that calculus changed in 2025 when the first Universes Beyond sets were permanently brought onto the standard track. <em>MTG</em>’s vice president of design, Aaron Forsythe, <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/aligning-the-universes-making-all-our-sets-legal-in-all-our-formats">explained</a> that the change was essentially to give the players outside the Standard format a new place to play their cards, but it seems to be coming at the expense of existing Standard players.</p><p>“The number one problem with Universes Beyond is that [Wizards] decided to put them in the core competitive formats so they’re no longer an opt-in product,” said writer, games journalist, and <em>Magic </em>enthusiast <a href="https://aidanmoher.com/">Aidan Moher</a>. “You can no longer ignore it.”</p><p>In 2025, the split between in-universe sets and UB sets was even at three apiece. Next year will feature a Ninja Turtles set, a Marvel superheroes set, <em>The Hobbit</em>, and <em>Star Trek</em>. For the first time, UB sets will outnumber the in-universe ones, which could be alienating to players who enjoy <em>Magic</em> for its own distinct storytelling universe. “I think a lot of people are feeling threatened in their space just because here’s all this advertisement seeping into <em>Magic</em>,” Partlow said.</p><div><p>“I think a lot of people are feeling threatened in their space”</p></div><p>There’s also a concern with these sets’ quality and price. While <em>Final Fantasy</em> was <a href="https://articles.starcitygames.com/magic-the-gathering/mtg-final-fantasy-already-the-best-selling-set-of-all-time/">a runaway success</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/mtg-magic-the-gathering-spider-man-survey-wizards/">the next UB set, Spider-Man, was not</a>. Like many games, <em>Magic</em> sets take years to design and develop. Spider-Man, being a UB set, was originally conceived as a supplemental set, which typically has fewer cards than a standard one. However, the decision to switch from supplemental to standard required that designers add more cards to fill out the set.</p><p>“It felt like it was just thrown together,” Bhatt said. “It felt cheap and rushed and unpleasant.” There’s also the setting of Spider-Man itself, which, according to Moher, didn’t quite match <em>Magic</em>’s high-fantasy identity. “All of a sudden you have a card that’s <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/651951/magic-marvels-spider-man-bagel-and-schmear?srsltid=AfmBOopwKGpX4Y1fJbWGrJj3am_8mwYZnUpmEaqHWgDhG4hxwHH5GwlJ&amp;Language=English">bagel and schmear</a> or like the guy on the computer,” he said. “It’s just strange and anachronistic.”</p><p>That antipathy is impacting the game’s secondhand market. Packs of Universes Beyond cards typically cost a few dollars more than in-universe packs. That cost increases for higher-end products like collector’s boxes and on the secondhand market. Like <em>Pokémon</em> cards, <em>Magic</em> has its own speculative market with people buying up product in hopes of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/2/23817243/one-ring-magic-the-gathering-post-malone">selling at higher prices later</a>. But with the current cadence of UB sets combined with the poor reception of Spider-Man, even the collectors are tuning out.</p><p>“The audience is like, ‘I’m not going to buy it,’” Bhatt said. “‘I’m just not going to pay you $40 or $60 for a Spider-Man collector booster pack, because I don’t care.’”</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->5</strong><span><figcaption><em>An example of how some of the cards in the Spider-Man set create a dissonance with </em>Magic<em>’s traditional magical fantasy setting.</em></figcaption> <cite>Image: Wizards of the Coast</cite></span></p></section><p>Even though Spider-Man didn’t hit the mark the same way <em>Final Fantasy </em>or <em>Lord of the Rings</em> did, many fans are still enjoying these crossovers. On his personal blog, <a href="https://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/766239595791810560/hey-mark-i-have-played-against-a-few-ub-decks-and"><em>MTG</em> head designer Mark Rosewater wrote</a>, “The reason Universes Beyond is so successful is because many longtime, invested, enfranchised <em>Magic</em> players enjoy it.”</p><p>The next UB set, <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>, launches on November 21st. Based on pre-launch sentiment in the <em>MTG</em> community, it feels like a set that won’t suffer the same reception or quality issues that Spider-Man had. Universes Beyond is here to stay. When<em> Fortnite</em> first started incorporating characters like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/11/23301844/goku-dragon-ball-z-fortnite-new-crossover-teaser">Goku</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/28/22954749/naomi-osaka-fortnite">Naomi Osaka</a>, it was mocked for being an unserious cash grab. Now, it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/streaming/789954/kpop-demon-hunters-fortnite-event">a celebrated feature</a> of a game that continues to dominate the most-played charts. <em>Magic </em>can have that too.</p><p>“In an ideal world, there would be more <em>Magic</em> sets than UB sets,” Partlow said. “I think that is the balance [Wizards] needs to strike. And if it wants to keep its core audience, that’s what it needs to do.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/report/819098/magic-the-gathering-universes-beyond-avatar-final-fantasy-spider-man]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/jbl-charge-6-bluetooth-speaker-is-practically-free-an-all-time-low-you%E2%80%99ll-only-see-for-early-black-friday.1352503/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good music can bring life to any party, but not all speakers are made equal. If you’re after something that’s portable enough to travel with and powerful enough to fill any room with rich sound, JBL’s Charge 6 Bluetooth speaker is a great option to consider.</p>
<p>On a regular day, it would run you around $200, which we won’t exactly label a budget buy. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5551/">But right now, Amazon has it marked down to just $130, thanks to a nice 35% early Black Friday discount.</a> The deal is available on all color options. Prefer your audio gear with a classic look? Consider the classic Black option. Want your speaker to have a bit more personality? The cool Squad version is up for grabs, too. Of course, like all massive discounts, we’re not expecting this one to stick around for long. We’re also not sure if it will be back for Black Friday, so it’s best to take advantage of it while you can!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5551/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Sound That Fills Any Room</h2>
<p>The size is compact, and it comes with a removable strap, which makes it quite convenient to carry it with you on the go. Redesigned hardware and JBL AI Sound Boost come together to deliver deeper bass, better highs, and clear lows without any distortion. It’s enough to fill any room with your favorite tracks, whether you’re listening to something energy-filled or winding down with some relaxing music after a long day.</p>
<p>The Charge 6 is more than enough to get the vibe going on its own, but if you’re after bigger sound, Auracast lets you link up other JBL speakers for bigger, wider coverage. Just ask your friends to bring theirs, and keep the party going all night long.</p>



<p>Battery is just as impressive. You’re looking at around 24 hours of playtime on a single charge, which easily translates into around two days of fun. If you need some extra juice and cannot plug it in, JBL Playtime Boost gives you an extra four hours of jamming. Charge 6 is also rated IP68 waterproof and dustproof, plus can survive 1-meter drops onto concrete. Take it to your off-road adventures, on the beach, by the pool, and even in the shower for a private concert without a worry.</p>
<p>All in all, this speaker not only offers great sound, but also easy portability, durability, and a long battery life that keeps the fun going.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In a growing field of copycat Soulslikes, <a href="https://kotaku.com/lies-of-p-review-pinocchio-soulslike-bloodborne-sekiro-1850857903"><em>Lies of P</em> stands apart</a> as one of the best. This year’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/lies-of-p-dlc-weapons-bosses-hltb-prequel-expansion-2000618041"><em>Overture</em> DLC</a> proved the game wasn’t a fluke. Now, the publisher behind the Pinocchio-punk action-RPG has confirmed it has a whopping five games currently in various stages of development, and only one of them is <em>Lies of P 2</em>.</p> <p>The South Korean mobile gaming giant Neowiz’s upcoming slate was outlined in <a href="https://cdn.neowiz.com/neowiz-site/assets/ir-library/3Q25_NWZ-IR-PPT_EN-itjp3znq.pdf">its latest earnings report</a> as part of a multi-phase plan. The first phase revolves around a handful of new mobile games and published projects coming next year. The second phase is much more ambitious and outlines several PC and console projects from different genres aimed at driving “global expansion.” Here’s how they’re listed:</p>

 <ul> <li>Life Simulation New Project – Life Simulation – PC/Console</li> <li>Survival Action Adventure New Project – Survival Action Adventure – PC/Console</li> <li><em>Lies of P</em> Sequel – Souls-like RPG – PC/Console</li> <li>New Project by Seungho Jin – Narrative-based RPG – PC/Console</li> <li>New Project by Kay Lee – Souls-like RPG – PC/Console</li> </ul> <p>The life sim and survival action games seem pretty self-explanatory. Seungho Jin directed the anime-style visual novel <em>Buried Stars</em>, though it sounds like his new game will push more into RPG territory. Maybe something in the vein of a turn-based Atlus game?<em> Lies of P</em> was made by in-house subsidiary Game8. It’s unclear if they’ll be involved in this second Soulslike RPG or if Kay Lee will be leading a completely separate team.</p> <p>Hopefully, most of these projects comes out and at least some of them are good. It’s interesting to see more South Korea-based publishers and developers move into bigger, single-player PC and console releases. It suggests the success of games like <em>Lies of P</em> and <em>Stellar Blade</em> has proven there are lucrative opportunities outside of free-to-play grinds and gacha casinos. Though it’ll probably be several years yet before we see the next wave.</p>

                <p>Former PlayStation executive Shuhei Yoshida has discussed cancelling games during his tenure at the company, including a new IP from God of War developer Santa Monica Studio. Sony had invested $25 million into the game, saw potential in it, but ultimately decided to shut it down and eat the cost.</p><p>Yoshida said on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Plu6ciaLMfso6xWbRqQuz?go=1&amp;sp_cid=5b691c77600e893959bfe6b75f0ea351&amp;utm_source=embed_player_p&amp;utm_medium=desktop&amp;nd=1&amp;dlsi=5fccf9ee027b4228" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">My Perfect Console podcast</a> that this new game was not a God of War title, but it had a "really amazing concept and very interesting gameplay ideas." Sony worked on this game for "many years" but after spending $25 million on it, the studio itself approached Yoshida to say things were not working out.</p><p>"They came to me and said, 'We have to stop.' I do not exactly remember the reason--probably the team was not able to find the game. It was a great concept, great idea, but you know, the gameplay didn't really come to be," he said, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/shuhei-yoshida-recalls-when-he-cancelled-two-25-million-game-projects-including-one-by-god-of-wars-santa-monica-studio/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as reported by VGC.</a></p><p>Yoshida did not provide a timeline for when this occurred, however. Earlier this year, it was reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-games-including-a-live-service-god-of-war-report/1100-6528869/" data-ref-id="1100-6528869">Sony canceled a live-service God of War game</a>, but the one Yoshida is speaking about was a new IP.</p><p>Also in the interview, Yoshida said cancelling games is a normal part of the business because the creative process involves lots of iteration. Cancelling games early in their development "doesn't cost us much," Yoshida said, but it was a "really hard decision" to cancel the new IP at Santa Monica Studio because of the time and money involved.</p><p>"But I think in this case, the team at Santa Monica Studio by themselves was like, 'You know, we probably have to stop,'" Yoshida said.</p><p>Yoshida also discussed another game he oversaw the cancellation of, and this was a title from an unspecified European studio. Yoshida did not share much in the way of specifics, but said this was a "big-budget project" that lacked a "core game" and did not go ahead.</p><p>"These days, $25 million cancellation is nothing special. [There are] much bigger cancellations," he said.</p><p>Yoshida went on to say cancelling these projects was ultimately in the best interest of the developers and the business overall. "If we continued, it just got bigger and bigger in terms of [financial] loss, and the developers eventually get tired of working on these. And it's not healthy to work on something that's struggling for the longest time," he said.</p><p>Yoshida added that, when the decision to cancel a game came down during his time at Sony, he tried to communicate with the developers about how it might be rough to abandon a project, but sometimes it's necessary. "Not doing this means we can do something different, something new, like brand new. So let's do the fresh restart," he said he told developers.</p><p>Yoshida also made headlines recently for saying he would have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ex-playstation-exec-says-he-would-have-resisted-sonys-live-service-push/1100-6528881/" data-ref-id="1100-6528881">"resisted" Sony's push into live-service games</a> and that he was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-sony-exec-on-the-one-playstation-game-he-was-surprised-didnt-sell-like-he-thought-it-would/1100-6528860/" data-ref-id="1100-6528860">surprised Horizon Forbidden West didn't sell as well as expected.</a> Yoshida also talked about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-exec-theorizes-bloodborne-director-is-too-busy-for-remaster/1100-6528852/" data-ref-id="1100-6528852">why there hasn't been a Bloodborne remaster yet.</a> He left Sony earlier this year <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-veteran-shuhei-yoshida-announces-retirement-from-sony/1100-6528084/" data-ref-id="1100-6528084">after 30+ years. </a></p>

            <p>Over 200 employees from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-north">Rockstar North</a> have signed a letter to management, in which they have condemned the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-developer-rockstar-accused-of-union-busting-after-it-fires-dozens-of-developers">firing of their fellow staff members in a move seen by many as 'union busting'</a>.</p>
<p>In this letter, Rockstar North's employees demand their colleagues - all of whom were Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) Union members - be reinstated. This letter follows protests in London and Edinburgh earlier this month, which were held in solidarity with the fired employees. Further protests are planned to take place in London, Edinburgh and Paris later this month.</p>
<p>The employees had been in the process of forming a union within the company. This union was known as The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> Workers Union, and aimed to push for better working conditions ahead of the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>.</p>

<p>"It's heartwarming to see so many of our colleagues supporting us and holding management to account - during a period where Rockstar want us to feel scared, my brave former colleagues are marching straight up to our boss's door and demanding our voices are heard and not backing down," said one fired employee, who withheld their name to protect anonymity.</p>
<p>"It's clear to everyone close to this situation that this is a blatant, unapologetic act of vicious union busting. Rockstar employs so many talented game developers, all of whom are crucial to making the games we put out."</p>
<p>Rockstar itself has claimed the recent firings were due to misconduct, including leaking information in public channels. However, the IWGB has refuted this, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unacceptable-and-unlawful-gta-6-developer-rockstar-hit-with-legal-claim-from-uk-trade-union-following-alleged-unfair-dismissal-of-staff">yesterday announced it had issued a legal claim against the Grand Theft Auto developer</a>.</p>
<p>In a further statement today, IWGB organiser Fred Carter said: "By deciding to fire more than 30 union members, Rockstar have carried out an Amazon-style act of union-busting unprecedented in the games industry. This is a company that benefits from more than £440m in UK tax relief, while displaying a callous and blatant disregard for both the livelihood of workers and the letter of the law."</p><p>Rockstar recently made further headlines after it made the decision to<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-gta-6-is-delayed-again-by-half-a-year-to-november-2026-take-two-stock-immediately-begins-to-drop"> delay the release of GTA 6 from May of next year into November</a>. At this time, publisher Take-Two said the most recent GTA 6 delay is designed to give "some additional time to finish the game with the high level of polish players expect and deserve". It added "Rockstar has our full support of course", and that the Take-Two team is "confident they will deliver an unrivalled blockbuster entertainment experience".</p>

            <p>Dispatch writer Pierre Shorette regrets cutting sex scenes from AdHoc's episodic superhero workplace comedy.</p>
<p>The first series of Dispatch wrapped last night, with the release of episodes seven and eight. While much of our time in the game was spent - as you would surmise given its name - dispatching a ragtag team of antiheroes to calls about everything from stuck cats to bomb threats, over the last few weeks we have also watched the characters and their relationships grow thanks to a range of narrative based choices and cinematics.</p>
<p>However, there were some more romantic scenes cut from the final release, which Shorette says on reflection the team "shouldn't have". <strong>Please be aware of some Dispatch spoilers below. </strong></p>

<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/dispatch-romance-deleted-sex-scenes-telltale-developers-exclusive-interview">Inverse</a>, Shorette acknowledged that many Dispatch fans were especially invested in the game's relationship and romance options, and despite there only being two to pursue, they became a "meaningful" part of the experience.</p>
<p>In Dispatch, players can choose to date either Blonde Blazer or Invisgal (who has a rather steamy dream about your character, Robert), though neither of these story lines is the main focus of the game. However, the team wasn't expecting the reception to Dispatch to be as "ravenous" as it has been, and that's "probably why we didn't plan for more romance options".</p><p>Shorette continued: "One of my secret shames is I think I default to romantic comedy in my writing and my whole life. I'm trying to pull out of that and make things more serious. Even in Wolf <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/among-us">Among Us</a> or Tales From the Borderlands, there's some romance."</p>

<p>The writer said he doesn't "know that Dispatch is any one thing", adding that seeing streams of the game has allowed him to see what has worked. "So if we can have people freak out at seeing a wiener on screen, laugh at a fart joke, and then somehow cry at the end of all that. I'm happy it's working, but I also don't think we made a 'gooner game,' and people know that now if they've played up to Episode six," Shorette said. "It's interesting to see the community switch up real fast, and lock in."</p>
<p>And, well, we now all know that the romance parts of Dispatch definitely worked. But, alas, some of those moments didn't make the final release. "We definitely cut some sex scenes. Which, in retrospect, we shouldn't have," Shorette laughed, teasing we may yet "get to see those one day".</p>

<p>"There isn't anyone on the development team that wouldn't have a laundry list of stuff they wish they could polish more or gotten into the game. On the writing side, our team has a bunch of darlings that had to be killed along the way," the writer closed. </p><p>"We're still an indie studio, I think people forget that because it's doing so well and looks so good. But because it looks good, it costs a lot per second to make this video game, and sometimes it costs things that often with these games is branching too."</p>

<p>Earlier this year, AdHoc announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-episodic-gaming-back-on-the-map-ex-wolf-among-us-devs-superhero-workplace-comedy-dispatch-sells-big-to-become-a-well-deserved-smash">Dispatch had sold over 1m copies in just 10 days</a>. Thanks to this success, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-dispatch-getting-a-second-season-well-thats-something-the-developer-is-definitely-going-to-think-about">the studio is now considering a second season</a>.</p>
<p>For more, our Bertie has also been playing Dispatch, and this has left him quite excited about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/critical-role-working-on-its-first-video-game-which-will-be-set-in-exandria">AdHoc's involvement with the upcoming Critical Role game</a>. "That Dispatch made me think over and over that 'this feels like a Critical Role animated show' is some of the highest praise I can heap upon it. That's not because Critical Role is the be-all and end-all of everything creative - it is brilliant, and it is endearingly wholesome - but it's because hitting those presentation heights is hard to do," he wrote in Eurogamer's feature <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-is-brilliant-which-is-great-news-for-critical-role-fans">Dispatch is brilliant, which is great news for Critical Role fans</a>.</p>
<p>"I didn't think a Telltale-like game was capable of it. But Dispatch has proved me wrong."</p>

		<p><em>Have you tried to buy anything lately? It's weird.</em></p><p><em>In Rob's case, it's trying to sell something (a condo) because he bought something (a house) at the worst possible time. In Patrick's case, it's trying to buy something (strawberries) and realizing "wait, is that more expensive now or is it just out of season?" (sometimes)</em></p><p><em>Trump is purposely tanking the economy, in ways big and small, over a strange lifetime obsession with tariffs. A grand economic experiment only felt by the kinds of people who pay attention to their credit card bill at month's end, aka just about everyone. </em></p><hr><p><strong>Rob</strong>: The other day I was at the grocery store and couldn't find orechiette. It's a little shell-shaped pasta, nowhere near as ubiquitous as spaghetti or fettucine but not a speciality item by any stretch of the imagination. The closest substitute was several shelves' worth of huge conchiglioni, about the size of an actual conch shell compared to the thumbnail-sized orechiette I was looking for.&nbsp;</p><p>Actually, as I looked closer at the shelves, there was a <em>really </em>weird selection from Barilla and De Cecco. There was an absurd amount of little bow-tie farfalle. No penne but tons of rigatoni. I'm not going to get into tier-listing pasta here, because every pasta has its place and mission, but I don't think anyone will be offended if I say that all the crowd-pleasers outside spaghetti were in short supply and what was left was stuff that couldn't really substitute.</p><p>A couple days later I read that a massive tariff on imported pasta is poised to hit the Italian food market and wondered if I'd just had bad luck or if I'd encountered a Trump Pasta Shortage. Was there, somewhere, a bunch of brokers snapping up contracts for bucatini and fusili like at the end of <em>Trading Places</em>, preparing to control the supply as prices are about to soar? Am I going to spend the next few years thinking, for the first time in my life, whether we can afford to make something with fettucine?</p><p>In the scheme of things, this stuff is minor compared to SNAP benefits or Border Patrol and ICE agents spending weeks gassing random people on the street before posing in front of the Bean Chicago like Wehrmacht troops marching through the Arc de Triomphe. But I also think there's a pervasive strangeness to the second Trump administration where you're never sure if something is just a weird coincidence or a harbinger of some looming systemic collapse or kleptocratic market manipulation.</p><p>We talked before the election about how bizarre and frustrating it is to see the Republican Party treated as if it exists in a world of policy hypotheticals. The fact the Republican brand has been "good for the economy" throughout my lifetime is laughable given the track record they've assembled. They are pro-business only insofar as they serve the whims of established, market-dominating incumbents and financiers, ensuring the rich get richer. I can look at my grocery bills since the summer and it's clear that I effectively had my taxes raised by corporate America, collected in installments at the till every week. Meanwhile, my actual taxes? Probably stolen to pay for National Guard deployments and base housing for Trump goons rather than local projects the funds were earmarked for. Meanwhile the Democrats have elected leadership that have turned important Senate seats into the most lavishly appointed cuck chairs in history. Chuck Schumer got new glasses for the second Trump term and I guess now we know why.</p><p>But really it's just hitting home for me the degree to which my entire adult life is going to be defined by Republicans trashing the country and profiting amid the ensuing chaos and anger. I graduated into an economic collapse and, predictably, now that I am selling my first home, the market <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/u-s-home-turnover-rate-at-lowest-level-in-decades-as-housing-slump-drags-on-analysis-finds?ref=remapradio.com"><u>has completely tanked</u></a>. You can almost mark the moment units in my building stopped selling: May of this year. Shortly after the tariff chaos began and before immigration raids started terrorizing specific communities and huge segments of the workforce. If I'd listed my place before Trump took office, I'd likely have sold within a month for about $50,000 or $60,000 more than I'm likely to get, to say nothing of the four months I'll have been paying a mortgage on an empty condo. We're well into "life-altering" amounts of money here. Did I just get unlucky with the timing of the end of a long real estate boom, or is a Republican government the equivalent of an unending series of black swan disasters?</p><p>I don't write all this to plead hardship. I'm incredibly fortunate to be in this position at all, and there are people for whom these pressures determine whether they can afford rent or healthcare at all. But I don't think I've ever felt like there is such a direct connection between my individual circumstances and the news I read. It's like Trump and Russell Vought are my new roommates in a way that's never been true of any other administration. Imagine if instead of fireside chats FDR just went around like a fucked-up Santa eating everyone's leftovers and blocking their toilet. That's what we've got now.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@towfiqu999999?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Towfiqu barbhuiya</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>One of the more curious things about the current state of play is that it’s just hard to <em>tell</em>.</p><p>Like, for example. Strawberries. My children <em>love</em> strawberries. It does not matter if they’re in or out of season, we’re going to find a way to eat strawberries on a near daily basis. Sometimes those strawberries might be coming from a giant Costco-purchased bag of frozen fruit, but hey, it’s still a damn strawberry.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>It’s not every day you get to snag a fully loaded 17-inch laptop with serious muscle for less, and that’s especially true for options from known brands out there. While we’re still a couple of weeks away from Black Friday, deals on top-rated tech are coming in hot already, which makes it a great time to treat yourself to a new, powerful laptop that you can use for both work and play.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5549/">Amazon is currently being generous with a massive 71% discount on the 17.3-inch HP laptop, which brings it price down to $700.</a> This machine is packed with high-end specs, so finding it at an entry-level price like this is a rare win, and you’re even getting a bunch of useful accessories thrown in for absolutely free. It’s also one of the lowest prices we have ever seen this powerhouse drop to, and the deal is open to both Prime and non-Prime members. We just recommend getting your orders in fast, as the offer might wrap up any moment now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5549/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Immersive Visuals, Comfortable Typing Experience</h2>
<p>It’s a sleek laptop with a basic, no-fuss design. The build feels premium, and is also quite lightweight for you to carry around easily. The screen size is quite generous. For context, most options in this range offer a 15.6-inch display, so you’ve got significantly more room to work, browse, and stream here. You’ll enjoy crisp, bright visuals thanks to its HD+ IPS panel, and since it’s anti-glare, you won’t have to deal with annoying reflections when working in brighter settings.</p>
<p>Then there’s a full-sized keyboard with a lift-hinge design, which gently elevates your typing angle just a bit to ensure a comfortable position. Those who spend long hours typing won’t have to deal with sore wrists by the end of it.</p>



<p>Performance-wise, you’re covered with an Intel i3-N305 processor with 8 cores, reaching speeds up to 3.8GHz, plus a massive 32GB of DDR4 RAM. That’s enough power to push through a variety of tasks and even multitask during busy days without slowing down. For storage, you get a fast 1TB PCIe SSD. It’s got enough room to store all your important data without constantly needing an external drive.</p>
<p>Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.4 make wireless connectivity easy, and you’re getting a wide range of ports to connect peripherals without feeling limited. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5549/">There’s a lot more to like about this laptop, especially now that it’s down to $700. Just be sure to grab yours fast, before the price shoots back up.</a></p>

<p>Call of Duty has made a big change with Black Ops 7 by introducing a four-player co-op campaign, which, for the first time, has exclusive Camos to unlock.</p>



<p>While earning Camos has long been part of the Call of Duty grind, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-zombie-camo-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusive Camos available in both Zombies</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-multiplayer-camo-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Multiplayer</a>, Black Ops 7 adds even more to the mix with the campaign.</p>



<p>If you’re on the hunt to unlock every Camo you possibly can in Black Ops 7, keep this guide handy as it details all of the challenges to tick off.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-black-ops-7-campaign-camos-amp-challenges">All Black Ops 7 Campaign Camos &amp; Challenges</h2>

<p><strong>There are 12 Camos to unlock for each weapon in Black Ops 7’s co-op campaign, with nine Military Camos and three Special Camos to earn, with Mastery Camos in addition to those.</strong></p>



<p>Military Camos have the same requirements across the board, with some exceptions, while Special Camos have specific challenges to unlock.</p>



<p>Finally, there are also Mastery Camos to earn, which require unlocking all the Camos available on specific guns.</p>



<h3 id="h-all-military-camo-challenges">All Military Camo Challenges</h3>



<p><strong>There are nine Military Camos to earn in Black Ops 7 Co-Op campaign, with the requirements being the same across all weapons and requiring Critical Kills.</strong></p>



<p>The exceptions, however, are Shotguns, which require Point-Blank Kills, Melees, which just require Kills, and Launchers, which require Kills, destruction of Guild Equipment, or VTOL Destructions.</p>



<p>All of the Military Camops below are available to earn across every weapon in Black Ops 7 Co-Op Campaign, with similar requirements.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Unannounced Valve Game Listing Fuels Half-Life 3 Speculation]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/unannounced-valve-game-listing-fuels-half-life-3-speculation/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/unannounced-valve-game-listing-fuels-half-life-3-speculation.1352461/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The hype for a potential Half-Life 3 announcement continues to grow, especially with the knowledge that Valve has an unannounced game under its upcoming releases. The Half-Life 3 hope is higher than ever.</p>



<p>If we discount Half-Life: Alyx (admittedly a phenomenal VR experience), we’ve not had a mainline, multi-platform <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/half-life-player-count/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Half-Life</a> game since 2007. We know Valve and Gabe Newell have explained before that the company doesn’t feel the need to make a sequel, but it’s still one of gaming’s greatest mysteries.</p>







<p>Recent developments are pushing the narrative that Half-Life 3 could finally happen, and an unannounced Valve listing offers another glimmer of hope.</p>



<h2 id="h-valve-has-an-unannounced-upcoming-release">Valve Has An Unannounced Upcoming Release</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We’ll forgive you, Valve, it’s fine. Credit to Valve</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you go to Steam, search for any Valve game, then click on the company’s name, you’ll be taken to the main page. From here, a simple scroll down takes you to the company’s existing and upcoming portfolio.</p>



<p>Clicking on ‘Upcoming Releases’ reveals four products:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/deadlock-was-the-top-game-on-steam-in-august/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadlock</a>.</li>



<li>The new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steam-controller-2-announced-by-valve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Controller</a>.</li>



<li>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-announces-the-steam-frame-vr-headset/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Frame</a>.</li>



<li>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-reveals-steam-machine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Machine</a>.</li>
</ul>



<p>All exciting Valve products and releases. However, if you look at the ‘All’ label in the left column, <strong>it clearly says 5, yet only 4 products are displayed</strong>. This more than likely <em>isn’t </em>an accident, and it suggests Valve has another product or game in the works, but perhaps something so big that Valve doesn’t want to announce it yet—see where we’re going with this?</p>



<figure><figcaption>Interesting. Credit to Steam</figcaption></figure>



<p>It wasn’t long ago that a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/half-life-3-trailer-rumoured-to-be-in-production/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Half-Life 3 trailer was rumored to be in production</a>. If you don’t think this is enough evidence, how about the suggestion that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/half-life-3-is-playable-end-to-end-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Half-Life 3 is ‘Playable End-to-End</a>‘?</p>



<p>Again, this is speculation, and we’re not saying this is Half-Life 3 confirmed (we wish). However, Alyx shows Valve isn’t afraid to make more Half-Life games, and with the wind very much in the company’s sails right now, it could be full Steam ahead on Half-Life 3.</p>







<p>We’ve had to sit on the Half-Life 2: Episode Two cliffhanger for nearly two decades, and we think it’s about time we finally get at least one final journey to wrap up the most incredible gaming saga.</p>



<p>Stay tuned. What do you think? Is it reasonable to suggest the long-awaited Half-Life 3 announcement is coming? Or are we blowing this out of proportion?

                <p>Rockstar's 2010 game Red Dead Redemption has been rated for Switch 2, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. The ESRB <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40987/red-dead-redemption/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recently posted a rating</a> for the game on these platforms, and this has led some to believe a remaster of the game is in the works and that it could possibly launch soon. Nothing is confirmed, however.</p><p>This is all separate from the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-ps5-xbox-switch-2-port-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6536035/" data-ref-id="1100-6536035">ongoing rumors of Red Dead Redemption II coming to Switch 2 and getting updated versions for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S</a>. The ESRB database has no rating for Red Dead Redemption II on those platforms, however.</p><p>The ESRB rating for Red Dead Redemption mentions zombies, which suggests the possible upcoming re-release could feature the game's popular Undead Nightmare expansion.</p><p>Red Dead Redemption came to the Switch in 2023 and PC in 2024, some 13 and 14 years after the game originally debuted on PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2010. The follow-up--which is a prequel to the events of the first game--launched in 2018 for PS4 and Xbox One and came to PC in 2019.</p><p>The rumored RDR2 ports for Switch 2, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S are said to be in the works for a 2025 release, while a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-4-remaster-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6531466/" data-ref-id="1100-6531466">GTA 4 remaster</a> could come out this year as well. Whether or not the rumored new versions of RDR and RDR2 could be packaged together is unknown.</p><p>Rockstar owner Take-Two recently said it had eight new iterations of previously released titles in the works that will be released by the end of its 2028 fiscal year, meaning by March 31, 2028. These will be remasters and ports; <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-ps5-xbox-switch-2-port-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6536035/" data-ref-id="1100-6536035">only four have been confirmed so far</a>, and some are speculating that the possible re-releases of RDR and RDR2 could be among the announced projects.</p><p>As for Rockstar's biggest upcoming release, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6 has been delayed yet again</a> and is now set for release in November 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Winter Burrow Review - Screenshot 1 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160504/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>Developed by Pine Creek Games and published by Noodlecake, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/winter_burrow">Winter Burrow</a> is a cosy woodland survival game where you play as a mouse who braves frigid weather, collects food and resources, and rebuilds their childhood home.</p>
<p>It begins with the death of our young mouse protagonist's parents, prompting a return to the long-abandoned family burrow. It's an opening that echoes the call for a simpler, more self-actualised life that is seen at the beginning of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/stardew-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Stardew Valley</a> and many early <strong>Harvest Moon</strong> titles, yet Winter Burrow's beginning is tinged with a sadness that threads itself through the remaining plot in a way that feels appropriate for a cast of wildlife creatures trying to survive a brutal winter.</p>
<p>Given the suitably melancholy start of the game, I was hopeful that Winter Burrow would weave together the cosy and the cruel in a survival landscape equal parts challenging and charming. For a survival game, however, Winter Burrow is lacking in that oh-so-important tension between risk and reward. The resulting experience is surprisingly linear and short-lived despite its artful aesthetic presentation. While you can technically spend as long as you want building furniture and decorating the burrow, gaining access to all the tools and areas through the main plot takes under 10 hours; there’s not much to entertain afterwards.</p>
<figure><a title="Winter Burrow Review - Screenshot 2 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160498/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The art style has often been compared to that of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/donrt_starve_nintendo_switch_edition">Don't Starve</a>, but the two games have distinct approaches to the mechanics of survival. When you die in Don't Starve, you lose all of your progress and must begin again from the start of an entirely different world map.</p>
<p>There are multiple ways to deplete your health in Winter Burrow — taking damage from the varying forms of bugs that wander the wilderness, staying out in the cold for too long, or simply starving — but death isn't actually a possibility for our little mouse. They simply pass out, dropping all of their items in an animation also reminiscent of Klei Entertainment's game, and find themself back at home none the worse.</p>
<p>Passing out would be more of a deterrent if resources were more precious, but it’s easy to replenish everything, from building materials like wood and rocks to ingredients such as nuts and berries. The joy of tracking down and even stockpiling difficult-to-come-by ingredients is half the fun of crafting in survival games. Crafting in Winter Burrow feels like it requires a grocery list more than a treasure hunt. Making new, updated clothing is worthwhile since it generally offers better cold resistance, but the majority of furniture is just for looks.</p>
<figure><a title="Winter Burrow Review - Screenshot 3 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160505/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Winter Burrow is meant to be more forgiving than your everyday survival game, and it certainly accomplishes that. There just isn’t a whole lot gameplay-wise to fill the holes in a survival game that isn’t very challenging. Although the woodland neighbours are interesting and distinctive, their interactions are limited, and once you’re done with the main story, there’s not much reason to stick around.</p>
<p>The Danish developers describe Winter Burrow as a game where “it is you who tells the story.” These kinds of buzz phrases seem to pop up more and more often as the years go on, but it feels like a particularly inaccurate description in this case. The player does not make choices that impact the plot in Winter Burrow. Certain sections of the map are inaccessible without specific tools, which can’t be constructed without completing NPC requests. It’s a plot on a train track - not at all what I would call telling my own story, and a bit out of place with survival game norms.</p>
<figure><a title="Winter Burrow Review - Screenshot 4 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160502/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>What Winter Burrow gets right, though, it gets very right indeed. The art that renders the intrepid winter wonderland is beautiful. The music and sound design lend themselves well to each scene and scenario. A little mouse knitting in a big armchair next to a crackling fire is as cosy as it gets, and don’t even get me started on getting to dress a mouse up in different tiny hats and sweaters.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, the game held up well in both handheld and docked mode, although the images are crisper and the UI is easier to make out while playing docked on a larger screen. It was sometimes difficult to tell what menu option was currently selected while crafting and looking at the required materials in handheld mode, but this is a pretty minor complaint.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Ultimately, Winter Burrow is a fun, cute game that could make for a cosy weekend, but its lack of mechanical depth precludes it from lasting significance.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong: a nice, linear plot and the ability to make cute furnishings for a hollowed-out tree of a home can be a lovely gaming experience. If only because the scaffolding itself is so wonderfully crafted, I wanted more from Winter Burrow than it was able to give.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) has filed a legal claim against Rockstar Games, following the game developer's decision to <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-developer-accused-union-busting-after-firing-dozens-of-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suddenly fire 31 workers from the Edinburgh office</a> (and three more in Canada). As we previously covered, Rockstar claimed the terminations were due to 'gross misconduct', which was later <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-says-fired-gta-developers-had-been-leaking-information/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clarified</a> as 'leaking information on a public forum'; however, the workers <a href="https://wccftech.com/anonymous-rockstar-employee-says-there-were-no-leaks-layoffs-union-busting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maintain</a> that they had been on the verge of unionization after reaching the 10% threshold required by law.</p>



<p>Thus, the IWGB considers this a brazen act of union busting. After a series of protests held in front of the Rockstar North headquarters, the union asked the studio to voluntarily reinstate the workers, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/fired-rockstar-workers-want-to-be-reinstated-get-back-to-work-on-gta-vi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> they wanted to return to work and finish their project (Grand Theft Auto VI, <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now scheduled for November 19, 2026</a>).</p>



<p>However, yesterday afternoon, the union <a href="https://iwgb.org.uk/en/post/iwgb-issues-legal-claims-against-rockstar-over-unfair-dismissal-of-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> Rockstar refused to meet, forcing them to issue the claim. The IWGB's legal department shared the following statement:</p>



<p><em>We are representing employees who were dismissed by Rockstar Games in circumstances that we believe amount to victimisation and collective dismissal linked to trade union activity. Despite our representation and attempts to meet with Rockstar to resolve the matter through negotiation, Rockstar have declined and persisted to terminate members of the union in a manner that is unacceptable and unlawful. Accordingly, we have now issued formal legal claims against Rockstar on behalf of the Claimants. Our members allege that Rockstar’s conduct constitutes trade union victimisation and blacklisting.</em></p>



<p>IWGB President Alex Marshall added: </p>



<p><em>We are confident that what we’ve seen here is plain and simple union busting, and we will mount a full legal defence with our expert group of caseworkers, legal officers and barristers. Employers like Rockstar would do well to understand that private spaces such as trade union Discord servers have protections, and that their company’s contractual clauses do not supersede UK law. This case stands as a warning to any employer in the games industry and beyond who thinks they are able to act with impunity against organised workers - we will not be intimidated.</em></p>



<p>Notably, a legal claim is not the same thing as a lawsuit. Instead, it is an informal request to resolve the matter outside of court. However, if the legal claim isn't successful, the IWGB and the former Rockstar employees will likely have to file a proper lawsuit. Needless to say, the proceedings could take a lot of time, forcing some of them to look elsewhere for employment in the meantime.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Valve has created a PC-based game console that lives under your TV. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/818111/valve-steam-machine-hands-on-preview-specs-announcement">Steam Machine</a> takes everything that’s great about the Steam Deck and adds the raw power to compete with the latest PlayStation and Xbox consoles. It also puts a huge amount of pressure on Microsoft to perfect its Windows and Xbox combination, as the Steam Machine brings Windows games to the living room in a way that Microsoft is dreaming up for its next-gen devices.</p><p>The Steam Machine looks like an Xbox Series X that has been cut in half into a miniature box. The 6-inch cube runs Windows PC games through Valve’s Linux-based SteamOS, and it should have enough power through its two AMD chips to deliver performance that’s close to an Xbox Series X or PS5. Inside, the Steam Machine’s components have all been compacted in a similar way to the Xbox Series X.</p><p>Beyond the hardware, it’s really SteamOS that makes the Steam Machine a viable Xbox and PS5 competitor. Valve failed to make Steam Machines a reality a decade ago, largely because developers had to port their games to Linux for them to run. Valve’s new Steam Machine utilizes its excellent Proton compatibility layer, which allows most Windows PC games to run seamlessly on the Steam Deck and often better than they do on equivalent Windows handhelds.</p><p>While the Steam Machine is a single device and Valve hasn’t announced OEM plans right now, I still think it represents a big threat to Microsoft’s next-gen Xbox plans — and even potentially to Windows PC gaming.</p><p>It’s no secret that Microsoft is working to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682011/microsoft-windows-xbox-pc-combination-features-rog-xbox-ally-devices">combine the best bits of Xbox and Windows</a> for its next-gen consoles, and that means more PC-like hardware and software, just like the Steam Machine. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/799698/xbox-ally-x-review-asus-microsoft-full-screen-experience">Asus’ Xbox Ally handhelds</a> are an early look at the direction Microsoft is heading in for Xbox consoles, with Windows at the heart and an Xbox UI on top.</p><p>Microsoft’s combination of Windows and Xbox feels like a beta right now, though, and one that is shipping on a $1,000 device. Microsoft has effectively made the Xbox PC app into Steam’s Big Picture Mode and suppressed some of the annoying parts of Windows so they’re hidden away. It’s very early days for Microsoft’s vision here, and I personally feel it shipped far too early. The Windows and Xbox teams have a lot of work ahead to improve the Xbox full screen experience and hide the complexity of Windows away. Valve’s Steam Machine now heaps on the pressure for Microsoft to execute its vision perfectly.</p><p>That pressure will only increase if Valve can convince other PC OEMs to build Steam Machines in the future, just like it expanded SteamOS to Windows handhelds. While Microsoft is working on its own next-gen Xbox hardware, sources tell me it also wants OEMs to build future Xbox-branded hardware just like Asus has with the Xbox Ally. That puts Microsoft and Valve on an even bigger collision course.</p><p>Microsoft and Valve are both trying to attract similar audiences, gamers that are intrigued by PC gaming but want a simplified console-like experience, or those who are already PC gamers and want a reliable living room option that plays all the games they’ve already purchased.</p><p>The challenge for Microsoft is that Valve has already perfected SteamOS into a controller-friendly operating system, with a storefront that dominates PC gaming. All the pieces are ready to go for a Steam console, while Microsoft is building out its next-gen Xbox with a combination of Windows and Xbox and without being <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/688407/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-cloud-amd">locked to a single store</a>. The next Xbox now looks set to embrace rival stores like Steam to entice people in, but Microsoft still faces a massive hurdle of convincing people to actually buy games in its own PC store instead of just buying them on Steam.</p><p>Microsoft will undoubtedly lean on its impressive Xbox cloud saves and Xbox Play Anywhere support as parts of its strength to battle Valve’s Steam Machine, but with SteamOS now available across consoles and handhelds it diminishes Microsoft’s cross-device effort. PC Game Pass is still exclusive to Windows, though, so Microsoft’s subscription service will play a big role in helping its next-gen hardware stand apart. Microsoft also has the huge advantage of games like <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Valorant</em>, <em>Battlefield 6</em>, and other multiplayer titles working seamlessly on Xbox, whereas they don’t run on SteamOS due to their complex anti-cheat systems.</p><p>Pricing will also be a big factor in Xbox + Windows vs. Steam Machine. Valve hasn’t finalized pricing yet, but it says “Steam Machine’s pricing is comparable to a PC with similar specs.” That sounds more pricey than a subsidized console, at a time when Microsoft and Sony are both bumping console prices beyond the norm. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/803824/microsoft-xbox-sarah-bond-next-gen-xbox-console-pc">Microsoft is also hinting</a> that its next-gen Xbox will be “a very premium, very high-end curated experience,” so expect more PC-like pricing for those consoles as well.</p><p>As the Steam Machine brings a simplified form of PC gaming to the living room, it also threatens to shine a bigger spotlight on Windows’ performance issues and the direction Microsoft is taking with its operating system. SteamOS has been outperforming Windows in a variety of titles already, leading some PC gamers to take a closer look at Linux for the first time. Combined with a simmering dislike of Microsoft’s direction with Windows from the PC gaming community, the Steam Machine should be a wake-up call for Microsoft to focus on performance and gaming instead of shoving Copilot buttons everywhere.</p><p>The Steam Machine now looks like a well-timed response to Microsoft’s Windows gaming struggles over the years, and an effort that has been in the works for a long time. Valve originally tried to put a box into everyone’s living room with its “Steam Box” effort more than a decade ago. I still remember encouraging my colleague T.C. Sottek to chase after <strong>Gabe Newell</strong> at CES in 2013. The Valve CEO <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/8/3852144/gabe-newell-interview-steam-box-future-of-gaming">sat down with us</a> for a rare and wide-ranging interview about the future of Steam and Steam Machines. Much of what Valve was trying to do with the original Steam Box felt like a reaction to Windows 8, and Newell <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/7/25/3186615/valve-gabe-newell-gaming-interface-windows-8-interview">even described</a> the decision to launch Valve games on Linux as a “hedging strategy” against Microsoft. He also described Windows 8 as a “giant sadness” at the time, showing that Valve was frustrated at Microsoft’s direction with Windows more than a decade ago.</p><p>Valve’s hedging strategy now looks like it could deliver the dream of a PC in the living room that Microsoft has been chasing for decades — from Windows Media Center to the Xbox One’s big push with Windows underneath. Except it’s not Windows in the living room, it’s Linux.</p><p>You’d think that would be setting off alarm bells over at Microsoft. Instead, Microsoft Gaming CEO <strong>Phil Spencer</strong> was positive about Valve’s announcement during an all-hands with Xbox employees yesterday. He also <a href="https://x.com/XboxP3/status/1988677531801944496">posted on X</a> to congratulate Valve.</p><p>“Expanding access across PC, console, and handheld devices reflects a future built on choice, core values that have guided Xbox’s vision from the start,” said Spencer. “As one of the largest publishers on Steam, we welcome new options for players to access games everywhere.”</p><p>Microsoft is convinced its path for the next Xbox devices is the right one, but it now has to compete with Steam on its living room home turf to make a PC-like game console a reality. Game on.</p><div><p id="whats-happening-with-the-windows-insider-program"><h2>What’s happening with the Windows Insider program?</h2></p></div><p>In recent weeks the faces behind Microsoft’s Windows Insider program have all announced they’re moving on. <strong>Brandon LeBlanc</strong>, <strong>Amanda Langowski</strong>, and <strong>Jason Howard </strong>have all moved to separate roles inside Microsoft, and it’s not clear who will replace them yet.</p><p>Microsoft assures me that “there are no changes to the Windows Insider Program,” despite the trio all suddenly moving roles at the same time. “While we hire to backfill these roles, the Insider Program will be led by Alec Oot, Principal Group, Product Manager, Windows Servicing and Delivery,” says Chris Morrissey, senior director of communications for Windows servicing and delivery. “We remain committed to listening and learning from our Insiders, continuing our cadence of blog posts as we develop new experiences each week.”</p><p>The current Windows preview build blog posts are unnamed, and I do wonder if they’ll all just be written by AI agents in the future. Blog posts for new Windows features seem like an easy target for Microsoft’s AI push internally. Either way, I hope Microsoft continues to listen to Windows feedback through its Insider program, especially as it was introduced just as Windows 10 fixed Windows 8’s mistakes.</p><p>I’m always keen to hear from readers, so please drop a comment here, or you can reach me at <a href="mailto:notepad@theverge.com">notepad@theverge.com</a> if you want to discuss anything else.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We already knew Hideo Kojima was working on an anime movie set in the <em>Death Stranding</em> universe,&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-physint-od-trailer-showcase-2000627889"><em>Death Stranding: Mosquito</em></a>, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-productions-death-stranding-2-od-physint-1851661289">he’d also dropped word</a> that there were other&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding-</em>based adaptions in the works. Well, now we know what at least one of them is going to be:&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding Isolations</em>, an anime TV series created for Disney Plus.</p> <p>Kojima’s number-one fan, Geoff Keighley, posted the news to his&nbsp;Game Awards account, stating that the seemingly very brightly-colored series would be arriving from Kojima Productions and E&amp;H Productions on Disney’s streamer some time in 2027.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Death Stranding Isolations has been announced, a new anime series coming to Disney+ in 2027, from the mind of Hideo Kojima. <a href="https://t.co/gY65pFFWkh">pic.twitter.com/gY65pFFWkh</a></p> <p>— The Game Awards (@thegameawards) <a href="https://twitter.com/thegameawards/status/1988808663201640643?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/disney-unveils-death-stranding-isolations-from-game-creator-hideo-kojima-1236616004/"><em>Deadline</em></a>, meanwhile, has a few more details about the project, revealing that the series will be directed by&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods</em>‘ Takayuki Sano, and stresses it will be using traditional hand-drawn 2D animation (which is presumably now how we say, “God, no, it’s not using AI.”) It will star the series’ main character, Sam Bridges, in a spin-off story where Bridges is attempting to save America and help others cope in their isolation. The summary continues,</p>

 <blockquote><p>“An old man is trying to realize salvation through ways outside of the connection advocated by Bridges. A female warrior is trying to kickstart a world of constant fighting. A boy holds a grudge against Bridges, and a girl has embraced her loneliness. On the precipice of the end of humanity and the world, their fates and hopes converge, as another story of <em>Death Stranding</em> begins.”</p></blockquote> <p>There’s no word on casting yet, although it would be surely impossible for anyone other than Norman Reedus to voice Bridges. It’s interesting to note that the promotional image doesn’t show him, however, instead presumably focusing on that younger boy and girl mentioned in the blurb. It seems likely that the anime will explore the lives of the individuals Bridges meets on his wobbly journeys, as he helps them reconnect. And hopefully it’ll all be super-fucking weird.</p> <p>Obviously this is still a long way off—given there’s no specific portion of 2027 mentioned, it could be as much as two years before we get to see any of it. But, unlike&nbsp;<em>Mosquito</em>, at least this seems to be showing some sort of plan for when to actually exist.</p>

              <p>Are those sleigh bells I hear? No, sir. Those are Pokéballs. December is approaching faster than a Blaziken’s Quick Attack. With the holidays right around the corner, why not have some extra fun counting down to Christmas this year? You and your family can celebrate the beginning of the holiday season with this advent calendar from Funko Pop. This set is packed with daily surprises in the form of mini Funko Pop vinyl figures of a handful of your favorite Pokémon. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5548/">Amazon usually lists the mystery box holiday calendar for $50, but ahead of Black Friday, the site has it going for 10% off.</a> That saves you a cool $5, bringing the price to just $45 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5548/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Celebrate With Your Favorite Pokémon, One Day at a Time</h2>
<p>This makes an ideal gift for Pokémon fans of all ages. Just get it to them before December, otherwise that kind of defeats the purpose of an advent calendar. How it works is the mystery box contains four rows of six small doors, each containing a beloved Pokémon character. Starting on December 1, you can peel back the layer to reveal who it is behind it waiting in vinyl Funko Pop form. One day, you’ll find Caterpie, the next you might Bulbasaur, then after that maybe Piplup. Every day for 25 days, you get to reveal a new pocket-sized friend.</p>
<p>All Pokémon included are featured right on the box. If you want to keep yourself surprised, I suggest you neither not look at it too closely nor read the following list, detailing each of the 24 Funko Pop Pokémon included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Caterpie</li>
<li>Sylveon</li>
<li>Dragonite</li>
<li>Oshawott</li>
<li>Arcanine</li>
<li>Lucario</li>
<li>Pigeotto</li>
<li>Leafeon</li>
<li>Horsea</li>
<li>Ponyta</li>
<li>Umbreon</li>
<li>Lapras</li>
<li>Munchlax</li>
<li>Psyduck</li>
<li>Charmander</li>
<li>Squirtle</li>
<li>Charizard</li>
<li>Alakazam</li>
<li>Scorbunny</li>
<li>Lapras</li>
<li>Espeon</li>
<li>Eevee</li>
<li>Pikachu</li>
<li>Bulbasaur</li>
</ul>
<p>Predictably, most featured are Gen 1 though there are some later generation favorites getting some love too. 16 are among the first Pokémon we met on our Game Boys back in 1999 while the other nine comprise of mainly later generation starters and various new Eeveelutions.</p>
<p>Each figure is smaller than the standard, popular Funko Pop figures. They measure in individually at a maximum of two inches tall. They are made from a durable vinyl materials. As collectibles, these are built to last—able to withstand daily wear of playtime too.</p>
