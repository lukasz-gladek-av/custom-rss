            <link>https://wccftech.com/roundup/playstation-6-everything-we-know-release-date-specs-price-games/</link>
            <guid>1442842</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="overview">
			
<p><strong>Sony</strong> hasn't officially announced the <strong>PlayStation 6</strong> yet, but that hasn't stopped the rumor mill from churning out an increasingly steady stream of leaks, insider reports, and solid hints from the company itself. With the PlayStation 5 well into the latter half of its lifecycle and the PS5 Pro already on shelves, <strong>the attention of hardcore gamers is increasingly turning toward whatever comes next</strong>. </p>



<p>Here is everything we know so far about the PlayStation 6, from its release window and hardware to pricing, design, and <strong>the possibility of an entirely new PlayStation handheld</strong> launching alongside it. Read this article <strong>with the significant caveat that most of this info is likely still in flux and may not even have been finalized by Sony itself yet</strong>. We'll continue updating this article up to the console's release whenever significant new information becomes available.</p>



<h2 id="h-release-date-and-pricing">Release Date and Pricing</h2>



<p id="h-release-date-and-pricing">Sony has maintained a remarkably consistent console release cadence: the PS3 launched in 2006, the PS4 in 2013, and the PS5 in November 2020, a seemingly near-perfect seven-year gap each time. Applying that pattern to the PS5 points to a <strong>2027 release window</strong> for the PS6, and that was the most widely cited target among leakers, chiefly YouTuber <strong>Moore's Law Is Dead</strong> (<strong>MLID</strong>) and <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-launching-2027-unless-unexpected-delays-happen-amd-leaker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">renowned AMD insider <strong>KeplerL2</strong></a>. However, in January 2026, <strong>MST International</strong> senior analyst <strong>David Gibson</strong> warned that while Sony's existing memory inventory would shield it from the short-term impact of <strong>rising RAM prices</strong>, increased costs could become a serious issue in the fiscal year ending March 2027, and noted that the PS6's release is therefore "<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-likely-to-be-delayed-longer-than-many-expected-leaving-prices-the-only-things-that-will-keep-evolving-and-not-for-the-better/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">likely to be delayed longer than many expected</a></strong>." </p>



<p id="h-release-date-and-pricing">Then, on February 15, 2026, Bloomberg published an even more alarming report citing anonymous sources familiar with Sony's PlayStation 6 plans. The report stated that Sony is now "<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-delay-2028-2029-nintendo-switch-2-price-increase-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">considering pushing back the debut of its next PlayStation console to 2028 or even 2029</a></strong>", still largely due to the ongoing memory shortage that has no end in sight. If true, this could mark the longest gap between PlayStation consoles to date, while also <strong>giving Microsoft a chance to capitalize on with its next Xbox console</strong>, which is still reportedly targeting a l<strong>ate 2027 release window</strong>. </p>



<p id="h-release-date-and-pricing">Pricing is one of the most uncertain aspects of the already still nebulous PS6 picture, and the RAM shortage has complicated things further. The PS5 launched at <strong>$499</strong> for the standard edition, but with rising production costs, <strong>the PS6 is highly unlikely to match that price point</strong>. Most estimates from credible sources currently place the PS6 <strong>between $500 and $600</strong>, though some industry observers have pushed that estimate <strong>as high as $700–$900</strong> depending on the memory situation and model configuration. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS5 Pro's <strong>$699</strong> launch price</a> in 2024 may have been responsible for setting a new psychological ceiling for PlayStation hardware.</p>



<h2 id="h-hardware-specifications">Hardware Specifications</h2>



<p id="h-hardware-specifications">Sony's continued partnership with <strong>AMD</strong> since the days of the PS4 is one of the few hardware details confirmed with high confidence. Reuters reported in September 2024 that Intel had lost out on a bid to design the PS6 chipset back in 2022, with AMD winning the contract. <strong>This makes sense from a backward-compatibility standpoint</strong>, since the PS5 and PS5 Pro are both built on custom AMD silicon.</p>



<p>Leaked specifications, primarily from the aforementioned leaks shared by MLID and Kepler_L2, point to a custom APU featuring:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Manufacturing node</strong>: <strong>TSMC N2</strong> (2nm), delivering substantial efficiency gains over the PS5's 7nm process.</li>



<li><strong>CPU</strong>: AMD <strong>Zen 6</strong> architecture, offering a substantial leap from the Zen 2 found in both the PS5 and PS5 Pro, which should dramatically reduce the CPU bottleneck issues seen in demanding titles.</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: It is expected that the PS6 will feature <strong>GDDR7 RAM</strong> offering approximately <strong>640 GB/s bandwidth</strong>, which would be <strong>a 43% increase over the PS5's 448 GB/s</strong>, though using a narrower 160-bit memory bus rather than the PS5's 256-bit bus, with the speed difference compensating for the reduced bus width. Total RAM capacity has not been reliably leaked yet.</li>



<li><strong>GPU</strong>: AMD's next-generation <strong>RDNA 5</strong> GPU architecture, which will be used by both PS6 and the next Xbox. Though, according to KeplerL2, the new PlayStation console <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-wont-include-full-amd-rdna-5-feature-set/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won't feature the full RDNA 5 feature set</a></strong> that will be available on desktop graphics cards.</li>



<li><strong>Rasterization Performance</strong>: Multiple leaks from MLID and KeplerL2 <span>indicate roughly&nbsp;<strong>three times the rasterization performance of the base PS5</strong>, with the teraflop count rising from <strong>10.28 TFlops</strong> for the PS5 (and <strong>18.05 TFlops</strong> for</span> the PS5 Pro) to <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ps6-specs-rumor-34-40-tflops-6-12-rt-performance-uplift/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">34-40 TFlops</a></strong> for the PS6.</li>



<li><strong>Ray Tracing Performance</strong>: This is supposedly the big focus of the PlayStation 6 console. Thanks to the advancements planned for RDNA 5, <strong>ray tracing performance could increase by a massive 6-12x compared to the PlayStation 5</strong>.</li>
</ul>



<p>Some of those advancements were actually co-developed by AMD and Sony through the so-called <strong>Project Amethyst, a machine learning-focused</strong> initiative. <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-mark-cerny-qa-we-ask-about-vrr-improvements-pssr-fg-path-tracing-and-ml-project-with-amd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Originally announced in late 2024</a>, Project Amethyst <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-unveils-radiance-cores-neural-arrays-universal-compression-next-gen-rdna-gpu-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received a major update in October 2025</a>, when AMD unveiled three key technologies that PlayStation 6 System Architect <strong>Mark Cerny</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/mark-cerny-project-amethyst-collaboration-amd-is-a-step-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">practically confirmed will be in the new console</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Neural Arrays</strong>: A new approach to grouping GPU compute units so they can work together as a single AI engine, enabling better upscaling and denoising at lower cost to GPU performance. This was described as a fundamental improvement to technologies like Sony's PSSR.</li>



<li><strong>Radiance Cores</strong>: A new dedicated hardware block designed for ray and path tracing, taking full control of ray traversal (one of the most compute-heavy tasks currently handled inefficiently across shared resources) and freeing the GPU's shader cores for their primary functions. Cerny noted: <em>"There's a significant speed boost that comes from putting the traversal logic in hardware, and a further boost that comes from that hardware operating independently from the shader cores."</em></li>



<li><strong>Universal Compression</strong>: A software layer that compresses data of all types (not just specific file formats, as in current solutions) as it flows through the graphics pipeline, effectively boosting available memory bandwidth. AMD's <strong>Jack Huynh</strong>, SVP and GM of Computing and Graphics Group, described memory bandwidth limitations as a key barrier to next-gen rendering techniques, and Universal Compression is intended to address that without requiring an expensive hardware memory upgrade.</li>
</ul>



<p>There's no info yet on the storage. On the connectivity side, support for the new <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/hdmi-forum-releases-hdmi-2-2-specification/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HDMI 2.2 specification</a></strong> (which allows resolutions up to 10K at 120Hz, 4K at up to 480Hz, and 8K at up to 240Hz) and <strong>USB4 Version 2.0</strong> seem like a given, especially if the delay rumors turn out to be correct.</p>



<h2 id="h-playstation-6-handheld-project-canis">PlayStation 6 Handheld: Project "Canis"</h2>



<p>One of the most unexpected elements of the PlayStation 6 conversation is the strong rumor that <strong>Sony is planning to launch a dedicated gaming handheld</strong> alongside, or shortly after, the PS6 home console. This would be quite the surprise for PlayStation handheld fans, who had almost given up on the idea of a new handheld console after the resounding failure of the PS Vita.</p>



<p>Bloomberg first reported in 2024 that Sony was exploring a gaming handheld, internally dubbed <strong>"Project Canis."</strong> Since then, leaked AMD documentation uncovered by MLID <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-handheld-specks-leaked-outperform-xbox-ally-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>has added substantial hardware detail</strong></a>, and multiple leakers have corroborated the device's existence. <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-low-energy-mode-handheld/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony has also updated its PS5 developer kits to prioritize "<strong>Low Power Mode</strong>" support</a>, with documentation suggesting developers ensure their games can run on just eight CPU threads. Multiple sources have since interpreted this as <strong>Sony quietly preparing the software ecosystem for handheld hardware</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Project Canis Tentative Specs </strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Chip</strong>: Monolithic APU built on TSMC 3nm of approximately 135mm².</li>



<li><strong>CPU</strong>: 4x Zen 6c cores for games + 2x low-power Zen 6 cores dedicated to the OS. The OS offload reportedly frees roughly 20% additional CPU headroom for games.</li>



<li><strong>GPU</strong>: 16 RDNA 5 compute units, clocking around 1.20 GHz in handheld mode and 1.65 GHz when docked.</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: LPDDR5X on a 192-bit controller, with theoretical support for up to 48GB; no solid figure has been confirmed, though developers consulted on the matter suggested anything between 24 –36GB would be necessary to run next-gen games with features such as UE5's Nanite.</li>



<li><strong>Performance</strong>: Roughly half the raw rasterization power of the base PS5, but with notably stronger ray tracing performance due to the RDNA 5 architectural improvements. Docked rasterization performance could be around 0.55 – 0.75× PS5, while ray tracing could land at 1.3 – 2.6× PS5 thanks to RDNA 5's efficiency gains.</li>
</ul>



<p>Some PlayStation gamers have worried that the handheld could "hold back" new PlayStation 6 games, but  according to Massive Damage's Art Director Bryan Heemskerk, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-held-back-pc-ports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS6 games are more likely to be held back by PC ports</a></strong>. </p>



<h2 id="h-playstation-6-games">PlayStation 6 Games</h2>



<p>This is by far the most speculative paragraph of the whole article, at least at the time of the original publication, for a very simple reason: it's way too early, and <strong>no PS6 games have been formally announced yet</strong>. That said, we can make a few educated guesses based on the known development timelines.</p>



<p>First in line would obviously be <strong>Intergalactic: the Heretic Prophet</strong>, <strong>Naughty Dog</strong>'s new sci-fi IP. It's been a long time since we got a new game from the studio (<strong>The Last of Us Part II</strong> launched in June 2020), and that's largely because Naughty Dog famously <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-canceled-naughty-dog-live-service/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled The Last of Us Online in December 2023</a></strong> because it didn't want to become bound to the live service development cycle. </p>



<p><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-wont-launch-before-2027-says-schreier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Intergalactic: the Heretic Prophet won't launch before 2027</a></strong>, according to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier. It will definitely launch on PlayStation 5, but it could be a prime candidate for a PS6 version when the PlayStation 6 eventually hits the market.</p>



<p>The same goes for most of the big games that are tentatively scheduled for 2027-2028:</p>



<ul>
<li>Creative Assembly's <strong>Alien Isolation sequel</strong></li>



<li>Ubisoft's <strong>Assassin's Creed Hexe</strong></li>



<li>Cloud Chamber's <strong>BioShock 4</strong></li>



<li>Larian's <strong>Divinity</strong></li>



<li>Bethesda's <strong>The Elder Scrolls VI</strong></li>



<li>Square Enix's <strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3</strong></li>



<li>Avalanche Software's <strong>Hogwarts Legacy 2</strong></li>



<li>4A Games' <strong>Metro Exodus sequel</strong></li>



<li>Respawn's <strong>Star Wars Jedi Part 3</strong></li>



<li>Ubisoft's <strong>Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Remake</strong></li>



<li>Ubisoft's <strong>Tom Clancy's The Division 3</strong></li>



<li>Saber's <strong>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 3</strong></li>



<li>CD Projekt RED's <strong>The Witcher IV</strong></li>



<li>CD Projekt RED's + Fool Theory's <strong>The Witcher Remake</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>All these games will likely be cross-generation, offering a PlayStation 6 version with additional bells and whistles at some point. The cross-gen phenomenon <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-ps4-crossgen-right-and-rational-jim-ryan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was already huge between PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5</a></strong>, and given current industry trends, it's only going to get larger.</p>



<p>As for true PS6-only titles, it will take a very long time for those. Maybe the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/next-mass-effect-continues-to-be-in-development-amidst-new-features-to-build-and-romances-to-figure-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next Mass Effect</a></strong>, the freshly announced <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-will-launch-before-2030-promises-casey-hudson/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</a></strong>, and the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/a-god-of-war-trilogy-remake-is-in-development-while-god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-launches-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War remake trilogy</a></strong> will qualify. Needless to say, we'll slowly update this section (as with the others) once more concrete details become available. Stay tuned.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Freshly minted <a href="https://kotaku.com/xboxs-new-boss-promises-not-to-flood-it-with-soulless-ai-slop-2000672087">Microsoft Gaming CEO Asha Sharma</a> has kicked off the newest era of Xbox leadership with an open thread on Elon Musk’s social media platform. Coming from Microsoft’s AI division, the former marketer with little experience in gaming faces a wave of skepticism from fans at the exact moment when trust in the Xbox brand has never been more challenged following waves of developer layoffs, game cancellations, and studio closures.</p> <p>She began with a simple question to her influx of new gaming followers. “Top 3 greatest games ever? Why? GO” reads her <a href="https://x.com/asha_shar/status/2025255912521486368">second post on X</a> since replacing outgoing <a href="https://kotaku.com/phil-spencer-xbox-leaving-retirement-microsoft-2000672059">38-year Microsoft veteran Phil Spencer</a>. “For me it’s <em>Halo</em>, <em>Valheim</em>, <em>Goldeneye</em>,” she told one user. Others asked which<em> Halo</em>. An Xbox Gamertag Sharma shared with another user included playtime in both <em>Halo Infinite</em> and <em>Halo: The Master Chief Collection</em>.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">New <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Xbox?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Xbox</a> CEO Asha Sharma has now publicly shared her Gamertag. She has a 10,860 gamerscore and seemingly only started playing on Xbox or this GT one month ago.</p> <p>She (or whomever runs the account) has played 29 games in the span of that month. <a href="https://t.co/3EMvDVLNo3">pic.twitter.com/3EMvDVLNo3</a></p> <p>— NIB (@nib95_) <a href="https://twitter.com/nib95_/status/2025279480621682906?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 21, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The account has a shocking number of achievements in <em>Ball x Pit</em>, one of 2025’s breakout indie games that debuted on Game Pass. One user recommended <em>Borderlands 2</em> which Sharma said she would try. A short time later, it appeared on her recent activity list. For some it’s a sign that the executive from Meta and Instacart is engaged, accessible, and no stranger to games. Others are skeptical that it’s not all just part of some carefully and artificially curated PR rollout.</p> <p>Amid the more than one thousand responses, Sharma was asked the obvious question on most Xbox players’ minds: what about exclusives? Microsoft’s shift from fierce console war competition with Sony to actively porting its biggest franchises to PlayStation 5 has read to many long-time fans as a betrayal and, perhaps even worse, a sign that the tech giant <a href="https://kotaku.com/thats-it-im-calling-it-xbox-is-dead-time-of-death-february-20-2000672114">has given up on Xbox as a viable contender in the console gaming space</a>.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hear you</p> <p>— Asha (@asha_shar) <a href="https://twitter.com/asha_shar/status/2025253764136141169?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 21, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>“Hi Asha Sharma, </span><span>as the new Xbox CEO I hope that you understand how important exclusive games are and how games like Halo, Forza, Gears. Fable… Created an identity for Xbox and its players becoming a key point for Xbox’s success,” wrote one player with a Gamerscore over 200,000. “Xbox games must be only on Xbox.”</span></p>

 <p>“Hear you,” she wrote back.</p> <p>The sentiment, vague and noncommittal as it was, instantly gave some hope to the diehard Xbox fans in Sharma’s mentions. Others think it’s just a cheap way to buy a little good will before Microsoft accelerates Xbox’s pivot to being just a third-party publisher or moves forward with more cuts and closures as the tech giant continues shifting all of its resources and energy into the AI race.</p> <p>Elsewhere in the informal Q&amp;A, some users on X accused Sharma’s answers of being written by a chatbot. “I don’t believe you,” wrote one person. “In fact, I think your account is an AI.” The new CEO of Xbox responded: “Beep Boop Beep Boop.”</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/midsummer-studios/" id="1480">Midsummer Studios</a> has closed, but not before giving a look at a life simulator that the team was working on.</p>



<p>The studio was founded by XCOM designer Jake Solomon, and it was Solomon who shared on social media that the studio was closing its doors but wanted to provide a look at a game called Burbank. According to Solomon, the game was a mix of The Sims and The Truman Show, the film starring Jim Carrey that focused on a man discovering that his life was a television series.</p>



<p>“We built a studio, we made a game, and I’m really proud of both,” wrote Solomon. “This game was a dream of mine, our team made it come true, so watch and dream with us,” he said in his post.</p>

<p>Jake Solomon later stated in a social media post that the characters in the pre-alpha trailer he shared were generated by AI. However, he insists that the studio had no intention of replacing any developers with AI.</p>



<p>“Our characters use AI for memory, reasoning and speech. That’s what let’s you create anyone you want and drop them in any story you write. But all of our art is created by our talented artists. We had no interest in replacing <em>any</em> developers with AI,” he wrote.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-xcom-devs-form-midsummer-studios-to-make-next-gen-life-sim/" id="40302">The studio opened in 2024</a>, with Solomon partnering with Will Miller, the lead designer at Firaxis Games, and Leslie Birch. Less than 2 years later, it is closed. The studio launched with $6 million in funding from investors. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The original </span><i><span>Saints Row</span></i><span> was an unexpected hit. Rising above the tide of urban sandboxes in 2006, the game pushed its tomfoolery further than even </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto</span></i><span> dared. The most recent entry, however, was a misfire. 2022’s reboot was busted from a technical standpoint and tonally out of sync for fans. Last year, rumors arose that the series might get another shot, but Chris Stockman, design director for the original game, now says the long-running </span><i><span>Row</span></i><span> has a fork in it.</span></p> <p><span>“I think the franchise is dead, unfortunately,” </span><span>Stockman <a href="https://twitter.com/papaRPG/status/2024941290492694703?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2024941290492694703%7Ctwgr%5E5b5766a4b2f5941f6a7dde345eab9a61c98bcdd8%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurogamer.net%2Fi-think-the-franchise-is-dead-says-saints-row-design-director">told a fan on Discord</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-think-the-franchise-is-dead-says-saints-row-design-director"><em>Eurogamer</em></a>)</span><span>. “I get the sense that Embracer has zero ability to do anything with it.”</span></p> <p><span>Though Stockman hadn’t been with </span><i><span>Saints Row</span></i><span> developer Volition for years, he claimed last November that Embracer Group approached him to help with a course correction for the franchise. The pitch, </span><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-original-saints-rows-design-director-says-hes-been-asked-to-create-a-pitch-for-a-potential-prequel/"><span>as he described it</span></a><span>, was a </span><i><span>Saints Row</span></i><span> prequel set in the 1970s. This new setting could have done a more balanced job of giving </span><i><span>Saints Row</span></i><span> a desperately needed fresh coat, while affording itself ample opportunities for its signature buffoonery.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Remember when we got excited about the prospect of a Saints Row prequel? Well according to Saints Row 1 Design Director Chris Stockman, Embracer is completely ignoring the idea.</p> <p>Saints Row is once again dead. <a href="https://t.co/cpPVcRjxwD">https://t.co/cpPVcRjxwD</a> <a href="https://t.co/FWpjC6kmkT">pic.twitter.com/FWpjC6kmkT</a></p> <p>— rpg!

Only a few months later, Stockman now believes he is being “ghosted” by Embracer and that it’s probably the end of the road for </span><i><span>Saints Row</span></i><span>’s 20-year joy ride. “I wish things were different,” he wrote.</span></p> <p><span>While it’s since become the norm, Embracer Group were one of the earlier conglomerates who got into the practice of hoovering up game studios and squeezing them dry. They’ve toyed around with portfolios like Gearbox, Crystal Dynamics, THQ and dozens more, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/embracer-sells-studios-collapse-nintendo-classics-black-ops-7-update-2000647577"><span>all to mixed results</span></a><span>. Their acquisition of Volition occurred in 2018, part of a package in the purchase of Koch Media. The 2022 reboot would be the only game Volition made under Embracer, developed under routine restructuring and staff transfers between other studios. When this banged-up </span><i><span>Saints Row</span></i><span> failed to meet sales expectations, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/embracer-shuts-down-saints-row-studio-volition-after-30-1850792734"><span>Volition was shuttered</span></a><span> by Embracer in 2023.</span></p>

 <p><span>This end is merely another page in the book of Embracer squashing out potential sequels, having recently binned revivals for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/more-details-about-xboxs-canceled-perfect-dark-reportedly-leak-2000627538"><i><span>Perfect Dark</span></i></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/embracer-group-deus-ex-cancelled-eidos-montreal-layoffs-1851205890"><i><span>Deus Ex</span></i></a><span> before that. Having picked up Crystal Dynamics in 2022, their first outing with the </span><i><span>Tomb Raider</span></i><span> series is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/crystal-dynamics-tomb-raider-open-world-layoffs-2000644117"><span>already facing turbulence</span></a><span> as Embracer enacts their signature restructuring.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Promises Two Far Cry Games Are Coming As Open-World Shooter Continues Its Longest Hiatus Ever]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/far-cry-7-extraction-shooter-assassins-creed-hexe-ubisoft-2000672574</link>
            <guid>1442764</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-far-cry-game-1680319871"><em>Far Cry 7</em></a> was not supposed to take this long, but Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot is promising the wait will be worth it. Asked about the state of the publisher’s biggest franchises and why they’re taking so long to make in a recent interview, the cofounder took the unusual step of confirming the existence of two previously reported upcoming<em> Far Cry</em> projects.</p> <p>“We have a solid pipeline underway across Vantage Studios,” he <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/ubisoft-ceo-interview-yves-guillemot-layoffs-creative-house-1236667500/">told <em>Variety</em></a> this week. “Under the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> brand, several titles are in development, spanning both single-player and multiplayer experiences, with the ambition to further grow a community that exceeded 30 million players last year. On <em>Far Cry</em>, anticipation is high, and we currently have two very promising projects in development.”</p> <p>The existence of both of these projects was <a href="https://kotaku.com/far-cry-7-multiplayer-ubisoft-star-wars-snowdrop-1850038103">first reported back in early 2023</a>.&nbsp;<em>Far Cry 7</em> was being developed under the codename Project Blackbird while the second game, a multiplayer spin-off, was being developed under the codename <em>Project Maverick</em>. While Ubisoft mentioned both games in internal presentations at the time as the company doubled down on its biggest franchises, they continue to face delays and remain MIA <a href="https://kotaku.com/far-cry-7-assassins-creed-hexe-ghost-recon-delay-1851780674">as the company tries to implement quality checks with higher standards</a>.</p>

 <h2>Why is <em>Far Cry 7</em> taking so long?</h2> <p>Historically, big <em>Far Cry</em> sequels have come out every two to three years, with smaller spin-offs releasing in-between. Since Ubisoft bought the franchise and launched <em>Far Cry 2</em> back in 2008, the longest gap between new entries has been four years. It will have been five years since <em>Far Cry 6</em> released come this fall. A similar breakdown in the pipeline has hit other major Ubisoft franchises as it gets more complex and expensive to develop AAA blockbusters.</p> <p>As <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-confirms-far-cry-and-assassins-creed/"><em>Insider Gaming</em> reports</a>, the <em>Far Cry</em> multiplayer spin-off Maverick in particular has faced major challenges. While it started as an extraction shooter, Maverick has continued to evolve and morph during development. While Ubisoft has continued to produce impressive, massive open-world single-player adventures, its forays into multiplayer have gone terribly. From <em>Hyper Scape</em> to <em>XDefiant</em>, and all of the botched and canceled live service projects in-between, Ubisoft has been unable to recreate the success of its biggest multiplayer staple, <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>.</p>

 <h2>“Several” <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games are just around the corner</h2> <p>On the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> front, the path forward is looking much clearer. An unannounced remake of <em>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag</em> appears to still be on track for release in 2026 despite a recent delay. The previously teased multiplayer spin-off Invictus is also still “locked-in,” according <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-confirms-far-cry-and-assassins-creed/">to <em>Insider Gaming</em></a>, with the next single-player game, <em>Hexe</em>, reportedly slated for 2027. Multiple unannounced mobile spin-offs were recently canceled, however, and a mobile game from <a href="https://twitter.com/assassinscreed/status/1568694651800133632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1568694651800133632%7Ctwgr%5Eb9b4ae047170f42a47dc2044f55096d535b137cb%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fassassins-creed-red-mirage-ubisoft-hexe-jade-netflix-1849521945">Netflix called <em>Jade</em></a> seems unlikely to ever see the light of day as the streamer pivots to licensed party games.</p>

 <p>Whatever happens to Ubisoft as it partitions its sprawling empire of studios into easily sellable “Creative Houses,” <em>Far Cry</em> and <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> will remain cornerstones of whatever’s left. There’s already a <em>Far Cry</em> TV series in development at FX and a new <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> historical drama coming to Netflix. All Ubisoft has to do is actually release a new<em> Far Cry</em> game at some point while bringing some excitement and shine back to <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>.</p>

<p>The day that Slay the Spire 2 will enter Early Access has been confirmed. Thankfully, for fans of the beloved roguelike deckbuilder, they won’t have to wait long.</p>



<p>Slay the Spire 2 enters Steam Early Access on Thursday, March 5, 2026, 12 days from this writing. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/mega-crit/" id="3619">Mega Crit</a> announced the news in a YouTube trailer.</p>



<p>This is the long-awaited follow-up to the game that helped solidify the roguelike deckbuilder genre. Shore, some may feel like they’re a dime a dozen these days, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/slay-the-spire-2/" id="3528">Slay the Spire 2</a> gets the opportunity to finally build on what the original game brought to the table in 2019.</p>

<h2 id="h-slay-the-spire-2-was-originally-set-for-a-2025-release">Slay the Spire 2 Was Originally Set for a 2025 Release</h2>



<p>The sequel to 2019’s Slay the Spire was originally scheduled for an Early Access release in late 2025. However, in September, Mega Crit announced it would delay the game to uphold its own quality standards. </p>



<p>Such improvements will include a new 4-player co-op mode, complete with specific multiplayer cards and new team synergies. Learn more about the new developments and updates here.</p>







<p>Insider Gaming will provide more information on the upcoming Slay the Spire sequel as Early Access approaches.</p>

            <p>Patrick Söderlund – founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> studio, Embark – has been appointed as executive chairman at Nexon to "accelerate global strategy, transform creative direction, and lead the next phase of growth" for its parent company.</p>
<p>Fresh from the success of Arc Raiders, Söderlund will now be working "closely with [Nexon] CEO Junghun Lee and the executive leadership team", setting the "strategic direction" that Lee will then implement.</p>
<p>It's not entirely clear if this position comes in addition to Söderlund's already pretty meaty role leading Embark – which is owned by Nexon – or is in place of it, but it appears to be the former.</p>

<p>"Nexon has all the assets to unleash dramatic growth – incredibly talented people, iconic franchises, large and committed player communities, and best-in-class live service capabilities," Söderlund said via a press statement.</p>
<p>"This is an enormous opportunity, but one that will require deep focus and discipline. [Nexon CEO] Junghun and I are aligned on what needs to happen, and I'm ready to get to work."</p>
<p>It's a huge appointment for Nexon, which – although bobbing along just fine with its immensely popular mobile titles like MapleStory – has failed to get a bite of the live-service sector, and chiefly dabbled in casual and mobile gaming until subsidiary Mintrocket released the hugely successful <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dave-the-diver">Dave the Diver</a> in 2023. It also published Embark Studios' inaugural title, The Finals, that same year, and the middling The First Descendant in 2024.</p>
<p>As we reported earlier this week, Arc Raiders continues to impress, nearing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-had-nearly-1000000-concurrent-players-last-month-and-thats-on-pc-alone">almost 1m concurrent players </a>on PC alone and pushing onwards with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-shared-watch-event-rewards-pve">events</a> and regular updates <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/roadmap-january-april-2026">planned out until April</a>.</p>
<p>It has also started to grapple with the consequences of that <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-latest-duplication-glitch-has-players-placing-hundreds-of-ziplines-and-trigger-nades-and-safe-to-say-its-scaring-everyone-i-hope-this-gets-addressed-soon/">massive duplication glitch</a> that allowed cheeky players to double anything they were holding in their hands, confirming it has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embark-studios-details-actions-against-exploits-and-glitches-abusers">finished a large investigation into how the recent exploits and glitches</a> came to be and how to deal with offenders now and in the future.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/discord-age-verification-hack-persona-2000672570</link>
            <guid>1442752</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Last week, Discord </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-palantir-peter-thiel-persona-age-verification-2000668951"><span>users reported seeing prompts to submit personal information to Persona</span></a><span>, a third-party age-verification service. As Discord commits to universal age-verification, the new measures have come under </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/oh-good-discords-age-verification-rollout-has-ties-to-palantir-co-founder-and-panopticon-architect-peter-thiel/"><span>intense scrutiny</span></a><span> after </span><a href="https://discord.com/press-releases/update-on-security-incident-involving-third-party-customer-service"><span>previous security failures</span></a><span>. Now a trio of hacktivists say they’ve successfully breached Persona, getting a closer look at how the company uses submitted biometrics. They say their findings raise alarms beyond the possibility of leaks.</span></p> <p><a href="https://www.therage.co/persona-age-verification/"><span>According to </span><i><span>The Rage</span></i></a><span>, Persona’s front-end security left a lot to be desired. Worse, however, were investigative findings that suggested Persona’s surveillance of the users whose data it collected was way more sprawling than originally believed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“It was initially meant to be a passive recon investigation,” </span><a href="https://vmfunc.re/blog/persona"><span>writes vmfunc, a cybersecurity researcher and one of the hackers</span></a><span>, “that quickly turned into a rabbit hole deep dive into how commercial AI and federal government operations work together to violate our privacy every waking second.”</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I'm sharing all email correspondences between <a href="https://twitter.com/vmfunc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@vmfunc</a> and myself in advance of <a href="https://twitter.com/vmfunc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@vmfunc</a>'s later blog posts because without context, a signed statement from myself has only created more conspiracy theories regarding Persona. <a href="https://t.co/nDJorLEP4H">pic.twitter.com/nDJorLEP4H</a></p> <p>— Rick Song (@rickcsong) <a href="https://twitter.com/rickcsong/status/2024423711559102578?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 19, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>On top of finding it surprisingly easy to access data gathered by Persona, the research showed that faces and biometrics were not just being scanned for age verification, but flagged for suspicious behavior and bounced off watchlists as well. To some, particularly those who don’t worry about their face being deemed “suspicious,” this may not sound like an Orwellian level of intrusion, until you remember Persona’s full network.</span></p>

 <p><span>Persona </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-15/founders-fund-values-identity-startup-persona-at-1-5-billion"><span>received $150 million in 2021</span></a><span> from the Founders Fund, a long-running tech investor group headed by Peter Thiel. Thiel’s main business, on top of </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/epstein-files-tech-elites-gates-thiel-musk/"><span>palling around in Jeffery Epstein’s emails</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hulk-hogan-sex-tape-gawker-lawsuit-kotaku-go-media-1851787000"><span>waiting for the antichrist</span></a><span>, is Palantir, an intentionally ominously-named data brokering service that is currently </span><a href="https://www.404media.co/elite-the-palantir-app-ice-uses-to-find-neighborhoods-to-raid/"><span>peddling user information to support ICE raids</span></a><span>. The findings of vmfunc and co’s research doesn’t directly tether Persona and Discord’s operations to Palantir or Thiel, but it wouldn’t be conspiratorial to point out that all this data seems to be funnelling along similar slopes.</span></p>

 <h2>Trust but verify</h2> <p><span>Persona has confirmed the breach, CEO Rick Song corresponding and </span><a href="https://x.com/rickcsong/status/2025038040599810385"><span>even thanking the</span></a><span><a href="https://x.com/rickcsong/status/2025038040599810385"> hackers</a> for flagging the security exploit. This has not, however, </span><a href="https://x.com/vmfunc/status/2024433404683374921"><span>tempered concerns</span></a><span> among those hacktivists about how the user information is ultimately being used.</span></p> <p><span>“Transparently, we are actively working on a couple of potential contracts which would be publicly visible if we move forward,” writes Christie Kim, chief operating officer at Persona, </span><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/discord-and-persona-end-partnership-after-shady-uk-age-test-sparks-outcry/"><span>in an email regarding the security breach and speculation around Discord</span></a><span>. “However, these engagements are strictly for workforce account security of government employees and do not include ICE or any agency within the Department of Homeland Security.”</span></p>

 <p><span>After the alarm was initially raised about Persona, Discord claimed its work with the Thiel-backed firm was only temporary, and that it didn’t have new contacts with it moving forward. It also promised user info was being wiped from servers within seven days of being gathered.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>In a statement provided to </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>, Discord said the “limited test” had concluded, though what Persona does with the information in that period isn’t clarified. It seems to go much further than verifying which PlayStation you grew up with. Even after the dust settles, it’s unclear if the trust can ever be repaired as an exodus of Discord users have already </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-alternative-teamspeak-age-verification-check-rivals-2000669693"><span>flooded alternatives like TeamSpeak</span></a><span>.</span></p>

<p>"Edmund and I have been discussing and mapping out what we want to do for DLC 1, and I gotta say I'm getting a little bit excited about it," Tyler Glaiel wrote on X/Twitter as the patch notes went live, detailing a raft of QoL changes, bug fixes, and more.</p>
<p>However, when a fan suggested that the duo should "really think about doing some UI touch up", Glaiel warned it wasn't that easy.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">We're gonna be pretty careful about stuff like that because a lot of the requests are people not quite understanding the tradeoffs we had to make during dev regarding complexity.

"Some stuff is in the works, though."</p>
<p>Last week, Mewgenics broke a rather impressive Steam record, welcoming 115,428 concurrent players on Steam, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mewgenics-sets-huge-steam-concurrent-player-record-taking-a-crown-previously-worn-by-hades-2">meaning it now boasts the highest concurrent player count of any roguelike on Steam <em>of all time</em></a>.</p>
<p>If you are one of the many already playing Mewgenics on Steam, be sure to check out our guides. Here is one on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/best-mewgenics-classes-tier-list-how-to-unlock">best Mewgenics classes tier list and how to unlock every class</a> to get you started. As for those aforementioned patch notes? Here you go:</p>
<blockquote><h2>MEWGENICS 1.0.20695</h2>
<ul>
<li>This patch is focused on major bug fixes and "easy" changes that are unlikely to cause secondary issues</li>
</ul>
<h3>QOL Changes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Coin/Food/Item zoomers no longer prevent you from opening the backpack while they're animating</li>
<li>Added "Limit Framerate" to video settings.</li>
<li>"Tall" tiles now go semi-transparent when in tactical view</li>
<li>Fixed item sort order upon returning from an adventure (one of the last changes pre-release was adding sort buttons to the in-combat inventory screen and this broke how they sorted upon returning home)</li>
<li>If playing on steam deck, End Turn (Hotkey) is now bound to "Enter Key" by default instead of nothing. Should allow for some steam input config hacks for those who want to bind it to a back button easier.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Copy Cat / Learn From Me being able to copy things other than spells in some cases</li>
<li>Fixed Tina3's Mama Maggot and Familiar Korbee not having a portrait</li>
<li>Fixed a certain very late game boss fight's summons running away when the boss died. In this particular case they weren't supposed to run</li>
<li>Fixed a few cases where an ability or passive icon in the UI would not update after being overridden by a new one (ex when using a Forbidden spell while already having 2 disorders)</li>
<li>Fixed a minor odds issue related to how Stimulation affects a parent with a class passive but not a class active</li>
<li>Fixed level spawn order to spawn static objects before familiars (This should fix a few cases where a familiar occupies a space a static object wants to be, causing it to spawn in a different place and sometimes blocking cats or enemies in)</li>
<li>Fixed Eat Rock and Rock Crusher showing a tooltip for Petrify</li>
<li>New idle animation for pet rock and pet boulder and fixed death gib</li>
<li>Fixed the way Interchange interacts with Bonus Move and Bonus Attack</li>
<li>Fixed a case where quitting after losing your last cat to a sacrifice event would cause a crash upon re-loading the save file</li>
<li>Fixed a few flickering pieces in a cutscene</li>
<li>Fixed amoebas being able to drop larger rocks partially off-map</li>
<li>fixed a very late game enemy leaving an invisible corpse</li>
<li>fixed Unscarred+ and Uncapped HP causing infinitely growing HP</li>
<li>lowered the odds of seeing a variant version of one act 3 miniboss</li>
<li>Added "texture_atlas_size" to settings file to allow for some configuration hacks for under-min-spec machines. Default is 4096. Note that lowering this will also require lowering "texture_scale_big" as well so larger textures can fit into the atlas. This will remain settings-file-only, no intent to add this to the options menu</li>
<li>Misc localisation fixes</li>
</ul></blockquote>

            <p>Balatro developer LocalThunk has marked the second anniversary of his hit indie roguelike with a heartfelt blog post that ended: "Yes, I'm still working on 1.1."</p>
<p>Balatro was set to receive a 1.1 update last year, but its solo developer, LocalThunk, pushed it back <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-update-delayed-as-developer-preserves-hobbyist-approach-to-ensure-this-isnt-the-last-update-the-game-gets">in order to preserve his "hobbyist" approach to game development</a>. Since release, he has been crunching alone on a balance patch and releasing a mobile port, before taking some time out and then beginning 1.1 work.</p>
<p>Now, in a <a href="https://localthunk.com/blog/bad-grades">blog post entitled Bad Grades</a>, LocalThunk talks about dropping out of his engineering degree – "the idea of spending the rest of my life doing something I didn't care about was enough for me to throw in the towel" – and talked about approaching his academic advisor for help switching to a computer science degree instead (luckily for us).</p>

<p>"The choice was simple. It was hardly a choice at all, really. I loved programming. I wasn’t any good at it, nor was I aware of what may await me after graduation, but in the months since that Intro to Computer Science course I had created a few programs that convinced me this is the thing for me. I want to make things with code," he wrote.</p><p>"The transition into Computer Science was a bit rough, seeing as I’d already missed a couple of weeks of the semester with a full course load. I was not a good student, and to be honest I barely passed some of my required courses."</p>
<p>But this new skill enabled him to make things – a "perlin noise terrain generator", a grid-based heat dissipation simulation" – and a "more granular version of Risk, or a bite-sized version of a grand strategy game like Europa Universalis".</p>
<p>"I worked on that game for over two years. It never had a name, it was never completed, and apart from showing it to a few friends and family, nobody knew it even existed," he added. "But it was exactly what I wanted to make, and the feeling of absolute freedom I had while working on it is the reason why I kept game development as a hobby years later. That project was the template. I found the files for that project and played it for a couple [of] days recently; it was pretty fun."</p>
<p>LocalThunk said he "thinks about that version of myself a lot now", adding, "Even if I could warn myself, I'm not sure what I could have said to prepare for the insanity" of releasing Balatro.</p>
<p>"With all the success, baggage, attention, heartache, fear, stress, and joy that I’ve had since Balatro was created, at least that old version of myself is still there," he concluded. "Last night I stayed up until the early hours of the morning drawing pixel art, writing code, and listening to music in my quiet house. Notebook of ideas open next to me, cup of decaf in hand."</p>
<p>Then, right at the end as a postscript, he added: "Yes, I'm still working on 1.1."</p>
<p>After a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-wins-formal-appeal-to-reclassify-poker-game-as-pegi-12">shaky start with ratings boards</a>, Balatro has gone on to find phenomenal success. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/100-completing-balatro-has-developer-better-equipped-to-design-the-next-big-update">LocalThunk has 100 percent completed his own game</a>, which has "equipped" him to better design the next update.</p>

            <p>Former Xbox president Sarah Bond thanked former CEO <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> and congratulated his successor, Asha Sharma, in a letter sent to all staff as news broke that she was leaving after eight years with the company.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/today-marks-an-exciting-new-chapter-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-retiring-amid-major-leadership-shakeup-that-sees-microsofts-coreai-president-taking-over-roll">Xbox CEO Phil Spencer announced his retirement from Microsoft after nearly 40 years yesterday</a> (21st February), amid a major leadership shakeup for the gaming brand that'll see Microsoft's current president of CoreAI, Asha Sharma, take over the role, and Xbox president Bond depart the company.</p>
<p>In a message shared via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sarahrbond_sharing-with-gratitude-the-note-i-sent-to-activity-7430753683912531968-YEXj/">LinkedIn</a>, Bond said she will "remain on as a Special Advisor to Asha to help ensure a smooth transition," but stressed, "this is the right time for me to take my next step, both personally and professionally". She did not share what those next steps would be.</p>
<p>"I've had the privilege of spending time with [new CEO] Asha over the last few weeks as we've planned for this transition, and I've seen firsthand her deep commitment to our players, developers, and brand," Bond said.</p>
<p>"She brings deep technology and commerce experience, along with a strong track record of building and scaling platforms that the world uses. Xbox deserves this. I'm excited to see her lead this next chapter for our team."</p>
<p>Bond added: "I'm incredibly proud of what we've built together over the past eight-plus years. PC and cloud gaming are growing faster than ever, our next console is well underway, and together we've helped lay the foundation for a more open gaming platform that spans devices and reaches players around the world."</p>
<p>She closed on thanking Spencer for his "mentorship and friendship over the years", and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella for "his sponsorship and support throughout my time at Microsoft".</p>
<p>In her first email to staff as CEO of Microsoft Gaming, Sharma wrote, "I feel two things at once: humility and urgency. Humility because this team has built something extraordinary over decades. Urgency because gaming is in a period of rapid change, and we need to move with clarity and conviction."</p>
<p>Spencer said: "Today marks an exciting new chapter for Microsoft Gaming as Asha Sharma steps into the role of CEO, and I want to be the first to welcome her to this incredible team."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I’ve always wanted to go skydiving. <em>Aerial_Knight’s DropShot</em>, from indie developer Aerial_Knight, lets me live out that dream — at least in a safe, virtual kind of way. It also lets me shoot bullets from finger guns, wield laser skulls, and wear cool sunglasses while I’m falling through the air. So maybe it’s better than the real thing.</p><p>Playing as a character named Smoke Wallace, who was bitten by a dragon that gave him the finger gun that can actually shoot bullets, you plummet toward the ground and try to pick off bad guys with that finger gun or by punching them up close. It’s a first-person game, and the perspective really helps sell the feeling that you’re falling through the sky.</p><p>Your goal is to survive each level without taking more than two hits from the bad guys or other dangers like lasers, all while taking down as many enemies as you can as quickly as possible. Your gun has a limited number of bullets, but you can refill your ammo by shooting or flying into balloons you’ll see as you fall.</p><p>Each level is short. I finished most of them in 45 seconds to a minute and a half. At the end, you get a letter grade based on how many enemies you take down, maxing out at S+++ if you reach a certain per-level goal. Since the terrain, obstacles, enemies, and speed boosts spawn in the same spot each level, repeating them to try and get that high score turns each level into fast-paced FPS puzzles you can crack to find the optimal route.</p><p>The game oozes style. Smoke Wallace has purple skin because of his dragon bite. He wears sunglasses, and you can pick different styles that give you different power-ups for finding the eggs, like one that briefly lets you fire six finger guns at a time. Every time you kill a bad guy, the game briefly goes into slow-motion. You’ll even take on bosses that include dragons and flying tanks. And throughout, you’ll be treated to an awesome heavy metal soundtrack.</p><p>I was done with <em>DropShot</em> after about two-and-a-half hours, and I could spend more time grinding S+++ scores if I wanted to. But I think the short length works in the game’s favor: <em>DropShot</em> explores its core mechanics in 50 great levels instead of stretching everything out into something that might wear thin. Even when I was nearing the end, I was still excited every time I flew through the sky.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/875259/dropshot-aerial-knight-review-pc-playstation-xbox]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">I would not be in this line of work without The Legend of Zelda. It’s my favorite franchise of all time – video game or otherwise – and it’s the series that will always draw me back into gaming and Nintendo, no matter what. My story is not unique; I know several IGN editors who feel the exact same way. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not a secret to anyone that Zelda is critically important to so many of us here: we’ve awarded <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/igneditorial/lists/masterpieces">seven different Zelda games a 10/10</a> since IGN was founded in 1996 (the most of any franchise), we were one of very few outlets to recognize <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ign-awards-2023-every-winner-announced">Tears of the Kingdom as Game of the Year</a> in a packed 2023, and we crowned Breath of the Wild as the greatest game ever made on our most recent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-100-video-games-of-all-time">Top 100 Games of All Time list</a>, compiled in 2021. It’s a series that’s constantly growing alongside us: how many franchises contain a game that’s essentially redefined a genre? You could argue Zelda would appear on that short list <em>at least </em>twice. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So as The Legend of Zelda celebrates its 40th anniversary this weekend, a few of us wanted to share our personal memories of this beloved franchise that we hold most dear. These are our legends of Zelda.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Zelda II: The Adventure of Link - By Seth Macy</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There aren't a lot of people whose first exposure to The Legend of Zelda franchise was The Adventure of Link. I'd go so far as to say, for most normal, well adjusted people, playing Zelda's NES sequel as their first foray into the series would turn them away from it forever. But not me. No. I was completely hooked. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I rented Zelda 2 for a weekend and, when I went to school the following Monday, my thumbs hurt from playing for so long. And the thing is, I didn't really even understand what the hell was going on. I just fell in love with the setting, the weird way it transitioned from an overhead map to self-contained battles, and the massive castles filled with opportunities for Link to die. It set my young imagination on fire and I became obsessed with it from a stylistic and presentational point of view. </p><span data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><section data-cy="user-list-embed"><span><div><h3 data-cy="title3">Legend of Zelda: The Complete Playlist</h3><p>Nintendo's Zelda series has gone from 2D to 3D, from D-Pads to sticks to touch screens to motion controls and back. Here are all of Link's (and Zelda's and Tingle's) adventures over the years. Log in to check off which ones you've played, and add others to your backlog.</p></div><span><a href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/igneditorial/lists/legend-of-zelda-the-complete-playlist" sx="[object Object]" data-cy="see-all-btn" title="View All Games">See All</a></span></span></section></span><p data-cy="paragraph">I need to point out, at no point did I actually like the gameplay. It was, and remains, brutally difficult, practically impossible for a kid to complete over the course of a rental weekend. The Death Mountain section was where I hung it up many times out of sheer frustration. And even though I was so angry and defeated and saddened to be unable to get through to the end, I still could not resist renting it week after week. I pored through the tattered rental store copy of the manual, captivated by the art style – so distinctively Japanese and at the time, so new and exciting. I borrowed concepts for my own middle-school drawings and rudimentary pen and paper role-playing creations. I also didn't realize it at the time, but that top-down world view and the experience point grind had awakened in me a love for JRPGs I didn't even know existed at the time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It wasn't until 2018 I finally beat The Legend of Zelda: The Adventure of Link, playing through the version available on Nintendo Switch Online, and only because I spammed the hell out of save states. Still, even all these years later, my imagination roars to life when I look at those classic illustrations, and I get a weird inkling to start up another playthrough. Then I remember how brutally unfun it is and I play something else. But man. What a world changing experience it was when I was a kid.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening - By Brian Altano</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">I hated school. OK, maybe "hated" is too strong a word. I strongly disliked school and it probably didn't like me very much back. To give the place some credit, I loved cracking jokes with my friends before class started. I loved that the cafeteria sold warm, three-for-a-dollar Otis Spunkmeyer cookies.  I loved every art class, the only class where the teacher didn't have to call my parents after and say "Brian is smart and creative, he just doesn't seem to care about this class." See, in 1993, I didn't want to be in school. All I wanted to do was play video games, talk about video games, read about video games, draw video game characters, and eat video game-themed breakfast cereals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A particular video game that I could not stop reading about (specifically in a Nintendo Power preview article that made frequent trips with me everywhere in my school backpack) was The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening, the first portable Zelda game ever made, which was making its way to the Nintendo Game Boy. The idea of a Zelda game that I could bring with me everywhere was absolutely mindblowing at the time. I would hop off the school bus every day to do chores, scrounge for coins in the couch cushions, and save money until I had enough to buy Link's Awakening. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But if I’m being honest, the real cash cow was my daily lunch money. Every day I got three bucks for lunch, which back then was enough to buy a sad cafeteria meal and a drink, usually one of those hockey puck shaped breaded chicken patties smooshed between two wet buns with a canned ice tea made by some questionable bootleg brand like “Ol’ Orchard” or “Teaslees” to wash it down. But one day I realized that if I instead bought three Otis Spunkmeyer cookies, I'd A) still be sort of full, B) get to eat cookies for lunch like some sort of child king, and C) save two whole bucks a day to put towards The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening. I’d have the game in a few weeks without having to do much of anything for it. There were some downsides to this plan, obviously. For starters, I'd have to hide the money from my parents. I'd also have to find a way to buy the game without them knowing it. And lastly, (and I can confirm this as a father now) there’s a very real science fact that if a little kid eats nothing but sugary breakfast cereals and three chocolate chip cookies all day and then needs to focus on school work, that kid will instead bounce off of the walls like an insane little maniac. By now you’re probably figuring out why my teachers didn’t like me very much.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A few weeks (and probably several detentions and cavities later) I had successfully saved enough money to buy my game. I walked down a highway in New Jersey to that magical, brown roofed, giraffe themed castle known as Toys ‘R’ Us and came home with my treasure tucked inside the big pocket of my winter jacket. To be fair, I paid every penny for it, but by the way I covertly and anxiously snuck it into my house you’d think I stole the thing. To this day, my parents never found out. Dad, if you’re reading this, a different Brian Altano at IGN wrote it, not the one who is your son. He would never steal lunch money to buy a video game. Weird coincidence that there’s two guys here named Brian Altano, right? </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 10 Best Legend of Zelda Games</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, for the next several months, my Game Boy came with me everywhere, but especially to school. On the bus, I played Zelda. In between classes, I played Zelda. On the playground, I played Zelda. Strangely enough, having video games to play at school between the actual school parts of school helped me focus on my classes more. Instead of day dreaming about when I’d get to play video games next, I’d walk into class feeling fresh after taking down another Zelda dungeon, and then I’d do everything the teacher needed me to do until I could play video games again. My grades started improving and my parents stopped getting as many disappointed phone calls from my teachers. This also coincided with me not eating chocolate chip cookies for lunch anymore, which also definitely helped. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So thank you to Link’s Awakening for being my first portable Zelda game, one of my favorite games ever made, and a game that rescued my academic career and also almost made me fail out of school. Thank you to Otis Spunkmeyer and Geoffrey Giraffe who went on to get married to each other, maybe. Apologies to my teachers and my parents and to the other Brian Altano here who is now in huge trouble with my dad. And happy birthday to The Legend of Zelda, a franchise that I’ll always be there for on day one, to purchase a brand new game with actual money that is no longer earned by eating chocolate chip cookies for lunch.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Zelda Timeline - By Logan Plant</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Spoilers for The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hyrule's history has been passed down countless times from one generation to the next. In that same tradition, I didn't discover my love for Zelda on my own: I inherited it. Just like every child with pointy ears who gets wrapped up in the never-ending battle for Hyrule, this story begins before my time. My dad played The Legend of Zelda at a friend’s house when he and my mom were in college, which led to them eventually saving to buy an NES of their own, just so they could bomb every last wall in that original 8-bit Hyrule. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fast-forward roughly a decade to when I entered the picture, born the same year as The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time’s launch on N64. My mom tells me I’d sit on her lap and watch my dad explore a new Hyrule, this time in 3D. Like our favorite childhood bedtime stories, I have no recollection of witnessing Link’s journey to stop Ganondorf. I’ve just always known it. This universe of talking trees and evil pigs and boys without fairies carved a home in my mind during my earliest days and hasn’t budged since.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Which is why it should come as no surprise that my first vivid memory comes from Hyrule, too. I’m four now, and my older sister and I are watching my dad fight the final boss of The Wind Waker. The very first thing I remember is Toon Link leaping into the air and plunging the Master Sword straight into Ganondorf’s skull. I was shocked: it was far and away the most violent, gruesome thing I’d ever seen. I recall walking into the living room to tell my mom what had happened, but then everything goes fuzzy again and all I’m left with is the everlasting image of Ganondorf turning to stone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No matter where I’ve gone, I’ve taken my love for Zelda with me. Breath of the Wild came out when I was in college, and I spent launch night marathoning it on the enormous, blurry TV in the dormitory lounge as my floormates passed by and watched for a bit on their way out to the evening’s events. Once the hall was empty, and the motion-activated overhead lights went dark, there was nothing left but me and the peaceful glow of the Great Plateau. I was confused when my friends returned just a few moments later. “You’re back already?” I asked, only to learn that four hours had glided by in what felt like minutes. That was the first of dozens of long nights with Breath of the Wild, and later, Tears of the Kingdom, which still managed to hijack my sleep schedule years after the days of going to college parties were long gone. Time changes all things, but Zelda has never seemed to mind.</p><span data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><section data-cy="user-list-embed"><span><div><h3 data-cy="title3">Logan's Top 10 Zelda Games</h3><p>Only the best version of each game is included.</p></div><span><a href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/MrHurgy/lists/logans-top-10-zelda-games" sx="[object Object]" data-cy="see-all-btn" title="View All Games">See All</a></span></span></section></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Zelda tells us a tale about an endless cycle of good rising up to ward off evil, and as we eagerly await its next chapter, I can’t help but wonder where I’ll be when a new 3D entry finally arrives. Maybe I’ll have a child of my own by then, and they’ll watch me take my first steps into whatever wild world Nintendo offers us next. Maybe their first memory will be something creepy or strange in a Zelda game years from now. I like to think they’ll play a new Zelda while off at college, homesick for their childhood but equally giddy to be experiencing a brand new take on Hyrule for themselves. And hopefully, they’ll always call their parents and siblings to talk about Zelda, just like I do to this day. That's a cycle I wouldn't mind repeating for generations to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Logan Plant is the host of Nintendo Voice Chat and IGN's Database Manager &amp; Playlist Editor.

We have not played all the Steam Next Fest demos. There are a lot. But here are a few that we've played and enjoyed.</p><h2>Replaced</h2><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/niPUvgTgnI8"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/niPUvgTgnI8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The quick pitch here is Cyberpunk aesthetics, Limbo/Inside cinematic platformer puzzles and mood, and Batman Arkham combat. It seems to be a potent mix that is already really impressing us. You can watch us play and discuss the demo above.</p><h2>Denshattack</h2><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6XGk7sIPzvQ"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6XGk7sIPzvQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Denshattack is a game that demos very, very well. In it, you control a train that can leap and stunt between tracks in a sort-of-post-apoclyptic Japan as you try to be the best train race trick performer in the world. It plays like a modern Dreamcast game and it's very cool. You can watch us play it above.</p><h2>Planet of Lana II</h2><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RTDTuPl56G8"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RTDTuPl56G8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Unlike the other two games listed here, Planet of Lana II is a bit more of a known quantity, as any sequel is. I mentioned Limbo/Inside above and Planet of Lana II takes heavy inspiration from those games, and does it well. The sequel is shaping up to be a worthwhile follow-up to the first game and you can check out the demo with us above.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/opinion/2026/02/20/the-video-games-you-should-play-this-weekend-february-20]]></content:encoded>

<p>Last November, Stockman revealed he wanted to revive the open-world crime series following the poorly received 2022 reboot – developed after he had left Volition – and claimed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/original-saints-row-designer-says-unloved-2022-reboot-missed-the-mark-but-the-big-news-is-embracer-wants-him-to-pitch-a-revival">publisher Embracer Group had reached out to hear more</a> about his ideas.</p>

<p>Fast forward a few months, however, and Stockman is now less confident, responding to a fan on Discord that IP holder Embracer has "ghosted him" and "has zero ability to do anything with [the franchise]".</p>
<p>"[H]onestly, I think the franchise is dead, unfortunately," Stockman said in reply to a commenter who'd shared their dismay that the last canon game was released "a decade ago".</p> <div>

<p>"I get the sense that Embracer has zero ability to do anything with it," he added. "I wish things were different. I tried my best to offer a path forward, but they've ghosted me."</p>
<p>Stockman's comments come <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saints-row-reboot-developer-didnt-know-what-they-were-building-saber-ceo-says-criticising-shuttered-team">after the CEO of Saber Interactive had some pretty damning words to say about the reboot</a> and its developer, Volition, after it was shuttered in 2023 as part of then-parent company Embracer Group's previously announced "restructuring" programme.</p>
<p>"They didn't know what they were building," Matt Karch said. "They didn't have any real direction. It couldn't last," Karch said. "And so, who's going to fund them for the next game after that disaster?"</p>
<p>I found the 2022 game to be a very mediocre affair <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saints-row-2022-review-a-snappy-but-slightly-uneven-reboot">when I reviewed it back in 2022</a>, calling it a reboot that "won't set the world alight, but there's a punchy game here with some pleasant surprises".</p>
