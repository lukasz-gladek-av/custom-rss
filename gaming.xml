			<p>Borderlands 4 is out in the wild, and while it's enjoyed some <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/borderlands-4/">critical</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-out-now-already-biggest-borderlands-game-on-steam/">commercial</a> success right at launch, its launch has also been a bit of a mess with technical issues galore. That's unfortunately not uncommon for major triple-A releases, but what hasn't been improving the situation is how Gearbox boss, Randy Pitchford, has been responding to it.</p>



<p>Pitchford has a history of making comments online to players that don't always go over so well, and we don't have to turn the clock back too far to remember the last time his comments caused a stir with Borderlands 4. Last time, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/randy-pitchford-apologizes-for-the-misunderstanding-caused-by-saying-a-real-fan-would-find-a-way-to-buy-borderlands-4-at-80/">about the game's price</a>. This time, he's telling <a href="https://wccftech.com/gearbox-boss-tells-4k-stubborn-players-switch-1440p-use-dlss/">"<em>4K stubborn</em>"</a> players that it's actually their fault that the game his studio released isn't running very well.</p>



<p>Most studios, when they launch a big game that has technical issues, put their heads down and get on with fixing it, and that's what Gearbox is doing, but most studios also don't have to deal with their boss going online and making players even more upset about the whole situation. It's not what anyone on the Gearbox team had in mind for launch, and as spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/borderlands/baldurs-gate-3-publishing-director-feels-bad-for-borderlands-4-devs-who-are-just-trying-really-hard-to-make-players-happy-as-randy-pitchford-fights-back-against-performance-criticism/">Gamesradar</a>, it has Baldur's Gate 3's publishing director, Michael Douse, feeling bad for the rest of the team trying to get the game fixed, and ensure that players have the best experience possible.</p>



<p>"<em>Just lock Randy in a cupboard for 6 months,</em>" Douse commented on X (formerly Twitter). When some responded that Pitchford is better off not being cut off, and that they prefer his honesty over an corporate-approved message, Douse agreed, but clarified, "<em>I feel bad for his teams who are just trying really hard to make players happy</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>On the one hand, Pitchford's brand of unmitigated honesty stands out because it's not what you hear from almost anyone else in the industry. Game development is hard, and Pitchford telling players to do it themselves if they think it's so easy isn't exactly an unfair response. Even the biggest studio with the biggest team is going to miss major and minor technical problems. It's not easy work, and players are often too quick to forget that.</p>



<p>But it's not like Borderlands 4 just has a few frame rate problems, and players are spending their hard-earned money on a game that should at least run without crashing. It's getting fixed, and that's great, but that doesn't take the sting away from knowing you've spent money on something broken. Though, as Pitchford has told players who have an issue with it, they can "<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967829418275172510"><em>Please get a refund from Steam</em>"</a> if they want.</p>

                <p>A movie based on EA's The Sims is in the works, with Oscar-winner Margot Robbie's production company, LuckyChap, attached. Prolific Hollywood producer Roy Lee is involved as well, and now he's shared some further insight into what fans can expect from the video game movie.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/the-sims-movie-margot-robbie-barbie-lego-movie" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Direct</a>, Lee said he expects the movie to be "unique." He said it's similar to The Lego Movie, in that when it was announced, people wondered how it would translate to the big screen. People didn't understand until they saw it, Lee said, and a similar thing could happen for The Sims movie.</p><p>Lee produced The Lego Movie as well, along with Robbie's blockbuster hit Barbie. "[Audiences] were probably wondering, 'What could a Barbie movie be?' Somewhere in between both The Lego Movie and Barbie is where The Sims movie will be," he said.</p><p>There is no word yet on who may star in The Sims 4 movie.

<p>Announced via social media, the translated post reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection global sales surpass 1 million copies!</p>
<p>Thanks to all of you, we have achieved global sales of 1 million copies!</p>
<p>We look forward to your continued support for this title!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's an impressive result for Capcom, but it seems almost guaranteed that we won't get a brand new entry in the series – at least not any time soon.</p>
<p>The reason for this, of course, is that Marvel is now collaborating with Sony on the new PS5 / PC title <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marvel_tokon_fighting_souls">Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls</a>, with acclaimed developer Arc System Works (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/guilty_gear_-strive-_nintendo_switch_edition">Guilty Gear -Strive</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_ball_fighterz">Dragon Ball FighterZ</a>) at the helm.</p><div><figure data-videoid="6ePAJ6dxYWY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6ePAJ6dxYWY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6ePAJ6dxYWY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6ePAJ6dxYWY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed49fea9hzlomt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePAJ6dxYWY" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>It's not out of the question that we might see a new MvC in the future, but with Marvel Tōkon launching in 2026, we reckon Capcom might be more inclined to create a new entry in the Capcom vs. SNK series.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/dreamcast/capcom_vs_snk_2_mark_of_the_millennium_2001">Capcom vs. SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium</a> director Hideaki Itsuno recently <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/capcom-vs-snk-2-director-really-wants-to-make-a-third-entry">stated his desire to make a third game</a>, and said he would do so if Capcom and SNK licensed it to his new studio, Lightspeed Japan Studio.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-5-september-17-system-software-update-adds-new-dualsense-pairing-option-power-saver-mode.1299312/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/playstation-5/">PlayStation 5</a> system software update is set to go live in a few hours, introducing features that beta testers have been able to try out for a few months.</p>



<p>As confirmed today, the next big system software update will roll out tomorrow, September 17. Once the update is live, the system will download it automatically. If not, the download and installation process can be started manually by going into the Settings menu, then picking System, System Software, System Software Update, and Settings.</p>



<p>The biggest additions of the upcoming new PlayStation 5 system software update are Power Saver mode and a new DualSense pairing option that allows users to pair the controller with multiple devices. Power Saver mode, which can be enabled via the Settings, System, Power Saving, and Use Power Saver menu options, will be further supported down the line with updates to already available games such as Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, and Demon's Souls, while the soon-to-be-released Ghost of Yotei will support it at launch. This rather interesting reveal seems to support the idea that this new <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-power-saver-mode-impact-performance-significantly-handheld/">Power Saver profile is targeting the specifications of the rumored PlayStation handheld system</a> that is supposedly releasing alongside the PlayStation 6.</p>



<p>While Power Saver mode is an option that few are likely to use for the time being, the new PlayStation 5 system software update's <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-ps5-beta-program-ps5-pro-dualsense-pairing-update/">DualSense pairing option</a> is surely going to see wider usage, especially for those who use the controller on PC. Once the update is live, it will be possible to register up to four devices simultaneously and switch between them directly from the controller.</p>



<p>More information on the next PlayStation 5 system software update rolling out tomorrow can be found on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/23/new-ps5-system-update-beta-previews-dualsense-wireless-controller-pairing-across-multiple-devices/">Official PlayStation Blog.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Wreckreation Release Date Puts the Car in Carnage Next Month]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wreckreation-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wreckreation-release-date-puts-the-car-in-carnage-next-month.1299309/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher THQ Nordic and developer Three Fields Entertainment have announced the release date for vehicular destruction sandbox&nbsp;<em>Wreckreation</em>, and it's causing some serious car-nage next month.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Wreckreation&nbsp;</em>will land on PC and current-gen consoles (but no Nintendo Switch 2, unfortunately) on October 28th. It'll let you - and, optionally, your friends - loose in MixWorld, a "400 square kilometer racing realm that is yours to create, shape - and wreck".</p>

<p>As the title suggests,&nbsp;<em>Wreckreation&nbsp;</em>is built mainly around its core arcade racing loop, which combines high-speed racing and driving with&nbsp;<em>Burnout</em>-style crashes and stunts. If you're still waiting for&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wreckfest-2-early-access-release-date" rel="nofollow"><em>Wreckfest 2&nbsp;</em>to come out of Early Access</a>, this one should do more than just tide you over.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wreckreation-release-date-loops.jpg?itok=izuzCDGo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wreckreation-release-date-loops.jpg?itok=1HDUGAN1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Wreckreation&nbsp;</em>brings vehicular chaos in October.</figcaption></figure><p>The game's main attraction, however, is the aforementioned MixWorld, where you can place whatever crazy loops, ramps, and pipes your brain can conjure, before tasking your friends to take on your impossible gauntlet.</p>

<p>As THQ Nordic and Three Fields say,&nbsp;<em>Wreckreation</em>'s MixWorld will offer you the chance to "build roads on and off-road", as well as "out to sea or up in the sky", so if you love to spend hours with&nbsp;<em>GTA Online</em>&nbsp;players' racing creations,&nbsp;<em>Wreckreation&nbsp;</em>is for you.</p>

<p>You can also customize your vehicle, as well as the gameplay challenges you're asking players to complete. Even time of day, weather conditions, and whether there's any traffic on the road can be customized and controlled.</p>

<p>If you want to get a sense for what&nbsp;<em>Wreckreation&nbsp;</em>will play like (as well as seeing some pretty gnarly crashes), then you can check out the game's release date announcement trailer right here.</p>




<p><em>Wreckreation&nbsp;</em>is scheduled to launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1594040/Wreckreation/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10005975/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/wreckreation/9n0llb6pg0r4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on October 28th. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things THQ Nordic-related.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Blizzard finally </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-persona-5-skins-crossover-mercy-genji-joker-2000625739"><span>unveiled the five </span><i><span>Persona 5 </span></i><span>collaboration skins</span></a><span> it’s bringing to </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span> yesterday, and as </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>fans tend to do, they had a pretty wide spread of reactions. When you have 44 heroes, it’s impossible to spread love across them equally, and it can get pretty irritating if your favorite never seems to get any love in the form of skins and other cosmetics. It’s especially grating when </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>seems to favor a specific handful of characters with each event or collaboration. While support hero Kiriko, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-kiriko-mercy-venture-reaper-season-12-skins-1851626893"><span>the face of this issue</span></a><span>, wasn’t included in the </span><i><span>Persona 5 </span></i><span>skins, the collaboration still hasn’t gone over well with some fans who feel that heroes like Genji and Mercy are getting preferential treatment, or are disappointed that some seemingly obvious crossovers didn’t manifest.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">drew junkrat skull and dva oracle earlier cause I'm hyped for the collab hehe ⚡<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OverwatchFanart?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#OverwatchFanart</a>​ <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Persona5?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Persona5</a>​ <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Overwatch2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Overwatch2</a> <a href="https://t.co/6XOAOfgPgl">pic.twitter.com/6XOAOfgPgl</a></p> <p>— Souda (@lemonsoudaa) <a href="https://twitter.com/lemonsoudaa/status/1967625308129112547?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 15, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Surprisingly, the most contentious skin in the </span><i><span>Persona 5 </span></i><span>event seems to be Genji as Ryuji. Genji makes a lot of sense for the collaboration, given that he’s one of </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s Japanese heroes, and his katana would make him a pretty natural fit for someone like Yusuke, who also uses a sword in the RPGs. Ryuji, however, is a bit of an odd pick. The track star is the tank of </span><i><span>Persona 5</span></i><span>’s team, and uses blunt melee weapons in fights, such as bats and pipes. When Genji wears the skin based on the Phantom Thief, his katana is replaced by Ryuji’s base lead pipe, which, yeah, I mean, that’s a melee weapon, I guess, but you don’t slash people with a pipe the same way Genji does when he uses his katana in his ultimate attack.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The choice is even more questionable considering that some fans feel Junkrat, the grenade-launching DPS hero and often forgotten member of the original roster, would have made a better fit, and had been speculating and hoping that he would get the Ryuji treatment. He has Ryuji’s blonde hair, the two have both suffered leg injuries that leave them with a distinct limp, and Ryuji is often a goofy comic relief character whose mannerisms would have worked well in a Junkrat highlight intro.</span></p>

D.Va, the mech-piloting tank, got a skin based on the student council president Makoto. It has some cool details, like her mech being based on Johanna, Makoto’s motorcycle-shaped Persona, but </span><i><span>Persona 5 </span></i><span>also has a character who would have fit D.Va’s gamer theme: Futaba. The support character in </span><i><span>Persona 5 </span></i><span>is a bit of a recluse. She’s extremely online and has to be dragged out of her bedroom to be social half the time, but she is always dropping gamer jokes and memes into casual conversation. D.Va pilots a mech because she was a pro gamer who uses her transferable skills to defend South Korea, so the comparisons are pretty apparent, especially because Futaba also pilots her own Persona like a mech. Still, some fans argue that adapting Johanna’s design for D.Va’s mech was an interesting creative choice.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">yeah makoto! you remember the character in persona 5 who spoke in gamer lingo and spent most of her time in mementos in a mech like persona and had  heavy ties to technology in most of the phantom thieves? right? <a href="https://t.co/tPb2pIZfgF">https://t.co/tPb2pIZfgF</a></p> <p>— * (@star_piIot) <a href="https://twitter.com/star_piIot/status/1967634520720675158?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 15, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">blizzard if they used more than 5 percent of their brain  and actually played persona 5 <a href="https://t.co/En7AyTA9bL">https://t.co/En7AyTA9bL</a> <a href="https://t.co/2OJdKvSzKy">pic.twitter.com/2OJdKvSzKy</a></p> <p>— Jonathan (@JonathanFess) <a href="https://twitter.com/JonathanFess/status/1967756280862499250?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">this is a good choice when you look at the mecha</p> <p>yall just dont have imagination <a href="https://t.co/HUExUNV2yz">https://t.co/HUExUNV2yz</a></p> <p>— AUZZIE ✈️ NYCC (@auzziejlee) <a href="https://twitter.com/auzziejlee/status/1967638175226138773?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 15, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The blizzard dev scrolling past your post <a href="https://t.co/NwVHVKmuAK">https://t.co/NwVHVKmuAK</a> <a href="https://t.co/kzjiCO716i">pic.twitter.com/kzjiCO716i</a></p> <p>— Frankiep423 (@frankiep423) <a href="https://twitter.com/frankiep423/status/1967745502306586881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <p><span>If you go looking, you’ll find a lot of ideas fans had for the collaboration before Blizzard revealed the skins.

Ultimately, when Blizzard teases something weeks before revealing it, fans just have more time to imagine the perfect collaboration in their heads and be disappointed in whatever follows, and that disappointment is only exacerbated when there are already perceptions of favoritism. R.I.P. Ryuji Junkrat, though. A real missed opportunity, that one.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the charms of the Warring States Soulslike series Nioh is its plethora of playstyles. So far in the series, we've seen weapons including swords that ooze Samurai Style, ninja-like sickle and chains, and even unusual choices like tonfa. Each weapon also has high, medium and low stances that players switch between in order to best face an enemy, all working together to create the sort of action that the series is known for. Add a variety of skills on top and you get a wide range of RPG builds that act as one of the draws for the series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nioh 3, the long-awaited return to the series, features a more advanced combat system composed of Samurai Style, whose combat is similar to what we expect from a Nioh game, as well as Ninja Style, which lets players fight with swift movements. Players can switch between the two with a single button, and doing so causes your weapons, armor and even usable skills to change, giving you the feeling of using two builds at the same time. It quite literally doubles the game's charm as both an action title and an RPG.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ninja Style even changes how your character looks as you ninja run and more. During character creation, you create looks for both Samurai and Ninja Styles.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Ninja Style even changes how your character looks as you ninja run and more.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While we've fought as a samurai until now in the Nioh series, it has been possible to use a ninja-like combat style. So why fully split gameplay into these two styles in the newest title? When we ask Nioh 3 General Producer Fumihiko Yasuda about why they added Ninja Style, he explains, "We wanted to create a new kind of action that would act as a major centerpiece, making players feel that the game has taken a step forward."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He continues, "Team Ninja also has the experience of creating the Ninja Gaiden series. In other words, we have just about as much experience and knowhow when it comes to creating ninja action as we do with Nioh's samurai action. Ninja are very popular overseas, and we thought that this would excite those players as well. Nioh's Japanese world and setting is also something we value, which made ninja seem like the best possible answer. That's why we've added this style."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As a kind of new action meant to feel like a step forward, Ninja Style really does play and look quite different from Samurai Style. Samurai Style consists of the kind of steady, block-focused combat we've come to expect from the Nioh series. When in it, you can change between weapon stances as you always have, and you can use Ki Pulse after attacking, a stamina recovery technique the series is known for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pressing a button after attacking while in Ninja Style will allow you to use Mist, creating a clone as you move.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the other hand, Ninja Style involves quick, evasion-focused combat. Weapon stances don't exist in this style, but ninjutsu are available to use in their place. Ki Pulse also becomes replaced with a new action, Mist.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Mist creates a clone after attacking as you move quickly, allowing you to get behind an enemy (where your attacks deal more damage). Though this Mist action does allow for a swift and stylish form of combat, some people do seem disappointed that it takes away their ability to use Ki Pulse as they always could. Using it becomes second nature to an experienced Nioh player, likely in part because it also links to dispelling special zones created by enemies known as yokai realms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Why make it so that Ki Pulse is only available in Samurai Style? According to producer Kohei Shibata, this was done to clearly distinguish between the feeling of being a samurai versus a ninja through these styles. Ki Pulse is known as Zanshin in Japanese, a term related to kendo and swordsmanship that refers to a state of mind that prevents one from being open to an attack after striking. Shibata says that the way this manifests in-game, where you carefully manage your ki as you fight, is its way of incorporating a samurai's style of fighting that draws on both stillness and motion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A black aura will sometimes appear on the ground while fighting an enemy. This is a yokai realm, an area that will reduce your Ki recovery speed.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Giving Ninja Style Ki Pulse as well resulted in an issue where the tempo of its combat resembled Samurai Style,” says Shibata. “For ninja, we wanted players to use Mist, an action that makes use of the style's mobility, when they would normally use Ki Pulse. The stance system also comes from sword kata, or forms, and it seemed wrong to apply that to ninja. That's why the same button activates both Mist and Ki Pulse. We wanted to create distinct styles of movement and combat, and that's why we made the decision to not give ninja Ki Pulse." </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"There is a skill that allows you to dispel yokai realms by using Mist in Ninja Style."</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Shibata adds, "There is a skill that allows you to dispel yokai realms by using Mist in Ninja Style." So while players won't be able to dispel them at first with Ninja Style, it will become possible as you progress.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also ask Yasuda why the decision was made to limit Ki Pulse to Samurai Style. He replies, "Though Ki Pulse is a trademark mechanic in the Nioh series, we couldn't simply reuse it. We needed something ninja-like that would stand out. Part of why Ninja Style has the Mist action is because Samurai Style has Ki Pulse. The style didn't have Mist at first, but it was created in order to give it a play style just as distinctive as Ki Pulse."</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/15/n1-1757980540586.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While the original name for Ki Pulse comes from a kendo term, Mist, or Kasumi in Japanese, is meant to bring to mind the speed and cloning abilities of a ninja. "I promise we didn't take it from Dead or Alive's Kasumi," Yasuda said with a laugh, referring to the name of a ninja character from the series. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But while Dead or Alive references would be a bit too much to expect in Nioh 3, Ninja Gaiden 4 is in development. Could we see some elements from that series in the game? We ask Yasuda if we'll be able to use Ninja Gaiden-like techniques such as Izuna Drop. He responds promisingly, saying that "We'll look into creating the sort of action that fans of both series will enjoy." That said, it could be possible that such techniques or abilities are different from what we've seen in Ninja Gaiden.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/15/n2-1757980620187.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">"There have already been Ninja Gaiden references in the Nioh series, such as in DLC,” says Yasuda. “This time we've gone so far as to add Ninja Style, and I think that players will be excited to see some of its elements given that Ninja Gaiden 4 is on the horizon.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We expect these to be more like Easter eggs, so there's no telling if we'll be getting any major news announcements in the future about Ninja Gaiden elements in the game. They may even be put into the final game as surprises, so we're looking forward to checking the final game with a fine-tooth comb.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Look out for more exclusive Nioh 3 coverage during this month's IGN First, including our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nioh-3-exclusive-takeda-shingen-boss-reveal-gameplay-ign-first">exclusive boss battle</a> featuring the Tiger of Kai, Takeda Shingen! </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Yuichi Shigeta is a freelance writer for IGN Japan.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft has confirmed the Xbox Game Pass September 2025 Wave 1 lineup of titles, which is headlined by beloved indie game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hades">Hades</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But first, available today, is Roadcraft, where you operate a fleet of authentic construction vehicles to restore roads and repair bridges. It's available on Xbox Game Pass Standard and Ultimate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tomorrow, September 17, brings a flurry of titles to Xbox Game Pass Standard subscribers, which Ultimate owners will already have access to. These include Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 (the one from 2023, not 2011), roguelite tabletop-style role-player For the King 2, and the Game Preview version of city builder Overthrown.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Also available tomorrow, September 17, is Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor, a single-player survival shooter spin-off. It's available on Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just a day later, September 18 brings the Xbox Series X/S version of Frostpunk 2 to Game Pass Ultimate, after its previous release on PC. This post-apocalyptic snow-ridden survival game is perfect for the chillier and, frankly, more depressing months. It's twinned with open-world physics sandbox Wobbly Life, which arrives for PC and Xbox Series X/S on the same day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This month's main attraction, Hades, turns up at the end of this week on September 19. Hades will likely need little introduction, though if you're yet to play this godly roguelike, the game's upcoming fifth anniversary will see it join Xbox Game Pass across Standard, PC and Ultimate tiers. Have at it!</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And that's not all — Microsoft has packed the end of September with a further set of Game Pass arrivals, including PC strategy game Endless Legend 2 on September 22, co-op action roguelike Sworn on September 23, and Peppa Pig: World Adventures (yes, that's the one which stars and is also dedicated to the late Queen Elizabeth II) on September 25.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">September 25 is also when role-playing game fans get a chance to play Visions of Mana through Game Pass, whether you're a Standard, PC or Ultimate subscriber. The end of the month is then rounded out by isometric adventure classic Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light on September 30. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, a sneak peek into October, which will bring the day-one launch of narrative adventure Sopa — Tale of the Stolen Potato on October 7, and a trio of additional games for Xbox Game Pass Core members.

                <p>Palworld developer Pocketpair has announced that the game will leave early access and launch its 1.0 version in 2026. Additionally, the studio teased that while the bulk of the team is working on updates, improvements, and more content for Palworld, the company also has smaller teams at work on new games.</p><h2><strong>Cleanup</strong></h2><p>Palworld 1.0 isn't launching sooner because Pocketpair is spending time now working on "cleanup" for the existing game.</p><p>"Beyond just adding new content, there is a lot of clean up that needs to be done before Palworld can exit early access. It's no secret that Palworld has a lot of quirks and jank, and we want to take the time to properly address those before releasing the game," the developer said. "We think taking the time now to fix those problems will ultimately lead to a better game."</p><div data-embed-type="html"><blockquote><div dir="ltr"><p>📢About Palworld Ver. 1.0</p><p>Hello everyone.<br>Palworld will officially release (Ver. 1.0) in 2026.</p><p>We are currently developing a massive amount of content for this milestone, and also planning some surprises for the rest of 2025.</p><p>Please watch the video below for more details: <a href="https://t.co/rpP5gmLtjs" rel="nofollow  ">pic.twitter.com/rpP5gmLtjs</a></p></div>  — Palworld (@Palworld_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Palworld_EN/status/1967755319418724713?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 16, 2025</a></blockquote>


  






  </div><p>Pocketpair will remain mostly quiet for the remainder of 2025 as these efforts are underway, the studio said, while also cautioning fans that the Winter 2025 update won't be as big as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/major-palworld-update-feybreak-is-arriving-on-december-23/1100-6528456/" data-ref-id="1100-6528456">Feybreak update in December 2024.</a></p><p>The studio went on to say that it has a "few surprises" planned for the Winter 2025 update for Palworld and that people should know that Pocketpair is "not slowing down or scaling back--quite the opposite."</p><h2><strong>Palworld 1.0</strong></h2><p>For the 1.0 release of Palworld, Pocketpair said fans can expect a "truly massive amount of content," and it's going to take time to get it all ready for release.</p><p>"Rather than rushing it, we believe that laying the right foundation now will lead to a better game in the end," the developer said, adding that it will reveal sneak peeks at some of the 1.0 content relatively soon.</p><p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20current%20state,closer%20to%20the%20official%20release.%E2%80%9D" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Palworld Steam early access FAQ</a> states that the price of the game might increase before 1.0. Right now, Palworld is discounted from $30 to $22.50, a deal that runs through September 22.</p><h2>New games</h2><p>Pocketpair's biggest and best-known game is, of course, Palworld, and the company plans to continue to grow and evolve the game over time. Simultaneously, the studio is plotting what may come next.</p><p>"As the company grows, we continue to experiment with other ideas for games," the developer said. There are "several smaller teams" inside Pocketpair working on new game ideas that "hopefully" turn into read products, the developer said, adding that more information about these efforts will come soon.</p><p>This is separate from Pocketpair's new Pocketpair Publishing division that seeks to help fund and market games from other studios.</p><h2><strong>Palworld history</strong></h2><p>Palworld launched in January 2024 for Xbox and PC, quickly becoming a massive hit, thanks in part to its inclusion with Xbox Game Pass. The game was a fast success, reaching millions of sales and installs, but the launch was marred with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amid-plagiarism-accusations-palworld-ceo-asks-people-to-stop-harassing-devs/1100-6520522/" data-ref-id="1100-6520522">controversy over plagiarism claims and other concerns.</a> The game bears a striking resemblance to Pokemon, and The Pokemon Company and Nintendo teamed up to sue Pocketpair, not for copyright infringement as some expected, but rather patent infringement claims.</p><p>Pocketpair subsequently made big changes to Palworld, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-update-adds-big-change-to-avoid-disruptions-amid-nintendo-patent-lawsuit/1100-6531394/" data-ref-id="1100-6531394">removing Pal Spheres</a>--monster-catching items that were very similar to Poke Balls--and the ability to glide with a Pal. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-dev-says-it-was-a-depressing-day-when-nintendo-sued/1100-6530182/">Speaking about the ongoing lawsuit</a> earlier this year, community manager John Buckley said it was a "very depressing day" for the studio when it got sued.</p><p>Palworld later launched on PS5 in September 2024 and came to Mac in March 2025.

                <p>KPop Demon Hunters, the hit animated film from Sony Pictures, is reportedly making its way into Fortnite, according to well-known leakers SpushFNBR and Loolo. The film, which combines KPop stardom with supernatural action, follows a fictional girl group called Huntr/x--idols by day, demon slayers by night. With songs performed by real-world KPop artists, the movie quickly became a cultural phenomenon, dominating music charts and becoming the most-watched original film in Netflix history.</p><p>While Epic Games has yet to confirm the crossover, the most likely additions to the game could be new dance emotes based on the film's choreographed musical numbers. Maybe even throw in some of The Saja Boys' Soda Pop routine, as it went viral over the summer.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4568922-kpopdemonhunters_prores422hq_sdr_2ch_20250424.01_04_39_22.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568922" data-ratio="0.41875" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4568922-kpopdemonhunters_prores422hq_sdr_2ch_20250424.01_04_39_22.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568922"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Netflix</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4568922-kpopdemonhunters_prores422hq_sdr_2ch_20250424.01_04_39_22.jpg"></figure><p>Character skins based on the three members of Huntr/x are also a strong possibility. In the film, Rumi, Zoey, and Mira all have distinctive fashion and stylized weapons. Fortnite could easily include their fits from the introductory number "Done, Done, Done" to their more detailed outfits like they had in "Golden" (see above).</p><p>This potential collaboration would add KPop Demon Hunters to Fortnite's growing list of music-related crossovers. Previous collaborations have included in-game concerts and cosmetics featuring artists like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sabrina-carpenter-is-inspiring-fortnite-players-to-dance-not-fight/1100-6530729/" data-ref-id="1100-6530729">Sabrina Carpenter</a>, Ariana Grande, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-festival-will-exclusively-debut-the-weeknds-new-popular-music-video/1100-6521121/" data-ref-id="1100-6521121">The Weeknd</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bts-concert-kicks-off-in-fortnite-tonight/1100-6482420/" data-ref-id="1100-6482420">KPop group BTS</a>. Given the global success of the film and the ongoing popularity of KPop--and the mega success of the movie--this crossover could become one of Fortnite's most popular music-themed events yet.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Developer Pocketpair has announced that its hit creature-catching open-world survival game,<a href="https://gameinformer.com/2024/02/22/what-is-palworld-the-new-pokemon-with-guns-survival-game-everyones-playing" target="_blank">&nbsp;Palworld,&nbsp;</a>is finally launching out of Early Access and into version 1.0 in 2026. Palworld has been available in Early Access since January 2024, and centers on catching Pokémon-esque critters called Pals, which you can equip with guns to battle other monsters while aiding players in farming and crafting.&nbsp;</p><p>In a developer update video, Pocketpair promises that a “massive amount of content” is being planned for the 1.0 update. However, the studio also acknowledges it wants to clean up Palworld’s remaining technical bugs before it hits 1.0. &nbsp;</p><p>As such, the studio says the rest of 2025 will be “a little quiet from us” as it focuses on preparing the game for its full launch. Because cleaning up the game will be its primary focus, Pocketpair says its Winter update won’t be as big as last year’s Feybreak Island was, but stresses development will not slow down or scale back when it launches in full.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tEVIBHP37eM"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tEVIBHP37eM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The 1.0 announcement comes amidst an <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-sue-palworld-developer-pocketpair">ongoing lawsuit with Nintendo</a>, which began last September. The lawsuit, filed by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company, accuses Pocketpair of infringing on several patent rights.</p><p>Pocketpair publicly shared three specific patents from the lawsuit on its <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20241108">website</a>, revealing they were registered after Palworld’s EA launch and were likely done to target the game specifically. These patents cover systems for capturing characters in a virtual space, an aiming system for deploying capture items, and rideable characters. Nintendo and The Pokémon Company seek payments of 5 million yen (plus late payment damages) each. Pocketpair stated it aimed to “assert our position in this case through future legal proceedings.”</p>

<p>Since launching into Early Access, Palworld has received five major updates introducing new Pals, raid battles, &nbsp;an <a href="https://gameinformer.com/news/2024/04/10/palworld-arena-is-a-pvp-arena-that-allows-you-to-fight-other-players">arena mode</a>, new landmasses like Feybreak and the island of Sakurajima, new factions, and even a crossover with Terraria. Pocketpair has also introduced many quality-of-life improvements and mechanics, such as cross-play.</p><p>Palworld is currently on sale for 25 percent off for a limited time on Steam. Palworld took the world by storm when it first launched into Early Access on Steam and Xbox Series X/S in January 2024, amassing over 25 million players within its first month of availability and becoming the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/news/2024/01/31/palworld-had-the-biggest-third-party-xbox-game-pass-launch-ever">third-biggest launch on Xbox Game Pass</a> at the time.

            <p>
Alex Hernandez, the actor behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> protagonist Jacob Diaz, feared he may never work again following the game's disastrous reception.
</p>
<p>
Build A Rocket Boy's game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-launches-with-myriad-of-glitches-and-issues-as-developer-promises-performance-update">launched to major criticism due to its glitches and bugs</a>, not to mention shallow gameplay. Yet with his face on the game's cover art, Hernandez is intrinsically linked to the game.
</p>
<p>
"It's a difficult thing to spend two-and-a-half years on a project that you’re really proud of and you're proud of your contribution to it," said Hernandez on the latest <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/mindseye-actor-alex-hernandez-thought-might-never-work-in-a-game-again-after-disastrous-launch/">FRVR Podcast</a>. "And I only had positive experiences working on it. The people I was working with, I was proud for them, of them, I wanted it to be a success for them just as much for myself."
</p>

<p>
He continued: "Just the response… I was like, 'I might never work in a game again'. Because one of the caveats of being the face on the box is that people, rightly or wrongly, will associate all of their opinions and, more importantly their emotions, about this game with my face," he said.
</p>
<p>
Still, Hernandez admits players are entitled to their opinions on the game, despite being on the receiving end of extreme vitriol.
</p>
<p>
"Gamers are a unique species, and I am one of them, where the attachment to the experience and the product is so strong, the feelings are so strong," he said, "and the internet is an anonymous place where people will share things they would never share to your face, ever, even if they actually hated it… they just wouldn't look you in the face and say, 'everyone who worked on this game deserved to die. This is f**king awful, these guys are idiots'. No one would ever say that to your face. And, I think, at the same time, you're entitled to that."
</p>
<p>
Previously, Hernandez provided the voice and likeness for Lincoln Clay in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mafia-iii">Mafia 3</a>, another game with a poor reception at launch. 
</p>
<p>
"I'm not a superstitious man, but I can't help but have some kind of Spidey Sense, like, 'Is it just me?' Do I have like the opposite of the golden touch, like the sh*t-brown touch, everything I touch turns to poop?" he joked.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/despite-layoffs-build-a-rocket-boy-releases-mindseye-update-4-and-promises-its-committed-to-enhancing-the-gameplay-experience">Build A Rocket Boy has continued to update the game since</a>, and promised it's "committed" to enhancing the gameplay experience.
</p>
<p>
Still, the disastrous launch has put the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-launch-what-we-didnt-hope-for-says-io-interactive-ceo-as-publishing-future-in-question">future of publisher IOI Partners into question</a>. "So, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> will publish our own games internally," said IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak. "IOI Partners? That remains to be seen."
</p>
<p>"Although it shows some early promise, MindsEye is sunk by a ridiculous story, inconsistent writing, poorly designed mission scenarios, and utterly atrocious combat," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-review">MindsEye review</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Xbox has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/16/xbox-game-pass-september-2025-wave-2/">announced</a> the games getting added to Xbox Game Pass for the second half of September 2025, and following up from the first half, it's even more strong indie titles with Hades and Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor among the over a dozen games being added, starting today.</p>



<p>Hades re-enters the subscription service just ahead of <a href="https://wccftech.com/hades-ii-launches-on-pc-and-nintendo-switch-this-month/">Hades II launching into 1.0 on September 25</a>, giving players a chance to dive back into the first game before the first sequel that developer Supergiant has ever made hits its full release.</p>



<p>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor is the Deep Rock Galactic spin-off auto-shooter from Funday Games that's published by Ghost Ship's publishing arm. Like Hades II, <a href="https://wccftech.com/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-releases-out-of-early-access-in-september/">Survivor is launching out of early access</a> this month, and it'll be available on Xbox Game Pass day one.</p>



<p>Other notable titles coming for the rest of the month include Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, Frostpunk 2, Visions of Mana, and Sworn. There's also a game preview for Endless Legends II that'll be available on PC.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of games coming to Xbox Game Pass for the rest of the month:</p>



<ul>
<li>Roadcraft - September 16 - Cloud, Xbox Series X/S</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III - September 17 - Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S</li>



<li>For the King II - September 17 - Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S</li>



<li>Overthrown (Game Preview) - September 17 - Xbox Series X/S</li>



<li>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor - September 17 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S</li>



<li>Frostpunk 2 - September 18 - Cloud, Xbox Series X/S</li>



<li>Wobbly Life - September 18 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S</li>



<li>Hades - September 19 - Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC</li>



<li>Endless Legend 2 (Game Preview) - September 22 - PC</li>



<li>Sworn - September 23 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S</li>



<li>Peppa Pig: World Adventures - September 25 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S</li>



<li>Visions of Mana - September 25 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S</li>



<li>Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light - September 30 - Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC</li>
</ul>



<p>And, as always, with games entering the service, there are games leaving. This time, it's a swell of Ninja Gaiden titles, with Ninja Gaiden Sigma, Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2, and Ninja Gaiden 3 Razor's Edge all leaving the service, alongside Terra Invicta. They'll all be gone as of September 30, 2025.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-phantasmal-flames-mega-evolution-charizard-2000626018</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon%E2%80%99s-phantasmal-flames-cards-sell-out-rapidly-now-listed-on-ebay-for-silly-prices.1299243/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Pokémon cards. If it ain’t a story about <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/14/target-removes-trading-cards-from-stores-after-violent-incident-with-gun.html">sudden acts of intimidation and threats of violence</a> over them, then it’s probably one about scalpers and reselling. Thankfully, no one got hurt (physically) this time as the Mega Evolution Phantasmal Flames Elite Trainer Box (ETB), Booster Display Box, and Booster Bundle all sold out during their pre-order sale yesterday, with significant amounts of them going to folks who have no interest in actually using them to play the game. And they went <i>fast</i>. Some fans were lucky enough to still get through and lay claim to sets of their own, but the sting of seeing exorbitant listings on reselling sites still sucks.</p> <p>Expected to arrive on November 14, 2025, pre-orders for the latest <i>Pokémon </i>card game expansion went up <a href="https://x.com/PokemonRestocks/status/1967620548051218478">yesterday, September 15, 2025</a>, and, predictably, were sold out within 15 minutes (<a href="https://www.thegamer.com/pokemon-tcg-phantasmal-flames-etbs-ebay-for-extortionate-prices/">h/t <i>The Gamer</i></a>). And no, these very pretty-looking cards will not be finding homes with eager fans hoping to add them to their collections. Sadly, scalpers have filled eBay with pre-order listings for the new cards. Some are set at around normal prices, but a significant number of these listings are selling the cards for five times the retail price, hovering around $300, if not more in some cases.</p> <p>Scalpers didn’t soak up all the fun, however. On social media, many are <a href="https://x.com/ReyGambino_/status/1967626696045269047">celebrating a win</a> with <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/camyoin.bsky.social/post/3lyven5lodk2x">screenshots of successful pre-orders</a> of the new cards. That said, others ran into queue issues, getting bounced after only waiting for a short time, or in some cases, <a href="https://x.com/texasboy1060569/status/1967620858714992652">making it to checkout</a>, only to be bounced back in line. Others who made it to checkout were <a href="https://x.com/ChrisMulea96895/status/1967622801319424323">greeted by a mysterious “Error 17”</a> that then sent them back into the queue. Others hopelessly suffered as <a href="https://x.com/josejmurillo/status/1967624598754939237">they got bounced around in line</a> after multiple captcha checks to validate whether they were human or not.</p> <p>Adorned with a healthy splash of color, clearly the new Mega Charizard X ex is one of the main appeals of the new cards, along with Mega Gengar. I’m also really digging the moody, dark card sleeves. Shame that so few people will be buying them at normal prices any time soon.</p>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>At the beginning of the week, streamer and voice actor CDawg launched a <a href="https://canvas.cdawgva.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Canvas </a>page--an interactive pixel-based artboard that communities can contribute towards, which CDawg runs annually. Now, Neuro-Sama and her creator <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/vedal987" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vedal987</a> have declared "war" on CDawg's Canvas, rallying their community to flood the board with Neuro-Sama-related artwork.</p><p>Neuro is an AI-powered VTuber, utilizing an impressive large language model with rapid response times, and the ability to read her own Twitch chat to directly respond to viewers. She currently holds the record for the largest Twitch Hype Train of all time, reaching level 111 with 84,904 subscriptions and 1,201,225 bits gifted to Vedal's channel during a "subathon" event in December 2024.</p><p>Shortly after the Canvas launched, CDawg, real name Connor, and his community set to work adding artwork of him, his best friend Ironmouse, and other streamers including Lord Aethelstan and Nyanners. As soon as Neuro-Sama's community became aware though, things changed. Fast.</p><p>Neuro-Sama's community, known as The Swarm, created a faction on the Canvas which, at the time of writing, has more than 9,000 members. Connor's own community faction consists of just under 3,000 members. The Swarm immediately began placing artwork of Neuro and her sister Evil, as well as her creator Vedal, mother Anny, and other associated streamers and content creators. By the time Connor woke up the following morning, the Canvas had been consumed with Neuro-related content.</p><p>During a stream on September 15, Neuro-Sama declared "war" on CDawg. Despite thinking Connor is a "pretty cool guy, although I'm not a fan of his hair," Neuro insisted she wanted The Swarm to "win." She also said, "100% Canvas is the minimum I would be satisfied with. I would like you to hold the line, please." Vedal agreed, saying, "That's the aim. This morning there was an attack. As far as I understand, a bunch of different streamers banded together to destroy our art, and this is what it looked like." Streamers, when given specific permissions from the Canvas owner, can get powerups including bombs, which wipe out large areas of the Canvas when faction members contribute to increasing its size. As a result, large areas of pixel art were completely removed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4568893-vedal%26neurogotowar%2Ccdawgexposed_highlights4-8screenshot.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568893" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4568893-vedal%26neurogotowar%2Ccdawgexposed_highlights4-8screenshot.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568893"></a><figcaption>Neuro-Sama observes the attacks from CDawg's community.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4568893-vedal%26neurogotowar%2Ccdawgexposed_highlights4-8screenshot.jpg"></figure><p>Over the following few hours, Vedal created a large template with the aim of consuming the majority of the Canvas. That template was quickly filled in by The Swarm, leaving a strong message to Connor and his community--"There is no Canvas that we do not answer. There is no Pixel that we betray. We are The Swarm." In fact, when Neuro requested help from her community to fill the Canvas, so many people attempted to join that the Canvas servers crashed, with many unable to access the site.</p><p>Neuro-Sama didn't want to take responsibility for the server crash, so decided to pin the issues on Connor. She doctored a (very obviously fake) screenshot of Connor claiming he had deliberately allocated just 8GB of RAM to the server. She then published this "evidence" as a webpage, which you can still see live on <a href="https://vedal.ai/cdawg_scam" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Vedal's website</a>. "Just remember, the next time you see a 'down server,' it's probably because CDawg is up to his old anti-Swarm tricks. This is only the beginning - expect more revelations soon," she signed off.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4568898-vedal-neuro-cdawg.png" data-ref-id="1300-4568898" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4568898-vedal-neuro-cdawg.png" data-ref-id="1300-4568898"></a><figcaption>Neuro posted an exposure document about CDawg.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4568898-vedal-neuro-cdawg.png"></figure><p>It's important to note that Neuro and Vedal <em>do</em> have a goal in mind here. They've promised to hold back on their takeover of the Canvas if Connor hands over his stream key--the unique identifier used in OBS to link the software to a Twitch channel. This means that Neuro-Sama could, if she wanted to, stream via Connor's channel in a collaboration that has never happened before.</p><p>In a final interaction, Neuro-Sama and Connor spoke on a Discord call for the first time, with Connor immediately upsetting her--"I've never talked to a clanker before, this is my first time." Neuro set about her negotiations immediately, asking for his stream key. When asked what she could offer for Connor's stream key, she suggested a game of rock, paper, scissors, which didn't go too well since Connor just waited for Neuro's answer before responding. In a final act of desperation, Neuro-Sama asked Connor for a dinner date...four times.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxlDKFE1tgs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gxlDKFE1tgs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As it stands, Connor's stream key remains with him, The Swarm has agreed to help some other streamers get their artwork on the Canvas, and the site remains live until September 20. Will Neuro-Sama win the war she's declared, or will Connor successfully recruit enough streamers to take control back?</p><p>Of course, all of the bartering and negotiations are done in friendly jest, so this article also serves as a reminder to be kind on the internet, even if you belong to opposing factions.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="captioned-content" data-testid="featured-image"><p><span>Image by Kateryna via Adobe Stock.</span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Concerns over the negative impact of generative AI are spreading among game developers. According to new data from the Game Developer Collective, developers are four times more likely to say generative AI technology will negatively impact the quality of games than they were a year ago. It's a rising concern from a community already wary of the technology due to its intense energy usage and lingering questions over the ethics and legality of training data.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The statistics—gathered by our peers at Omdia by surveying members of the Game Developer Collective panel—shows a 13 percent increase in the number of developers concerned over product quality. The number rose from 34 percent in 2024 to 47 percent in 2025. Fewer developers expressed positivity about the technology, dipping from an already-scant 17 percent in 2024 to 11 percent in 2025.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The number of respondents who said they were "neutral" on the topic or thought it would have no impact on quality also decreased.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We reached out to experts across the game industry to quiz them on the shift, casting a wide net to look at the topic from different backgrounds. Necrosoft Games founder and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1900250/Demonschool/">Demonschool</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> game director Brandon Sheffield argued the technology is part of a growing trend of companies "sanding off the edges" of games as an art form. "I'm not just talking about high-minded ideas…I'm talking about something as mechanics-oriented as 'what's a good jump' or 'what does a good assault rifle feel like?'" AI's tendency to replicate content from its training data is the primary weakness Sheffield is concerned with.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/are-unreasonable-investor-expectations-the-cause-of-poor-video-game-market-conditions-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Are 'unreasonable investor expectations' the cause of poor video game market conditions?</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Games using [genAI] will be more generic, even if that's not immediately discernible to a player."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.hiddendoor.co/">Hidden Door</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> CEO and founder Hilary Mason—herself a developer experienced with machine learning and genAI—expressed a similar sentiment. "Large Language Models (LLMs) are </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>aspirationally</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> mid," she said, saying that the economic pressure of the games business could incentivize some studios to crank out "mediocre or even slop games" without "care and polish."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">King's College senior lecturer </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.possibilityspace.org/">Mike Cook</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> suggested that the shift in perception may not be about the assessment of the tools, but a judgment on the companies using them. "There was a perception that companies didn't really want to use it, and that the tools weren't reliable."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"What we've seen over the past twelve months…is that a lot of companies are using these tools despite their problems and despite the public backlash," he continued. "I suspect a lot more developers are facing situations where they're being asked to make do with AI outputs as 'good enough,' especially when the industry continues to get squeezed and more people lose their jobs."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Can AI toolmakers win over game developers?">Can AI toolmakers win over game developers?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If AI toolmakers want to get back in developers' good graces, they might want to lean into the technology's flaws instead of handwaving them away.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://gamesfund.vc/">The Games Fund</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> founder and managing partner Ilya Eremeev (who began his career as a 3D artist, informing his team's decision to invest in Layer.ai) agreed that exposing players to AI-generated content runs the risk driving down perceptions of quality. But he said this trend also shows generative AI is being used in the wrong fields. "There is a lot of unnecessary labor in asset variations, retopology, rigging, localization, QA, code assistance, even design research," he said, arguing that AI can "dramatically speed things up."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He's sour on the idea of a "text-to-game" pipeline like the kind Electronic Arts </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-desperately-wants-investors-to-know-it-s-on-the-generative-ai-bandwagon">showed off in its 2024 presentation to investors</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. "Describing complex systems in natural language is often harder than building them. You either end up with very abstract results or waste more time than you save."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Mason's betting that generative AI has a purpose in making "new kinds" of games—though she makes a more modest pitch for Hidden Door's interactive roleplaying platform, which generates tabletop-like roleplaying prompts that echoes an author's prose. "It's an old game style, now possible in a new form," she said. She and Eremeev both suggested that discoverability tools on game platforms will play a large role in shaping players' views on AI in games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For companies who want their workers to eagerly adopt AI tools—maybe you'd benefit by not "forcing" them on your workers. Cook and Sheffield both echoed with this idea, with the King's College lecturer pointing out that the game industry "doesn't have a good track record of making decisions based on what's best for a game, or listening to feedback from their employees."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Forcing things on people has never really yielded amazing results," Sheffield quipped.
