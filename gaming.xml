            <p>From Software game difficulty chat <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shadow-of-the-erdtrees-mixed-steam-reviews-paint-a-different-picture-to-the-critical-reception">is in full swing</a> following the release of Elden Ring's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> DLC, but cannier Soulslikers such as myself and <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/what-are-hidetaka-miyazakis-favorite-fromsoftware-games-now-that-elden-ring-is-finished-dark-souls-and-bloodborne-left-a-very-big-impression-the-president-says/">GR</a>’s Hirun Cryer are already leaping and bounding ahead to the next Stage of Review Discourse: which From Software game is bestest? Here to settle the matter once and for all until the next time we post about it is company president Hidetaka Miyazaki.</p><!--more-->
<p>Asked by <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/elden-ring-getting-patch-with-new-hairstyles-for-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc/">CNET</a> to say which of the From Software games he’s worked on is his “favourite child”, Miyazaki correctly answered “first Dark Souls and Bloodborne”. Truly, the perfect reply. Interviewer David Lumb has presumably now retired from journalism, for there are no more worlds to conquer. The only way it would be better is if Miyazaki had added "which is coming to PC soon". <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/souls-devs-fromsoftware-also-want-bloodborne-on-pc-even-if-the-games-own-director-cant-admit-it">He's definitely up for a Bloodborne PC port</a>, musing earlier this month that “any game like that, it'd be nice to have an opportunity for more players to be able to experience that and relive this relic of the past.” The onus is on Bloodborne's publisher Sony, it seems, to give the project the greenlight.</p>
<p>Ever the diplomat, Miyazaki qualified his initial response with "of course, I love them all". But grotty old Lordran and Yharnam are the gameworlds he appears to look back on mostly fondly, inasmuch as anybody looks fondly at a Souls game, even if they haven't reached quite as many people as From's later works. "On a very personal level, I would say, first Dark Souls and Bloodborne left a very big impression on me,” Miyazaki told CNET. "As a company, Elden Ring put us in a completely different league, so that was a huge milestone for the company."</p>
<p>As for From Software games Miyazaki hasn't worked on, he singled out 1995 action-RPG King's Field 2 for praise (a little surprisingly, he didn’t mention Armored Core). I like King’s Field games myself. There’s a rich vein of latter-day retro indie dungeon crawlers inspired by the series - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lunacid-is-lo-fi-first-person-dungeon-skulking-done-right">Lunacid is a recent doozie</a>.</p>
<p>We haven’t ever published a list of the best From Software games, possibly because doing so would be akin to making a shark-diving cage out of mackerel, but we have done a list of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-soulslike-games">the best Soulslikes</a>. It was last refreshed in 2021, and could probably do with an update.</p>
<p>
I have been trying to think of an elegant way to mention that Miyazaki has an actual child <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-hidetaka-miyazaki-reflects-on-how-becoming-a-father-might-influence-his-future-games">and that being a father might influence his future games</a>, but I am now tired and irritable. Please just pretend I have cleverly inserted this bit into one of the paragraphs above.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dungeons-dragons-to-finally-let-players-drink-potions-as-a-bonus-action-in-one-dd<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Dungeons &amp; Dragons players will finally be able to drink potions as a Bonus Action in One D&amp;D, meaning the popular homebrew and Baldur's Gate 3 mechanic is becoming an official rule in the next iteration of the game.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/dungeons-dragons-makes-popular-homebrew-rule-official-in-2024-core-rulebooks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Comic Book</a>, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPBnLlqV0Z0&amp;t=71s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> from D&amp;D game designers Jeremy Crawford and Chris Perkins walked fans through some changes to the Player's Handbook, which will be refreshed for the first time in more than a decade in 2024, including the long-requested ability to have a cheeky heal as a Bonus Action.</p><p>Crawford specifically said that health potions can be used as a Bonus Action in One D&amp;D — <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dungeons-dragons-announces-updated-core-rulebook-release-dates-but-not-all-of-them-arrive-in-2024">which arrives beginning September 17, 2024 with the Player's Handbook</a> but won't launch fully until the Dungeon Master's Guide and Monster Manual arrive on November 12, 2024 and February 18, 2025 respectively — but it's unclear if the rule change will apply to other potions too.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024 Monster Manual Cover Slideshow</h3></div></output><p>As a health potion can theoretically be drank at the same speed as any other kind of potion, however, it would certainly make sense for the Bonus Action rule to affect all of the magic smoothies. The current 5th Edition of D&amp;D forces players to use a potion as a full Action, meaning players miss a turn of doing potentially more interesting things if they need to heal.</p><p>Using potions as a Bonus Action has long been a popular mechanic in players' homebrew or home rules though, and even Baldur's Gate 3, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-review">the hit D&amp;D video game which follows most of 5th Edition's rules</a>, let players drink them as a Bonus Action.</p><p>The release of the updated rules, meaning the transition from 5th Edition to One D&amp;D, comes alongside the tabletop role-playing game's 50th anniversary. Publisher Wizards of the Coast announced <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wizkids-is-celebrating-dds-50th-anniversary-with-its-biggest-miniature-booster-set-ever">the biggest miniature booster set ever to celebrate</a>, and has been <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-first-look-at-the-dungeons-dragons-2024-monster-manual-cover">slowly but surely sharing tidbits of information</a> about <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dungeons-dragons-2024-core-rulebooks-are-up-for-preorder">the new set of core rulebooks</a>.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-on-xbox-series-s-can-run-at-60fps-thanks-to-mods<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Bethesda <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-gets-big-update-that-adds-detailed-surface-maps-ship-decoration-and-60fps-on-xbox-series-x">recently added a 60 frames per second option to Starfield on Xbox Series X</a> but left the Xbox Series S version out in the cold. Thankfully modders have stepped in to save the day, as they so often do.</p><p>As verified by the tech wizards at <a href="https://www.patreon.com/digitalfoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Foundry</a>, Starfield on the less-powerful Xbox Series S can now be played at 30fps thanks to mods (search for ‘Series S' under the mod menu). Using mods, Digital Foundry found Starfield on Xbox Series S hit a baseline of 60fps even on challenging GPU-limited areas of the game,  such as heavily populated cities, with some less-demanding areas rising to 90fps.</p><p>However, it’s worth noting that playing Starfield on Xbox Series S in this way drops the resolution to 1280x720 from 1600x900. "We seem to be finding the limits of FSR 2 upscaling quality, with some ugly artefacting," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-starfield-mods-unlock-frame-rate-on-xbox-series-s-so-how-well-does-it-run" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Foundry reports</a>. "Even so, you are getting a viable performance mode — it's just that the trades are far more obvious to the eye than the Series X version."</p><p>The inevitable next question is that if modders can get Starfield running at 60fps, why hasn’t Bethesda? Digital Foundry said the reduced resolution that comes with such improved frame-rate performance means “Starfield simply isn't a particularly attractive game at this point.” Bethesda, Digital Foundry suggests, may not feel this trade-off presents Starfield in as good a light as it requires.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Starfield May Update Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Starfield’s performance on Xbox Series S may not be front of mind for Bethesda in any case. Last week, Bethesda Game Studios chief Todd Howard responded to a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-starfield-steam-reviews-plunge-to-mostly-negative-todd-howard-responds-to-paid-mods-backlash">backlash over Starfield paid mods</a>, confirming the developer would take a look at its pricing model for Creations content.</p><p>On Steam, Starfield’s recent user review rating fell to ‘Mostly Negative’ after disgruntled players hit out at Bethesda for charging $7 for a single Starfield mission. The second mission of the recently released Trackers Alliance is only available as a Starfield Creation and costs $7, or 700 credits.</p><p>Looking further ahead, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-isnt-walking-away-from-starfield-its-planning-a-second-story-expansion-for-year-2"><u>Howard has confirmed plans to release a second story expansion for Starfield</u></a> following this year’s Shattered Space, and commented on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-teaser-is-now-6-years-old-and-even-todd-howard-paused-to-say-oh-wow-that-has-been-a-while"><u>the long development of The Elder Scrolls 6</u></a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-reveals-diablo-4-season-5-ptr-details-including-new-questline-requirement<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Blizzard has announced plans to run a second Public Test Realm for action role-playing game <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>, this time for Season 5.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/diablo-4s-first-public-test-realm-lets-players-try-season-4-early">Diablo 4’s first PTR</a> ran in April and let Battle.net PC players play the well-received Season 4 early. Similarly, the Season 5 PTR gives fans a taste of what’s to come June 25 to July 2 for players with a PC Battle.net account only.</p><p>“The purpose of the PTR is to test updates and features before the launch of Season 5,” Blizzard said in a <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24111472/the-diablo-iv-season-5-ptr-what-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>. “Then we’ll make adjustments to Season 5 using your feedback before it goes live for everyone. The feedback we receive helps us to fine-tune balance changes, eliminate bugs, and create the best experience possible. Having a PTR gives us a chance to test new systems, and we’re grateful for your time spent playing.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>As for what to expect from the PTR, there’s a new questline that takes place after the events of the main questline and presumably leads into the events of Diablo 4’s first expansion, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred">Vessel of Hatred</a>, which launches October 8, 2024. “Season 5 features a new story where enemies are cut-down, alliances shift, and unlikely friends emerge from the shadows,” Blizzard teased.</p><p>It’s worth noting that you’ll need to head to Hawezar in World Tier 3 and “investigate a disturbance amongst the cityfolk there” in order to trigger the questline. The World Tier 3 requirement means you’ll need to have completed the campaign and crossed over from World Tier 2 by defeating that difficulty’s Cathedral of Light capstone.</p><p>Completing this new questline lets you battle the Infernal Hordes, the new gameplay activity coming with Season 5. Infernal Hordes features seemingly endless waves of enemies, which grow more powerful with each passing day. It sounds very much like a Diablo 4 take on a wave-based rogue-lite: the Infernal Hordes is an activity where you slay hordes while earning Burning Aether to unlock powerful weapons and rewards.</p><p>Elsewhere, Season 5 introduces new Legendaries, Uniques, and items. There are quality-of-life updates to endgame bosses, too. Diablo 4 Season 5, which does not have a name yet, launches August 6.</p><h2>Diablo 4 Season 5 PTR Patch Notes:</h2><p><strong>1.5.0 PTR Build #55051 (PC)</strong> - June 25, 2024</p><h2>GAME UPDATES</h2><h3>New Items and Tempering Recipes</h3>All Classes<p><strong>Tempering Recipes</strong></p><p>Worldly Finesse - Offensive</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>+X% Critical Strike Damage</li><li>+X% Vulnerable Damage</li><li>+X% Overpower Damage</li><li>+X% Ultimate Damage</li></ul>Barbarian<p><strong>Unique Items</strong></p><p>Unbroken Chain - Amulet</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Casting Steel Grasp reduces Iron Maelstrom’s Cooldown by 5-10 seconds.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chained-together-steam-surprise-hit</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/chained-together-is-steams-latest-surprise-hit.909819/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chained-together-steam-surprise-hit<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sometimes, the stars align and a game manages to rack up tens of thousands of players on Steam, seemingly from out of nowhere. Such is the case with&nbsp;<em>Chained Together</em>, a new platformer that asks you to climb out of the depths of hell.</p>
<p>Since its release last Wednesday,&nbsp;<em>Chained Together&nbsp;</em>has been rocketing up the Steam charts, and unlike <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/banana-steam-popular">definitely-not-a-scam "game"&nbsp;<em>Banana</em></a>, this one doesn't seem to be offering any kind of financial incentive to its players.</p>
<p>Instead, it's a physics platformer that's all about climbing out of hell, and it can be tackled either by yourself or with up to three friends in local multiplayer. If you ask me, though, it rather seems like&nbsp;<em>Chained Together&nbsp;</em>has been built around co-op.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/chained-together-steam-success-hanging.jpg?itok=NFFxZ6bz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/chained-together-steam-success-hanging.jpg?itok=9ELkVgR_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Chained Together</em>&nbsp;is rocketing up the Steam charts.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not entirely clear what's behind&nbsp;<em>Chained Together</em>'s meteoric (and entirely appropriate, given the subject matter) rise, but absent any kind of artificial boost, a number of factors could be at play here.</p>
<p>The game has a pretty low price point; at time of writing, it's available for $4.49, which is only a 10% discount on its usual price of $4.99. That's a solid price for any group of friends looking to take a punt on a new co-op experience.</p>
<p>It's also a simple, straightforward game in the vein of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/human-fall-flat-2-delayed"><em>Human: Fall Flat</em></a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/popular-indie-game-only-up-suddenly-removed-from-steam"><em>Only Up!</em></a>, and it doesn't appear to offer any kind of microtransactions or live-service elements, which may well be refreshing for those looking for a multiplayer game devoid of such things.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/chained-together-steam-success-falling.jpg?itok=detJPyg5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/chained-together-steam-success-falling.jpg?itok=jxbaF0af 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This kind of moment is probably why&nbsp;<em>Chained Together&nbsp;</em>is popular.</figcaption></figure><p>There is also, of course, the fact that&nbsp;<em>Chained Together&nbsp;</em>is a pretty good game to stream; it's got plenty of laugh-out-loud emergent moments, and going by <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2567870/Chained_Together/#app_reviews_hash" rel="noopener" target="_blank">its Steam reviews</a>, it's also a great way to get angry at your friends, which never fails to shift a few copies.</p>
<p>If you'd like to try&nbsp;<em>Chained Together</em>, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2567870/Chained_Together/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">grab it right now on PC via Steam</a>. It's only a few dollars, so it's almost certainly worth an hour or two of your time at the very least.</p>

        <p>"Today is a very important day for the effective enforcement of the DMA."</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>EU regulators have opened a new investigation following claims <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eu-takes-aim-at-apple-google-meta-non-compliance">Apple is not complying with EU rules</a>.</p>
<p>The European Commission – which started <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eu-takes-aim-at-apple-google-meta-non-compliance">investigating Apple's alleged non-compliance</a> back in March – has accused Apple of breaching its Digital Markets Act, meaning Apple could face a fine of up to 10 percent of the firm's global annual revenue. That may not sound like much, but when you consider that Apple generates £301bn ($383bn) a year, that's a sizeable punishment.</p>
<p>Any further offences could even see the fine increased to 20 percent.</p>

<p>Apple, Google owner Alphabet, and Facebook owner Meta are all being investigated by the EU under the Digital Market Act (DMA), key legislation designed to keep competition fair.</p>
<p>Both Apple and Google are being investigated over their mobile app stores, which the EU previously ordered must allow greater competition on their respective platforms.</p>
<p>As Tom explained for us at the time, Apple's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-returning-to-ios-says-epic-as-apple-agrees-to-alternative-app-marketplaces-in-eu">previously-announced solution to satisfy DMA rules has drawn fire</a> over its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-returning-to-ios-says-epic-as-apple-agrees-to-alternative-app-marketplaces-in-eu">fees and limits, which make launching games or apps outside of the App Store costly</a> – something long-time legal rival Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney called "hot garbage".</p>
<p>"Today is a very important day for the effective enforcement of the DMA," Margrethe Vestager, the EU's competition and digital chief, said in a statement earlier today (thanks, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/06/24/business/apple-eu-competition-rules/index.html?Date=20240624">CNN</a>), which also confirmed the regulatory body has also opened another investigation into Apple's new contractual requirements that require app developers to pay a "core technology fee" each time their app is installed.</p>
<p>"Steering is key to ensure that app developers are less dependent on gatekeepers' app stores and for consumers to be aware of better offers."</p>
<p>In response, Apple said: "All developers doing business in the EU on the App Store have the opportunity to utilise the capabilities that we have introduced, including the ability to direct app users to the web to complete purchases at a very competitive rate. As we have done routinely, we will continue to listen and engage with the European Commission."</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24182763/house-dragon-king-aegon-2-joffrey-game-thrones</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/house-of-the-dragon%E2%80%99s-king-aegon-is-far-more-than-just-joffrey-2-0.909810/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24182763/house-dragon-king-aegon-2-joffrey-game-thrones<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="EaVGEn">The Game of Thrones TV universe has had its fair share of childish, petulant, fair-haired kings. And at first, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24178745/house-dragon-season-2-premiere-review-episode-1"><em>House of the Dragon</em> season 2</a><em>’</em>s addition to that lineup, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23379127/house-dragon-kids-are-screwed">Aegon II Targaryen</a> (Tom Glynn-Carney), seemed like he could end up just a slightly less evil rehash of Joffrey, like the series taking its foot off the gas and playing the hits. But in the first two episodes of the season, Aegon has already proven that there’s plenty to separate him from <em>Game of Thrones</em>’ greatest villain. </p>
<p id="H1cccH">[<strong>Ed. note:</strong> This post contains spoilers for <em>House of the Dragon</em> season 2. It also contains spoilers for <em>Game of Thrones</em>, if that’s somehow a concern for you.]</p>
<p id="pYjAPg">Joffrey is, by necessity, a pretty simple character. In <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game-of-thrones/24157742/game-thrones-finale-anniversary-next-show-like">season 2 of <em>Game of Thrones</em></a>, when he first really steps into power, the show is introducing half a dozen new factions and twice as many characters. Joffrey’s immature, cruel, violent, impulsive, and generally thoughtless in most of his actions. That isn’t to say his character is bad because it’s simple, just that he fills in a very necessary role. The season is a maelstrom of morally gray characters with Joffrey in the center to give the audience an anchor, like a measuring point to judge the comparative evil of every other king; when everyone else is morally complex, it helps to have a villain to orient ourselves around. </p>
<p id="u3LBUJ">But like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23419041/house-dragon-aemond-targaryen-death-dragon-sapphire-eye-villain-meaning">most of the characters in <em>House of the Dragon</em></a>, Aegon is far more nuanced than his closest <em>Game of Thrones</em> counterpart. </p>

<p id="oLGouw">In his earliest moments this season, Aegon gets a similar setup. We see him at a small council meeting, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23405183/house-dragon-review-episode-9-alicent-aegon-rhaenys">acting like a brash child</a>, pushing for war in an instant, furious that anyone would <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game-of-thrones/23289499/house-of-the-dragon-aegon-conqueror-prophecy-ice-and-fire-game-of-thrones">question his claim to the throne</a>. But his humanity doesn’t take long to emerge. During his time seeing to the concerns of his lowborn subjects, it becomes clear that Aegon wants to be a good king. He tries to loosen the livestock tax on farmers, only to be told that it would cripple his dragons, and he clearly wants to give the smiths the money they request. Neither of these, as Otto points out, are particularly good decisions. But they’re empathetic and understandable all the same, in a way that Joffrey never could be. </p>
<p id="2EZ72g">In that way, Aegon is more affected by tragedy than Joffrey ever was. In the second episode of the season, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24178649/house-dragon-season-2-daemon-assassins-prince-blood-cheese">after the death of his son and heir</a>, Aegon is broken in a more nuanced way than <em>Game of Thrones</em> characters ever have been, at least on screen. We see him impulsively call for war and Rhaenyra’s head; we see him kill the former Goldcloak that was caught attempting to ferry his son’s head out of King’s Landing; and we see him cry alone in his room in one of the saddest television scenes in recent memory, made even more poignant by the fact that Alicent simply walks out of the room when she sees this, too sad herself to even confront her son. </p>

<p id="ZTK0L3">It’s all the impetuous restlessness that we saw from Aegon during the first episode’s small council meetings, but manifesting itself though grief instead of boredom. Aegon’s spoiled life distances him from tragedy but doesn’t immunize him to it. So when it comes for him, too, he has no idea what to do with those feelings. It’s deeply, inescapably, and devastatingly human, all in ways that Joffrey never needed to be. And that’s exactly what <em>House of the Dragon</em> needs, with its tangled web of familial conflicts, misunderstandings, and backhanded power grabs. </p>
<p id="zTw6lX">Unsurprisingly, the best summary for the kind of king Aegon II Targaryen is, and how different he is from Joffrey, comes from <em>Game of Thrones</em> itself. In the original series’ second season, Tyrion tells Joffrey that Westeros has had vicious kings and idiot kings, but that Joffrey might be its first vicious idiot king. In Tyrion’s parlance, Aegon is an idiot king. Not the insulting kind of idiot that Tyrion intended, but a tragic kind of idiot. In another time, Aegon could have had a fine enough reign, and that fact alone creates a massive gulf between him and Joffrey, and makes Aegon an even sadder character in the process. </p>

<p>Season 5 of Diablo 4 <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24111472/the-diablo-iv-season-5-ptr-what-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">is approaching</a>, and with it comes a brand new survival mode for players to experience. </p>



<p>Known as Infernal Hordes, this new mode becomes unlocked after completing the new questline for the season.</p>



<p>“The Infernal Hordes is an activity where you slay hordes while earning Burning Aether to unlock powerful weapons and rewards,” Blizzard says. “Successfully slay the Hordes and you’ll be able to fight the powerful Fell Council.”</p>



<p>As far as how the mode works, Infernal Hordes sees enemies attack in 90-second waves. After each 90-second wave, you’ll get to decide between three Infernal Offers before the next wave starts. These Infernal Offers will give you options such as increasing the difficulty for more rewards, increasing overall damage, and more. They can also stack as you move through your run.</p>



<p>As you fight, you’ll earn Burning Aether to spend at the end of a run.</p>



<p>“Successfully slay all waves in the Tier you are attempting to advance to the Well of Hatred then battle the Fell Council,” Blizzard continued. “Upon defeating the Fell Council, spend your Burning Aether on Spoils of Hell.”</p>



<p>Spoils of Hell offers four different options after a successful run: Spoils of Equipment, Spoils of Materials, Spoils of Gold, and Spoils of Greater Equipment.</p>



<p>In addition to the Infernal Hordes mode, Season 5 will feature new weapons and items, updates to endgame bosses, and more. Currently, Season 5 content is available in the public test realm (PTR) that runs from June 25 – July 2. To join the PTR, you simply have to select the “Public Test Realm” <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24111472/the-diablo-iv-season-5-ptr-what-you-need-to-know#PTR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">option from the dropdown</a> above the play button in Battle.net. </p>

Or if you want to show off, you could find a novel way to play it, just like Twitch streamer Perrikaryal has done by using the power of her mind to make progress.</p><p>Working her way through the Elden Ring DLC--which is quickly earning a reputation for being incredibly challenging--Perrikaryal has already managed to beat several of the early bosses with pure brain power, like those <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/at-least-one-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-boss-is-just-two-guys-in-a-costume/1100-6524453/">two guys in a Chinese dragon costume</a>.

                <p>Wipeout first launched for PlayStation and DOS in 1995, and it quickly became a cult classic. The series would go on to earn multiple sequels on PlayStation platforms over the next two decades, all of which followed the same futuristic racing blueprint laid out by the original. If you're a dedicated fan of the series, you'll likely be interested in the upcoming <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0500021767?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wipeout Futurism: The Graphic Archives</a></strong>--a hardcover volume that details the game's creation and how the series played a role in shaping the racing genre. The book releases on <strong>November 12</strong>, and preorders are seeing a slight discount ahead of its launch.</p><div title="6524456 - Wipeout Futurism Preorder" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2470" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6524456 - Wipeout Futurism Preorder" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0500021767?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/0500021767?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0500021767?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Wipeout Futurism: The Graphic Archives</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0500021767?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/0500021767?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0500021767?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$56 (was $60)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>Wipeout Futurism: The Graphic Archives contains 320 pages filled with commentary, concept art, and additional designs related to Wipeout.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/total-war-warhammer-3-patch-510</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/total-war-warhammer-3-patch-5-1-0-adds-free-legendary-hero-and-more.909771/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/total-war-warhammer-3-patch-510<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Creative Assembly and Sega have released the patch notes for&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer 3&nbsp;</em>Patch 5.1.0, which brings a new Legendary Hero, a new game mode to enjoy, and more.</p>
<p>The patch, which is scheduled to arrive tomorrow, introduces the free Legendary Hero Karanak, the Hound of Vengeance. He can stop enemy Lords or Heroes from moving, and he can summon Flesh Hounds to fight alongside him, too.</p>
<p>When enemy units are routing, Karanak gains extra melee attack damage and weapon strength, and he can also reveal hidden units within his radius, so there's no hiding from this tracking hound.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/total-war-warhammer-3-patch-5.1.0-conquest-mode.jpg?itok=GRQ4eVLw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/total-war-warhammer-3-patch-5.1.0-conquest-mode.jpg?itok=jGfQYTl3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Total War: Warhammer&nbsp;</em>Patch 5.1.0 also brings a new game mode to enjoy.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as Karanak, you can also look forward to a brand new game mode in the form of Conquest, a competitive battle mode that uses the same rules as Land Battle but adds a central capture point to fight over.</p>
<p>To achieve victory in this mode, you'll have to hold that capture point and generate 500 victory tickets. Don't worry, though; this mode won't be replacing Land Battles, as it's primarily designed for multiplayer.</p>
<p>Conquest will utilize 42 "repurposed Land Battle maps" picked by competitive&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer 3&nbsp;</em>players. Those maps will include Alpine Ridge, Cliff of Beasts, and Mortis Wastes, among others.</p>
<p>Other changes in the patch's rather extensive patch notes include adding an AI option to Domination Mode (as in a CPU player, not generative AI), as well as the addition of Daemons of Chaos to ranked play and much more.</p>

Grab a cup of coffee, though, because it's a pretty long list.</p>
<p>These patch notes arrive just a couple of days after&nbsp;<em>Total War: Rome 2&nbsp;</em>programmer Julian McKinlay released a lengthy statement detailing his experiences at Creative Assembly during the development of that project.</p>

There's a training mode, where you can practice your special moves and see things like hit boxes for each character.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Fortnite Reload Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Fortnite Reload also features a twist that seems to take inspiration from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/">Call of Duty: Warzone</a>--players who are eliminated can reboot, provided that at least one of their fellow squadmates is alive. But there are some limitations. Here's how rebooting works in Fortnite Reload:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Once eliminated, players can choose to start their reboot timer rather than waiting for a squadmate to revive them.</li><li dir="ltr">Reboot timers start off at 30 seconds, but can scale up to 40 seconds as the match progresses.</li><li dir="ltr">Once the timer runs out, the player is rebooted.</li><li dir="ltr">Surviving teammates can shave time off a downed player's reboot timer by downing and eliminating opponents--or wiping an entire squad.</li><li dir="ltr">Near the end of the match, reboots become unavailable, something players may wish to keep this in mind when playing.</li><li dir="ltr">If all players in a squad are taken out, there's no coming back, and that squad will be permanently eliminated.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Additionally, Fortnite Reload includes a series of intro quests that can earn players up to 20,000 XP each. Complete some of these quests will earn you the following rewards:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">3 quests completed: Digital Dogfight Contrail</li><li dir="ltr">6 quests completed: Pool Cubes Wrap</li><li dir="ltr">9 quests completed: NaNa Bath Back Bling</li><li dir="ltr">Earn a Victory Royale: The Rezzbrella Glider</li></ul><p>To access Fortnite Reload, log in to Fortnite and select the "Fortnite Reload" tile from the Discover screen. Then squad up with some friends--or some random teammates--and prepare to fight your way to victory.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/real-life-final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-aetheryte-appears-in-london.909729/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-aetheryte-london<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has unveiled a real-life Aetheryte Crystal landmark at London's King's Cross St. Pancras train station to celebrate the upcoming launch of&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail</em>.</p>
<p>The newest expansion for the critically-acclaimed MMO is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-expansion-release-date-collectors-edition">launching on July 2nd</a>, and to commemorate its impending release, a life-size Aetheryte Crystal has been placed outside one of central London's busiest train stations.</p>
<p>If you're in the area, you'll be able to visit the crystal until 11pm tonight, after which point it'll be removed. Make sure you don't try to teleport to it after that, and don't set it as your free return location; who knows where you might end up?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-real-life-aetheryte.jpg?itok=26dHDl4n 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-real-life-aetheryte.jpg?itok=Ir8e0oSU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It'd be pretty convenient if you could just teleport to this thing, eh?</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, this Aetheryte doesn't have the same properties as the ones in&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, so you won't just be able to teleport to it by paying a nominal fee (or, indeed, for free if it's set as your return point).</p>
<p>At least, I assume that's the case. It may be that this crystal does indeed contain the secrets of teleportation, and that our lowly species has yet to discover the way to unlock those secrets. For now, though, I'd stick to taking the trains.</p>
<p>This crystal business is all in aid of publicizing the release of&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail</em>, the latest expansion for Square Enix's much-loved MMORPG&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>.</p>
<p><em>Dawntrail&nbsp;</em>is set to be the start of a new saga for&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>after 2021's&nbsp;<em>Endwalker&nbsp;</em>concluded a ten-year saga with a suitably emotional bang, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-update-655-screenshots-tease-dawntrail-story-with-pictomancer-krile">the story for this one</a> seems like it'll be decidedly more light-hearted and adventure-filled.</p>

<p>As well as telling a new story,&nbsp;<em>Dawntrail&nbsp;</em>will also raise&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>'s level cap to 100, and it'll introduce two new DPS jobs: the magical <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-expansion-dawntrail-reveals-new-job-pictomancer-withg-spectacular">Pictomancer</a> and the melee-focused <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-reveal-recap-new-viper-job-ffxi-crossover-tons-of-content">Viper</a>.</p>
<p><em>Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail&nbsp;</em>launches on July 2nd across PC, PlayStation, and Xbox Series X|S. If you tune into Twitch streams marked with the Viewer Rewards tag between then and July 29th, you <a href="https://x.com/FF_XIV_EN/status/1805171513626329329" rel="noopener" target="_blank">could earn an adorable Chocorpokkur mount</a>, so make sure to keep your eye out for that.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/marvel-crisis-protocol-black-panther-shang-chi-and-more-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We're back with another new set review for the fast-paced, kinetic&nbsp;<em>Marvel: Crisis Protocol</em>, a tabletop miniatures skirmish game from Atomic Mass Games featuring your favorite characters from across the Marvel universe. We most recently covered <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/marvel-crisis-protocol-professor-x-nightcrawler-and-more-review">a large batch releases, including Professor X, Nightcrawler, and more</a>. Now we're checking out two new releases: first up is Black Panther, Chosen of Bast &amp; Namor, The Sub-Mariner, and from there we move onto Shang-Chi &amp; Silver Sable -- read on for our review!</p>
<h2><em>Marvel: Crisis Protocol&nbsp;</em>- Black Panther, Chosen of Bast &amp; Namor, The Sub-Mariner</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-black-panther-and-namor.jpg?itok=y1eUYLWr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-black-panther-and-namor.jpg?itok=MvV9f3FS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>From Wakanda to Atlantis, heroes come together!</figcaption></figure><p>First let's look Black Panther, Chosen of Bast - who brings his hand-to-hand combat skills to the table in a new version of the character (the game has previously released the character as: <a href="https://www.atomicmassgames.com/character/black-panther-killmonger/">Black Panther</a>, this new "Chosen of Bast" moniker makes this an entirely different version of the character).</p>
<h3>Black Panther, Chosen of Bast</h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-black-panther-chosen-of-bast.jpg?itok=x3qW7V7l 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-black-panther-chosen-of-bast.jpg?itok=9YBoQxin 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The addition of Wallcrawler really emphasizes his mobility!</figcaption></figure><p>As we can see from the above stat card, this version of the character is a 3 Threat character (the previous incarnation is 4 threat) and features a balanced defense. Retaining the very fun "Pounce" ability the former version of the card also had, he's now kitted out with the very powerful Spirit Predator ability.</p>
<p>I found myself immediately drawn to that big, nasty attack - where you're rolling 7 dice and (with a little luck) then able to unleash your Builder for free. In one of my games, this lead to him almost one-shotting Mysterio. It's these kinds of interactions that make me fall more in love with&nbsp;<em>Marvel: Crisis Protocol</em>&nbsp;every day -- it truly is just a chance to play What If? on a grand scale.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-black-panther.jpg?itok=REaiw9pI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-black-panther.jpg?itok=jZILFF4s 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ready to strike!</figcaption></figure><p>Playing with Black Panther, I was impressed with his ability to navigate the battlefield now that he has Wallcrawler. With a larger base, in my playthrough I had him constantly moving around the board, throwing himself with Pounce, and getting the jump on objectives with Insight of the Ancients.</p>
<p>Statistics-wise I feel like he's fairly middle-of-the-road for a 3 cost character (though I do like that all of his attacks are Mystic-based), but that doesn't mean he's not an incredibly useful addition to your crew. Use him (obviously) with other Wakanda affiliated characters to great effectiveness, or throw him in an Avengers lineup and just lean on him to get stuck in and deal serious damage.</p>
<h3>Namor, the Sub-Mariner</h3>
<p>Next up in the pack, making his&nbsp;<em>Marvel: Crisis Protocol&nbsp;</em>debut, is the isolationist king himself Namor, the Sub-Mariner. Let's go ahead and take the plunge (sorry) and check out his stat card.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-namor-the-sub-mariner.jpg?itok=wui7s9tZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-namor-the-sub-mariner.jpg?itok=0qRnidWD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Who knew Namor was a Gem Bearer!?</figcaption></figure><p>As his 5-threat power level suggests, Namor, the Sub-Mariner is a seriously powerful character. While play testing Namor, the number one thing that was immediately obvious was how shockingly fast this character is. He's on a large base, has flight, and he's got a Move Long, which means he was absolutely zipping across the battlefield the entire game.</p>
<p>With 7 Health on both sides of his card, he's also incredibly sturdy, allows nearby allies (and himself) to reroll 1 die in their attack and defense rolls, gains extra Power,&nbsp;<em>and&nbsp;</em>his attacks and effects can't be reduced or prevented by superpowers or Team Tactic Cards. So why does all of that matter? Because that's all passive bonuses that don't require an energy spend.</p>
<p>This means that - even setting aside his attacks for a moment (which we'll get to shortly) - he's a highly mobile, <em>extremely</em>&nbsp;hard-hitting model who can even slightly, passively buff his teammates.&nbsp;</p>

His builder attack allows him to Advance toward his target distance Small, but his Armies of the Deep attack is the real stunner here. As you can see from the card above, he either calls a swarm of crabs, an octopus, or a wave of turtles to crush the foe. That's... hilarious? In my playtesting, he sent a devastating Wave of Turtles crashing into Doc Ock (missed opportunity not sending the octopus after him, but I had a game to win here).</p>
<p>All in all, for sheer maneuverability,&nbsp;I think Namor deserves some serious consideration for your list. He hits hard, is a sturdy fighter, and has multiple abilities that allow him to either stay on his opponents or do a bit of zone control by pushing them away.</p>
<h2><em>Marvel: Crisis Protocol&nbsp;</em>- Shang-Chi &amp; Silver Sable</h2>

<p>I'm&nbsp;<em>always</em>&nbsp;a big fan of more on-the-ground heroes and villains, so I knew this character pack would be right in my wheelhouse. Let's start with Shang-Chi!</p>
<h3>Shang-Chi</h3>
<figure role="group"><figcaption>We're showing both sides of Shang-Chi's card here because of how his attacks subtly change between his healthy and injured side.</figcaption></figure><p>He's exactly what you'd expect from a character who's main form of super-heroism comes from on-the-ground, fist-to-fist combat, though the Range 3 on his Rising Phoenix Kick has a much nicer range than I could have hoped for with this martial artist. His "Supreme Martial Artist" ability, where he counts blanks as successes when defending a close-combat fight, is super thematic.</p>
<p>And while all of his attacks, on both sides of his card (we love new attacks opening up on an Injured card side), are potent and powerful - I think the main takeaway for how to play Shang-Chi is to use him to really manage hot objective areas.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-shang-chi.jpg?itok=N59-KHP5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-shang-chi.jpg?itok=nQ30_lHv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Shang-Chi doesn't even need the rings to lay a hurt on his opponents.</figcaption></figure><p>I wouldn't necessarily lean on him to hold objectives, but he should constantly be pushing enemies out of range with moves like "Dragon Chases Its Tail" and "One Inch Punch." With his ability to sneak in little small moves, and push enemies around the board, it'll be hard to face off against him and stay put in one spot.</p>
<p>In other words, Shang-Chi is great at letting someone else hold objects while he ensures high-danger enemies aren't allowed to stick in and cause problems.</p>
<h3>Silver Sable</h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-silver-sable-card.jpg?itok=Sj-Ewf0W 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-silver-sable-card.jpg?itok=RGId5wJ0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Get comfy in your Sniper Nest and pick off your enemies.</figcaption></figure><p>For Silvija Sablinova, there are no radioactive spider bites to nurse, no exposure to gamma rays... nothing but a big, terrifying looking sniper rifle! And it's for this reason that this character is such a fun welcome to the game. I have to admit, I'm a sucker for long-range characters in&nbsp;<em>Marvel: Crisis Protocol</em>, and there aren't many out there with a Range 5.</p>
<p>Of all her special abilities here, for me - in my playtesting at least - it was all about the Sniper Nest and Headshot. Just build up her power, get her high up, and start cracking at enemies out in the open. Easy to pilot as a character, there's not a ton of complexity to Silver Sable, but she's so much fun to play.</p>
<p>I do wonder if she's worth the 4 threat, as Silver Sable feels like more of a 3 threat character, but with Shot Caller, and some of her tactics cards (which you should check out in depth on <a href="https://www.atomicmassgames.com/transmission/from-panel-to-play-silver-sable/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Atomic Mass site</a>), she can be a really potent addition to your team.</p>

<p>I think that both of these new character packs are really strong additions to the game. The new Black Panther is a very powerful striker, and Namor is so slippery on the battlefield he's a must-add for anyone running a S.H.I.E.L.D. list. And both Shang-Chi and Silver Sable are fun characters who do very different things.</p>
<p>It's always hard for me to give a sort of final thought roundup on miniatures when we're dealing with a collection of different ones, so what I really want to say in this space is: do these characters interest you? Do they feel like they'd be a good fit in your lists? Overall, for me, the most important thing about each of these four miniatures is that none of them feel boring.</p>
<p>Instead, each of these characters are rendered onto the tabletop in ways that feel true to their roots, the miniature designs look absolutely amazing, and each has the ability to create a fun, engrossing moment. I've always felt that you get the most interesting moments from non-core characters with&nbsp;<em>MCP</em>&nbsp;- Iron Man's great and all, but isn't it more interesting to lumber around the field as Arnim Zola?</p>
<p>That's how I feel about fielding Namor or Silver Sable, these are characters that are well-loved, but they haven't been MCU-ified to death (not that there's anything wrong with MCU, but it takes some of the mystique away from a character when we've lived with them in live action for years). So that's why I really love these packs - the characters are powerful, and shake up the world of the game a bit!</p>

  <p id="T4eTkV"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online/22381941/beginners-job-subscription-teleport-mount-shadowbringers-endwalker"><em>Final Fantasy 14</em></a>’s <em>Dawntrail </em>expansion is upon us, with the game going down for a <strong>48-hour maintenance</strong> ahead of its early access period.</p>
<p id="5wVwvm">While <em>Dawntrail </em>itself launches fully on July 2, players who pre-ordered the new expansion will be able to play it early on June 28 after the lengthy maintenance.</p>
<p id="OaI2sb">Below, we explain when <em>FFXIV Dawntrail</em> maintenance begins and what last-minute things you can do to ensure you’re all set for the expansion’s launch.</p>
<hr id="qsgp2D">
<h2 id="n3Ji6Z">
<strong>What time does </strong><em><strong>FFXIV </strong></em><strong>go down for maintenance?</strong>
</h2>
<p id="lNoIYf"><em>Final Fantasy 14</em> will go down for maintenance on <strong>Wednesday, June 26, </strong>at the following times and will be unavailable for 48 hours:</p>
<ul>
<li id="hRirtL">
<strong>2 a.m. PDT</strong> for the west coast of North America</li>
<li id="Prdg5A">
<strong>5 a.m. EDT</strong> for the east coast of North America</li>
<li id="ifpyl6">
<strong>10 a.m. BST </strong>for the U.K.</li>
<li id="XaeSfj">
<strong>11 a.m. CEST</strong> for western Europe/Paris</li>
<li id="TI0AFn">
<strong>6 p.m. JST</strong> for Japan/Tokyo</li>
<li id="GliPUK">
<strong>7 p.m. AEDT</strong> for Australia/Sydney</li>
</ul>
<p id="6uHLB9">That said, the game will come back up at the same time, but on <strong>Friday, June 28</strong>. You will only have access to <em>Dawntrail</em> content if you pre-ordered the expansion. </p>
<hr id="NWnzlD">
<h2 id="iRht83"><strong>What should I do before FFXIV Dawntrail maintenance?</strong></h2>
<p id="IDt6i0">Ahead of maintenance, there’s plenty of things you can do to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online/24167088/dawntrail-prepare-how-to-get-ready">prepare for <em>Dawntrail</em></a>. Outside of stuff we list in our guide, you should also make sure to <strong>put any gardening plots away</strong> so that your crops don’t wither — the timer for the crops will keep going, even during maintenance. You should also <strong>refresh your </strong><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24115574/how-to-get-a-house-apartment-lottery-wards-plots"><strong>housing timer</strong></a>, if you have a house. During <em>Endwalker</em>’s launch, you couldn’t enter your house due to extreme server congestion, so it’s best to reset that timer now before congestion possibly occurs.</p>
<p id="vrOOnL">If you plan on using a Fantasia to change into the newly added female Hrothgar, you should <strong>use you Fantasia before maintenance</strong>. You’ll also need to <strong>unequip everything</strong> before being able to Fantasia. Since you have to relog to actually change races, you’ll be able to change right away upon your first login after maintenance. (If the login queues and aforementioned congestion are as bad as they were during <em>Endwalker</em>, you will not want to relog for that Fantasia, as you may end up stuck in a login queue for hours.)</p>
<p id="ORAoAM">Last but not least, you should make sure to <strong>log off in a sanctuary</strong> (in a town or near an Aetheryte) to make sure you accumulate <strong>rested EXP</strong> — which is a 50% EXP bonus up until a certain amount.</p>

  <p id="ooDeLN">Horror comic fans will get a windfall this October with <em>Through Red Windows</em>, a new series from the combined and formidable talents of writer Ram V (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/2022/12/6/23488554/best-comics-2022-graphic-novels"><em>The Many Deaths of Laila Starr</em></a>, <em>Detective Comics</em>) and artist Joëlle Jones (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/2021/2/3/22244520/yara-flor-wonder-girl-woman-cw-brazilian"><em>Wonder Girl</em></a>, <em>Lady Killer</em>), published by Dstlry. </p>
<p id="uLK8LQ">“<em>Through Red Windows</em> has been an exercise in [sowing] discomfort,” Jones told Polygon via email.</p>
<p id="eQjlJ6">The series follows up-and-coming financier Athul Laal, who accepts an invitation to live in his plutocratic mentor’s 73-story Manhattan residence and office building. Then, as Jones put it, “chaos and viscera” ensue.</p>

<p id="90fm6i">Ram V said the series grew from his love of Edgar Allan Poe, and from making a lot of friends in the architecture department during college, which instilled in him a fascination for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7n7ylXPueYE">altered reality within highly designed spaces</a>. </p>
<p id="ycK7ge">“Psycho-geography has also been an ongoing obsession of my work,” Ram told Polygon via email. “The high-rise element of this story comes from there. I’d also been interested in telling a story that looked at wealth, old wealth as a sort of Eldritch Entity with eternal self-perpetuation as a motive. And I’d wanted to tell a story of the dehumanizing nature of modern day ambition, especially as I see it in the nouveau riche, Indian entrepreneur.”</p>
<p id="SM5r1i">“The business aesthetic is inherently harsh and desaturated; greys, whites, blacks, and navy blues set around right angles,” Jones said of her work on the series. “It’s incredibly austere. Having that contrast against the eldritch and supernatural has been a fantastic challenge and a lot of fun—it’s injecting chaos and viscera into a design that relies on uniformity and perfection. Hopefully you’ll never read another comic like it.”</p>
<p id="xBtv13">Jones shared two pages of strikingly colored interior art from the upcoming first issue. [<strong>Ed. note:</strong> The pages contain a depiction of suicide.]</p>

<p id="3bQcpe"><em>Through Red Windows </em>will be told in longer than usual 48-page installments, starting with <em>Through Red Windows</em> #1 this October, available for preorder or digital purchase <a href="https://dstlry.co/products/through-red-windows-1-jones-cover-a?_pos=1&amp;_sid=8d8ce118f&amp;_ss=r">direct from Dstlry</a>. Keep reading for the official summary of the first issue, and a look at the main and variant covers by Jones.</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="qHTRdl">When ailing Plutocrat, Harlan Roderick, invites his young protégé Athul Laal to live at Roderick Place in downtown Manhattan, what Athul believes this to be his first step into the inner circle of the world’s elite, soon turns into a living nightmare. Athul discovers that Harlan and his illness are inextricably connected to the 73-story building, in which, behind each door, lie secrets and monsters from both Harlan and Athul’s own lives.</p>
<p id="seWB3b">Laal’s ambition gets the better of him and the higher he climbs in the company (and the building!) the deeper and darker becomes the danger to his life….and maybe his soul.</p>
