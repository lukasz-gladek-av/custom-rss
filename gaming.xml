		<p>Nintendo has released a new video for The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, showing off the world and gameplay of the first mainline series game to feature a playable Zelda. The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is coming out for Nintendo Switch on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/18/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-lets-you-actually-play-as-zelda-this-september/">26th September 2024</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom – Traversing Hyrule Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DolGuwvAnfg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>With a focus on exploring this latest iteration of Hyrule and how Zelda can get around with her new summoning abilities, the video takes us to the searing heat of Gerudo Desert, and the village of Gerudo tribe, and the Jabul Waters, which plays host to both the Sea Zora and River Zora, who don’t always get along. Kakariko Village is at the base of Eldin Volcano, but this has been transformed by the weird rifts that kicked this adventure into gear, and you’ll have to figure out how to reach the home of the Gorons. And finally, the Faron Wetlands are all kinds of leafy and play home to the Deku.</p>
<p>Echoes of Wisdom will throw plenty of side quests your way, such as tryiing to held an elderly man cheer up his wife with a flying plant, save someone from being trapped up a wall, gathering up Cuccos, and dealing with a… a Tornado Ghost?</p>
<p>You’ll be able to zip around the world using Waypoints as fast travel nodes on the map, but Zelda will also be able to ride a horse and hop up and over obstacles. All you need is to learn the Carrot echo and you’ll be able to summon a horse wherever you are.</p>

<p>Smoothies take the cooking of Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom and blend them into something a bit lighter, as you can combine gathered items to make smoothie combos. Electro Apple mixed with Floral Nectar, for example. You can also use outfits and accessories to enhance Zelda’s abilities, like Zora flippers improving her swimming.</p>
<p>Another ability was also revealed, in addition to the Echo summoning. For larger obstacles, Tri will help you with the power of Bind. This latches any object to Zelda’s movement, from a huge boulder to a half-buried chest, and even to summoned echoes, if you want to have an impromptu spiky shield. You can also reverse bond to map Zelda’s movement to other creatures and objects, switching back and forth.</p>
<p>Echoes of Wiszom borrows the visual style of the Link’s Awakening remake, which was a real highlight from a few years ago, which was already rather delightful, but will make for a real change in the series by having Zelda be the main playable character, using magical abilities and her wits, as opposed to combat in order to get ahead.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/two-new-fairy-tail-games-take-on-deckbuilding-and-volleyball-soon.944997/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/two-new-fairy-tail-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Kodansha Creators' Lab has announced two brand new&nbsp;<em>Fairy Tail&nbsp;</em>games in collaboration with series creator Hiro Mashima, and they're both landing in the next month or two.</p>
<p>According to a press release, the collaboration between the two began when Mashima "said he wanted to have a&nbsp;<em>Fairy Tail&nbsp;</em>game made". Presumably, he's not counting the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/fairy-tail">RPG created by&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>developer Gust</a>.</p>
<p>First up,&nbsp;<em>Fairy Tail: Dungeons&nbsp;</em>is a deckbuilding roguelite that will feature five playable characters from the manga, each of whom will have their own special abilities. It'll tell an original story and will revolve around exploring dungeons, building synergies, and taking advantage of your characters' unique strengths.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fairy-tail-dungeons-combat.jpg?itok=b2ArHRao 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fairy-tail-dungeons-combat.jpg?itok=tn0CrtG4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fairy Tail: Dungeons&nbsp;</em>is a new roguelite heading your way later this month.</figcaption></figure><p>Launching on PC via Steam on August 26th,&nbsp;<em>Fairy Tail: Dungeons&nbsp;</em>is developed by ginolabo, the team behind&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/soulvars-review-biblical-demon-antivirus"><em>Soulvars</em></a>&nbsp;(which is also a deckbuilding RPG, so this appointment makes a lot of sense).</p>
<p>The second project to come from Mashima and the Kodansha Creators' Lab is&nbsp;<em>Fairy Tail: Beach Volleyball Havoc</em>, a rather unique-looking pixel art proposition that marries beach volleyball with fighting game mechanics.</p>
<p>You'll be playing volleyball as (and against) teams of&nbsp;<em>Fairy Tail&nbsp;</em>characters, and each time you score a point, your magical abilities will become more powerful, granting you access to more spells with greater power.</p>
<p><em>Beach Volleyball Havoc&nbsp;</em>will support up to four players, and you'll be able to play either in local multiplayer or via Steam Remote Play.</p>

<p>This one's taking a little longer to cook; it'll launch on September 16th.&nbsp;<em>Beach Volleyball Havoc&nbsp;</em>is being developed by tiny cactus studio, whose work you may know from&nbsp;<em>Super Glitter Rush&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Dimension Tripper Neptune: Top Nep</em>.</p>
<p>To commemorate the announcement of&nbsp;<em>Beach Volleyball Havoc</em>, a&nbsp;<em>Fairy Tail</em>-themed art contest is also being held, so if you fancy drawing&nbsp;<em>Fairy Tail&nbsp;</em>characters in beach attire, you can <a href="https://daysneo.com/award/fairytailbeachvolleyball.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">check the contest and its rules out here</a> (although it's in Japanese, it looks like it's open to anyone).</p>
<p><em>Fairy Tail: Dungeons&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305500/FAIRY_TAIL_DUNGEONS/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC via Steam</a> on August 26th, and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2116680/FAIRY_TAIL_Beach_Volleyball_Havoc/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">Beach Volleyball Havoc</a>&nbsp;</em>follows not long after on September 16th.</p>

            <p>Forthcoming action-RPG Phantom Blade Zero developer S-Game says that as it believes in "making our game accessible to everyone", it has not "ruled out any platforms".</p>
<p>Confirmation came via the studio itself, which took to social media to clarify its stance after several media outlets reported an unnamed developer <a href="https://gameplayscassi.com.br/noticias/ninguem-precisa-desta-plataforma-black-myth-wukong-e-phantom-blade-zero-nao-sao-exclusivos-do-playstation-mas-as-versoes-do-xbox-nao-sao-prioridade-dizem-desenvolvedores/82482/">said</a> "nobody needs Xbox".</p>

<p>S-Game has distanced itself from the comments, saying they do not represent "S-Game's values or culture".</p>

<p>"We want to clarify that these claimed statements do not represent S-Game’s values or culture, as we believe in making our game accessible to everyone and have not ruled out any platforms for Phantom Blade Zero.</p>
<p>"We are hard at work on both the development and publishing fronts to ensure that as many players as possible can enjoy our game at release and in the future."</p> <div>

<p>That's according to the game's director, Soulframe, who recently opened up about its world design.</p>
<p>"It's just like the old Souls games," Soulframe said at the time. "You move around and explore in a seamless map, it's just not a huge open-world map. But every region is connected together seamlessly."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>One, if not the most popular, mini-game seen in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth will be revamped for the third and final part of the trilogy, according to the game's director.</p>
<p>As reported on X/Twitter by <a href="https://x.com/neo_aoshi/status/1819841781204156672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1819841781204156672%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@neo_aoshi</a>, during a panel at the Otacon anime convention with producers and voice actors from the game, director Naoki Hamaguchi talked about the Queen's Blood mini-game, revealing that he has received many requests from fans regarding a real-life version of the card game. While he couldn't confirm one would be coming, he did reveal that a revamped version of the mini-game will be included in the third and final entry in the series.</p>
<p>The Final Fantasy series is no stranger to card mini-games like Triple Triad from the eighth entry in the series and Tetra Master from the ninth entry in the series, so the inclusion of Queen's Blood in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth was extremely welcome, although it wasn't possible to challenge the vast majority of NPCs like it was possible in Final Fantasy VIII. Hopefully, the revamped version of the mini-game will allow players to play more games against a bigger number of opponents than Rebirth.</p>
<p>The wealth of mini-games is only one of the things that defines the Final Fantasy VII Rebirth experience. You can learn more about the second entry in the series, currently available exclusively on PlayStation 5, by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/larian-studios-channel-from-hell-intro-video-reveals-upcoming-content/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/larianstudios/status/1820475850942210368" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a>, Baldur’s Gate 3 developer Larian Studios teased the intro video for its brand-new YouTube channel, “Larian: Channel From Hell.”</p>



<p>This anticipated YouTube channel now has an introductory video featuring host Aoife Wilson. It breaks down the content coming to Larian: Channel From Hell, as the studio expands its social presence.</p>



<p>Larian: Channel From Hell will include “regular streams and shows, featuring our development team, to patch explainers, unboxing videos and updates on what we’re currently up to.”</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Introducing Larian: Channel From Hell!" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EOVdwbRhHYM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The intro video elaborates that fans can also expect “behind the scenes footage” and documentary-style content. </p>



<p>Wilson also teases that Swen Vincke, founder and CEO of Larian Studios, will also make cameo appearances from time to time. </p>



<p>Vincke often interacts directly with fans. In March 2024, they also made it very clear that Larian is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/larian-studios-baldurs-gate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not planning any Baldur’s Gate 3 DLC</a> or a sequel. Though fans are disappointed, many praised the open communication.</p>



<p>In their own <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1820480224766963996" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a>, Vincke also teased Larian Studio’s new YouTube channel. They mentioned some of the glimpses seen in the intro video. That includes “loads and loads of fun” from smashing ice sculptures to “game celebrities catching fire.”</p>



<p>Although Larian Studios is working on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/larian-studios-is-working-on-two-new-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two new games</a>, moving beyond Baldur’s Gate 3, fans still await its major Patch 7 update. Larian <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-closed-beta-has-been-delayed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently delayed</a> the closed beta for Patch 7, originally expected in late July 2024. </p>

            <p>God of War studio Sony Santa Monica is developing its first new IP in over 20 years.</p>
<p>As spotted by a member of <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/according-to-a-developer-at-santa-monica-studio-the-studios-next-game-is-a-new-ip.943911/">ResetEra</a>, a developer at Sony Santa Monica mentioned they've been working at the studio "looking after the entire character development pipeline on their new IP".</p>

<p>In the "about" section of their <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/glaucolonghi/">LinkedIn profile</a>, a developer supervising character development said they were "thrilled to be back" at Santa Monica after a brief departure to work at Striking Distance and Unknown Worlds.</p>
<p>"Santa Monica Studios presented the opportunity of coming back as character supervisor, looking after the entire Character Development pipeline, on their new IP, so here I am, thrilled to be back, working again with the crew and pushing characters in video games together," the developer said.</p>
<p>As you no doubt expect, the dev stopped short of revealing what, exactly, the IP is or even what kind of characters they were developing</p>
<p>The studio's debut game was PS2 racer Kinetica in 2001, but since the first God of War in 2005 Sony Santa Monica's worked solely on that series (besides assisting development on other projects). A brand new franchise, then, is an intriguing prospect.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-launches-new-official-figurine-collection-with-aloy-varl-kratos-atreus-and-jin-sakai">Sony recently revealed a new range of figurines called "The Shapes Collection"</a> that includes characters from God of War Ragnarök, Horizon Forbidden West, and Ghost of Tsushima.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom might be a brand-new adventure, but the upcoming game brings back some well-known areas for fans to explore. A new trailer for the Switch exclusive shows off familiar spots like Gerudo Desert, Kakariko Village, and Hyrule Castle.</p><p dir="ltr">Focused on exploring Hyrule, the new Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom video highlights some of the major regions in the game. Gerudo Desert is "prone to frequent sandstorms," for instance, though there is an oasis where the princess can get some rest by creating a bed echo. There's also Kakariko Village within the Eldin Volcano area, a town that dates back to The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past on SNES.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DolGuwvAnfg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DolGuwvAnfg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">One intriguing plot point touched on in the new trailer is a conflict happening in Jabul Waters between the Sea Zora and River Zora tribes. Both groups seem friendly to Zelda, but not each other. Meanwhile, Deku scrubs can be found in the Faron Wetlands.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo noted that traversing the map in Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom will be made easier in two major ways. First off, waypoints are littered across the land, allowing for fast-travel by warping. Then, the princess can call horses by creating a carrot echo to ride across Hyrule. The steads can even trample over enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">Zelda won't just have horses to help her, either. The Bind ability seems integral to her adventure, letting the princess move massive objects while she runs around. This can also be used to pull treasures out of the ground or even reposition foes (maybe off of cliffs). Additionally, there's a reverse bond for Zelda to be transported by moving objects.</p><p dir="ltr">Last but not least, there are smoothie shops across Hyrule. Zelda can blend together different ingredients to create scrumptious drinks for her own benefit, such as replenishing hearts with a Mixed Milk Smoothie.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-starring-zelda-launches-september-26/1100-6524358/" data-ref-id="1100-6524358">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom was announced</a> not even two months ago at a Nintendo Direct. It will be the first mainline game in the franchise with Zelda as the protagonist, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-features-a-playable-link-according-to-esrb-rating/1100-6524962/" data-ref-id="1100-6524962">though an ESRB rating has mentioned Link is playable</a>.

Nintendo has released a new trailer highlighting some of the new powers she’ll have and all the places she’ll get to use them. </p><p>Princess Zelda will have the whole of Hyrule to explore in <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>. She’ll traverse the harsh landscape of the Gerudo Desert, the calming waters of Jabul, the jungles of the Faron Wetlands, and the scorching lava floes of Eldin Volcano. And to get around the wide world of Hyrule, Zelda will be able to summon a trusty steed to her side, just like Link.</p><p>Zelda’s got a couple of new powers that will aid her in her quest to save Hyrule from dangerous rifts that threaten to consume the land. In addition to being able to summon copies of creatures or objects called echoes, she’ll also be able to bind or reverse bond objects. With the bind power, Zelda will tie an object to her movement, letting her move giant obstacles or enemies out of her way. For reverse bond, Zelda herself will move along with the object, helping her get over big gaps or climb tall cliffs.</p><p>It’s a little more than a month before <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> comes out for Nintendo Switch owners. With the reveal of these new locations and powers, it seems like <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> will have an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/3/22959702/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-open-world-five-year-anniversary">open-world vibe</a> similar to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review"><em>Breath of the Wild</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As spotted <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/horror-movies/five-nights-at-freddys-sequel-starts-filming-in-october-matthew-lillard-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by GamesRadar</a>, film actor Matthew Lillard gave fans a major update during a new interview, teasing that filming on the Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 movie could begin in October 2024.</p>



<p>Lillard appeared on YouTube channel JayBee &amp; Milly for an interview, and briefly spoke about his availability. He stated that he’s doing a TV show right now and “doing FNAF in October.” </p>



<p>In the first film adaptation, Matthew Lillard portrayed William Afton. Five Nights at Freddy’s earned the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/five-nights-at-freddys-opening-weekend-is-the-biggest-for-a-live-action-video-game-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest opening weekend</a> for a live-action video game adaptation. So, Blumhouse naturally greenlit a 2025 release window for Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 in May 2024. </p>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://x.com/FNAF_ScottGames/status/1820217342489735365" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a>, FNAF_ScottGames also revealed a production image for the anticipated sequel. The post has fans speculating on the character under construction.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Fans identify the character as Toy Bonnie, opening the door for a lot of potential story beats. Toy Bonnie remains a fan favorite character, who originally appeared in the Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 video game. </p>



<p>The toy animatronics are beloved characters, and they are tied to crucial elements of the larger mythology. It’s unclear if Toy Bonnie and corresponding characters will appear in flashbacks, given the game series timeline.</p>



<p>The original Five Nights at Freddy’s movie did include a lot of fan service. However, it still took many creative liberties. </p>



<p>The update teasing Toy Bonnie shows a lot of progress on Five Nights at Freddy’s 2. Actor Josh Hutcherson previously said the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/five-nights-at-freddys-2-story-is-already-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">story was in development</a> back in January 2024. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-hyrule<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has released a brand new trailer for&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>, and it's showing off the game's version of the timeless land of Hyrule, as well as how you can get around it.</p>
<p>Titled "A Tour of Hyrule", the trailer describes&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>'s world as "a land of plentiful abundance" in which you'll discover "diverse regions" filled with "interesting people".</p>
<p>First, we get to see the iconic Gerudo Desert, which has made an appearance in several&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>games including <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time"><i>Ocarina of Time</i></a>,&nbsp;<em>Twilight Princess</em>, and, most recently,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-kingdom"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>. It returns here, complete with a town where you'll meet members of the Gerudo tribe.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-hyrule-gerudo-desert.jpg?itok=Q5yn7862 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-hyrule-gerudo-desert.jpg?itok=xCkm5paJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Gerudo Desert returns once again in&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>We're then introduced to Jabul Waters, an idyllic location that plays host to both the Sea Zora and the River Zora, who look vastly different but who both inhabit the water.</p>
<p>Eldin Volcano and Kakariko Village are also making a return, and naturally, Eldin is where you'll find the Gorons, as well as their favorite treat in the form of rock roast.</p>
<p>The final new area we're introduced to is the Faron Wetlands, a swampy area that is home to the Deku Scrubs, who are rumored to have a "voracious sweet tooth", according to the trailer. As you can see, you'll be well-served if you're hoping to spot classic&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>staples in&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>.</p>
<p>Following the new areas, we're then introduced to&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>'s quest log, which works similarly to&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-wild"><em>Breath of the Wild</em></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>'s, as well as its travel waypoints, which are fast travel points you can revisit once you've discovered them.</p>

<p>You'll also have access to a horse, which you can use to hop over small walls and send smaller enemies flying. You'll be able to summon it from anywhere in the overworld.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-announced">launching next month</a>, then you should check out the trailer in full. It also touches on new abilities, items you can equip, and the crafting-adjacent smoothie system, plus more.</p>
<p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>arrives <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/The-Legend-of-Zelda-Echoes-of-Wisdom-2590490.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">exclusively for Nintendo Switch</a> on September 26th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>
The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom continues to look brilliant in this latest trailer from Nintendo that gives you a whistlestop tour of its version of Hyrule. 
</p>
<p>
From Hyrule Castle to Gerudo Desert and Kakariko Village, the upcoming Switch game will let Zelda see all the sights, plus hang out with Gorons, Deku Scrubs and both flavours of Zora. 
</p>
<p>
As well as fast travel points, Zelda will also be able to explore on horseback to hop over small echoes. Just create a carrot "echo" - using your ability to conjur up objects you've seen previously - and your trusty steed will come running.

<p>
Other sections of the trailer gave a look at other new powers, such as Bind - the ability to make objects or enemies move as you do. It's handy for moving boulders, or even monsters, right off of cliffs. 
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, Reverse Bond lets you attach yourself to moving objects, including animals such as flying gulls or wall-climbing spiders, to explore further.
</p>
<p>
Cooking also appears to be present - of a kind - although here you'll be making smoothies. Business-orientated Deku Scrubs will let you blend ingredients you've collected for helpful boosts - such as giving resistance to elemental effects or recharging hearts.
</p>
<p>Ahead of the game's launch on 26th September, fans have been busy trying to work out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-react-to-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-reveal-with-timeline-speculation-and-adorable-artwork">where in the series' timeline Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> sits.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/creatures-of-ava-review-mystery-of-avatar-with-song-in-its-step<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Creatures of Ava</em> was a game that I went into expecting some fun animal collecting and puzzle solving, For the most part, that's what I got, but one major aspect of the game that I didn't expect to come away from was a shift in perspective about conservation, Climate Change, and how we always view it from human-kinds eyes.</p>
<p><em>Creatures of Ava</em> puts you in the shoes of Vic, an employee of the Aleph corporation, whose mission on the dying planet of Ava is to research the lifeforms that inhabit it, capture some to save them from the planet's destruction, and investigate the hostile 'Wither' that is infecting all life.</p>
<p>Early on in your adventure you meet Nim'ar, a member of the Naam race, who is investigating the ancient sites of Ava looking for information on how to stop the 'Wither' from continuing to take over the planet.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/creatures-of-ava-08.jpg?itok=fMjbQJJw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/creatures-of-ava-08.jpg?itok=r4m9DkMn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nim'ar is one of the Naam, a race that is able to hear the songs of the creatures and the planet itself</figcaption></figure><h2>Save The Creatures, Save Ava</h2>
<p>Through your journey, you won't just be working to preserve the flora and fauna of Ava from the Wither, but you'll also be investigating ancient ruins for Nim'ar. If you're already roaming the planet looking for different species, it can't hurt to also follow up on some leads of how it may have been combatted in the past.</p>
<p>As soon as I set foot on the planet of Ava my mind was drawn to parallels with the <em>Avatar </em>film franchise. Not only in the creation of a fantastical world filled with unique flora and fauna but also in the Naam race and the way they're a part of a hive mind with all other creatures and Ava itself.</p>
<p>It was a very interesting approach to the story, that Ava arriving had the best intentions but we are just humans showing up declaring that we'll save everyone without really understanding the problem or asking those on the planet if they even want to be saved.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/creatures-of-ava-11.jpg?itok=LXgpKjqt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/creatures-of-ava-11.jpg?itok=moRQzx9n 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Vic isn't just investigating ancient ruins, but also the ruins that her own company has left behind</figcaption></figure><p>As the story was building I as the player was feeling at odds with the job that I was there to perform on behalf of the company, and how much of a 'savior' complex our character has. As more was learned about Ava I definitely could see how Vic's thinking was shifting, but even then the turns that the story takes I couldn't have predicted. They left me feeling quite humbled as a human in the presence of nature.</p>
<h2>Explore Four Biomes</h2>
<p>The gameplay of <em>Creatures of Ava</em> has Vic exploring each of the four areas of Ava. Within each, you'll be learning the song of the animals - as a way to tame and have them assist you in your exploration - seeking out new creatures to tame and transport back to your base, and exploring the ruins to help Nim'ar learn about how the ancient civilizations dealt with the Wither.</p>
<p>Whether you're following the primary quest line, hunting down any of the side-quests, or just exploring at your own pace you'll encounter countless little puzzles to tickle your brain with.</p>
<p>You might see an interesting item through some brambles. To reach that you'll first need to remove the Wither from a nearby beast, play its song to ingratiate it to you, and then use its ability to break away the bramble. As you get further into the game puzzles might require you to utilize the abilities of two or three creatures at a time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/creatures-of-ava-01.jpg?itok=IjhWXWqf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/creatures-of-ava-01.jpg?itok=UPwXDWCP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Raga has a variety of abilities that you can use to reach new areas</figcaption></figure><p>To cleanse the Wither from a creature you need to form a link to it with your ancient staff, once a connection has been made the creature's infection will slowly whittle down. You can use abilities to drain the infection faster, raise the creature into the air, or even slow the creature down to make the process easier. You can cleanse multiple creatures at a time by creating a beam chain between them all.</p>
<p>While you're cleansing the creatures you have to be careful as they will fight back. They could charge at you, blast you with shockwaves, or dig up from under your feet. You'll need to be watching everyone's movements and dodging accordingly while maintaining your connection.</p>
<p>Cleansing feels like the gameplay of the poltergust of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4a328c3b-49f3-48a6-9879-9ac7c3863b9d" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/luigis-mansion-3-review"><em>Luigi's Mansion</em></a> but with a lot more going on than just 'don't break the chain'. For each combat scenario, you'll need to be balanced making a steady pace toward your objective, cleansing the creature, while also dodging left and right, and watching out for your ability cooldowns. At no point would I say that the process was difficult but enjoyably challenging.</p>

<p>Reaching a new area I always made it my goal to just pick a direction and start exploring. Whether I found new creatures to pet or take photos of, upgrades for Vic, or the main plot I was having not only a wonderful but a relaxing time.</p>
<p>At no point did I feel pressured to progress the story, and the world never felt so large or daunting that I wasn't happy to explore every inch of it. This might be one of the most relaxing games I've ever played because of it.</p>
<p>Each new area you travel to is also sizably smaller than the one before, meaning that as the story reaches its natural crescendo your progress isn't stopped because you still have 1/4 of the game to get through. I felt my time and attention was respected in this way.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/creatures-of-ava-19.jpg?itok=A3U3RsrY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/creatures-of-ava-19.jpg?itok=queYZUoF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>While I appreciate a clear 'point of no return' I would much rather not be locked out of half of the game</figcaption></figure><p>One aspect of <em>Creatures of Ava</em> that did frustrate me as someone who enjoys collecting in games, but also in making story progress is the number of "point of no returns" that are present in the game. Starting with the second biome once you're done with the story quest of that area you lose access to it.</p>
<p>Because of this, at any point in time, you only ever have access to two out of the game's four areas. You'll be presented with a helpful 'point of no return' screen, but it also felt like I was being shamed by the game for wanting to progress the story while I hadn't taken a photo of all of the wind chimes in the area.</p>
<p>It's disappointing to think that in a game that has so many fun puzzles stashed away in its world, you can lock yourself out of half of the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/creatures-of-ava-17.jpg?itok=icPwHy0A 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/creatures-of-ava-17.jpg?itok=NQaEre5r 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Through your adventure, Vic will see Ava in a very different way</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Creatures of Ava</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p><em>Creatures of Ava</em> is going to be one of those games that sit with me for a long time. While completing the story and scouring the world might not promote replayability, especially with how much of the game you lose access to as you play, the message of the game is one I'm going to continue to muse on.</p>
<p><em>Creatures of Ava</em> shows a beautiful world on the verge of death, and while science is trying to protect and preserve it, starts to ask big questions about how we understand and interact with nature from a very specific human point of view.</p>
<p>The gameplay was relaxing and rewarding, with so many interesting nooks and crannies of the world to explore. I also enjoyed that <em>Creatures of Ava</em> never overstayed its welcome. It arrived, politely shared with me an interesting story about a strange and fantastical world, and then left leaving me with delightful things to ponder.</p>

<h2>Review Summary</h2>

<p>
Creatures of Ava is a wonderful adventure that wraps together an interesting story about humankind's view of nature, exploration of a beautiful alien world, and interesting creature taming mechanics. While I'd wish to continue exploring this game a major detriment is how you get locked out of half the game as you play through it.

Zelda can change outfits too, in order to augment not just her look but also her abilities. </p><p>The final mechanic outlined in the trailer is Zelda’s bind ability. In addition to summoning echoes of objects found in the world, she’ll also be able to bind objects to her that will follow her around when she moves. Reverse-bind, meanwhile, will make her follow the objects, help her hang from moving platforms or catch rides on fast creatures in the world around her. </p><p>Out September 26, <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> really does seem like it’s shaping up to take the lessons learned from <em>Breath of the Wild </em>and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> when it comes to open world experimentation and freeform puzzle solving. A lot of fans have been hoping Zelda’s first playable entry in the series wouldn’t be just an off-year B-side, and so far that thankfully doesn’t seem to be the case at all. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This video digs into the absolute basics, such as how hunter have both sheathed and drawn weapon states, with the former allowing faster movement and the use of items. It also shows off the Seikret, a new creature that you can mount and ride across the open world. The Seikret can also automatically follow the trail to get you to the target monster, and give you time to heal, sharpen your weapons and grab useful items and materials that you meander past. It also has a holster to let you swap between primary and secondary weapons.</p>

<p>Then there’s the Slinger, which is standard gear for hunters in Monster Hunter Wilds and will replace the Wirebug from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a>. It can shoot out ammo gathered in the environment, and can grapple to draw in distant items (even while riding the Seikret), or interact with certain parts of the environment. Pretty handy!</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds: Focus Mode Overview" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_v3lnXyNFhI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Focus Mode is a new mechanic and combat technique, letting you aim your attacks and guards more precisely. They will now go in the direction the camera is facing, giving you more manual control. Focus Mode will highlight wounds on monsters, which you’ll then want to directly target to deal extra damage. It also enables Focus Strikes, which are particular special attacks.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Monster Hunter Wilds: Great Sword | Weapon Overview" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t2h3Uxj7nNg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>And finally, there’s a look at the Great Sword, one of the many weapons that will feature in Monster Hunter Wilds. A series staple, this is at the slower, heavier end of the scale, but the weapon overview video shows how it can be used with hit-and-run tactics, can guard, and then how Focus Mode can deal massive damage.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC in 2025. With two big trailers for the game shown so far – see them <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/30/first-monster-hunter-wilds-gameplay-revealed/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/08/monster-hunter-wilds-trailer/">here</a> – the next is expected to be released during Opening Night Live for Gamescom 2024 later this month.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xenoblade-directors-monolith-soft-studio-announces-brand-new-rpg.944853/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xenoblade-director-monolith-soft-new-rpg<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Xenoblade Chronicles&nbsp;</em>director Tetsuya Takahashi and his studio Monolith Soft have announced that they're recruiting for a brand new RPG, and it sounds like it might be a bit different to what you're used to from the developer.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.monolithsoft.co.jp/recruit/production/rpg.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">message</a> on the official Monolith Soft website (which is in Japanese; we're using machine translation), Takahashi says he's recruiting staff for Monolith's "first production for the first time in a long time". It's unclear exactly what he means by this, since <em>Xenoblade Chronicles 3&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xenoblade-chronicles-3-release-date-unveiled">launched just two years ago</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The phrasing might be a quirk of machine translation, or it might mean that Takahashi and Monolith are setting out to create a brand new IP, which would be the studio's first since 2010's&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade Chronicles&nbsp;</em>(if you don't count 2012's&nbsp;<em>Namco x Capcom&nbsp;</em>followup&nbsp;<em>Project X Zone</em>, that is).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xenoblade-chronicles-3-monolith-soft-tetsuya-takahashi.jpg?itok=o1kGMmqQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xenoblade-chronicles-3-monolith-soft-tetsuya-takahashi.jpg?itok=Oef4e54D 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Xenoblade</em>'s Monolith Soft is working on a new game.</figcaption></figure><p>Takahashi says that the days of creating large-scale games with smaller teams are over, and that it now needs people with "a wide range of knowledge", as well as "connections that utilize that knowledge".</p>
<p>He goes on to say that each area of an RPG, from its overworld to its characters and battle system, is "closely linked" to the next, and so it's important to have staff members who can work together on these elements rather than separately.</p>
<p>Sadly, details about Monolith Soft's new RPG are somewhat thin on the ground; Takahashi says he can't go into detail regarding what the RPG will look like now, but that he and his studio want "as many customers as possible" to enjoy his games.</p>
<p>He also reiterates that Monolith is, despite his newfound ambitions, "not a rigid organization"; rather, it's still a "relatively rough and sloppy organization", and that's what makes his team "unique".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xenoblade-chronicles-definitive-edition-monolith-soft-shulk.jpg?itok=xrKoHtzB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xenoblade-chronicles-definitive-edition-monolith-soft-shulk.jpg?itok=qzi2IBji 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Monolith Soft's last new IP was&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade Chronicles</em>, unless you count&nbsp;<em>Project X Zone</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Whatever we can expect from Monolith Soft's new project, it sounds like it won't be a followup to any of the studio's existing properties, so it might be a good idea to stop holding out hope for that&nbsp;<em>Xenosaga&nbsp;</em>sequel. We'll bring you more on this as soon as we get it.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/project-white-sands-codename-half-life-rumor</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valves-project-white-sands-codename-reignites-half-life-rumors.944850/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/project-white-sands-codename-half-life-rumor<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If a recently-deleted voice actor listing is to be believed, Valve is currently working on a project codenamed&nbsp;<em>Project White Sands</em>, and that name should be ringing alarm bells if you're a&nbsp;<em>Half-Life&nbsp;</em>fan.</p>
<p>The game was spotted by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ek3943/valve_is_working_on_a_title_under_the_codename/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Redditor KekanKok</a>&nbsp;as part of voice actor Natasha Chandel's <a href="https://www.natashachandel.com/resume/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">list of upcoming video game voiceover projects</a>. At time of writing, the site is down due to exceeding its bandwidth limit, but you can see an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240804192456/https://www.natashachandel.com/resume/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">archived version of it here</a>.</p>
<p>Chandel's credits include games like&nbsp;<em>Fallout 76</em>,&nbsp;<em>Valorant</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Starfield</em>, and she also lists&nbsp;<em>Project White Sands</em>, which she's apparently working on for Valve. She doesn't name the character she's playing, though.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/half-life-alyx-project-white-sands-valve.jpg?itok=adX2oofG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/half-life-alyx-project-white-sands-valve.jpg?itok=wrW-7rcB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Valve's last foray into the&nbsp;<em>Half-Life&nbsp;</em>series was 2020's&nbsp;<em>Half-Life: Alyx</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>As noted by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ek3943/comment/lghyf57/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Redditor Thaumaturgia</a>, White Sands is the name of a park in New Mexico, and fellow user Ploid_Kerensky <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ek3943/comment/lgi7r99/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="noopener" target="_blank">notes</a> that White Sands is actually also a military test range in that state.</p>
<p>This is significant because in the&nbsp;<em>Half-Life&nbsp;</em>series, New Mexico is where you'll find the headquarters of the Black Mesa Research Facility, or at least you would have done before the events of&nbsp;<em>Half-Life&nbsp;</em>took place.</p>
<p>As such, if&nbsp;<em>Project White Sands&nbsp;</em>isn't a new&nbsp;<em>Half-Life&nbsp;</em>game of some description, then Valve is playing a rather nasty prank on its fans. Then again, it's entirely possible this internal codename was never supposed to see the light of day, and that it's an ironic inside joke of some kind.</p>
<p>It might seem particularly cruel to throw a bone to&nbsp;<em>Half-Life&nbsp;</em>fans almost 17 years after the last non-VR&nbsp;<em>Half-Life&nbsp;</em>title gave them (or perhaps I should say "us" hope), but could this be cause for new optimism? I, for one, very much hope so.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/half-life-2-episode-2-project-white-sands.jpg?itok=uKZaEvCQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/half-life-2-episode-2-project-white-sands.jpg?itok=nykMsO_7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's been 17 years since the last Valve-developed non-VR&nbsp;<em>Half-Life&nbsp;</em>game.</figcaption></figure><p>This is the second suggestion within the last few months that Valve might be ramping up its development wing again. Back in May, leaked info regarding a hero shooter by the name of&nbsp;<em>Deadlock&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/now-theres-leaked-footage-of-valves-new-game-deadlock" rel="noopener" target="_blank">started circulating</a>, although Valve hasn't confirmed whether that's a project in active development or not.</p>
<p>Of course, just like&nbsp;<em>Deadlock</em>, there's a chance&nbsp;<em>Project White Sands&nbsp;</em>might never see the light of day, although if Valve is far along enough to hire voice actors, that might be an encouraging sign. Stay tuned for more.</p>

The <strong>13-inch M3 MacBook Air </strong>with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage is $849.98 (around $250 off) in all available colors at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CX22ZW1T?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>. And for those who want more storage or RAM, Amazon is also selling the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CX261SRT?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">8GB RAM / 512GB configuration for $1,049.98</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2024-MacBook-13-inch-Laptop/dp/B0CX246FNZ?tag=theverge02-20">16GB RAM / 512GB version for $1,249.98</a> — each around $250 off.</p><p>If you can spend the extra dough, that highest-specced model is ideal since it has the performance headroom to last quite a long time. However, even the base MacBook Air is a great all-around machine, especially since its 256GB SSD no longer clocks at slower speeds like previous generations.</p><p>Apple’s latest version of the Air came out earlier this year and was given some modest upgrades over its predecessor, including a faster M3 processor, the ability to use two external monitors with the lid closed, and Wi-Fi 6E. There are really no downsides to picking the M3 Air over the older M2 model, aside from the higher price — and today’s deal makes that delta just $50.</p><p><h4><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24114684/apple-macbook-air-m3-13-15-inch-2024-review">Read our review of the 13-inch MacBook Air M3</a>.</h4></p><div><p>The MacBook Air M3 is a jack-of-all-trades, with a balanced combination of performance and power efficiency. It also now supports dual displays with the lid closed, and the storage speed is noticeably faster.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-incorporate-this-absurd-game-shuffling-sonic-mod-into-every-other-video-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Every so often, the fine folk of Resetera take a break from their usual schedule of complaining that video games journalists get all their news from Resetera, and post a Thing Of Beauty. For example: it's thanks to Resetera member <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-sonic-mod-is-insane.944673/">AstralSphere</a> that I know about Alistair Aitcheson's <a href="https://www.alistairaitcheson.com/games/magicbox.html">Magic Box and BizHawk retro emulation tools</a>, which - amongst other things - allow you to play old Sonic the Hedgehog games in giddy parallel, shuffling between them whenever you collect a ring.</p><!--more-->
<p>If you have even the slightest understanding of games featuring Sega's prickly pinball, you will know that switching games whenever Sonic collects a ring is a recipe for panic and confusion beyond Dr Robotnik's wildest and wettest daydreams. That was certainly the conclusion of streamers participating in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zw-wW20VG8&amp;t=368s">the latest episode of Random Number Generation</a>, a Games Done Quick show dedicated to randomisation mods and their communities (beware rapid screen-flashing during the transitions). </p>
<p>Here's the thing, though: I played Sonic a bunch back in the day, and as regards certain Sonic levels, <em>I think I could keep up with this</em>. Specifically, Green Hill Zone and its equivalents, of which I have muscle memories so deeply engraved they will be visible as glinting threads within the swirling tissues of my spirit, as and when the Good Lord packs me off to my personal 16-bit heaven.</p>
<p>More importantly, it strikes me that shuffling between games based on certain actions would be a wonderful way to clear my backlog, by splicing together games at random. Picture it: you're hoeing the pumpkin patch in Stardew Valley and all of a sudden your hoe is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-best-weapons">Bloodhound's Fang</a> and the pumpkin patch is a cauldron of Rot and there is a stinking golden lady with big hair doing butterfly combos at you. You dodge-roll past her and oh shitballs, you've just invaded the Karaz Ankor and Thorgrim Grudgebearer is absolutely livid.</p>
<p>After many hours of hard campaigning and a gruelling battle in the foothills of the Everpeak, you succeed in felling the High King, which isn't much consolation now that you're trapped in a cupboard in Amnesia: The Bunker. Forget mods: this should be an official platform feature. Perhaps a certification requirement. Imagine it, a games industry built like the Quantum Leap TV show, with games full of hidden wormholes into other games. Questions of pacing would become irrelevant, and today's arguments about skill would fade to echoes, because nobody would have a clue what the hell they're playing at any given second, or what the hell they'll be playing next.</p>
<p>If Alistair Aitcheson seems like an RPS kinda guy, that could be because (as I've just discovered) our former deputy editor Alice B went to school with him. His other works include <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-book-ritual-is-a-game-about-shredding-a-book-made-by-someone-i-was-at-school-with">the Book Ritual</a>, in which you shred books that "think they're human" - the loose idea being to explore your attachment to a physical object. It feels like the Magic Box and BizHawk tools are kind of doing the same thing.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Nintendo has released a new trailer for upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, giving players a near six-minute look at the game.</p>



<p>“Learn about some of the regions you’ll visit in Hyrule during your adventure––as well as a few other things that are sure to come in handy,” Nintendo said. </p>

<p>Some of the regions shown during the trailer include the Gerudo Desert, Jabul Water, Eldin Volcano, and Faron Wetlands. Within each region there are various villages you’ll need to visit to learn more about what’s happening in Hyrule. You’ll also have to help villagers with their problems throughout.</p>



<p>“Helping people with their troubles is a big part of your journey,” the trailer says, “and wise heroes are often rewarded for their good deeds.”</p>



<p>There are also various waypoints for fast travel that will help you along your journey. You’ll also get access to a horse mount that you can call using a carrot echo from anywhere in the overworld.</p>



<p>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is the first game in the classic franchise that has players play as Princess Zelda, herself.
