            <p>Take-Two is "highly confident" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> will make that recently-promised autumn 2025 release window.</p>
<p>The company's CEO Strauss Zelnick was asked about the timing of GTA 6's release during an interview with CNBC. Here, the company exec said the team generally decides upon a release window by factoring in measurable elements, using the "number of bugs in a title" as an example.</p>
<p>"Every one of us will make sure we have as few bugs in a title as possible before we launch," Zelnick said. But, in the case of GTA 6 - or, in Zelnick's words, "an extraordinary title, for which there are extraordinary expectations" - it is less about bugs and more about "creating an experience that no one has seen before".</p>

<p>"[Developer] Rockstar Games seeks perfection in what they do. Perfection is indeed hard to measure," Zelnick continued. "It really is more subjective than objective."</p>
<p>Zelnick was then asked further about GTA 6's release window, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-coming-in-fall-2025-publisher-take-two-reveals">Take-Two recently narrowed down from a broad 2025 timeframe to simply "fall" of next year</a>. While the CEO said there is often "slippage" in the industry, and Take-Two is not immune from delays, he does not see this happening with GTA 6.</p>
<p>"We narrowed the timing because we are highly confident in that timing," Zelnick said. You can listen to the exchange via the post below.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Strauss Zelnick (Take-Two CEO) was interviewed by CNBC on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GTA6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GTA6</a></p><p>- The game was internally delayed because rockstar seeks perfection, it’s going to be a game NO ONE has EVER seen before. <a href="https://t.co/6rMF374VgR">pic.twitter.com/6rMF374VgR</a></p></div>— Dyllie (@_Dyllie_) <a href="https://twitter.com/_Dyllie_/status/1792241924738285669?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 19, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>When it does make its highly-anticipated debut, GTA 6 will release across both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-will-release-on-xbox-series-xs-and-playstation-5-in-2025">Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5</a>. Rockstar is yet to give a timeframe for a PC release. </p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baldurs-gate-3-dev-larian-studios-new-location</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/baldurs-gate-3-dev-larian-studios-opens-new-location-in-warsaw.875583/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baldurs-gate-3-dev-larian-studios-new-location<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Divinity: Original Sin 2&nbsp;</em>developer Larian Studios has opened a new studio location in Warsaw, and the studio is also beginning development on two new projects.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://x.com/larianstudios/status/1792495491256664211" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Larian's new location, which is its seventh worldwide studio, is located "in the heart of Poland's lively gaming scene". As if to demonstrate the point,&nbsp;<em>The Witcher&nbsp;</em>studio CD Projekt Red, which is also based in Warsaw, <a href="https://x.com/CDPROJEKTRED/status/1792519072690655655" rel="noopener" target="_blank">congratulated</a> Larian on the new studio.</p>

<p>In the aforementioned post, Larian also says that development work on "two very ambitious RPGs" is beginning in earnest.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/baldurs-gate-3-larian-new-studio.jpg?itok=DUQgWEzE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/baldurs-gate-3-larian-new-studio.jpg?itok=zsmSuAH- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Larian Studios is easily best-known for its work on&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>This isn't the first time we've heard about these new projects. Last month, Larian said that rather than creating a sequel to&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>, the studio would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baldurs-gate-3-mod-support-patch-7">focus on two upcoming projects</a>, both of which will be based on original IPs.</p>

<p>It sounds like the new games won't be based on&nbsp;<em>Divinity&nbsp;</em>either, so if you were hoping for a sequel to 2017's well-received&nbsp;<em>Divinity: Original Sin 2</em>, then you may well be just as out of luck as&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>fans, sadly.</p>

<p>In any case, Larian will be in good company while it's developing these two new projects. CD Projekt Red is far from the only studio based in Warsaw; others include&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a>&nbsp;</em>developer 11 bit studios,&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/evil-west">Evil West</a>&nbsp;</em>creator Flying Wild Hog, and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/outriders">Outriders</a>&nbsp;</em>dev People Can Fly.</p>

<p>The division of labor between Larian's studios for the new projects is unclear, but since Larian doesn't clearly define which of its locations have made its games (in a manner similar to Ubisoft, for instance), it's likely all of the developer's locations will be involved.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/evil-west-flying-wild-hog-warsaw.jpg?itok=Hi9wtPz2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/evil-west-flying-wild-hog-warsaw.jpg?itok=2w29WSV8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Other Warsaw-based studios include&nbsp;<em>Evil West&nbsp;</em>developer Flying Wild Hog.</figcaption></figure><p>Larian says it's looking for talented "programmers, RPG designers, writers, and more" who either live in Poland or who would be interested in relocating.</p>

<p data-characters="262" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">We’ve seen Epic Games destroy plenty of buildings, vehicles, and even islands in <em>Fortnite</em> over the years, but the developer took things a step further by crushing a real-life Battle Bus with a monster truck, teasing that a new version would arrive in-game.</p> <p data-characters="271" data-current-count="271" data-injectable="false">With <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/when-does-the-new-fortnite-season-come-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Fortnite</em> Chapter 5, Season 3</a> set to release on Friday, May 24, we’re already expecting plenty of new items and cosmetics, fueled by the announcement of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fortnites-new-fallout-content-is-more-salt-in-the-wound-for-fallout-76-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Fallout</em> crossover</a>. Nobody had mentioned a new Battle Bus, however, that seems to be on the horizon too. </p> <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="556" data-injectable="true">In a clip tweeted out by the official <em>Fortnite</em> X account, you can see the Battle Bus parked in the middle of the Monster Jam World Finals, which took place on Saturday, May 18. We then see a giant monster truck fly over a jump and clear the purple vehicle, flipping over as it landed. </p>
 <p data-characters="229" data-current-count="229" data-injectable="false">Unfortunately for the Battle Bus, however, there was no escape from destruction, with a second truck soaring over the jump and landing right on top of the modified school bus, crushing it like it wasn’t even there. Awesome.</p> <figure data-current-count="529" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="346" data-current-count="346" data-injectable="false">An awesome clip by its own merit, the caption with it was what got <em>Fortnite</em> fans’ tongues wagging, reading: “Might be a new bus in town.” With the <em>Fallout </em>crossover coming, many have speculated that it could be the return of the Armored Battle Bus from Chapter 3 to match the Power Armor seen in the game and Amazon Prime show. </p> <p data-characters="293" data-current-count="639" data-injectable="false">Of course, this could also have been just a cool thing that Epic decided to do, but having the release date of the new season on the LED screens around the stadium seems like an obvious nod to a new update. What it’ll look like remains unknown, but I for one can’t wait to see it. </p>

            <p>
What looks to be a previously-unseen Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 post-credits scene has been uploaded to YouTube after 13 years, solving a mystery surrounding unused audio in the game's files, and offering a bleaker coda to the hugely-popular shooter's campaign.
</p>
<p>
Infinity Ward's first Modern Warfare 3, released in 2011, famously ends with the trilogy's main villain Makarov swinging from a rope, after he and hero Price fall through a glass skylight. The credits roll as Makarov's dead body sways, while an injured Price lights up a cigar. It's a grim but satisfying conclusion. 
</p>
<p>
But unused sound files suggested there was still more to come - and indeed, after 13 years, fans finally believe they can see what Infinity Ward once intended would follow. Spoilers: it would have been bad news for Price.

<p>
Audio files for the level include mention of a mysterious "Shadow Man" entering and exiting a room with heavy footsteps, while ominous music plays. But there's no place in the level - as shipped in the final game - where this happens. 
</p>
<p>
Step up Call of Duty modders <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU-86Tufa0HFAUre1UBoEdw">yoyo1love</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De7Axarv12E">Vlad Loktionov</a>, who claim to have discovered and uploaded footage of a post-credits scene that features the "Shadow Man", and presumably sets up a new mystery to be answered by another game. 
</p>
<p>
The scene would have contined on from the end of the game - Price still lying on the floor smoking his cigar, Makarov still swinging on his rope. A mysterious figure would have walked into the room, observing the two, and as Price seemingly bleeds out, would then silently exit. The screen blurs as Price drops his cigar, before fading to black. Here it is to watch in full:

<p>
Price dying (on top of earlier main character deaths in the game) would certainly have been a more downbeat finale. The question would then have been who the mysterious stranger was - perhaps answered in a Modern Warfare 4 (rather than Infinity Ward's actual follow-up, 2013's standalone Ghosts). 
</p>
<p>
Regardless, it's fascinating this coda has seemingly lain unseen in the files for more than a decade.

            <p>You remember the ending of 2011's first-person bullethoser <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</a>, right? Everyone does! A big man kills another big man with a gun but then - then! - a third big man kills that first big man with a rope. It's dramatic stuff. Well, a data-diving enthusiast of the CoDwars has discovered a cut ending from the original trilogy's closing chapter. It's a more downbeat and mysterious finale, featuring a shadowy figure whose identity is never revealed. Also, Captain Price, the hero of the franchise and aforementioned big man number three, drops his cigar with possibly mortal implications.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The unused ending has been restored by a "yoyo1love", a YouTuber who likes to mess about in the game's files. It's been uploaded by another user, Vlad Loktionov. The cut sequence looks to have been intended as a post-credits scene. </p>

<p>As you can see, Captain Price is briefly visited by a shadowy figure in the background. He then tumbles over and drops his lit cigar which rolls weakly away from him, a loss of comforting tobacco possibly charged with symbolism and also possibly charged with nothing. A photo appears afterwards showing the four major characters of the series, with a big "rest in peace" vibe, which suggests Price has also just died. </p>
<p>Anyway, compare all this to <a href="https://youtu.be/AsImV95IrqQ?feature=shared&amp;t=142">the original ending</a> in which Captain Price painfully but satisfyingly lights his cigar and chills out, watching a corpse swing in front of him (normal Captain Price pastime). </p>
<p>I'm poking fun. But I do find it interesting to see relics of gaming yesteryear surfacing and spawning conspiracy theories among fans, even as late as 13 years from the game's release. Lots of stuff ends up on the chopping room floor in video game development. It's hard to know why things get cut without having been in the studio when the decision was made. We could speculate this was a planned teaser for a follow-up Call of Duty game, but that the mysterious ending was canned for whatever reason. (Infinity Ward's next CoD ended up being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-ghosts">Call of Duty: Ghosts</a>, which told its own separate story, independent of previous characters). But only the team involved will likely know what was intended here. For now, I'll leave the Call of Dutiful out there to come to their own conclusions. </p>
<p>Again, this is the Modern Warfare of many years ago, not the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">first-person shooter</a> remake of 2023. It was an awkward time for the series back then, developed amid the fallout of departing team members who would go on to form Respawn Entertainment. John (RPS in peace) didn't like the shooter much in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-modern-warfare-3-single-player">Modern Warfare 3 review</a>, calling it a "bombastic and clumsy un-game". But if you want to see how it stacks up next to the others in the series, we did once have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/every-call-of-duty-campaign-ranked">all the Call of Duty games ranked</a>. </p>

			<p>More than a few players have been asking for a proper remake of Final Fantasy VI for years, but Square Enix is seemingly not ready to commit to this project, leaving some players no choice but to recreate the game themselves.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AILab.-fv8qb">Japanese YouTuber Touya</a> has been working on an AI live-action recreation of the sixth entry in the series and finally released a longer video covering the entirety of the story a few hours ago. This live-action recreation is not only of the highest quality, sometimes making it difficult to distinguish it from a real live-action recreation, but it's also incredibly accurate, recreating characters like Terra, Edgar, Locke, and Kefka very faithfully.</p>
<p><iframe title="【総集編】AIでFF6のオープニングからエンディングまで再現してみた  (Final Fantasy 6 AI generated movie)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yX88c33cdtE?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As already mentioned, a proper Final Fantasy VI remake has yet to be released, although the game did receive multiple versions over the course of the years, including a Game Boy Advance port featuring additional content, a mobile port that features some controversial new visuals, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-pixel-remaster-series-to-launch-this-spring-on-playstation-4-nintendo-switch/">Pixel Remaster</a>, which introduces some visual improvements that are faithful to the original SNES version, a rearranged soundtrack, and some additional features. Hopefully, once the Final Fantasy VII remake project has been completed, Square Enix will finally take a look at the sixth entry in their popular series and finally give fans what they have been asking for a very long time.</p>

<p data-characters="324" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With how many stories of studio shutdowns there have been this year, like what happened to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/redfall-and-hi-fi-rush-developers-shut-down-in-another-awful-wave-of-microsoft-cuts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arkane Austin and Tango Gameworks</a>, it’s refreshing to hear of a new studio opening and creating job opportunities. In this case, it’s <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-baldurs-gate-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baldur’s Gate 3</a></em> developer Larian Studios, which is expanding into Warsaw, Poland.</p> <p data-characters="389" data-current-count="389" data-injectable="false">Larian Studios’ <a href="https://x.com/larianstudios/status/1792495491256664211" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Twitter account</a> made the announcement on May 20, revealing the new division will simply be called Larian Warsaw and be based in “the heart of Poland’s lively gaming scene.” This makes it the seventh studio Larian has opened. Aside from its headquarters in Belgium, Larian has studios in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Spain, and Malaysia.</p> <figure data-current-count="689" data-injectable="true"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>*obtains condition Enlarged*</p><p>With two very ambitious RPGs now starting development, what better way to see our visions realised than by growing the team and opening a 7th studio in the heart of Poland’s lively gaming scene!</p><p>Welcome, Larian Studios Warsaw! <a href="https://t.co/hpm2aMdQmy">pic.twitter.com/hpm2aMdQmy</a></p></div>— Larian Studios (@larianstudios) <a href="https://twitter.com/larianstudios/status/1792495491256664211?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 20, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="508" data-current-count="508" data-injectable="true">Larian has “two very ambitious RPGs” in development right now, so it’s decided it’ll need extra hands to work on them. The <a href="https://larian.com/careers/location/warsaw?location=warsaw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official website</a> already has a handful of job openings at the Warsaw studio, where Larian says it is “dedicated to fostering an environment where developers can thrive creatively and reclaim their agency. Systems-heavy RPGs need best-in-class developers, that’s why we’ve put the people who build those systems at the center of our culture.”</p>
 <p data-characters="661" data-current-count="661" data-injectable="false">No doubt the success of <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> helped with Larian’s expansion, and yet the studio’s opted to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/larian-ceo-explains-why-the-studio-isnt-making-baldurs-gate-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not follow it up with a <em>Baldur’s Gate 4</em></a>. I imagine <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> owner Hasbro will want a sequel regardless, but another studio will have to handle it. As for what Larian is working on, it hasn’t shared anything on its next projects, only suggesting that it won’t be returning to its <em>Divinity: Original Sin</em> series either. Whatever these RPGs are, there’s little reason to assume they won’t at least be fun to play, and having a seventh studio to help will ideally allow Larian to make them even better.</p>

		<p>Larian Studios has revealed the launch of a new studio in Warsaw, Poland, marking its seventh studio globally. The company already operates studios in Quebec, Dublin, Guildford, Barcelona, Ghent, and Kuala Lumpur. Larian is currently hiring for various positions at the Warsaw studio, including <a href="https://larian.com/careers/b006674a-e946-4804-8566-0859bd33c170">RPG Designer</a>, <a href="https://larian.com/careers/37ee3d1d-842a-45d6-a143-9bb33319e094">Graphics Programmer</a>, <a href="https://larian.com/careers/e4ea9659-633b-4fbe-8b2b-5bbabd7a9039">Tools Programmer</a>, and <a href="https://larian.com/careers/f00c5771-cdf6-4132-ae4d-3b78e4ed2f72">Writer</a>. Moreover, they have an <a href="https://larian.com/careers/376a2c9e-9166-4a7f-9949-435db7a9b1ca">open application process</a> for those interested in joining Larian Warsaw.</p>

<p><em>“The decision to open a permanent studio in Warsaw shows how serious we are about encouraging creativity, collaboration, and innovation in the heart of Poland’s lively gaming scene,”</em> said Ula Jach, Head of Studio. <em>“We’re thrilled for the opportunity to collaborate with the abundant talent and expertise of the region, especially considering Poland’s strong reputation as a hub for RPG and gaming enthusiasts.”</em></p>
<p>Swen Vincke, CEO of Larian Studios, said, <em>“Visiting GIC last year confirmed what I’d been thinking for a while – there’s a lot of talent here and a lot of devs who think like us.</em><br>
<em>On top of that, many of them want to work on RPGs so it’s a match made in heaven.</em><br>
<em>Our plan for the Polish studio is very simple. Build a team that can work on our two – very ambitious – new RPGs and enjoy the fruits of their labor. We’re a very bottom up company so I’m eager to see what new things they’ll bring us. I think it’ll work really well.”</em></p>
<p>Larian Studios’ latest release, Baldur’s Gate 3, has been met with critical acclaim. In our review, Dom noted, <em>“Baldur’s Gate 3 is an exquisite example of a role-playing game, and an incredible recreation of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons experience. It is, in a word, unmissable.”</em></p>

<p>Despite its success, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/22/larian-studios-is-not-making-baldurs-gate-3-dlc-baldurs-gate-4-or-anything-else-dnd/">Larian Studios has confirmed</a> that it will not be developing any DLC for Baldur’s Gate 3, nor does it have plans to develop Baldur’s Gate 4 or any other games within the Dungeons &amp; Dragons universe.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Larian <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larians-next-game-wont-be-a-baldurs-gate-3-sequel-dlc-or-anything-with-dungeons-dragons">confirmed its next game will not be Baldur's Gate 4</a>, DLC, or anything to do with Dungeons and Dragons. Rather, it will be those two aforementioned RPG's, which for now remain rather mysterious.</p>
<p>Back in April, the studio said it was still "early days" for these projects, with Vincke stating <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-studio-confirms-two-new-projects-will-be-our-best-work-ever">what's coming will be the team's "best work ever"</a>. An exciting claim given the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-takes-home-best-game-and-four-more-awards-at-this-years-baftas">monumental success of Baldur's Gate 3</a>.</p>
<p>As for a potential Baldur's Gate 4, Dungeons &amp; Dragons owner Wizards of the Coast <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wizards-of-the-coast-now-talking-to-lots-of-partners-about-next-baldurs-gate">recently confirmed</a> it's "now talking to lots of partners" about a new game in the series.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/divinity-original-sin">Divinity Original Sin</a> developers Larian today announced the opening of a new studio in Warsaw, Poland. This is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> outfit Larian’s seventh studio worldwide, and the latest to contribute to their "24-hour development cycle" model. That’s even more hands on deck to a) keep Swen Vincke’s armour polished to a fine sheen and b) ensure smooth sailing for the two new games that Larian <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-have-two-new-games-in-the-works-fueled-by-the-very-same-fire-as-baldurs-gate-3">currently have in the works</a>.</p>

<p>Make a wisdom check against your reading skills, roll the die under the sofa, then just read the bit of press release below normally:</p>
<blockquote><p>As the team ramps up development on our next games, Larian’s excited to boost its existing 24-hour development cycle with the addition of this seventh studio. Larian Studios Warsaw will be joining a global team of sister studios in Quebec, Dublin, Guildford, Barcelona, Ghent, and Kuala Lumpur.</p>
<p>"The decision to open a permanent studio in Warsaw shows how serious we are about encouraging creativity, collaboration, and innovation in the heart of Poland's lively gaming scene,” said Ula Jach, Head of Studio. “We're thrilled for the opportunity to collaborate with the abundant talent and expertise of the region, especially considering Poland's strong reputation as a hub for RPG and gaming enthusiasts."</p></blockquote>
<p>We also have a strong hint - if any were needed - that the two upcoming games Larian is working on are, indeed, RPGs.</p>
<blockquote><p>Swen Vincke, CEO of Larian Studios, said: "Visiting GIC last year confirmed what I'd been thinking for a while - there's a lot of talent here and a lot of devs who think like us.</p>
<p>On top of that, many of them want to work on RPGs so it's a match made in heaven.</p>
<p>Our plan for the Polish studio is very simple. Build a team that can work on our two - very ambitious - new RPGs and enjoy the fruits of their labor. We're a very bottom up company so I'm eager to see what new things they'll bring us. I think it'll work really well."</p></blockquote>
<p>"As an independent studio since 1996, we value the freedom to follow our creativity wherever it leads," wrote Larian in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4172097464031362567">Steam blog</a> back in April. "In this case, after six years in the Forgotten Realms and much discussion and rumination, we’ve decided to seize this opportunity to develop our own IPs. We’re currently working on two new projects and we couldn’t be more excited about what the future has in store."</p>
<p>As for the future of the Baldur’s Gate series and D&amp;D games in general, licence holders Hasbro<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dds-makers-are-spending-1-billion-on-their-own-video-games-promising-theyll-be-quality-and-authentic-like-baldurs-gate-3"> recently announced</a> it'd be spending $1 billion on its own video games. If I was being cynical, I might imagine a CEO assuming that budget and the D&amp;D name were the only reasons for Baldur’s Gate 3’s success. "Mo’ money, Mo’ Baldur’s Gates!" they declare confidently, before reclining back on their chair, which is actually just several writers and artists horribly contorted into a flesh throne.</p>
<p><em>Disclosure: Former RPS deputy editor Adam Smith (RPS in peace) now works at Larian and is the lead writer for Baldur's Gate 3. Former contributor Emily Gera also works on it.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/native-zelda-majoras-mask-pc-port-will-be-the-herald-of-various-new-native-n64-pc-ports-df-says/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The recently released The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask PC port will be the precursor of various new native N64 PC ports, according to Digital Foundry's Alexander Battaglia.</p>
<p>Earlier <a href="https://wccftech.com/native-zelda-majoras-mask-pc-port/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this month we reported on a new tool</a> from coder 'Mr Wiseguy', that allows for 'easy-to-make' native PC ports of N64 titles without needing a game's source code. The tool makes use of static recompilation and uses the <a href="https://wccftech.com/n64-emulator-plugin-rt64-ray-traced-lighting-dlss-object-motion-blur-widescreen-60fps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upcoming RT64 rendering engine</a> from known modder 'Dario' in order to offer various enhancements to the original game. Fast forward a little over a week, and Digital Foundry has now tested this new recompilation project. The result? According to Alexander Battaglia, Majora's Mask Recompiled paves the way for easier-to-make native N64 PC ports.</p>
<p>"Zelda 64 recompiled is an amazing fan effort to bring this culturally significant game to modern platforms", Battaglia says in the latest Digital Foundry video. "It is quick, easy to use, accurate, fast, and it is rich with useful features for the power user. It is going to be the herald of many new ports of classic N64 games to the PC, and I'm super excited to see what comes next."</p>
<p><iframe title="Zelda 64 Recompiled: A Revolution In N64 Native Ports For PC" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O1wlTOvn2y0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As covered earlier in our initial article about the project, the creator of the tool will soon also release a recompilation of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. In addition, modder 'Dario' is actively working on his RT64 ray tracing plugin, which will add ray tracing to these ports in the near future.</p>
<p>We've included the main features of the Majora's Mask Recompilation project below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plug and Play</li>
<li>Fully Intact N64 Effects</li>
<li>Easy-to-Use Menus</li>
<li>High Framerate Support</li>
<li>Widescreen and Ultrawide Support</li>
<li>Gyro Aiming</li>
<li>Autosaving</li>
<li>Low Input Lag</li>
<li>Instant Load Times</li>
<li>Linux and Steam Deck Support</li>
</ul>
<p>Those interested can download this <a href="https://github.com/Zelda64Recomp/Zelda64Recomp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">native PC port through Github here</a>. You'll only need to legally own the ROM of the original version of the game in order to play it.</p>

			<p>New Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut mods that were released in the past few days bring considerable visual improvements.</p>
<p>The first of these mods is the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/ghostoftsushima/mods/44?tab=description">Serene Reshade - Damp RT</a>, a resource-intensive ray-traced global illumination shader that attempts to simulate light propagation using on-screen data. The shader also adds some sharpening that accounts for depth and introduces some minor color adjustments while trying to stay true to the game's original style.</p>

<p>The second Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut mod that brings some welcome visual improvements is a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/ghostoftsushima/mods/28?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cutscene pack</a> that includes great-looking 4K AI-upscaled prerendered cutscenes. Among the available variants are also ultra-wide 21:9 cutscenes with no black bars.</p>
<p>The third and final Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut mod that improves visuals is similar to one released for <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-forbidden-west-mod-yellow-tint/">Horizon: Forbidden West</a>, which removes the game's <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/ghostoftsushima/mods/51">green tint</a> for more colorful and cleaner visuals.</p>
<p>Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut PC release has been extremely successful, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-sets-new-concurrent-player-peak-record-for-sonys-single-player-games-on-steam/">setting a new concurrent player peak record</a> for Sony's single-player games on Steam, surpassing God of War. A success that is totally deserved, thanks to the game's high quality and excellent PC port. More information on the game can be found in Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-tsushima-duty-heavier-than-a-mountain-death-lighter-than-a-feather/">review</a> of the original PlayStation 4 release.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-xbox-next-ram-storage/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-6-xbox-next-ram-may-not-get-doubled-over-their-predecessors-as-storage-and-software-will-do-the-grunt-work.875499/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-xbox-next-ram-storage/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 6 and Next Xbox may not get double the RAM of current-generation systems as it may essentially be useless due to some reasons.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DFClipsChannel">Digital Foundry</a>'s Richard Leadbetter recently commented on the amount of RAM next-generation consoles are expected to have. He doesn't think it will be doubled over the 16 GB of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, as memory costs aren't decreasing significantly, and adding an excessive amount of memory would be economically viable. Storage and software-based solutions have already seen a generational leap in the current generation of consoles, and they will likely continue doing the grunt work in the next generation as well.</p>
<p>This, however, doesn't mean that the PlayStation 6 and Xbox Next won't have more RAM than their predecessors, and the Xbox Next will likely have more than Sony's console if Microsoft makes its console more of a PC. Still, console manufacturers are likely going to take a more holistic approach to console design, as highlighted by the PlayStation 5 Pro, which will not feature <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-36-teraflops/">double the GPU performance of the base model</a> but will make up for it with software-based solutions like the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler.</p>
<p>Talking about how much RAM the PlayStation 6 and the Xbox Next may need, Alexander Battaglia made some interesting comments, highlighting how there's a limitation in the production side that limits how much VRAM is actually needed. Filling the 16 GB RAM of the current generation consoles requires a huge amount of work, and filling more than that would require developers, for example, to go for some static solutions that would feature some unique special effects that would only show up once during a game. We are reaching a point of stagnation that may last a decade, where developers will have to figure out how much VRAM past a certain point will be necessary, and development will also change substantially, as more procedural solutions will limit how much VRAM is actually necessary.</p>
<p><iframe title="Should Next-Gen Consoles Invest Heavily In More RAM?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pN-wvzD7A8U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Very little is currently known about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-most-powerful-generation-amd/">PlayStation 6</a> and the Xbox Next. We will probably learn sooner about the latter, as it is rumored to be scheduled for a<a href="https://wccftech.com/next-xbox-console-might-launch-in-2026-according-to-new-rumor/"> 2026 launch.</a></p>

It seems to be the side of a shopping complex in Japan, with the signage all written in Japanese. This got the brains of some <em>CoD </em>fans whirring, with immediate suggestions that this may not just be the teaser reveal for <em>Gundam</em>, but also a showcase of a new map. </p> <p data-characters="313" data-current-count="673" data-injectable="true">If you think back through the history of the <em>Modern Warfare</em> series, there’s already been a map set in a shopping mall, which is Arkaden from <em>MW3</em>. With classic <em>CoD</em> maps already appearing in this year’s game, it makes perfect sense for it to return, and some players are convinced it’s happening. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="351" data-current-count="651" data-injectable="true">The idea first appeared on Reddit when Herr_Fredolin wrote: “This map in the background looks a little bit like Arkaden, possible remake in Season 4?” This quickly gained traction, with players voicing their agreement with the idea, writing: “I’d love to see Arkaden,” and “I just want to play Arkaden again.”</p>
 <p data-characters="282" data-current-count="282" data-injectable="false">Of course, we’ll have to wait for official confirmation from Activision to see if Arkaden really is coming back, but it would make a lot of sense, and the fact that they included a building that we know isn’t currently in <em>MW3</em> can’t have just happened by accident. </p> <p data-characters="370" data-current-count="652" data-injectable="false">We’ve already seen hints about the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/when-is-the-kar98k-coming-to-warzone-mw3-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kar98k sniper rifle</a>‘s return, so dropping this teaser to build hype before the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/when-does-mw3-and-warzone-season-4-start/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 4</a> blog drops seems like the perfect way to get people ready for the seasonal update. Personally, I’m all aboard the hype train on this one, and I’m counting down the minutes until the blog drops, which is expected this week. </p>

Delta, the popular app that allows users to emulate thousands of Nintendo games on iPhone and iPad, has finally found itself in legal hot water - but not from Nintendo itself. 
</p>
<p>
Instead, Delta's developers were accused of copying their app's icon from Adobe, the company behind PhotoShop - and have now rushed to change it to avoid being kicked off the App Store by Apple.
</p>
<p>
"Adobe threatened legal action unless we changed our app icon - so we did!" the app wrote in its latest patch notes, explaining its hastily-changed icon design. "Hope y'all like it!"

<p>
The drama unfolded earlier this month in a succession of emails to Delta, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/17/24159268/delta-emulator-logo-change-app">The Verge</a> reported - firstly from Adobe's lawyers and then a day later from Apple itself, saying the app risked being delisted.
</p>
<p>
Adobe claimed Alpha's triangle-with-a-bit-cut-out logo was similar to its own triangle-with-a-bit-cut-out design. And, looking at them side-by-side, you can see the similarity.
</p>
<p>
But these logos are based on entirely different letters, Delta argued - while still changing its look to a scrambled version of its original as a placeholder.
</p>

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Untitled-1_4WOrJvq.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

</figure>
<p>
"We responded to both Apple and Adobe explaining our icon was a stylised Greek letter delta - not an A - but that we would update the Delta logo anyway to avoid confusion," Delta creator Riley Testut said.
</p>
<p>
Delta topped the iPhone App Store last month, following Apple's recent change in app store policy to officially allow video game emulator apps onto its storefront for the first time.
</p>
<p>
The app allows users to play downloaded ROMs of classics from the NES, SNES, N64 home consoles, as well as Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS handhelds.
</p>
<p>
It's not the first App Store emulator to get into trouble. Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apple-pulls-iphone-gba-emulator-but-not-because-it-encourages-piracy">Apple pulled another Nintendo emulator</a> after it was discovered that the app itself was based on another emulator's code.
</p>
<p>
Last week, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/now-theres-a-ps1-emulator-rising-up-the-iphone-app-store-charts">free PS1 emulator for iPhone and iPad named Gamma</a> was also launched.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer previously contacted Nintendo for its stance on app store emulators, and was pointed to industry body Video Games Europe for a response.
</p>
<p>
"The industry is committed to protecting the creativity and hard work of video game developers," a Video Games Europe spokesperson said. "Illegal circumvention of copyright protections or engaging in copyright piracy stifles innovation and hampers the development of the entertainment experiences that are enjoyed by millions of players around the world."
</p>
<p>
Could more Nintendo consoles be emulated on iPhone in the future? Not for now, according to Nintendo hacker and dataminer OatmealDome, who has demonstrated that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gamecube-and-wii-emulation-on-iphone-unlikely-due-to-technical-constraints-rather-than-piracy-concerns">GameCube and Wii emulation on iPhone is unlikely</a> due to technical constraints.

            <p>
Fans have released Mario Builder 64, a PC toolbox to create levels based on the N64 classic.
</p>
<p>
Where Nintendo's own Super Mario Maker games allow players to create 2D courses using NES, SNES and modern visuals, <a href="https://romhacking.com/hack/mario-builder-64">Mario Builder 64</a> allows for 3D courses filled with familiar assets, enemies, and stars to hunt for - all running on N64 open source.

</p>
<p>
A trailer for the game shows building and Mario platforming in action and has since gone viral.
</p>

<p>

The game allows players to build levels using what seems to be an intuitive interface, selecting from plenty of platform assets as well as environmental themes and skyboxes. The trailer includes obstacle course-like levels floating in the sky, as well as levels that feel more open world and underwater levels.
</p>
<p>
Levels are then uploaded and available for others to play. The trailer shows off a selection, including red coin challenges, bosses and exploration-focused levels, speed-run levels and more.
</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Mario Builder 64 has been released. Much time and effort was poured into this project and I couldn't be happier to share it with all of you.

<p>
In short, this is spectacular and a clear evolutionary step for the Mario Maker series.
</p>
<p>
Will Nintendo allow Mario Builder 64 to survive? Unlikely, but perhaps somewhere there's an official equivalent in the works? Please?!
</p>
<p>
Nintendo fans have already been playing ROMs on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/popular-iphone-emulator-in-legal-trouble-but-not-from-nintendo">Delta emulator app on iPhone</a>, which has proven particularly popular.

</p>
<p>
Super Mario 64 was, of course, a launch game for the N64 in 1997 (in Europe), but 27 years later <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-27-years-super-mario-64s-last-remaining-locked-door-has-finally-been-opened">its last remaining locked door has finally been opened</a>.

</p>
<p>
The first Super Mario Maker was released on WiiU in 2015 and was followed up by a Switch sequel in 2019. "A quirky and powerful construction toy that's fun to play with even if you aren't trying to make anything," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/super-mario-maker-2-review-whether-youre-building-or-not-this-is-a-joy">Eurogamer Super Mario Maker 2 review</a>.

</p>
<p>
A 3D evolution would make a great addition to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-makes-first-switch-2-announcement">Switch 2</a>, though don't expect that console until next year at least.

            <p>20 years after leaving Elder Scrolls, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/starfield-tips-guide">Starfield</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> makers Bethesda Game Studios, veteran writer and quest designer Douglas Goodall has returned to classic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG </a><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind">Morrowind</a> with an expansive new quest mod.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/54525?tab=description">Red Wisdom: An Ashlander Prophecy</a> - which features writing from Goodall under secret cyberpunk alias AFFA - offers players the chance to "Join forces with wide-eyed Nirani to unlock the hidden truths that lie within the sacred burial sites of the tribes." The project - which you can find over at NexusMods - is a collaboration with fellow modders Greatness7 and Melchior Dahrk. Melchior Dahrk especially looks to be an extremely prolific modder, with <a href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/MelchiorDahrk/mods?gameId=100">99 projects</a> under their belt, most of them for Morrowind. "Explore a new angle to Ashlander lore, confront wild beasts and Daedric interlopers, and piece together the puzzle which may shape the fate of Morrowind," the page continues. Here are some more details, straight from the Silt Strider’s proboscis:</p>
<blockquote><p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing by AFFA aka Douglas Goodall</li>
<li>Explore a brand new grotto used by the Ahemmusa tribe to "bury" their dead</li>
<li>Visit the exterior burial sites of the Erabenimsun and Zainab tribes</li>
<li>Collect four elemental-themed Ashlander trinkets - all with custom art</li>
<li>Experience new Ashlander lore through the trials of a young Wise Woman apprentice</li>
<li>Interoperability features like tooltips, achievements, graphic herbalism, and quest notification icons</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Goodall has previously released a <a href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/AFFA/mods?gameId=100">trio of smaller mods</a> for Morrowind, one of which added "about 30" low level quests. Cheers for the spot, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/20-years-after-quitting-bethesda-veteran-morrowind-dev-returns-to-the-funky-rpg-to-create-new-mods/">Games Radar</a>. Between the mod, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ardenfall">Ardenfall </a>demo, and the recently-released <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dread-delusion">Dread Delusion</a>, you can now spend the weekend pretending its 2002 again - one that contains the "Morrowind of another timeline," <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/who-needs-a-morrowind-remake-when-you-can-explore-the-beautiful-nightmare-of-dread-delusion">reckons Brendy</a>. Two Morrowinds in the same timeline sounds like a paradox waiting to happen, but at least you’ll have options while history strains to reconfigure itself around you.</p>

        <p>The offer is reportedly expected to be £2.2 billion</p>

</header>  <div>



            <p>Keywords Studios has confirmed it's in "advanced discussions" with private equity firm EQT to buy the developer.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/75886c5a-0f4f-4573-8844-a62efd518a68">Financial Times</a>, the offer is expected to be £2.2 billion. EQT is negotiating a cash offer of £25.5 per share.</p>
<p>In a statement issued this morning, Keywords said EQT previously approached the studio with four "unsolicited proposals" which were rejected, but this one is a "significant increase" from the initial proposal, Keywords' board said, and one it "would be minded to recommend" to the company's shareholders.</p>
<p>For now, shareholders are "strongly advised to take no action."</p>
<p>The EQT Group has until June 15 to make a formal offer.</p>
<p>"The board remains confident in the company's growth strategy of building the only truly global platform providing solutions to the video games and entertainment industries, both organically and through acquisitions, and EQT is supportive of this strategy," the developer's board said.</p>
<p>Keyword Studios has grown its services empire significantly in recent years with a number of acquisitions, the most recent being the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/keywords-acquires-the-multiplayer-group-from-improbable-for-765m">purchase of The Multiplayer Guys from Improbable for £76.5 million</a>.</p>
<p>The company has over 70 facilities around the world, offering services such as QA, localisation, art, audio, marketing, and game development.</p>

        <p>But Digital segment beat all forecasts and expects 384% rise in profit next fiscal year</p>

</header>  <div>



            <p>Bandai Namco has released its full-year financial results, showing a solid year for its overall business in the face of declines from its video games segment.</p>
<p>The Japanese publisher recorded record high net sales of <strong> </strong>¥1.05 trillion ($6.74 billion) and saw full-year profit rise more than 12% to ¥101.4 billion ($651.4 million).</p>
<p>But while the Digital segment, which handles Bandai Namco's video game operations, saw both sales and profit fall year-on-year, all of its results were ahead of previous forecasts — by ¥5.2 billion ($33.4 million) in the case of profit.</p>
<p>The publisher expects a stronger performance from its video games business for the year ending March 31, 2023.</p>
<h2>The numbers</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net sales: </strong>¥1.05 trillion ($6.74 billion, up 6%)</li>
<li><strong>Operating profit: </strong>¥90.6 billion ($582 million, down 22%)</li>
<li><strong>Net profit: </strong>¥101.4 billion ($651.4 million, up 12.3%)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Digital (incl. video games)</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net sales: </strong>¥372.6 billion ($2.39 billion, down -3.4%%)</li>
<li><strong>Profit: </strong>¥6.2 billion ($39.8 million, down 87%)</li>
</ul>
<h2>The highlights</h2>
<p>Bandai Namco reported "favourable sales" for its biggest home console releases, Armored Core 6 and Tekken 8, as well as strong contributions from its mobile apps, but noted that its PC online games fell short of their targets.</p>
<p>The publisher also noted that it recorded both a valuation loss and disposal loss during the fiscal year. This was due to a reevaluation of its title lineup in Digital, which was part of its current Mid-Term Plan to improve operating profitability.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the publisher has strong expectations for Elden Ring's Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, which releases on June 21, and teased that it will release "several new titles" in the second half, which should improve its performance in the new fiscal year.</p>
<p>Most of the growth for the fiscal year ended March 2024 came from its Toys &amp; Hobby segment, with sales of Gundam figures and new trading card games for One Piece and Dragon Ball cited as key successes.</p>
<p>Despite the declines in certain segments and overall operating profit, Bandai Namco beat its forecasts for total net sales, operating profit and net profit.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the company expects to grow overall next year, although is forecasting a 20% drop in profits. However, its Digital profits are expected to increase by 384% year-on-year.</p>
<h2>The forecast</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net sales: </strong>¥1.08 trillion ($6.9 billion, up 2.8%%)</li>
<li><strong>Operating profit: </strong>¥115 billion ($738.7 million, up 27%%)</li>
<li><strong>Net profit: </strong>¥81 billion ($520.3 million, down 20%)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Digital (incl. video games)</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net sales: </strong>¥370 billion ($2.38 billion, down -0.6%%)</li>
<li><strong>Profit: </strong>¥30 billion ($192.7 million, up 384%)</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-has-entered-adjustment-phase-voice-acting-and-motion-capture-finished/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Death Stranding 2 has entered an adjustment phase that will last for roughly one year, according to creator Hideo Kojima.</p>
<p>That's what Kojima said during the most recent episode of his NHK radio show “Hideo Kojima’s Radio: Infinity” (<a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202405/5569" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via</a> Famitsu, and <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/death-stranding-2-filming-completed-according-to-hideo-kojima/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">picked up</a> by Automaton Media). During the broadcast of the show's second episode, the legendary designer talked about the Death Stranding sequel and revealed that shooting and recording with the cast has been completed. In addition, Kojima mentioned that the game will now enter an adjustment phase, during which he and his team will be refining transitions between scenes and controls, as well as improving the game’s overall clarity and entertainment value.</p>
<p>Death Stranding 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is slated for</a> a release on PS5 sometime next year. An exact release date has yet to be announced. An exciting <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-trailer-state-of-play-release-window/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new trailer</a> for the game (including the confirmation of the 2025 release window) was released back in January of this year. Interestingly, during the NHK radio show broadcast, Kojima also talked about this trailer, and said that he wanted to show off the game's theme, overall look as well as gameplay. In addition, Kojima said that he wanted to show that the characters are connected to each other. We've included January's trailer, as debuted during PlayStation's State of Play event, below:</p>
<p><iframe title="Death Stranding 2 On The Beach - State of Play Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wbLstJHlC4U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>DEATH STRANDING 2: ON THE BEACH sees Norman Reedus, Léa Seydoux, and Troy Baker return to Hideo Kojima’s genre defying universe. They will be joined by Elle Fanning, Shioli Kutsuna, and Academy Award-winning film director George Miller.<br>
</em><em>Hideo Kojima is joined by longtime collaborator Yoji Shinkawa who will direct character and mechanical design, with Ludvig Forssell and Kyle Cooper reprising their roles as musical director and title designer, respectively.</em></p>
<p>After various rumors, Death Stranding 2 was first teased during The Game Awards 2022. The game is the sequel to 2019's Death Stranding.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-sets-new-concurrent-player-peak-record-for-sonys-single-player-games-on-steam/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-sets-new-concurrent-player-peak-record-for-sonys-single-player-games-on-steam/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been just four days since Ghost of Tsushima DIRECTOR's CUT launched on PC, and already, it looks like another win for Sony.</p>
<p>Around twelve hours ago, SteamDB <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2215430/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registered</a> a new concurrent player peak record for the game. At 77K users, Ghost of Tsushima DIRECTOR's Cut has surpassed Sony Santa Monica's God of War, which peaked at 75K. Of course, Helldivers 2 is in another league entirely with its peak of 458K concurrent users from three months ago. Then again, Helldivers 2 is a purely online game, a category that regularly dominates Steam charts. While Ghost of Tsushima offers a cooperative multiplayer mode called Legends, it was added for free post-launch as more of a thank-you for players. The game's meat and bones is the vast single player campaign.</p>
<p>User reception has also been favorable. 88% of the over nine thousand user reviews are positive, thanks to the polished port delivered by Nixxes. The game offers features like <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-pc-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, DLSS Frame Generation, DLAA</a>, NVIDIA Reflex, AMD FSR Frame Generation, and Intel XeSS. PC gamers can also <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-pc-dlss-upscaling-fsr-3-frame-gen-simultaneous/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mix and match upscalers</a>; the creator of benchmarking software CapFrameX mentioned getting over 100FPS at 3840x1600 with an Intel Arc A770 card on High Settings, Intel XeSS set to Quality, and AMD FSR Frame Generation enabled.</p>
<p>If you aren't familiar with Ghost of Tsushima, here's what I thought of the game when I <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-tsushima-duty-heavier-than-a-mountain-death-lighter-than-a-feather/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reviewed it</a> for PlayStation 4, rating it 9/10:</p>
<p><em>Ghost of Tsushima is Sucker Punch's best game yet and a great open world title capable of measuring to some of the biggest names in the genre. The excellent rendition of feudal Japan, along with its well-written characters and story, make Ghost of Tsushima stand out as the last must-have PlayStation 4 exclusive.</em></p>
<p>The game was also a great commercial success, selling nearly 10 million copies in the first two years after its debut on the console. John Wick director Chad Stahelski is even <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-movie-in-production-to-be-directed-by-john-wicks-chad-stahelski/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">directing a live-action adaptation</a>.</p>

            <p>This week on RPS: secret plans and clever tricks. Also, a bunch of new videogames, none of them particularly Enormous or Crocodilian. We open on Monday 20th May with the extremely Alice B-friendly combo of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2521600/LittleKnown_Galaxy/">Little-Known Galaxy</a>, aka <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-sweet-life-sim-is-stardew-meets-star-trek-and-you-can-try-the-demo-now">Stardew Valley meets Star Trek</a>, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2179170/A_Tower_Full_of_Cats/">A Tower Full Of Cats</a>, a hidden object puzzler featuring a tower full of dogs, I mean cats. All very upbeat. Well, hold that thought, because on the 21st, it's time for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii">Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2</a>, another slice of Celtic sort-of-psychosis from Ninja Theory, which is as grim as the accompanying <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paper-trail">Paper Trail</a> is *checks Nic's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paper-trail-review">review</a>* incredibly annoying?</p> <!--more-->
<p>On 22nd May there's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2153750/Venture_to_the_Vile/">Venture To The Vile</a>, a 2.5D metroidvania which is already doing a nice line in background animations and scenery, <a href="https://rkgk.com/">RKGK/Rakugaki</a>, a 3D platformer in which you are a graffiti artist tagging up a neo-brutalist city, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/isles-of-sea-and-sky">Isles Of Sea &amp; Sky</a>, which is Zelda but also sokoban. 23rd May introduces the long-anticipated <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hauntii">Hauntii</a>, a ghostly twin-stick puzzle-shooter rendered in two-tone line art, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1658920/Crown_Wars_The_Black_Prince/">Crown Wars: The Black Prince</a>, which is sort of XCOM but French and from the 14th century. On the 24th, there's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2882440/DEVIL_BLADE_REBOOT/">a reboot of Devil Blade</a>, a 1996 shmup with a pretty glorious mix of sprites and 3D environments.</p>
<p>As ever, these recommendations are but the perishable emissions of our crumbling mortal intellects, and we have doubtless skimmed over one or more videogames of note. I trust you'll be getting all up in my grill about that in the comments. Also as ever, this week's videogames are manna for the Maw, that atrocious quantum edifice of famine and plunder, which we must once again try to appease by means of the below newsblog. I've been working on a glossary of Maw vocalisations. I'm pretty sure that "BZZTYGHTAHJHJ" is Mawese for "Fallout 5 release date", while "xh'nglar ghhgrhjw'nafh" means "is Wuthering Wave leftist" and "EEEEEEEEEEEEE" translates to "Microsoft opens new studio". Have a fun week all.</p>

    In a stunning coincidence primarily of interest to me only, Steam has 3 Legacy Of Kain Games for under a quid each, and GOG has the other (Blood Omen), also for under a quid - or around 85% off all round. With all the money you save, you could buy a beanbag to sit in and sulk about the lack of Soul Reaver 1.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-release-date-possibly-leaked-via-publisher%E2%80%99s-website.875448/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-release-date/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Dragon Ball Sparking Zero release date might very well have been leaked via Bandai Namco's own website.</p>
<p>Last week we covered <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-2024-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new rating</a> for the upcoming fighting title, which suggests that the game isn't that far out. Fast forward a couple of days and we might now have a more exact release date - October 1st, 2024. At least, that's what a datamine from Bandai Namco's website appears to hint at. As <a href="https://x.com/SrgioM3/status/1791878710162755999" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> by X user and YouTuber&nbsp;<span><a dir="ltr" role="link" href="https://x.com/SrgioM3">@SrgioM3 </a>(and <a href="https://x.com/DbsHype" target="_blank" rel="noopener">picked up</a> by X user @DbsHype), the publisher's website mentions an October 1st release for the game, which suggests that Dragon Ball Sparking Zero (from the Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi series) will be out in less than five months from now. We've included the video that @SrgioM3 made on the game's release date below:</span></p>
<p><iframe title="EXACT Release Date | Dragon Ball Z Sparking Zero (Datamine)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K6u7BzD-OOU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Of course, this could merely be a placeholder date, but other entries in the series, including&nbsp;<span>Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi (originally published as Dragon Ball Z: Sparking!),&nbsp;</span><span>Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 2, and&nbsp;</span><span id="Dragon_Ball_Z:_Budokai_Tenkaichi_3_(2007)">Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3, were all released in October (in Japan). We'll update you as soon as we learn more about Dragon Ball Sparking Zero.</span></p>
<p>Sparking Zero, the newest entry in the Budokai Tenkaichi series was officially announced back in December of last year. The game will be powered by Unreal Engine 5, and is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC (via Steam).</p>
<p>“This is the DRAGON BALL fighting game players have been waiting for, bringing a new sequel for one of the most beloved game series based on the franchise to a new generation of players,” said Mike Chang, VP of marketing and Digital Business, Bandai Namco Entertainment America Inc., upon the game's announcement. “It has been more than 15 years since DRAGON BALL Z: Budokai Tenkaichi&nbsp;pioneered arena brawlers, and&nbsp;DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO&nbsp;continues the legacy while adding new genre-defining features made possible only with the latest game platforms to deliver one of the most immersive anime game experiences of all time.”</p>
<p>We've included the announcement trailer alongside some of the game's main features below:</p>
<ul>
<li role="presentation">DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO&nbsp;brings back the revered 3D action battle game series previously known as Budokai Tenkaichi&nbsp;in the West</li>
<li role="presentation">Arriving on new-gen consoles and PC, this is the first entry in the series since Budokai Tenkaichi&nbsp;3&nbsp;released in 2007 on PlayStation 2</li>
<li role="presentation">Engage in exhilarating battles with exceptional visual fidelity, fighting arenas with destructible environments, and an incredible roster of DRAGON BALL fighters</li>
</ul>

<p data-characters="256" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The Pokemon Company has revealed <em>Pokemon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet – Shrouded Fable</em>, the next set in the beloved TCG. This set will add a selection of new cards in August 2024, some of which were first seen in <em>The Hidden Treasures of Area Zero</em> DLCs. </p> <p data-characters="487" data-current-count="487" data-injectable="true"><em>Pokemon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet – Shrouded Fable</em> is set to add a bunch of new cards for competitive players to add to their decks and experiment with, as well as some <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/rarest-pokemon-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">incredibly desirable collectibles</a>. Perhaps most exciting of all, it’s going to add a new foil variant to shiny cards that are going to make foil pulls from packs even more exciting. All <em>Pokemon TCG</em> fans should be keeping an eye on this one because it’s going to really change the game when it drops. </p>
 <h2 id="h-when-is-the-release-date-for-pokemon-tcg-scarlet-violet-shrouded-fable" data-injectable="false">When is the release date for <em>Pokemon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet – Shrouded Fable</em>?</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="337" data-current-count="637" data-injectable="true"><strong>The release date for the <em>Pokemon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet – Shrouded Fable</em> is August 2, 2024.</strong> This is when retailers will be able to sell products from the set, though there could be prerelease events leading up to that date that will allow fans to get their hands on cards early, depending on what their local game stores offer. </p>
 <p data-characters="151" data-current-count="151" data-injectable="false">The only exception to this is the <strong><em>Pokemon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet – Shrouded Fable</em> Booster Bundle, which will go on sale on September 6, 2024.</strong> </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">What is the <em>Pokemon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet – Shrouded Fable</em> set?</h2> <figure data-current-count="451" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="297" data-current-count="297" data-injectable="false"><strong>The <em>Pokemon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet – Shrouded Fable</em> set will introduce brand new aspects to the TCG, including Pecharunt.</strong> This Pokemon was originally discovered in <em>The Hidden Treasures of Area Zero</em> DLCs for <em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet</em>, and it’s coming to the TCG as a Darkness-Type. </p> <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="621" data-injectable="true">Players will be able to use Pecharunt ex to let them switch in another Darkness-Type Pokemon that’s currently benched with its Subjugating Chains ability. It can also be paired with the Pokemon you’ll recognize from when you first encountered it, Okidogi ex, Munkidori ex, and Fezandipiti ex for various combos. </p>
 <p data-characters="501" data-current-count="501" data-injectable="true">What I think might be the most exciting part of this set is the fact that it adds another unique foil pattern. These will still be Parallel Foils, but they’ll feature a new foil style surrounding the artwork of the card. You can check if you get one of these using the expansion code in the bottom left-hand corner of the card. It should show an illustrated white box with black text if it’s one of these new variants from the <em>Pokemon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet – Shrouded Fable</em> set. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Where to buy the <em>Pokemon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet – Shrouded Fable</em> set</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="405" data-current-count="705" data-injectable="true"><strong>Your local game store is the best place to purchase any products from the <em>Pokemon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet – Shrouded Fable</em> set.</strong> These stores help keep the game alive and offer exclusive opportunities to collectors. However, they’re not available to everyone, especially if you live out in the sticks like me. So, for those of you who need an online retailer, these are the best ones to use. </p>
 <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="120" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong><a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Pokemon Center Online</a> (US &amp; UK)</strong>: The Pokemon Center Online is the most reliable retailer of <em>Pokemon TCG</em> products. It’s also a great place to check in for exclusive products that you might not be able to get elsewhere. I’ve seen particularly good deals on there from time to time, but they sell out fast. </li> <li><strong><a href="https://www.chaoscards.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chaos Cards</a> (US &amp; UK)</strong>: I’ve used Chaos Cards before for TCG products, and they’ve always delivered my goods on time. This is a good retailer to choose from when it comes to pre-orders because you can collect points to get discounts on future purchases. </li> <li><strong><a href="https://magicmadhouse.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Magic Madhouse</a> (US &amp; UK)</strong>: Magic Madhouse is a great retailer from which to get TCG products, provided you pre-order them early. If you don’t, you’ll be paying a premium. However, everything I’ve ever ordered has always arrived on time and intact, which is the most important thing. </li> </ul>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/deck-archetypes-in-magic-the-gathering-explained.875319/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/deck-archetypes-in-magic-the-gathering-explained/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=deck-archetypes-in-magic-the-gathering-explained<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="467" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Learning the rules of how to play <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> is all you need to do in order to have fun at most tables. But at some point in your journey as a Planeswalker, you may run into an opponent whose deck always has the upper hand against yours. This boils down to the balancing system within MTG, which, like many competitive games, is roughly based on a “Rock, Paper, Scissors” system. The concept is easy to follow, but it isn’t as simple as it sounds.</p> <p data-characters="445" data-current-count="445" data-injectable="true">In <em>Magic: The Gathering,</em> there are numerous <strong>deck archetypes</strong> that represent our rock, paper, and scissors. At the core of MTG (and other card and video games), there are three primary archetypes: Aggro, Control, and Combo. This guide will go over these three archetypes and the Keyword Abilities that contribute to their success. By the end, you’ll be able to identify the archetype of any given deck, along with its strengths and weaknesses.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-the-three-core-deck-archetypes-in-magic-the-gathering-mtg" data-injectable="false">The three core deck archetypes in <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> (MTG)</h2> <h3 data-injectable="false"><strong>Aggro</strong> (Aggressive) deck archetypes in MTG</h3> <p data-characters="400" data-current-count="700" data-injectable="true">Starting with one of the easiest-to-understand archetypes, Aggro decks are everything that you think of when you hear “aggressive.” The strategy is to be in your opponent’s face, hitting hard and fast. To do this, Aggro decks primarily contain cards of the <strong>Red</strong> mana color due to its cheap creatures and<strong> Burn</strong> spells (such as Lightning Bolt) which are capable of dealing raw damage to any target.</p>
 <p data-characters="387" data-current-count="387" data-injectable="false">Some abilities that thrive in Aggro decks are <strong>Haste</strong>, <strong>Prowess</strong>, and <strong>Trample</strong>. These abilities allow creatures to dish out damage quickly and efficiently. Remember, the goal of an Aggro deck is to be fast and overwhelm your opponents before they have a chance to establish themselves. You’ll be looking to swing (attack) with all of your creatures in every combat phase, if possible.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="537" data-current-count="924" data-injectable="true">Although most Aggro decks in MTG use Red cards, that isn’t to say that other colors can’t be used to build aggressive decks. One of the weaknesses of Red cards is the lack of removal and denial options. Pairing Red with colors that cover its shortcomings, such as Black or Blue, will make for a slightly less aggressive but more well-rounded deck. The popular <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-magic-the-gathering-color-combination-names-explained/">Gruul Aggro combination</a> uses Red cards to establish an early board advantage and then uses enchants and +1/+1 counters from <strong>Green</strong> cards to form a powerful mid-game roster.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="212" data-current-count="212" data-injectable="false">If you can’t defeat your opponent quickly enough, your army of small creatures won’t be able to stand up against the fearsome monstrosities built by<strong> Ramp</strong> decks or the various gimmicks that <strong>Combo</strong> decks employ.</p> <h3 data-injectable="false"><strong>Combo</strong> deck archetypes in MTG</h3> <p data-characters="463" data-current-count="675" data-injectable="true">Combo decks are the paper to Aggro decks’ rock, but that metaphor doesn’t paint the whole picture. Your strategy becomes a matter of putting together the pieces of a puzzle. Reliably drawing those pieces and defending your work in progress are the keys to being a successful Combo player. This is why Combo archetypes in MTG perform so well against Aggro strategies; There isn’t a fear of a Counterspell or Exile card awaiting your grand finale.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="230" data-current-count="230" data-injectable="false">Each Combo deck has an overall win condition, with most having a few lesser combos included. While there isn’t a particular color that is overrepresented in Combo decks, there are many boxes that need to be checked to succeed.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="60" data-current-count="290" data-injectable="false">Helpful spells and abilities for Combo decks in MTG include:</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="410" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Tutor </strong>cards allow you to search your library for specific card types.</li> <li>Spells or permanents with <strong>Hexproof</strong>, <strong>Indestructible</strong>, or <strong>Ward</strong>, which effectively increases the cost to target a permanent with spells or abilities.</li> <li>Triggers or abilities such as “enter the battlefield (ETB)” or “Whenever you…” provide a focus for the deck to be built around.</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="221" data-current-count="221" data-injectable="false">An example of a win condition for a Combo deck would be <strong>Revel in Riches</strong>. By utilizing the <strong>Pirates</strong> tribe and their various means of <strong>Treasure</strong> generation or cards such as <strong>Brass’s Bounty</strong>, victory is easily attainable.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="221" data-injectable="false"> <figure><figcaption>Image via Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <figure><figcaption>Image via Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <figure><figcaption>Image via Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> </figure> <p data-characters="490" data-current-count="711" data-injectable="true">With an ideal starting hand, Combo decks easily spiral out of control and become a dominant force at the table– or simply win the game. But as we mentioned at the beginning of this guide, this concept is only simple on paper. While Combo strategies excel against Aggro decks, they fall victim to the disruption that <strong>Control </strong>archetypes specialize in. A simple Counterspell or various forms of removal could put a stop to a Combo deck before it has the chance to get the ball rolling.&nbsp;</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false"><strong>Control</strong> deck archetypes in MTG</h3> <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="309" data-injectable="false">With a Control deck, you’re disrupting the opponents’ strategy in every way that you can. This is done with <strong>Counterspells</strong>, forms of removal such as <strong>Destroy</strong> or <strong>Exile</strong> cards, or advanced strategies such as <strong>Mill</strong> or <strong>Discard</strong>. It’s because of these tools that Combo decks fear going up against Control decks.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="224" data-current-count="533" data-injectable="true">Colors that are synonymous with Control decks are Blue, White, and Black. Each of these colors provides the means to put a stop to any deck strategy out there– so long as you have the cards in hand and mana to spare.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="62" data-current-count="62" data-injectable="false">Helpful spells and abilities for Control decks in MTG include:</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="182" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Scry</strong> and <strong>Surveil</strong> cards along with sources of card <strong>Draw</strong> in order to keep a healthy amount of solutions in your hand to address any issues that arise.</li> <li>Removal cards range from soft-removal options such as <strong>Bounce</strong> (return target permanent to its owner’s hand) to hard-removal in the form of <strong>Destroy</strong> or <strong>Exile</strong> cards.</li> <li>Abilities that effectively increase the number of spells at your disposal. These would be Flashback or Magecraft spells or any card that allows you to “return Instant or Sorcery cards from your graveyard.”&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p data-characters="487" data-current-count="669" data-injectable="true">But while Control decks seem to have all of the solutions for dealing with other deck archetypes, they struggle to close out games on their own. Control decks are notorious for running very few creatures, which greatly limits their offensive capabilities and makes defending those creatures a necessary task for victory. Many Control players resort to unconventional win conditions such as<strong> Laboratory Maniac</strong> or the various <strong>Jace Planeswalkers</strong> and their card drawing and milling mechanics.</p>
 <p data-characters="399" data-current-count="399" data-injectable="false">Control decks can easily dismantle the strategies of Combo decks but struggle to keep up with the output of creatures and spells cast by Aggro players. Players of Control decks will frequently lose mana advantage to Aggro players due to the cost differences between the two. Eventually, Control players will run out of answers to Aggro players’ numerous questions, and defeat becomes inevitable.&nbsp;</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Other deck archetypes in <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> (MTG)</h2> <p data-characters="349" data-current-count="748" data-injectable="true">Aggro, Combo, and Control archetypes are the foundation of many decks within MTG. There are a vast number of strategies that build off of one or a combination of multiple archetypes to create a unique playstyle. Archetypes such as <strong>Tempo</strong> or <strong>Midrange</strong> fuse the strategies of Aggro and Control decks but deploy them at opposing stages of the game.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="254" data-injectable="false">Wizards of the Coast continues to expand the number of archetypes that exist in the game by<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/magic-the-gathering-ever-set-released/"> introducing new abilities with every set</a>. But at its core, <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> will forever be one of the most captivating games of Rock, Paper, Scissors ever.&nbsp;</p>

            <title><![CDATA[MW3 Cut Credits Scene Appears After 13 Years and Changes the Ending]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/mw3-cut-credits-scene-surfaces/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mw3-cut-credits-scene-appears-after-13-years-and-changes-the-ending.875313/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/mw3-cut-credits-scene-surfaces/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Modern Warfare 3 (2011) was the ultimate ending to one of the greatest trilogies in the history of the franchise. It was a monumental run from start to finish, taking players from COD 4: Modern Warfare in 2007 to the grand finale in 2011’s MW3. In the middle, we were blessed to receive Modern Warfare 2, widely considered to be the best Call of Duty game ever (perhaps behind Black Ops).</p>



<p>Now, thirteen years after Modern Warfare 3 was released, a cut post-credits scene has emerged online, showcasing a subtle change that brings about a massively different ending for the 2011 game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-small-but-mighty">Small but Mighty</h2>



<p>At the end of Modern Warfare 3, Captain Price finally thwarts Vladimir Makarov, securing justice in the most poetic (and brutal) way possible. As he sits back and marvels at his work, he pulls out his trademark cigar, lights up, and then the screen fades to black, with the game simply drifting away, marking an end to the trilogy.</p>



<p>However, in the new clip that has surfaced online – which is a total of 60 seconds long – we see the same sequence unfold, but there are a couple of minor differences.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="MW3 Cut Post-Credits Scene (4K)" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/De7Axarv12E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Across the room, we see a shadowy, suited figure appear, which many have claimed is a representation of Death. His identity is never confirmed as he looks at the scene before him and walks off, with Captain Price losing grip of his cigar and having it roll to the floor, before again, the game fades into darkness. We then see a picture of the four key characters we followed through the trilogy, which is a nod to the fact that they’ve all met their untimely end.</p>



<p>Only Infinity Ward knows the identity of this figure, as the content was ultimately cut from the game and never saw the light of day – until now.</p>
