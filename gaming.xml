            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new report has claimed that long-awaited PlayStation 5 version of Starfield will be releasing in April 2026.</p>



<p>That’s according to a new report from <a href="https://www.ppe.pl/news/398522/potwierdzamy-starfield-na-ps5-premiera-za-rowne-dwa-miesiace.html" type="link" id="https://www.ppe.pl/news/398522/potwierdzamy-starfield-na-ps5-premiera-za-rowne-dwa-miesiace.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PPE</a>, which obtained internal documentation from a video game distributor revealing that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-2026-update-rumoured-to-bring-quicker-space-flights-ps5-switch-2-ports-and-more/" type="link" id="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-2026-update-rumoured-to-bring-quicker-space-flights-ps5-switch-2-ports-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Starfield is scheduled to launch on the PlayStation 5</a> on April 7, 2026.</p>



<p>While not confirmed in the report, it’s likely that the PlayStation 5 release will be a part of the long-awaited ‘Starfield 2.0’ update, which was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-2-0-could-be-real-after-all/" type="link" id="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-2-0-could-be-real-after-all/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shown to the press a few months ago</a>.</p>



<p>It’s worth mentioning that PPE has had a good track record of leaking information related to physical game releases, however yesterday’s Take-Two Interactive call debunked their claims that GTA 6 would avoid physical game releases on launch.</p>



<p>That being said, PPE did provide a screenshot of what appears to be an internal system, showing that Starfield is going to release on April 7.</p>



<p>It isn’t quite clear what the update will bring, but according to rumours, Starfield’s massive update is set to deliver a major overhaul to the game, in addition to its second major expansion, ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/terran-armada-bethesda-starfield-anniversary-post/" type="link" id="https://insider-gaming.com/terran-armada-bethesda-starfield-anniversary-post/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Terran Armada</a>‘.</p>



<p>It’s currently unclear whether the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-next-year/" type="link" id="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumoured Switch 2 version</a> of the game will also release at the same time. <a href="https://xboxera.com/2024/02/04/exclusive-microsoft-plans-starfield-launch-for-playstation-5/" type="link" id="https://xboxera.com/2024/02/04/exclusive-microsoft-plans-starfield-launch-for-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">XboxEra</a> was the first to report on a planned Starfield version for the PlayStation 5 in February 2024.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> has received a PEGI rating for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, hinting towards a port to the latest Nintendo console.</p>
<p>As can be seen<a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?q=Hollow+Knight"> on the PEGI website</a>, the beloved metroidvania can be seen rated across all its console versions. However, if you peer down at the base version of Hollow Knight (not the Voidheart Edition) you can see a Switch 2 version rated today, the 5th February 2026.</p>
<p>This comes at a peculiar time, as we have a Nintendo Partner Direct to look forward to later today at 2PM GMT / 3PM CEST / 6AM PST / 9AM EST. Perhaps this is a early indicator of a reveal to come.</p>

<p>Hollow Knight hasn't become a household name without cause. The game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whats-so-special-about-the-original-hollow-knight-the-intoxicating-power-of-team-cherrys-invisible-insistent-guiding-hand">has an extremely compelling guiding hand</a> that urges players to explore a collection of endearing, often gorgeous, sometimes horrifying, locations that are both lovingly-crafted and packed with weaving narratives.</p><p>If you've not actually played the original Hollow Knight yet, perhaps you jumped first into <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a> or just haven't found the time, it's an absolute must-play. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-a-slick-stylish-and-super-tough-metroidvania">You can read Eurogamer's review of Hollow Knight here</a>, in which Vikki Blake describes the game as: "A stern yet scintillating 2D adventure that makes a point of not holding your hand."</p>

            <p>Original Mario voice actor Charles Martinet has shared more on how he came up with the voice for Nintendo's moustachioed plumber.</p>
<p>Back in 2023, Nintendo announced that Martinet, the exuberant voice of Mario, would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-says-charles-martinet-no-longer-video-game-voice-of-mario">no longer be the English voice actor behind Nintendo's most recognisable mascot</a>, after almost 30 years in the job. Starting with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-bros-wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/internet-briefly-thinks-its-identified-marios-new-voice-actor-until-he-says-no">the role was instead taken on by Kevin Afghani</a>, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/miyamoto-explains-what-charles-martinets-mario-ambassador-job-actually-entails">Martinet became a Mario Ambassador</a>.</p>

</span> </p>
</div>
<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>But, how did Martinet actually come up with the 'whoops' and 'wahoooooos' of Mario? Well, first off, it turns out that Martinet actually crashed Nintendo's audition for Mario without knowing anything about the character. In fact, he didn't even know anything about Nintendo. But even so, he had "so much fun at the audition" many decades ago, and soon his iconic legacy began.</p>
<p>"I was simply told to start talking, and when you run out of things to say, that's your audition," Martinet told <a href="https://www.gamingbible.com/features/mario-actor-interview-never-heard-nintendo-203132-20260203">GamingBible</a>. "I didn't want to do an Italian plumber sounding gruff, mean and nasty or scary to children, like a Mafia member. I didn't know whether the audience would have children in it, but I have a principle of comedy of always being kind. I thought to myself that I'll do something much more silly and fun. I didn't know anything about video games, so I just made things up about food and started talking."</p>
<p>Martinet added that "being able to bring that joy into children's and adults' lives" has been a "tremendous honour" for him.</p>
<p>"When they tell me stories of growing up with Mario, and playing the games with their parents, grandparents, and now their children, it gives me such a feeling of joy that cannot be described. I'm just grateful for those moments every day."</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Since his turn as the voice of Mario in the games, Martinet did have a rather charming cameo in the Super Mario Bros. Movie. Here, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-who-charles-martinet-voices-in-the-super-mario-bros-movie">he voiced Mario and Luigi's father</a>. Mario and Luigi's father appears in multiple scenes during the film's opening section in Brooklyn, and again at the end, when Bowser's castle comes crashing back through to the "human" world.</p>
<p>At one point, we hear Mario and Luigi's father congratulating his sons by saying: "That's my boys!" Awww! I wonder if <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-super-mario-galaxy-movie-direct-unveils-new-characters-that-do-not-disappoint">he will return for The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</a>, as well…?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[After Multiple Delays, Cult Hit 'Caves Of Qud' Is Finally Hitting Switch This Month]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/after-multiple-delays-cult-hit-caves-of-qud-is-finally-hitting-switch-this-month</link>
            <guid>1426327</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Publisher Kitfox Games has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/caves_of_qud">Caves of Qud</a> will finally release on the Nintendo Switch this month on <strong>16th February 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>The title has been a long time coming – 17 years in the making, to be precise – so the recent delays on Switch have felt pretty trivial, thankfully. Toward the end of January, Kitfox stated that the release would likely slip into February as it was awaiting final approval. That's now seemingly happened, and everything is a-go for the 16th.</p>
<p>For those unaware, Caves of Qud is a roguelike RPG developed by Freehold Games. It's received critical acclaim on other platforms for its deep systems, emergent gameplay, and freedom of choice. We're really excited to dive into this one when it launches next month, but if you need a bit more of an overview, here's the official breakdown of key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- Deep Physical Simulation</strong> – Don’t like the wall blocking your way? Dig through it with a pickaxe, or eat through it with your corrosive gas mutation, or melt it to lava. Yes, every wall has a melting point.<br>
<strong><br>
- Fully Simulated Creatures</strong> – Every monster and NPC is as fully simulated as the player. That means they have levels, skills, equipment, faction allegiances, and body parts. So if you have a mutation that lets you, say, psionically dominate a spider, you can traipse through the world as a spider, laying webs and eating things.<br>
<strong><br>
- Dynamic Faction System</strong> – Pursue allegiances with over 70 factions: apes, crabs, trees, robots, and highly entropic beings, just to name a few.<br>
<strong><br>
- Richly Detailed Science Fantasy Setting</strong> – Over fifteen years of worldbuilding have led to a rich, weird, labyrinthine, one-of-a-kind storyworld, layered on top of the simulation, all for you to explore. Live and drink, friend.<br>
<strong><br>
- Tactical Gameplay</strong> – Turn-based, sandbox exploration and combat offers as many solutions as you and your mutations, implants, artifacts, and skills are creative enough to invent.<br>
<strong><br>
- RPG Elements</strong> – Quests, NPCs, villages, historic sites; some dynamic and some handwritten, interwoven to produce a transportative RPG experience.<br>
<strong><br>
- Atmospheric Original Soundtrack</strong> – Over two hours of otherworldly music to delve to.</p>

            <guid>1426321</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Exactly a week after <a href="https://wccftech.com/from-medieval-combat-to-combat-mechs-new-crimson-desert-gameplay-overview-highlights-the-story-pywel-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropping the first 'Features Overview' video dedicated to the open world and story of <strong>Crimson Desert</strong></a>, developer <strong>Pearl Abyss</strong> has released the second entry in the series. The new video dives deep into the action/adventure RPG's combat mechanics and character progression ahead of its <strong>March 19, 2026</strong> launch date. The showcase reveals a combat system designed around fluidity, expressiveness, and player choice, combined with progression paths that, according to the developers, will reward exploration and experimentation.</p>



<p><strong>At the heart of Crimson Desert's combat are weapon variety and seamless skill chaining</strong>. Players can wield an arsenal of weapons, ranging from classic swords and shields to spears, greatswords, axes, and ranged weapons, each offering distinct tactical advantages. Pearl Abyss highlighted that <strong>attacks will flow naturally between weapon strikes, bare-hand combat, kicks, and grapples</strong>, allowing players to build highly customizable combo chains. Elemental enhancements such as burn, freeze, and stun effects further deepen the tactical layer, giving the player tools to adapt to different enemy types and situations.</p>



<p>The developers took great care to ensure mobility played a crucial role in maintaining combat momentum. Slides, dodges, counters, and swings are directly integrated into attack sequences, creating what Pearl Abyss describes as <strong>"combat that feels grounded yet explosive and endlessly expressive."</strong> Perfectly timed guards and dodges don't just protect—they open counter windows that keep players on the offensive. The system rewards skillful timing and positioning over button mashing, encouraging players to master the rhythm of each encounter. Beyond direct combat, the game also features environmental and mount-based combat. <strong>Players can leverage their surroundings and utilize various mounts to shift battlefield dynamics</strong>.</p>



<p>The progression journey begins with protagonist Kliff at his lowest point. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/crimson-desert-everything-we-know-about-the-new-open-world-fantasy-action-adventure-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As mentioned in our game info roundup article</a></strong>, he's a survivor of the Black Bears' devastating assault on the Greymanes with minimal abilities and equipment at his disposal. <strong>Players must gradually rebuild Kliff into a formidable warrior</strong>, with every advancement shaped by player-driven choices.</p>



<p>Central to the character progression in Crimson Desert is the <strong>Artifact System</strong>, where <strong>Abyss fragments collected from quests, boss victories, and exploration unlock core stat boosts like Health and Stamina increases</strong>. These fragments also grant new skills that extend combo chains and enhance existing abilities. In a nice twist, some advanced techniques require players to observe them firsthand in the world before they can be learned.</p>



<p>Each player will most likely build a different version of Kliff. They might prioritize stamina upgrades to enable longer exploration sessions and extended gliding across Pywel's vast regions, or they could focus on unlocking diverse grappling techniques to dominate melee combat. <strong>The skill combination system and upgrade paths are designed to reflect individual playstyles, ensuring no two players' Kliff will develop identically</strong>.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The video then mentioned that equipment crafting and customization offer another layer of progression. Gear can be purchased from merchants, discovered in hidden locations, or crafted from raw materials gathered through mining, hunting, and quest completion. <strong>Boss encounters in particular will serve as both tests of mastery and sources of unique rewards</strong>. Fearsome adversaries ranging from human opponents to beasts, mechanical constructs, and magical entities await throughout the continent. <strong>Defeating these bosses yields exclusive equipment imbued with their signature abilities and special effects</strong>. Before closing the video, Pearl Abyss teased a third and final Features Overview coming ahead of the game's launch. If it follows the current schedule, it should drop on Thursday, February 12.</p>



<p>In other Crimson Desert news, the game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-2-million-wishlists-middle-the-witcher-3-zelda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has just surpassed two million wishlists</a></strong>. Pearl Abyss PR Director Will Powers also recently shared a couple of tidbits about the game: <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-campaign-very-small-percentage-of-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the main campaign is only a small percentage of the overall content available</a>, and the balance between narrative and gameplay sits in the middle between <strong>The Witcher 3</strong> and <strong>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</strong>.</p>

            <p>Following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>'s big reveal at 2024's Geoff Awards, it predictably took <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-pc-mods-the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">modders</a> about five minutes to revamp <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a>'s Ciri into her <a href="https://www.vg247.com/witcher-4-witcher-3-mod-ciri-adult-monster-slayer">older monster slaying variant</a>. Now, one of them's had a crack at going a step further by designing a short questline offering a taste of Geralt's non-quite-daughter slaying monsters in Kovir and Poviss, with help from CD Projekt's RedKIT tools.</p>

<p>Dubbed <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/11831?tab=description">Dawn over Kovir</a>, this new questline's the work of a modder going by Fandera. Inspired by that 2024 reveal trailer for the next round of witchering, their adventure looks to kick off with endgame Gerry from the River getting a quest to have a chat with oneiromancer Corrine Tilly that results in him seeing a quick glimpse of Ciri's future.</p>
<p>Cue 45 minutes to and hour and a half of you running around as Ciri and pursuing monster contracts in a version of Kovir the modder's constructed. As you might have gleaned from the showcase video above, there's no voice acting, though the modder does note English subtitles are available. At least to my eye, the mod's version of Kovir looks rather like Skellige, but that's part and parcel of mods like this which make fresh stuff out of assets that already exist in the base game.</p><p>Like a lot of ambitious RedKIT works, the mod also generally appears to be fairly minimalistic in its current incarnation, but Fandera wrote that they plan to deliver the likes of refined animations and voice acting via updates. As of writing, you should get about 45 minutes to an hour and a half of not-quite-Witcher 4ing out of Dawn over Kovir before you hit the end.</p>
<p>If that sounds like a worthwhile distraction as the wait to see whether CD Projekt do whip out that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ooh-that-rumoured-witcher-3-dlc-could-be-something-really-funky-if-its-set-where-the-latest-report-suggests">extra official Witcher 3 DLC</a> they're rumoured to have in the works, both the Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine DLCs are hard requirements of the mod. You'll also need to grab <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/2110">Community Patch - Shared Imports</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/5940">Custom Player Characters</a>.</p>

<p>Memory shortages aren’t going to impact PS5 stock at least until the holiday season of 2026. </p>



<p>The shortages and rising costs of memory have the entire community worried about how these changes will affect prices. AMD has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amd-reportedly-raising-graphics-card-prices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already begun raising GPU prices</a>, NVIDIA has discontinued GPUs, and Nintendo stated it will “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-will-carefully-evaluate-switch-2-price-increase-as-memory-costs-rise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">carefully evaluate</a>” the situation. Now, Sony has revealed their strategy for the PS5. </p>







<h2 id="h-ps5-stock-safe-for-holiday-2026-as-sony-secures-required-ram">PS5 Stock Safe For Holiday 2026 as Sony Secures Required RAM</h2>



<p>According to a post by Genki_JPN on <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/2019330491225375186" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">X</a> (formerly Twitter), Sony’s CFO Lin Tao recently discussed the issues related to PS5 stock and memory shortages. Tao announced that the minimum amount of memory needed to maintain PS5 stock levels until the end of the holiday season in 2026 has been secured. She also shared strategies to tackle the RAM shortage.</p>



<p>Tao mentioned that negotiations with suppliers will continue. To minimize the impact of rising RAM costs, they are considering two strategies. First, they will prioritize monetizing their current install base. Second, they plan to further expand their revenue from software and network services.</p>



<p>PlayStation has <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/2019336563264762156" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">indicated</a> that PS5 sales are declining in the latter half of its life cycle; however, software revenue from the PlayStation Store has reached a record high, largely due to major third-party franchises and new hit releases.</p>







<p>In other news, memory and storage shortages have also <span>led Valve to&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-revisiting-steam-machine-pricing-due-to-ram-market-volatility/" target="_blank">reassess the pricing of</a></span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-revisiting-steam-machine-pricing-due-to-ram-market-volatility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the Steam Machine</a>. Additionally,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-sold-more-than-nintendo-switch-2-last-quarter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5 has sold better</a>&nbsp;than Switch 2 during the 2025 holiday season.

            <p>Have you heard the word '<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-review-masocore-action-with-an-approachable-twist">masocore</a>' before? It's a portmanteau of 'masochist' and 'hardcore', and it's what Team Ninja used to describe the first few games in the Nioh franchise. In an interview <a href="https://www.fandom.com/articles/nioh-2">a long time ago</a>, Yosuke Hayashi (general producer at Team Ninja) told me that the team working on the Nioh games never really wanted to make them 'Soulslikes', and thought that 'masocore' suited the developer's vision slightly better.</p>
<p>"We weren't trying to make a game in this genre to begin with, but when we played the original Dark Souls, we were really inspired," Hayashi told me back in 2020. "Team Ninja is famous for difficult action games, but it wasn’t our primary intention to make a difficult game. It was more about detecting the tension of samurai games - and the genre that worked for that, for us, happened to be 'masocore'."</p>
<p>Now, on the eve of the launch of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/nioh-3">Nioh 3</a>, I had the chance to chat to Masaki Fujita, game director of the third game in the hardcore action-RPG series. I was curious about the evolution of Team Ninja's experience in the genre, and if its approach to difficulty had changed at all when it came to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nioh-review-4">Nioh</a>, especially after working on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rise-of-the-ronin">Rise of the Ronin</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ninja-gaiden-4">a new Ninja Gaiden</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/wo-long-fallen-dynasty">Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stranger-of-paradise-final-fantasy-origin-review-a-trashy-soulslike-that-packs-surprising-depth">Final Fantasy: Stranger of Paradise</a> in the interim.</p>

<p>For context, there is a long-running - and often quite exhausting - discourse around difficulty in action-RPGs. Should games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dark-souls-review">Dark Souls</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a> have difficulty options? Would it make the titles more accessible for players? Would it compromise the feeling of achievement that even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hidetaka-miyazaki">Hidetaka Miyazaki</a> believes lies at the core of the experience? Would the entire genre be as beloved, as infamous, as popular, if it wasn't for its relationship with brutal difficulty?</p><p>"We've never considered adding difficulty settings to the Nioh series," Fujita tells me when I askew whether the challenge level in these games is non-negotiable for Team Ninja. "The value of clearing the game is something that is unifying, and since Nioh 3 has even more variations on strategies to clear the game compared to previous games in the series, our approach is not to change the difficulty setting when you can't clear it."</p>
<p>This is actually a sentiment echoed by 'father of the genre', Miyazaki. The Dark Souls boss is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tough-love-on-dark-souls-difficulty">on the record</a> as saying you don't need to be 'particularly skilled' to play Sark Souls games: you just need to know how to adapt, how to pick up a new spell, a different weapon, a new way of thinking, if bashing your Moonlight Greatsword against a boss over and over again isn't yielding any success for you.</p>



<p>The same is true in Nioh - and (after pumping 80 hours into it) especially Nioh 3: there are so many tools at your disposal now, with magic, ninjutsu, summons, Guardian Spirit skills and more being made more available and easier to use, that any roadblock you come up against can be chipped away at… if you know how to re-spec and re-evaluate. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nioh-3-review">In my review</a>, I mentioned it's the easiest title in the series so far, and that's partly because of the '<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> effect'; if something is proving too tough, you can simply wander out into the open field, check off more side missions, and come back later. The level scaling is pretty intense in Nioh 3, and you'll soon find even five or so levels can make an eye-watering difference.</p><p>"The enjoyment and sense of accomplishment of being able to figure out on your own how to overcome a situation is what we see as one of the best parts of this series," concludes Fujita. Personally, I think that feels more apparent in Nioh 3 than in any other game in the series, precisely because Team Ninja gives you so much freedom in choosing how to tackle the various gatekeepers and difficulty spikes. I think the formula is more potent here than in any other Team Ninja game, period. Nioh or not.</p>

            <guid>1426300</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Valve has posted an update about the upcoming release of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/12/valve-announces-the-steam-machine-steam-frame-and-steam-controller/">Steam Machine, Steam Frame and new Steam Controller</a>, but it’s not exactly the best of news.</p>
<p>Since announcing the three products on 12th November last year, we’ve been waiting for Valve to confirm a release date and pricing, but they are still unable to do so. “When we announced these products in November, we planned on being able to share specific pricing and launch dates by now,” they say, “But the memory and storage shortages you’ve likely heard about across the industry have rapidly increased since then.&nbsp; The limited availability and growing prices of these critical components mean we must revisit our exact shipping schedule and pricing (especially around Steam Machine and Steam Frame).</p>


<p>“Our goal of shipping all three products in the first half of the year has not changed. But we have work to do to land on concrete pricing and launch dates that we can confidently announce, being mindful of how quickly the circumstances around both of those things can change. We will keep you updated as much as we can as we finalize those plans as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>To be clear, this does not mean that the launches themselves have been delayed – we have no details on what their plans were outside of the broad first half of 2026 window – but Valve’s ability to make such announcements definitely has.</p>
<p>In November, there was broad speculation about how Valve might price the Steam Machine, in particular. The company did make statements to the effect that they would not be subsidising the hardware in the manner of a games console, and so many had expectations that the price could be around $700 or even higher. However, that was&nbsp;<em>just</em> before the PC hardware market went completely haywire with companies like OpenAI pre-booking massive amounts of memory, storage and more to feed their intention to build lots of new server farms to feed the AI bubble even further. RAM is now massively more expensive, as production lines are now being adapted to create the more intensive types of memory that helps AI models run quicker, Micron has retired their consumer-facing Crucial brand, and even older generation DDR4 RAM is seeing increased demand as people hunt for any kind of decent pricing at all.</p>

<p>The immediate impact has been felt with PC components and companies without stockpiled parts like Raspberry Pi, but this can and likely will affect everything else, from current gen console pricing through 2026-27, to next-gen console launch plans and pricing, to smart phones, even cars and washing machines. Everything needs RAM, CPUs and storage these days, and it’s all being gobbled up.</p>
<p>Speaking of components, Valve did also confirm in an attached FAQ that they are supporting the use of NVMe SSDs in the 2230 or 2280 form factor, memory that is DDR5 SODIMMs (though not the speed they intend to use), and that both of these areas will be accessible for upgrades.</p>
<p>Additionally, Valve’s own testing says that the “majority” of Steam games are able to play at 4K and 60FPS with the use of FSR upscaling. However, given the Radeon RX 7600 chip that the system features, ”&nbsp;there are some titles that currently require more upscaling than others, and it may be preferable to play at a lower framerate with VRR to maintain a 1080p internal resolution.”</p>

Reporting its financials for the quarter ending December 31, 2025, Sony failed to provide an updated sales figure, but did highlight the game in its webcast, reviewed and transcribed by IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In the studio business, Ghost of Yotei, a tentpole title we released in October, exceeded the sales of the previous title in the same period of time and significantly contributed to the financial results of the quarter,” Lin Tao, Sony's chief financial officer, said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Our established live service titles like Helldivers 2 and MLB The Show also contributed stable recurring revenue.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The statement here is a little vague (we assume “same period of time” reflects each game's first quarter on sale, which would be the first three months of availability), but Sony sounds happy with Ghost of Yotei either way. How exactly does it compare to Ghost of Tsushima? Ghost of Tsushima, which was initially released for PlayStation 4 on July 17, 2020, sold 2.4 million copies in its first three days, then hit 5 million after 118 days (just shy of four months). Latest sales figures provided by Sony show Ghost of Tsushima on 13 million copies sold, including sales of the PC and PS5 Director’s Cut, as of August 11, 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We should consider that Ghost of Tsushima came out on the PS4, which in the summer of 2020 had a much bigger install base than the PS5 does today, and released into the stay-at-home gaming boom fueled by lockdowns. Ghost of Yotei also sold for $70, which means its dollar sales are greater compared to the cheaper Ghost of Tsushima, whose standard edition launched at $60.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, multiplayer add-on Ghost of Yotei: Legends comes out at some point this year, which will undoubtedly give Ghost of Yotei a shot in the arm. And we all know that Ghost of Yotei, like Ghost of Tsushima before it, will eventually launch on PC in Director’s Cut form. Perhaps there will even be a PS6 version, whenever that console rolls around.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best PlayStation Game of 2025</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait to find out, check out IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-review"><u>Ghost of Yotei review</u></a>.

            <title><![CDATA[Dynasty Warriors: Origins – Visions of Four Heroes Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/05/dynasty-warriors-origins-visions-of-four-heroes-review/</link>
            <guid>1426276</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>After successfully reinvigorating the franchise formula with last year’s <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/dynasty-warriors-origins">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a>, I was eager to see where <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/omega-force">Omega Force</a> and <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/koei-tecmo">Koei Tecmo</a> would go next with the series and whether we’d see an “Xtreme Legends” expansion similar to past games. While it may not share the same XL name, the newly-released Visions of Four Heroes DLC is certainly XL in spirit, offering more than just a bonus cluster of campaigns for players to hack and slash their way through.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dynasty Warriors: Origins - Visions of Four Heroes Overview Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w7uuXeeYsIQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As the name implies, this first major expansion for Dynasty Warriors: Origins centres on four main characters: Zhang Jiao, Dong Zhuo, Yuan Shao, and Lu Bu. They represent the four powerful antagonists players encounter early on in the series’ Romance of the Three Kingdoms storyline, this DLC effectively giving each one of them a shot at redemption. Even the nasty, tyrannical Dong Zhou!</p>


<p>Not everyone was particularly keen on Origins and the developer’s decision to sack off the usual stacked roster of playable characters in favour of a single enigmatic protagonist. However, as we discussed at the time, Ziluan serves as somewhat of a handy conduit, his mystic trappings allowing him to flit between opposing factions and characters, at least during those early chapters. This gave us a more enriched overview of the setting, story, and the warring perspectives of its key players, where other <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/dynasty-warriors">Dynasty Warriors</a> games typically force you down one of three, faction-aligned tunnels. In Visions of Four Heroes, Ziluan’s penchant for side-swapping gets dialled up to eleven as he travels through time to help out characters who are traditionally viewed as franchise villains.</p>
<p>It’s this kind of thoughtful narrative exploration that marks Dynasty Warriors: Origins as such a turning point for the series. Let’s take the first of the Four Heroes, Zhang Jiao, as a good example. Those who have been playing Shin Sangoku Musou since its debut will remember him as the crazy-haired wizard who lays claim to some of the most chuckle-worthy English-dubbed lines of the PS2 era. Origins completely drops that caricature image, however, portraying him as somewhat of a tragic figure – a religious leader who rallied thousands of famine-stricken peasants, even though their unchecked rebellion would have a devastating impact.</p>


<p>Each new story chapter in Visions of Four Heroes featured a handful of large-scale battles, sandwiched between cutscenes and occasional visits to the new hub-like Inn where players can also partake in new arena style challenges. In order to access the DLC, you will need to have hit certain milestones in the core campaign. Basically, once you’ve defeated each of the four featured characters, their chapter becomes playable.</p>
<p>New story content isn’t the only thing Visions adds to the game; there are two new weapon types, including the Bow and the Rope Dart. As with the core Origins arsenal, each one has its own unique playstyle and mechanics. The bow, for instance, can seamlessly switch between melee and ranged attacks by holding the block button, successive hits allowing you to unleash a powerful charged shot. These weapons have their own progression paths and unlockable special abilities too, with all base weapons from the game having been supercharged with additional ranks for the expansion.</p>
<p>Visions also introduces a new way of framing larger conflicts with its “Strategic Battles”. You’ll encounter several of these in the DLC, each one transporting the player to a smaller, more self-contained map where individual enemy and allied units take turns to move and engage. Left to their own devices, units will whittle down one another’s troop reserves before moving onto the next fight though, amidst all this, players can use one of their actions per turn to join in these skirmishes: smaller bouts of hack n’ slash combat that typically require you to defeat a general or capture a main base.</p>

<p>In truth, there’s not much scope for feats of tactical genius. To reduce friction and make the battles themselves a little easier, you’ll want to join fights where your allies are struggling, preventing their unit from being routed which would reduce your total troop count in the final battle. To help with this, a handful of Tactics can be used while navigating the world map, buffing allies and hampering enemies before a skirmish has even started. Each minor victory will also reward you with a panel of Secret Tactics that can be used in combat, such as the ability to summon a hurricane, or create an area of effect that charges your Musou gauge.</p>
<p>While Strategic Battles lack true tactical depth, they’re a clever way of reframing what would otherwise be a straightforward gauntlet of battles for each chapter in the DLC. It’s not hard to imagine Omega Force evolving this concept for when the studio (hopefully) delivers an Empires-style spin-off for its Dynasty Warriors reboot.</p>

<p>A hollow promise?</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="3f39f5339d751"><a title="Hollow Knight" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3f39f5339d751/hollow-knight.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure><p>Back in December, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/hollow-knight-silksong-expansion-coming-2026-hollow-knight-switch-2-edition-also-announced">we learned</a> that the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a> would be getting a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> of its own at some point in 2026. In true Team Cherry style, things have been radio silent ever since, but a newly-emerged PEGI rating may suggest that we're closer to release than we had initially expected (thanks, <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/hollow-knight-nintendo-switch-2-edition-announced/">Nintendo Everything</a>).</p>
<p>As spotted on the <a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?q=Hollow+Knight">official PEGI website</a>, Switch 2 has been added to the Hollow Knight platform list, under the original game's '7' age rating. The rating cites "mild violence to fantasy characters and pictures or sounds likely to be scary to young children" as the reason for this classification, none of which is all that surprising if you've ever set foot in Deepnest *<em>shudders</em>*.</p>
<p>The other thing worth pointing out is that the Switch 2 version is accompanied by a release date of 5th February 2026. Tha- that's today!</p>
<figure data-uuid="0007ea4604dc3"><a title="Hollow Knight PEGI Rating" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0007ea4604dc3/hollow-knight-pegi-rating.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?q=Hollow+Knight">PEGI</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, this <em>might</em> be nothing, and we actually have months to go before we get to dive into Hallownest again. PEGI ratings have a habit of cropping up out of the blue with a 'release date' that seems to correspond to the date that the rating was added rather than the date the game was released — see <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/hi-fi_rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a> and its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/hi-fi-rush-has-been-rated-for-the-switch-again">15th January Switch date</a> from last month.</p>
<p>But we can't help but notice that there <em>is</em> a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-announced-for-today-5th-february-2026">Partner Direct</a> today, and we suppose a shadow drop for this kind of thing <em>could</em> be on the cards.</p>
<p>We'll just have to wait and see what the showcase brings. For reference, Team Cherry has confirmed that Hollow Knight - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition will boast "high frame-rate modes, higher resolutions and many additional graphical effects", and it'll be available as a free upgrade to all those with the Switch 1 version.</p>
<p>Aside from that, we also have the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight_silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-sea-of-sorrow">Sea of Sorrow</a>' expansion to look forward to at some point this year. While Team Cherry said it was keeping "further details a secret for now" at its reveal back in December, it teased new areas, bosses, tools and more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Sony has <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q3_supplement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted its own quarterly financial report</a>, revealing that <strong>PS5 shipments have now reached 92.2 million units</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-shipments-reach-84-2-million-units-ghost-of-yotei-sold-3-3-million-units-first-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">up from 84.2 million units declared in the previous quarter</a>. This means that Sony sold <span><strong>8 million PlayStation 5 consoles in its fiscal Q3</strong>, a rather significant (<strong>-15.8%</strong>) decrease from</span> Q3 2024. </p>



<p>This is only slightly offset by marginally better PS5 shipments in Q1 and Q2 2025 compared to the previous year. Overall, in FY 2024, <strong>Sony had shipped 15.7 million units as of Q3</strong>, whereas this year, the total fiscal year sales to date amount to <strong>14.4 million units</strong>, or <strong>-8.3%</strong>.</p>



<p>Despite the downward trajectory, cumulative PS5 shipments are not at all far from where the PlayStation 4 was at the same point in its lifecycle. The PS4 had sold <strong>94.4 million units</strong>, but <strong>it also faced far less adversity than the PS5 did</strong>; the most recent Sony console had to deal with the semiconductor shortage at first, and now the RAM shortages aren't helping, either. </p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/SDKTavm-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Credits to ResetEra's Red Kong XIX for making this chart: <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps5-reaches-92-2-million-lifetime-console-units-shipped-8-million-units-last-quarter.1426120" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps5-reaches-92-2-million-lifetime-console-units-shipped-8-million-units-last-quarter.1426120</a></em></figcaption></figure>



<p>It's far from all bad news for the PlayStation division, though. Full game software sales (between PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5) increased to <strong>97.2 million units</strong> sold, <strong>up 1.4%</strong> compared to last year. That's mostly thanks to first-party sales, which reached <strong>13.2 million units</strong> in the quarter, a <strong>13.8%</strong> increase compared to 2024's <strong>11.6 million units</strong>.</p>



<p>Of course, the game leading the charge was <strong>Ghost of Yōtei</strong> by <strong>Sucker Punch Productions</strong>, by far the biggest PS5 exclusive game released in FY 2025. Indeed, during the FY2025 Q3 earnings call, Sony Chief Financial Officer <strong>Lin Tao</strong> shared that the game has exceeded the sales of its predecessor, <strong>Ghost of Tsushima</strong>, when launch aligned.</p>



<p>Sony did not provide an actual update to sales figures. However, we know that Ghost of Tsushima sold 2.4 million units in the first three days, but only reached 5 million units 118 days (nearly four months) after launch. By contrast, Ghost of Yotei sold 3.3 million units in 32 days. <strong>This means Tsushima must have taken slightly longer to reach that milestone</strong>. Even if it's only a marginal improvement, though, it's actually more meaningful when you consider that Tsushima was released at the height of the COVID pandemic and benefited from a much larger install base than Ghost of Yōtei. Given these positive sales figures, it's hard to imagine Sony won't greenlight a Ghost of Yōtei DLC, and indeed, the developers <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-developer-doesnt-close-door-to-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have already suggested there's a chance it will happen</a></strong>.</p>



<p>At some point in 2026, Sucker Punch is scheduled to launch the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-legends-2026-release-gamescom-onl-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Legends online co-op mode</a></strong>. It is also believed that <strong>the debut of Legends might coincide with the game's PC launch</strong>, though that's just speculation for now.</p>

Each of the weapons available in the game has <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">extensive movesets</strong> that require multiple button combinations to accommodate the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">huge Martial Arts loadout</strong> that has now become typical for the series.</p>



<p><span>While&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3</em>&nbsp;<strong>streamlines the complexity</strong>&nbsp;of its predecessor's controls and button combinations, it adds unexpected <strong>mechanical challenges</strong>&nbsp;that make it difficult to <strong>consistently unleash Martial Arts set to specific motion and button combinations.</strong></span></p>



<p>Complete The Shogun's Preparation: <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">change this setting ASAP</strong> to improve combat flow and <strong>ultimately make fighting enemies more enjoyable.</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-change-the-controls-to-type-b-asap">Change the Controls to Type B ASAP</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Controls-1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Type B proved the best control scheme for me in Nioh 3 as it made it easier to use certain Martial Arts more consistently</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh 3</em> comes with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">six control scheme options,</strong> which move some of the game's core combat actions between different buttons. While the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Type A control scheme</strong> generally works well (though you may need some time to adjust if you're coming straight from <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nioh-2-the-complete-edition-grave-no-bar/"><strong>Nioh 2</strong></a></em>) I have found in my over 50 hours with the game <strong>not to be the best</strong> for one specific reason: <strong>the difficulty to <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/enter-the-dojo-mastering-nioh-3-combat-and-arts-proficiency-flow/">use some Martial Arts</a> consistently.</strong></p>



<p>As opposed to the first two entries in the series, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh 3</em> assigns quite a few <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">critical Martial Arts</strong> in both Samurai and Ninja style to <strong>forward + button and back + button combinations</strong>, leaving the <strong>L1 /LB + button combination free for Guardian Spirit skills.</strong></p>



<p><strong>These button combinations make using specific Martial Arts really unreliable</strong>. While the forward + button combination is a little more reliable, I have had a lot of trouble using the back + button Martial Arts consistently, forcing me to <strong>buffer the input behind a regular attack string.</strong></p>



<p>Needless to say, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">this forces a playstyle that is not good for certain weapons</strong>. Take the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Ninja Style Hatchets</strong>, for example: assigned to the back + heavy attack slot is the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Dragonfly Martial Art</strong>, which is incredibly useful from a distance, but far riskier to use close to the enemy, a positioning the Type A controls essentially forced me into.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Type-B-better-controls-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Type B controls made me enjoy Nioh 3's combo potential in combat way more</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>If you, like me, are having trouble with these Martial Arts button combinations, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">switch the Control Type to B</strong>. This control scheme <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">restores the L1/LB + button combination for Martial Arts</strong> from previous entries in the series, switching the <strong>Guardian Skill button combos to L1/LB + up and L1/LB + down on the directional pad.</strong></p>



<p>The difference, you will soon notice, will be <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">night and day</strong>, no matter your weapon of choice. In my case, I was able to use the Samurai Dual Swords counterattack <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Punish the Proud</strong> Martial Art previously assigned to back + heavy attack <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">much more consistently</strong>. Aerial combat in Ninja Style was also significantly improved, as aerial Martial Arts became more reliable with more consistent execution.</p>

            <p>If you keep an eye on the big, ambitious Fallout mods that're always in the works, you might have heard of Fallout: Revelation Blues. Its developers have been plugging away at remaking Van Buren - the version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a> which was in development at Black Isle Studios before being cancelled in 2003 - as a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">New Vegas</a> mod for the past few years. While they released a <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-new-vegas-mod-revelation-blues-demo-van-buren">first demo last year</a> under the Revelation Blues moniker, the group have decided to re-christen their project Fallout: The New West ahead of releasing a second demo at some point soon.</p>

<p>Ahead of that, the name change has been set in stone by the release of the fresh teaser above and the launch of a <a href="https://falloutthenewwest.com/">new website</a>. Why the switch from Revelation Blues? Well, one of the mod's devs going by the handle Caveman6667 has explained on <a href="https://discord.com/channels/867445710622556230/867471933725212702/1447407535437905920">Discord</a> that the group concluded Revelation Blues was "a mystery of a name for many passersby and isn't a grabby title". The New West, meanwhile, they feel fits the mod better, as it'll feature "many allusions and references to the Old West".</p>
<p>So, out with the old and in the New West as the modders gear up to release a second demo, this time focused around Van Buren's opening sequence. You're in Tibbets prison, a pen run by an AI dubbed Odysseus, and you've gotta break out of that joint while a new plague's also on the loose in the section of American southwest the mod's set in. The modders wrote in a <a href="https://discord.com/channels/867445710622556230/867471933725212702/1468679368711864462">Discord post</a> put out alongside the teaser that they're "fairly confident" they could put a release date on this Tibbets demo right now, but have instead elected to play it safe and simply declare they're "very very very close" to delivering it.</p><p>As outlined on the sparkly new website, the New West crew's current plan is to get this "alternate start demo" out of the way, then "follow it up with the entirety of act one of the game as a vertical slice". If you're keen for a taster of what the mod's full experience'll be like, they've also provided the following handy blurb outlining its key tenets and aims:</p>
<blockquote><p>In many ways, it tells the same broad story envisioned by Fallout: Van Buren, but restructured and expanded to form a cohesive, playable experience. The project’s primary narrative goal is to take the disparate plot threads and unfinished concepts found in the original design documents, including for example, the NCR–Brotherhood conflict, the Great Tribal War between Caesar’s Legion and the Daughters of Hecate, the fight for the soul of the Mormon State and much more, and weave them into a satisfying, unified narrative that adheres to the main plot as described in the design documents.</p>
<p>Players assume the role of a new protagonist,released from captivity in 2253, known as "the Prisoner", and the story is set in an alternate continuity that predates and reinterprets the events of Fallout: New Vegas. Unfortunately due to many Van Buren concepts being folded into FNV, we cannot set the project in the same timeline. Our secondary goal is to incorporate many of the modern gameplay conveniences introduced through Fallout: New Vegas and its more than fifteen years of modding, while preserving the distinctive mechanics and design quirks of classic Fallout found in the original design documents.</p></blockquote>
<p>While I'm not as voracious a Van Buren lore sponge as other Fallout enjoyers, the New West's re-creation of a wasteland adventure we never got has certainly piqued my interest, so here's hoping the upcoming demo's a good one. If you fancy giving the mod's first demo - Burham Springs - a go in the interim you can find it on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/91191?tab=description">Nexus Mods</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-of-yotei-is-beating-tsushima-in-sales-sony-reveals/</link>
            <guid>1426258</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sony’s CFO has revealed that Ghost of Yotei’s sales have performed better than those of Tsushima in the same period. </p>



<p>One of the biggest releases for Sony PlayStation this year was Ghost of Yotei, the highly anticipated sequel to Sucker Punch’s 2020 hit, Ghost of Tsushima. Sony had confirmed that the title sold 3.3 million copies in the first month, and the budget was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-of-yoteis-budget-is-very-similar-to-tsushima/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">very similar</a> to the previous title. Now we know that the latest instalment is also performing better. </p>







<h2 id="h-ghost-of-yotei-sold-better-than-tsushima-in-the-same-period">Ghost of Yotei Sold Better than Tsushima in the Same Period</h2>



<p>Sony CFO Lin Tao’s comments on Ghost of Yotei sales were revealed through an <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/2019316878162948307" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> post (formerly Twitter) by Genki_JPN. Tao stated that Yotei was a “tentpole title” released in 2025 and “exceeded the sales of the previous title in the same period of time.” Sucker Punch’s latest instalment also contributed “significantly” to the financial results of the latest quarter. </p>



<p>Ghost of Yotei was released on October 2, 2025, for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/playstation-5/" id="38">PlayStation 5</a> and PlayStation 5 Pro. We have yet to receive an announcement for a PC version, which could help boost the sales event further. Yotei has been out for a little over 4 months, and its performance during this period has been better than Tsushima’s. No sales figures were revealed. </p>



<p>What else could help boost the sales is a DLC for the title, and the developers have already <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sucker-punch-ghost-of-yotei-possible-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mentioned a potential expansion</a>. It just depends on whether they feel players really want to know more about a particular relationship or story element in the game. </p>







<p>In other news, Sucker Punch could work on a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sucker-punch-could-make-new-sly-cooper-infamous-game-after-ghost-of-yotei/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sly Cooper or Infamous</a> game next.

            <guid>1426240</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Just a few hours after <strong>AMD CEO</strong> <strong>Lisa Su</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-confirms-steam-machine-will-start-shipping-early-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publicly shared that they expected the <strong>Steam Machine</strong> to start shipping in <strong>early 2026</strong></a>, <strong>Valve</strong> <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steam_hardware/announcements/detail/625565405086220584?utm_source=SteamDB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted an update</a> revealing there will actually be a slight delay.</p>



<p>In a blog post dedicated to launch timing and other FAQs for the whole family of upcoming <strong>Steam Hardware</strong> products, Valve admitted they've had to revisit the shipping schedule and pricing <strong>due to the ongoing memory and storage shortages <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-one-can-escape-memory-shortages-says-samsungs-co-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that have hit the tech industry hard</a></strong>. They had hoped to be able to share both the launch and price details by now, but that just wasn't possible yet, with the Steam Machine and <strong>Steam Frame</strong> particularly affected (while, on the other hand, the <strong>Steam Controller</strong> obviously won't include any RAM or storage; but Valve wants to start selling it alongside the other two).</p>



<p>Valve's goal is to launch all of the products <strong>in the first half of 2026</strong>. From the sound of it, though, they are now targeting the latter months of Spring, perhaps toward May or June, whereas before it really sounded like it could have launched in March or April.</p>



<p><strong>Customers are certainly worried more about the pricing</strong> than the slight delay. The RAM shortage has driven component prices to absurd levels, and even console manufacturers like <strong>Nintendo</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/we-must-monitor-the-situation-closely-current-high-ram-prices-wont-immediately-impact-the-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">haven't definitively ruled out price bumps for their hardware</a> if the situation doesn't improve. The Steam Machine was already going to have a hefty price tag, at least compared to a typical console, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-isnt-going-to-be-subsidized-valve-confirms-prepare-for-high-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">because Valve won't subsidize it</a></strong>. Earlier this year, a Czech retailer <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-price-leak-valve/">listed a price of <strong>$950</strong> for the base model with 512GB of storage, while the 2TB model would cost </a><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-price-leak-valve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$1070</a></strong>. Those prices are not confirmed by any means, though.</p>



<p>In the new blog post, Valve also shared a few FAQs for the Steam Hardware family. </p>



<h2 id="h-steam-machine">Steam Machine</h2>



<ul>
<li>Valve reiterated that most Steam games can run at 4K@60FPS on the Steam Machine with AMD FSR. However, <strong>they also acknowledged that some titles will be more taxing, and users might need to play at a lower frame rate with VRR enabled and a 1080p internal resolution</strong>. Meanwhile, they are working on HDMI VRR, <strong>investigating improved upscaling</strong>, and <strong>optimizing ray tracing performance</strong> in the Steam Machine driver.</li>



<li>It was confirmed that the <strong>SSD</strong> (NVMe 2230 or 2280) and <strong>RAM</strong> (DDR5 SODIMMs) are both <strong>user-accessible and upgradable</strong>.</li>



<li>In the coming months, Valve will begin sharing faceplate CAD models, specs, and details so manufacturers can make and sell third-party faceplates to users.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-steam-frame">Steam Frame</h2>



<ul>
<li>Streaming services should work in a 'theatrical browser mode'.</li>



<li><strong>People wearing glasses shouldn't have problems with the Steam Frame</strong>, though it depends on the width of the glasses. Still, Valve would like to make prescription lens inserts available ahead of launch.</li>



<li>The Steam Frame will include a new feature called <strong>Foveated Streaming</strong>. Based on the eye-tracking data, the PC streams high-resolution data only to the portion of the viewport the player is looking at. This is a system-level feature, so it can be applied to all games to improve performance. Furthermore, it can stack with <strong>Foveated Rendering</strong> (which allows a game to render only the portion the player is looking at) if the game supports that feature.</li>



<li>The <strong>Valve Index</strong> will continue to be supported by Valve, as it has in the past.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-steam-controller">Steam Controller</h2>



<ul>
<li>The Steam Controller is expected to work with any game compatible with the Steam Overlay, even if they aren't actually on Steam.</li>
</ul>

            <p>Despite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-steam-machine-is-still-on-track-for-its-original-release-window-according-to-valves-chosen-chipmakers">AMD’s assurances to the contrary</a>, Valve have announced that they’ve pushed back release plans for the new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-the-new-steam-machine-valves-square-shot-at-steamos-pc-redemption">Steam Machine</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valves-new-steam-controller-aims-to-entice-a-broader-field-of-pc-players-which-i-fear-already-includes-me">Steam Controller</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-steam-frame-is-real-and-valve-want-it-to-be-the-last-vr-headset-youll-ever-buy">Steam Frame</a> VR headset. Alas, my curse of publishing news posts roughly 0.0045 seconds before a major situation change continues to ruin my life – sometimes I wish I’d never beaten the warlocks in that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/titanfall-2">Titanfall 2</a> pub match.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Instead of "early 2026," the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-announce-a-new-steam-machine-steam-controller-and-the-steam-frame-vr-headset-and-ive-played-them">original release window</a>, Valve are now only aiming to ship the hardware trio "in the first half of the year." No prizes for guessing the cause, either: the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/45479024/view/625565405086220583?l=english">Steam blog post</a> notes specifically that ongoing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/predicting-steam-machine-prices-would-be-a-lot-easier-if-ram-costs-hadnt-gone-horribly-wrong">memory and SSD shortages</a>, caused by the tech industry buying up components to build infrastructure for AI products, have both scuppered the initial launch plans and delayed Valve’s decision on how the Steam Machine and its brethren will be priced.</p>
<p>"When we announced these products in November," the post reads, "we planned on being able to share specific pricing and launch dates by now. But the memory and storage shortages you've likely heard about across the industry have rapidly increased since then.The limited availability and growing prices of these critical components mean we must revisit our exact shipping schedule and pricing (especially around Steam Machine and Steam Frame).</p>
<p>"Our goal of shipping all three products in the first half of the year has not changed. But we have work to do to land on concrete pricing and launch dates that we can confidently announce, being mindful of how quickly the circumstances around both of those things can change. We will keep you updated as much as we can as we finalize those plans as soon as possible."</p><p>If the Machine, Controller, and Frame <em>do</em> arrive in the first half of 2026, that ultimately wouldn’t be an interminable wait beyond the originally announced window. Higher-than-expected prices seem like a given, though, particularly for the Machine and the Frame. The Steam Controller might at least dodge the blow of the economics hammer, as it contains neither a fat SSD nor a pile of RAM.</p>
<p>For now, all we can do is bitterly add "Hopes of a cheap living room PC" to the list of all the things that the AI uranium rush has destroyed, alongside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ram-may-be-abominably-expensive-but-hey-at-least-ssd-prices-are-also-exploding">general component pricing</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/one-of-pc-gamings-key-ram-manufacturers-arent-selling-to-regular-humans-anymore-so-they-can-peddle-more-kit-to-ai-companies">Crucial</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/more-than-half-of-gamedev-professionals-see-genai-as-harmful-according-to-gdcs-latest-survey">game developers’ opinions of AI</a>.</p>

However, due to industry-standard revenue splits, aggressive recoup models, and passive investors, the devs see income months later and are a sadly small slice of the pie, often that is enough to shut down a promising studio.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-servers-downtime-february-5/</link>
            <guid>1426201</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite players around the world have been locked out of the game on February 5 as Epic Games deploys the latest update to the title, with players impatiently waiting for the Fortnite servers to be back up.</p>



<p>After a huge South Park collab in January, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/genres/battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Royale</a> behemoth is entering a new month with a fresh drop of content, keeping the game alive until the next major seasonal change early in March.</p>



<p>For all the details on the Fortnite downtime and everything coming in the February 5 update, Insider Gaming has you covered.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-will-fortnite-servers-be-back-up">When Will Fortnite Servers Be Back Up?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New content. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Fortnite Servers are down for several hours for the update on February 5, and there is no confirmed time of their return. However, previous updates indicate how long players need to wait.</strong></p>



<p>Server downtime in mid-season updates typically lasts for three to four hours, which means that the Fortnite servers should be back up after the v39.40 update somewhere between 2 AM PT and 2 AM ET.</p>



<p>However, downtime can be longer if issues are discovered or if there is a larger patch to deploy, and social media is the best place to keep track of the server status.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-in-the-fortnite-february-5-update">What’s In The Fortnite February 5 Update?</h2>



<p><strong>The biggest addition in the February 5 update in Fortnite is the start of a new Fortnite Festival season, with Chappell Roan as the headline act.</strong></p>



<p>After plenty of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-festivals-next-major-collab-may-have-been-found/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaks and rumors</a>, her inclusion as the star of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-festival-season-13-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite Festival Season 13</a> was revealed by Epic Games, and the new season, of course, means a new Festival Pass to progress through.</p>



<p>In the Battle Royale scene, the South Park collab has now completed, with the Born in Chaos Mini Pass expiring. Unfortunately, if you didn’t complete the pass, those free rewards are now unavailable, though they could return to the Item Shop for purchase in the future.</p>



<p>The Valentine’s Day event is also set to be added, though the dates for its duration are not yet confirmed, and there’s a slew of big collabs coming to the Item Shop, including the second wave of KPop Demon Hunters and two character skins from Marvel Rivals; Magik and Luna Snow.</p>

            <p>Valve time strikes again. Three months after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tech-valve-announces-standalone-steam-frame-vr-headset-plus-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-revival">announcing a trio of new hardware products</a>, including the Steam Machine, Steam Frame and Steam Controller, Valve has published a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/45479024/view/625565405086220583?l=english">blog post detailing their delay</a>. The new hardware was meant to arrive in the first quarter of this year, but this has now been "revisited" to the first half of the year due to the "memory and storage shortages you've likely heard about". </p>
<p>The Steam Machine is likely the major catalyst behind the decision, as the sharp rise in RAM and storage prices could force a rethink for a living room box that was intended to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tech-steam-machine-preview-a-powerful-customisable-mini-pc-for-couch-gaming">bridge the gap between consoles and entry-level PCs</a>. With RAM and storage prices doubling, tripling or even quadrupling over the past three months, even the relatively modest base model with 16GB of DDR5 RAM and 512GB will now cost significantly more to produce. </p>
<p>For context, the cheapest 16GB DDR5 SODIMM kit has <a href="https://zdcs.link/98AyY1">more than doubled in price on Amazon UK</a>, from £67 on Valve's November announcement date to £148 today. A 512GB 2230 NVMe SSD of the type used by Valve in the Steam Machine has <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJ8YMG">also rocketed up in price</a>, from £54 to £88 in the same time period. If we look at 2TB drives, it's <a href="https://zdcs.link/QPxg3D">a steeper climb</a>, from £129 to £244. </p>
<p>Valve isn't paying consumer prices from Amazon, of course, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ram-prices-are-soaring-what-does-it-mean-for-gaming">these price surges are a worldwide affair</a> that have affected nearly every part of the PC industry. The situation could even postpone the release of the next generation of games consoles. </p><p>While the Steam Machine is the most obviously affected, the Steam Frame VR headset is also a miniature Snapdragon-powered gaming PC, with its own 16GB of LPDDR5X memory and 256GB or 1TB of storage, and its pricing will therefore need to be reconsidered. Previously, Valve had indicated that it expected the Frame to undercut the Valve Index in price, which retails for £919. The Steam Controller is the only member of the trio relatively immune to the current climate, though its launch is necessarily tied to the other two products. </p>
<p>Valve's post states that it expected to be able to share pricing and availability data by now, so it will be interesting to see how long it will take the Washingtonian firm to release revised information. In the meantime, you can check out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/45479024/view/625565405086220583?l=english">the recent blog</a> to see a few more frequently-asked questions answered, on topics including RAM/storage upgradability, ongoing support for the Valve Index and expected Steam Machine performance figures, with more blogs to come over the coming weeks. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>South Korean video game publisher Krafton, Inc. has announced that PUBG: Blindspot, the free-to-play 5v5 tactical shooter developed by PUBG Studios, is now available on Steam via Early Access. The team describes the game as being "designed around fast, high-intensity indoor firefights" that mix close-quarters battles and team-based strategies with a top-down perspective.&nbsp;</p><p>Krafton, which made headlines last October after touting that <a href="https://www.krafton.com/news/press/%ed%81%ac%eb%9e%98%ed%94%84%ed%86%a4-ai-first-%ea%b8%b0%ec%97%85-%ec%a0%84%ed%99%98-%ec%84%a0%ec%96%b8-1000%ec%96%b5-%ec%9b%90-%ec%9d%b4%ec%83%81-%ed%88%ac%ec%9e%90/">it would transform into an "AI-first company,"</a> says in a press release that today's Early Access launch marks the beginning of an open development phase, "with the development team actively working alongside players to refine gameplay systems and expand content" ahead of the game's 1.0 release. PUBG Studios adds that player feedback will play a central role in shaping the game with updates designed around depth, balance, and quality.&nbsp;</p><h3>PUBG: Blindspot Maps</h3><p>PUBG: Blindspot is the first spinoff of the mega-popular battle royale grandfather (though that's a heavily debated topic), PUBG, and takes place decades after the events of the original game. The head of the IP, Taesok Jang, says, "Starting with PUBG: Blindspot, the PUBG IP will continue to expand into new genres and platforms."&nbsp;</p><p>Today's launch precedes Competitive Season 1, which will launch next week on February 12. You can download the game right now on Steam, or play the game via Nvidia GeForce Now streaming.&nbsp;</p><h3>PUBG: Blindspot Characters</h3><p>If you've played any of the game's betas, you'll find some new content in today's Early Access release, like a defense-exclusive character with Molotov-based arena control, according to the press release.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Are you going to check out PUBG: Blindspot?

		<p>Krafton’s top-down tactical shooter <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pubg-blindspot">PUBG: Blindspot</a> is out now in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3143710/PUBG_BLINDSPOT/">Steam Early Access</a>, and it’s a free-to-play game that’s worth checking out for fans of this kind of genre.</p>
<p><iframe title="PUBG: BLINDSPOT | Early Access Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A5qFiL2pdWc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>PUBG: Blindspot might share the branding of the hit battle royale, but it’s a totally different style of game. This is a 5v5 team shooter that’s all about lines of sight with a shared team vision, controlling angles and close quarters combat with an element of destruction. New content is already planned, including the defence character Blaze, the addition of Molotov Cocktails for area control.</p>
<p>The early access launch is the start of open development that will take on feedback from the player base to inform the updates, balance and future updates. It’s available for free at this time, and per the FAQ on Steam, it’s planned to stay in early access for around one year, after which Krafton “plan to offer bundles at various price points, as well as a variety of in-game items.”&nbsp;The game will almost immediately kick into a seasonal structure, with Competitive Season 1 launching on 12th February.</p>
<p>“Early Access allows players to become active participants in the development process,” said Seungmyeong Yang, Production Director of PUBG: BLINDSPOT. “By launching as a free-to-play title and developing openly with the community, we aim to shape PUBG: BLINDSPOT together through ongoing communication and frequent updates.”</p>

<p>We got to go hands on with this game late in 2024 saying in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/08/project-arc-preview-pubg-studios-tactical-shooter-from-the-top-down/">our preview</a> “There’s just something about the top-down angle and the shared team vision that makes the game feel lighter than Siege, to me, and that’s something that I really hope resonates with gamers at large. I can definitely see this working really well on consoles, as well.”</p>
