                <p>Shortly after the release of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/backyard-baseball-97-review-hit-parade/1900-6418299/" data-ref-id="1900-6418299">Backyard Baseball '97</a> remaster in October 2024, Playground Productions and Mega Cat Studios revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/backyard-sports-continues-comeback-with-five-more-titles-on-the-way/1100-6527118/" data-ref-id="1100-6527118">Backyard Baseball '01 will be one of the next remastered titles</a>. Now, the game has been set for a release date in early July, and Playground Productions has confirmed that 28 out of 31 MLB players from the original Backyard Baseball '01 will return for the remaster.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmNTH8ku6Hs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MmNTH8ku6Hs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The announcement didn't specify which of the three MLB players didn't lend their names and younger likenesses to Backyard Baseball '01's remaster. But some of the confirmed returning players include Cal Ripken, Jr., Sammy Sosa, Mark McGwire, Alex Rodriguez, and Derek Jeter.</p><p>In partnership with Major League Baseball, Backyard Baseball '01 will feature logos from MLB's professional teams in addition to the players representing the league. Like the earlier Backyard sports remasters, Backyard Baseball '01 will recreate the classic gameplay for touch and modern PC controls.</p><p>"We're honored to partner with MLB to bring this iconic game to modern gaming devices for the first time," said Playground Productions CEO Lindsay Barnett in a statement. "Backyard Baseball '01 was a game-changer in many ways--introducing some of the sport's biggest legends into the Backyard universe. We can't wait for fans to relive the joy of building their dream team with both our beloved original characters and baseball's greatest pros from that unforgettable era."</p><p>Backyard Baseball '01 will be released on PC via Steam and on mobile devices on July 8. The remaster of Backyard Baseball '97 was ported to Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 5 last October. However, there's currently no word about whether Backyard Baseball '01 will eventually join it on consoles. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> griefers are pinning ornithopters to the ground in PvE zones, summoning worms with thumpers, and feeding helpless players to the monstrous beasts in otherwise safe regions of the game.</p>
<p>It works due to vehicle collision. While Funcom <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-patch-ends-the-reign-of-vehicular-terror-as-ramming-into-other-players-no-longer-deals-damage">removed the ability to damage other players by ramming into them with ornithopters</a>, you can still push other players' vehicles around by flying into them. What these griefers are doing is essentially parking their own flying vehicles on top of players looking to harvest spice or flour sand, stopping them from flying out of the reach of incoming sandworms.</p>
<p>This comes following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-deep-desert-pve-expansion">a massive patch made the PvP Deep Desert significantly safer</a> for PvE-minded players, allowing them to farm the highest tier of resources without fear of roaming ornithopter gangs. In response, those who got a kick out of hunting down these combat-averse players have seemingly taken their devious behaviour elsewhere.</p>

<p>It's worth noting victims of this strategy do have ways out. They can attempt to slip out of the grasp of these griefers and fly away, or retrieve their scout ornithopter (while it has no stored cargo) with a vehicle back-up tool. However, taking the second approach still leaves you stranded on the sand with a worm approaching, forcing you to make a break for the nearest safe spot.</p>
<p>This, obviously, trapping players on the ground isn't an intended vehicle interaction. So what can Funcom do? Well, they can remove vehicle-on-vehicle collision altogether in PvE zones. This was a popular community-suggestion during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-pvp-is-being-dominated-by-one-busted-technique-crushing-people-with-helicopters">the whole ornithopter squishing saga</a>.</p>
<p>The counter-argument is, harvesting spice on open sand is meant to be dangerous! While Hagga Basin isn't a PvP zone for the most part, you're still meant to keep your head on a swivel for incoming dangers. Removing this vehicle collision issue could make harvesting spice too easy.</p>
<p>It's a tricky one. Removing vehicle-on-vehicle collision is likely harder than it looks, and may have knock-on effects on the wider game. It's unlikely Funcom can flip a switch to make it work in PvP areas and not in PvE ones. There is a touch of irony with this, as an update to make the PvP endgame safer for PvE players has consequently made the PvE area more dangerous.</p>
<p>In my heart I can't really be mad at these sorts of shenanigans. Obviously for the player taking things slow and steady, happy in Hagga Basin, it would be incredibly frustrating to get pinned and eaten by a worm. But I also can't help but shake the feeling that these sorts of hyjinx add a wild west charm to Dune: Awakening, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-early-meta-helicopter-infested-nightmare">one I hope never goes away</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-griefers-are-parking-on-other-players-and-feeding-them-to-worms]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Sonic Team head Takashi Iizuka has no plans to remake or remaster the Dreamcast <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-adventure">Sonic Adventure</a> games.</p>
<p>Iizuka, who directed both Sonic Adventure and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-sa2-dc">Sonic Adventure 2</a>, is frequently asked by fans to remake the two beloved games, but he told <a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/144842/takashi-iizuka-sonic-racing-crossworlds-interview-june-2025">Shack News</a> the effort required would be better spent on new games.</p>
<p>"I do hear that a lot," said Iizuka. "I really am appreciative of everyone who likes the Sonic Adventure series, but when I think about what it would take to bring that game up to the standards and expectations of what the modern gaming audience would want, I think it would be about as much time and energy as it would to make a new title.</p>

<p>"So part of me is thinking maybe I should just make a brand new title and that's why there are currently no plans."</p>
<p>Sonic Team doesn't seem averse to remakes and remasters entirely, considering last year it released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review">Sonic x Shadow Generations</a> - an update of the 2011 original.</p>
<p>However, both Sonic Adventure and Sonic Adventure 2 are particularly dated. And as Sonic Team continues to develop its 3D Sonic games, Iizuka previously stated the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-frontiers-is-cornerstone-of-future-sonic-games-says-sonic-team-head">open zone design of Sonic Frontiers is the "cornerstone of future Sonic games"</a>.</p>
<p>Further, last year Iizuka stated there were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-plans-for-sonic-adventure-3-says-sonic-team-boss-but-wed-love-to-make-it">no plans for Sonic Adventure 3 or a Chao Garden game</a> either, but said "we'd love to make it".</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the interview, Iizuka discussed the roadmap for the development team and how they decide which game to make next.</p>
<p>The three core pillars of the Sonic series are the modern 3D action games, the 2D classic games, and the racing games, Iizuka explained.</p>
<p>Looking back, it's clear the team is seeking to alternate between these each year: last year had Sonic x Shadow Generations, the year before was the 2D <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-superstars">Sonic Superstars</a>, and the year before that was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-frontiers">Sonic Frontiers</a>. Now there's Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds following previous racing games.</p>

			<p>During a recent investor meeting, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa addressed the topic of demand for the newly released Switch 2 console. According to Furukawa, it greatly exceeded Nintendo's internal estimates, which is why you may have had trouble finding it in stores. The president even apologized to customers for the inconvenience. Here's the quote, initially <a href="https://x.com/NStyles/status/1938408070784393520" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">found</a> by X user NStyles and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/nintendos-president-apologises-for-not-being-able-to-meet-switch-2-demand" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">translated</a> into English by Nintendo Life:</p>



<p><em>Currently, in many countries, the demand for Switch 2 exceeds the supply, and we are unable to meet it. We understand that some shareholders have also been unable to obtain it. We started accepting lottery sales at My Nintendo Store in April. The response far exceeded our expectations, and I announced in my name on X that there were 2.2 million applicants, along with an apology.</em></p>



<p><em>Since then, we have conducted four lottery sales, but some people were not selected. We have announced that the fifth lottery will take place starting in July. Many general retailers have also conducted lottery sales. The number of stores offering in-store sales is gradually increasing. As a company, we are working to improve our production system to deliver as many units as possible. We apologise for the inconvenience caused by this initial demand, which greatly exceeded our expectations.</em></p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 <span><a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-debuts-with-3-5-million-units-sold-in-4-days/" target="_blank">sold</a>&nbsp;over 3.5 million units in the first four days, which is</span> <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-selling-twice-as-fast-as-the-og-switch/">twice as fast</a> as its predecessor in the same timeframe. Last week, DFC Intelligence <a href="https://wccftech.com/switch-2-2025-sales-forecast-bumped-from-15-to-16-million-units-by-dfc-intelligence/">raised</a> its 2025 sales forecast for the new console from 15 to 16 million units. That estimate does include the limited supply, for without that, DFC Intelligence reckons the Switch 2 could sell 20 million units.</p>

<p>The first of these new modes is known simply as Challenge. This will introduce "tougher foes" and "greater trials".</p>
<p>Then there is the Iron Squire mode, which ups the difficulty even more by giving you no second changes. It's a permadeath situation, people. "Die once, your save is gone," The Plucky Squire developer All Possible Futures wrote, wishing us all good luck.</p>
<p>As well as this increased level of difficulty, the studio is also adding the likes of dialogue fast forward and new achievements. </p>
<p>The Plucky Squire's free Challenge update is already available for those on Steam. Console versions are coming "soon". You can check out a little teaser for it all via the embed below.</p>

<p>"There's also a handful of pacing issues, not least that the game has a habit of interrupting its own flow to explain things.

<p>Given the sheer quality of its products and the dedication of its development teams, we imagine Nintendo must be a pretty intimidating place for anybody. And indeed, according to <strong>Star Fox</strong> designer Takaya Imamura (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-is-so-full-of-geniuses-even-zelda-and-star-fox-veteran-takaya-imamura-felt-a-constant-sense-of-inferiority-working-with-them/">Automaton</a>), this was indeed the case during his own stint at the company.</p>
<p>In speaking on <a href="https://x.com/ima_1966/status/1938107363799798252">X</a>, he noted that he felt relieved when he left the company; not because it provided a negative experience of any kind, but rather so that the overwhelming sense of inferiority he felt could be eased. Despite his own huge contributions, it seems even Imamura felt somewhat intimidated by his talented colleagues.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067zpyush&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I really felt that Nintendo is full of amazing people, and I was constantly thinking about how to prove my own worth among them. A sense of inferiority was always lingering somewhere.</p>
<p>"When I left the company, it’s true that I felt a sense of freedom, as if I had been released from the inferiority complex I’d carried for years. But at the same time, there was also a loneliness in thinking, “I won’t be able to work with these people anymore…” That said, with only a few years left until retirement anyway, and since game development often takes many years, I felt a stronger desire to move forward at my own pace, doing more freely creative things."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shinji Watanabe, another ex-Nintendo employee and now CEO of Epsilon Software, <a href="https://x.com/es_s_watanabe/status/1938131920317256011">responded to Imamura</a> and agreed, even describing developers at Nintendo as "celestial beings".</p>
<p>Imamura has certainly earned his place in the Nintendo Hall of Fame, however, having contributed to massive franchises such as Star Fox, <strong>F-Zero</strong>, and <strong>The Legend of Zelda</strong>. He has since released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/omega_6_the_triangle_stars">Omega 6: The Triangle Stars</a> on Switch.</p>

Big, blue, and bouncy, this gelatinous monarch is the perfect entry point for testing your mettle, dropping some handy loot and setting the tone for boss battles to come.</p><p dir="ltr">Unlike the more dramatic foes lurking deeper in Terraria’s layers, King Slime is pretty casual about the way in which it appears, showing up if you poke it the right way or sometimes just crashing the party on its own. Although entirely optional, defeating it is often the first step towards serious progression, unlocking early mobility options and giving newer players a clear combat checkpoint. Here’s how to summon and beat King Slime in Terraria.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to prepare for King Slime</h2><p dir="ltr">While King Slime isn’t exactly Moon Lord material, it still pays to come prepared. The first <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-terraria-bosses-in-order/1100-6532648/" data-ref-id="1100-6532648" data-mce-href="/articles/all-terraria-bosses-in-order/1100-6532648/">Terraria boss</a> might be a glorified blue blob, but it’s one that teleports, spawns minions, and can flatten you like a professional pancake chef if you’re caught off guard.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4523258-how-to-summon-king-slime-gun.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4523258" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4523258-how-to-summon-king-slime-gun.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4523258"></a><figcaption>Using a gun against King Slime.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4523258-how-to-summon-king-slime-gun.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Make sure you’ve got at least copper-tier or better armor - packing wood armor is pushing your luck, and vanity-only setups are asking for a swift respawn screen. You might get away with melee weapons if you’re feeling brave or fancy a particularly tall challenge, but your best bet at this early stage is to equip a ranged weapon to keep your distance. Shurikens work well, but my pick is a bow with flaming arrows, as you can craft your ammo by hand using standard arrows and torches. As for accessories, finding a grappling hook and Hermes Boots from Underground and Cavern chests will help you maintain momentum.</p><p dir="ltr">Just like all Terraria bosses, life is much easier when making a platform arena ahead of the fight. Hack a few trees down with your axe, and you’ll soon have enough wood to craft the blocks by hand. You’ll need to anchor the first wooden platform onto something, such as stone, but once you’ve started extending, you can remove the initial placement without the whole thing collapsing. The further you go, the simpler it is to kite the King and avoid getting boxed in by blue slimes.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to spawn King Slime</h2><p dir="ltr">There are a few ways to get the royal jelly rolling, and none of them require a regal invitation.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4523262-how-to-summon-king-slime-crown.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4523262" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4523262-how-to-summon-king-slime-crown.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4523262"></a><figcaption>Use a Slime Crown to summon King Slime</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4523262-how-to-summon-king-slime-crown.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>King Slime spawns in three different ways:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Use a Slime Crown -</strong> Crafted at a Demon or Crimson Altar with 1 Gold/Platinum Crown and 20 Gel. Crowns are made from 1 Ruby + 5 Gold/Platinum bars at an anvil. Simple, clean, and entirely under your control</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Naturally spawn during Slime Rain -</strong> This random weather event causes slimes to fall from the sky. If you defeat enough, King Slime may drop in unexpectedly. It’s fashionably late, but will always show up towards the end if you meet the 150 slime quota</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Random spawn -</strong> On rare occasions, King Slime just spawns because he feels like it. You’ll either need to roam the outer edges of your world to the far left or right, particularly near forests, but you might stumble into an accidental boss fight. Just make sure it’s daytime, you’re on the surface, and there’s grass nearby</li></ul><p dir="ltr">King Slime has a few tricks: it teleports if you get too far away, bounces faster when its health drops, and constantly spits out blue slimes to keep you distracted. It’s also one of the few bosses that can despawn easily if you run too far or die, so don’t stray too far mid-fight.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to beat King Slime</h2><p dir="ltr">Keep your distance. King Slime is massive, slow, and easy to predict, but if you stand still for too long, it’ll hop right on top of you. Use platform layers or rope elevators to move vertically, and pepper it with ranged attacks. It only teleports when you're far away, so keep within a few blocks if you’re going to melee and want to avoid surprise jellification.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4523257-how-to-summon-king-slime-terraria-attack.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4523257" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4523257-how-to-summon-king-slime-terraria-attack.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4523257"></a><figcaption>Attacking King Slime.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4523257-how-to-summon-king-slime-terraria-attack.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Clear the blue slimes as they spawn, especially in Expert or Master Mode, where crowd control becomes critical. This prevents your arena from becoming a trampoline death trap. If you’re using flaming arrows, shurikens, or even early magic weapons like the Wand of Sparking, aim for sustained damage per second (DPS) and keep kiting.</p><p dir="ltr">When fighting with friends, designate a tank to hold his attention while ranged players pelt from above. It has no phase changes, just increased aggression and movement speed as it slowly shrinks from the damage it takes. Don’t panic when it gets faster. That just means you’re close to victory.</p><h2 dir="ltr">King Slime drops and rewards</h2><p dir="ltr">Defeating King Slime nets you a royal helping of goodies, particularly useful for early exploration. None are essential for progressing, but nice to have in preparation for your next fight.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Classic Drops</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Solidifier</strong> - Lets you craft slime-themed furniture</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Slime Gun</strong> - A bit useless but completely fun, giving you the ability to inflict the Slime debuff on both enemies and friendly NPCs alike</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Slime Hook</strong> - A grapple hook styled blue after the King</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Slimy Saddle</strong> - Ride around on your own mini Slime. It’s faster, jumps far higher than you can, and even float on water</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Ninja Armour Pieces</strong> - Helmet, shirt, and pants drop individually, affording decent movement bonuses and a stylish headband to boot</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>King Slime Trophy</strong> - Commemorate your victory with a wall hanging</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>King Slime Mask</strong> - A vanity item that plonks a blue bubble on your head</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Gel</strong> - Makes crafting a little easier, especially when making torches, sticky glowsticks, bombs, or the Slime Crown you’ll use to summon the King.</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr">Expert and Master Mode Drops</h3><p dir="ltr">All Classic drops apply to Expert and Master Modes, but these harder versions of Terraria boss fights give you extra rewards to aim for:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Royal Gel</strong> - An accessory that makes most regular slimes friendly. Consider it an early-game peace treaty</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Coins -</strong> Not glamorous, but everyone loves a bit of pocket change</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>King Slime Relic</strong> (Master Mode-only) - A golden piece of furniture to celebrate your win</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Royal Delight</strong> (Master Mode-only) - Summon the Slime Prince as your pet, right after you kill its father</li></ul><p>Beating King Slime also ticks off an early-game milestone: it earns you the Slippery Shinobi achievement, unlocks a Bestiary entry, and gets you one step closer to conquering Terraria’s ever-escalating gauntlet of chaos.</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 Splatoon 3 upgrade introduces some significant improvements that highlight just how much more powerful the new system is compared to its predecessor.</p>



<p><span>Over the weekend, the tech experts at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank">Digital Foundry</a>&nbsp;shared their analysis of multiple Nintendo Switch 2 upgrades for several original Switch first-party titles like Super Mario Odyssey, Zelda: Link's Awakening, and Echoes of Wisdom, and a few others, highlighting how the games have been improved on the new generation system.</span> The improvements introduced to the vast majority of games, however, don't highlight how much the new console is more powerful than its predecessor as the Splatoon 3 upgrade does. </p>



<p>The Splatoon 3 upgrade bumps the resolution from dynamic 1080p to 4K in docked mode with image quality improvements and, in some scenarios, the Nintendo Switch 2 increases resolution by five, six times, as seen in one instance where the game runs at 864p on the original system, and at 2160p on the new. The upgrade also massively improves the city hub area, which runs at locked 60 FPS on the Nintendo Switch 2, as does the rest of the game. In handheld mode, the upgrade is less of an improvements as the game ran well in the same mode on the original Switch, though the 1080p resolution at locked 60 FPS is still an improvement over the dynamic 720p resolution offered on the original system.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The power of the Nintendo Switch 2 is definitely being put to good use<span> to improve some of the best games released for its predecessor, and even&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-backward-compatibility-better-original-system/" target="_blank">unpatched games can brute-force some welcome performance improvemen</a>ts.&nbsp;</span>With the exception of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-display-problematic-worse-predecessor/">screen</a>, the system as a whole is a significant improvement over its predecessor, as highlighted by Chris in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">review.</a></p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is now available worldwide</p>

            <p>Yaaar, me hearties. Pull up a barstool and take another swig of grog. I be hearin' fresh tales of a treasure that's reportedly still in development at Ubisoft.</p>
<p>These whispers be comin' from Matt Ryan, the voice actor behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">Assassin’s Creed Black Flag</a>'s swashbucking stabber Edward Kenway. He's cheekily told some landlubbers that they may have to beat the game again, prompting the parrots to start squawking about a return to the Carribean yet again.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In a video posted to that most piratey of platforms, TikTok, Ryan asked a fan he was busy signing stuff for at a convention whether they'd played Black Flag. "Well, you might have to beat it again," the actor replied after the fan said yaaarrr.</p>
<p>After the fan said they've got to replay all of the games, Ryan then added: "Well, especially this one. There's a reason I say that, but I can't say anything." It's not quite a map to an island where there's a big X, but it's certainly got folks talking about the best AC game and sea shanty singalong machine again.</p> <div>

<p>While Ubisoft hasn't confirmed that a Black Flag remake is in the works, Kotaku reported that this was the case <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-might-be-remaking-their-swashbuckling-pirateventure-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">back in 2023</a>, stating that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skull-and-bones">Skull and Bones</a> developers Ubisoft Singapore were involved. <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/assassins-creed-black-flag-actor-says-fans-may-have-to-beat-the-game-again-as-remake-rumours-mount/">VGC</a> wrote in their story on Ryan's loose lippery that the remake is still in development as of right now.
</p>
<p>Black Flag, in case you've not played it, is a pretty good Assassin's Creed game and an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-pirate-games-on-pc">outstanding pirate game</a>. Sailing around in a big ship blasting various navies to bits with cannons and then boarding so you can take their booty was a right hoot in 2013, and odds are it'll be just as much of a hoot in the 2020s, assuming we do get this remake at some point.</p>
<p>For now, maybe start dusting off your tricorn and twin flintlock pistols, but keep your powder dry just in case things somehow hit the rocks and we don't set sail to the mysterious Isla de Remake a some point down the line.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rumoured-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-seemingly-teased-by-actor-whos-pretty-chill-about-loose-lips-sinking-ships]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Balls have never been footed so fast. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rematch">Rematch</a>, the moreish multiplayer soccer game from the developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sifu">Sifu</a>, has seen its first cases of speedhackers infesting the game over the last week. </p>
<p>It's not unusual for multiplayer games to suffer a few cheaters, and it's not clear how widespread the hacking tools are being used among the growing number of players (now at 3 million players, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/playrematch.com/post/3lseohvckdc2a">according to Sloclap</a>). But it is a mild concern to anyone who prefers their team mates and opponents to move at regular human pace, and not say, the speed of an angry motorcycle, as shown in footage captured by several players. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>One <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCkVDYOclm4">video of a speedhacker</a> posted by a player shows a nippy ne'er-do-well whirling around the pitch with the ball jerkily following their fast feet, scoring a few goals in the process as other players jog around sadly or stand still - perhaps completely stunned, or maybe just in the process of quitting the game. A couple of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aW5XIFsogo">other</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV-SYWamSro">videos</a> show the same behaviour in more matches. Booo! Poor sportsmanship, that.</p>
<p>Rematch does feature Easy Anti-cheat, however it looks like these sneaks have found a workaround, allowing them to run like a pursued gazelle across the field, even in a ranked 5v5 game. No anti-cheat solution is watertight but you'd hope this wouldn't happen when your precious Bronze division ranking is on the line. Hopefully it's something that can be caught and fixed by the studio. We've asked Sloclap for comment. </p>
<p>I haven't encountered a cheater myself so far, and it's worth saying that I'm loving the game. I effused as much in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rematch-review">Rematch review</a>. Even with its occasional server hiccup and the crashes that happen more frequently than I'd like, it's the most enjoyable football 'em up I've played since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rocket-league">Rocket League</a>. I am wary of the corporate sponsors lurking in the battlepass (last week saw the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/playrematch.com/post/3lsjmapqe6b2s">addition of a cosmetic kit</a> sponsored by sportswear company Puma). Football is like religion - better at the grassroots than under a wealthy organisation. But if it helps Sloclap keep the servers live, and doesn't get too invasive, I can shrug these things off.</p>
<p>Opponents running at superhuman speeds, though. That I cannot beat by wearing a brand.</p></div>

<p>I Am Your Beast is a fast-paced first person shooter with a comic book style that makes it feel like a cross between XIII, Rambo and Doom. Split into short missions across four different modes – Story, Challenge, COI Support Group, and Cold Sweat – Harding has to deal with different objectives which includes killing all enemies, surviving enemy waves, destroying satellite uplinks, and using laptops. Each mission gives you a rating at the end with your score dependant on how quickly you beat a level (apart from the wave missions), and the style in which you kill enemies. You will be ranked from a low D to a high S.There are also bonus objectives which unlock after you first complete a mission, and these can be things like using certain weapons to kill or doing a no kill run.</p>


<p>You have a plethora of options for taking out enemies.&nbsp;Harding can be like Mario and jump on an enemy’s head to decapitates them, or use tree bark to hit them. A combat knife can be thrown to instantly kill, or you can use pistols, shotguns, assault rifles, snipers to shoot at your enemies. Run out of ammo? You can throw weapons at enemies to knock them down and stomp on them as well. In some missions you get access to claymore mines and RPGs too, allowing you to take out groups of enemies in a satisfying explosion. Not that you need RPGs most of the time, when missions are stacked with red barrels to make go boom – it can get very loud.</p>


<p>The fast-paced nature of I Am Your Beast provides a good portion of the game’s challenge. You need to be moving constantly using your reflexes to quickly dispatch enemies, pick up weapons, fire them, chuck them, and pick up something else. You are doing all of this while working out the best route on the fly to kill enemies, or avoid them, and then finding the exit. There are times where things can be slightly overwhelming, especially if you get put in a tight spot, and there were some visibility issues when it came to the nighttime missions, making it harder to see the paths you can take. There were also a couple of moments where my momentum came to a halt because of minor obstacles in the environment getting the way.</p>
<p>What I Am Your Beast does very well is tell its story. There are cutscenes between each mission which consist of nothing but characters talking to each other, but the acting is great and the humour throughout is very good. In missions, soldiers will talk to each other and some of the conversations are funny, while others show some of the fear these soldiers have of Harding. Outside of the main story mode, the COI Support group has missions which are told from the perspective of the soldiers that survive the hunt for Harding, and you also have Cold Sweat, which provides the toughest missions in the game. These challenge mode missions are not canon to the plot of I Am Your Beast, but a fun aside.</p>

<p>The soundtrack is excellent with thumping mix of synths and guitars all coming together for some hard hitting beats. The visual design of I Am Your Beast is kind of comic book like and it looks very good. There is a lot of detail in the environments while enemies have slightly different looks to them depending on their strength. Like I mentioned earlier, the night levels could have been a little brighter as it can be tough to see where to go.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		I Am Your Beast is an excellent fast-paced first person shooter that has a lot of content to get through, and replayability where you will want to keep pushing for the top marks. There’s a well told and well acted story too. It looks and sounds great, but is slightly let down by the lighting in the night missions.	</p></div>

			<p>A new Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 mod, now available online introduces a highly requested feature that can make the game more enjoyable for users who have lamented the lack of a feature that has become a standard in the past few years.</p>



<p>The Minimap mod developed by paboyafx and now available for download from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/clairobscurexpedition33/mods/383?tab=description">Nexus Mods</a>, does exactly what its simple name indicates: it adds a fully functional minimap to the game, complete with multiple zoom multiplier options ranging from 0.35x to 3x. As the level design of the amazing role-playing game developed by Sandfall Interactive can get a little confusing at times, this simple mod can be a godsend for those who want to explore the game's locations in their entirety and don't want to rely on old-school methods to avoid getting lost.</p>



<p>To be completely honest, I did not feel much of a need for a minimap in my time with the game, and had tons of fun relying on the environment to avoid getting lost and exploring locations the best I could. This sort of approach to exploration further enhanced what is,<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/"> in my opinion</a>, one of the best role-playing games released in the past few years.</p>



<p><em>Before launch, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 looked like a solid yet safe role-playing game, but Sandfall Interactive’s debut shattered expectations in the best possible way. With a gripping story, a beautifully written cast of characters, and engaging gameplay that breathes new life into familiar mechanics, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a journey that leaves a lasting mark on both the mind and the heart.</em></p>



<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>
