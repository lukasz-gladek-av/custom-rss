But damn, it was close.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197586" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Disney+ Pulls The Abyss Over Controversial Rat Scene — Again" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="128" data-playlist="197586,196406,197589" data-current="197586"><div><p>Disney+ Pulls The Abyss Over Controversial Rat Scene — Again</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197586/197586_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197586/197586_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197586/197586_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23107.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Superman</em> made a fantastic $122 million in its domestic opening weekend, but lagged behind internationally, with $95 million coming in from the other 78 nations. <em>Fantastic Four: First Steps</em>, however, flipped that around—the latest entry in the MCU <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/world/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took in $118 million in the United States</a></span>, but $100 million worldwide. And yes, you’re right, those figures are all <em>incredibly</em> close.</p><p>$218 million for <em>Fantastic Four </em>to <em>Superman</em>’s $217 million means both Marvel and DC can be feeling pretty good about things right now. It also does put a lot of the last couple of weeks of handwringing about Supe’s international performance in a different perspective</p><p>Post <em>Superman</em>’s release, James Gunn has given a bunch of comments about why the film may not have performed as well overseas as hoped, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2025/film/news/james-gunn-superman-woke-anti-america-box-office-1236465776/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/james-gunn-superman-woke-anti-america-box-office-1236465776/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most recently claiming</a></span> that “anti-American sentiment around the world” could be behind the discrepancy, as well as suggesting Superman isn’t as well known in some foreign territories as names like Batman. But given both superhero flicks have made almost identical amounts, it seems that it could be a lot less about Superman specifically, and perhaps more about superheroes themselves.</p><p>Things are still going well for <em>Superman</em>. After three weekends of release, it’s now crossed the half-billion point, with a reported total of $502,701,478, with percent of that domestic. In contrast, 54 percent of <em>Fantastic Four</em>’s opening total is from the U.S. So, again, rounding errors, but the same pattern.</p><figure id="" data-id="69d291abf7f3fc913134b32f16353b4b" data-recommend-id="image://69d291abf7f3fc913134b32f16353b4b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1380" data-height="776" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="HERBIE the robot." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="HERBIE the robot." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="69d291abf7f3fc913134b32f16353b4b" data-recommend-id="image://69d291abf7f3fc913134b32f16353b4b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1380" data-height="776" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="HERBIE the robot." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The reason anyone cares about this is the implication that the perceived lack of overseas sales means these films might not be making as much money as they “should.” Looking through this years’s biggest movies, the normal proportion of total box office to come in domestically is between 32 and 50 percent. <em>F1: The Movie</em>, the extraordinary advertising feature starring Brad Pitt, made just 32 percent of its $510 million in the U.S. <em>Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning</em> is on $592 million, with 33 percent coming in from American audiences. Even <em>Captain America: Brave New World</em> got more than 50 percent abroad, and the same for <em>Thunderbolts*</em>.</p><p><em>A Minecraft Movie</em> teeters shy of the big one billion at $995 million, 44.4 percent domestic, while the biggest American movie of the year so far, <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em>, got 42 percent of its $1 billion from home shores. (The biggest movie of 2025, the Chinese animated film <em>Ne Zha II </em>which has pulled in an eye-watering $1.9 billion, got just one percent of that in the U.S.!)</p><p>So, given all this, producers and distributors will be wondering why international audiences aren’t showing up to skew the stats in a similar way for these two superhero movies. While sitting on thrones made of diamond-encrusted gold bullion.</p><p>It’ll be interesting to see if <em>Fantastic Four: First Steps</em> has the same legs as <em>Superman</em>, especially given it’s a somewhat more obscure property among the non-comics-reading public. Still, it’s already the 13th biggest film of the year after just a couple of days.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/fantastic-four-first-steps-opening-weekend-superman-1851787100]]></content:encoded>

                <p>As announced yesterday during the Middle-earth: The Adventure Ahead panel at San Diego Comic Con, the survival crafting game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria/" data-ref-id="5000-566000">The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria</a> is getting a brand new expansion. This new expansion, titled Durin's Folk, is very light on details though. It's currently slated for release in Q4, 2025, and a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2933130/view/545615719765639778?l=english" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam post</a> explains that you'll "continue the fight to restore Moria with an expanded end-game story, exciting new game mechanics, plus many unrevealed secrets!"</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dR3nlac_v90" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dR3nlac_v90" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>A small teaser trailer was also released, showing off a big empty hallway with a massive door being opened by a group of dwarves. Various characters speak over the trailer too, with one notably saying "Khazad-dum is the home of Durin's Folk." For some context, Khazad-dum is another name for Moria, so it sounds like this end-game focused expansion might actually be living up to the base game's subtitles. Durin is also one of the seven fathers of the dwarves, the original group of dwarves that founded the dwarven race, for any non-Lord of the Rings loreheads out there.</p><p dir="ltr">Return to Moria didn't receive an outstanding reception when it launched back in 2023, averaging a critics' score of 59 on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria/">Metacritic</a>, and a user score of 6.8. The game appears to be doing better on Steam these days, with a very positive rating across all of its reviews.</p><p dir="ltr">The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria is available to play now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>

<p>Total Digital Eclipse of the heart</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/18dac4deea960/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Digital Eclipse</em></figcaption></figure><p>We've been eagerly anticipating more news on Digital Eclipse's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection</a> since it was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection-comes-to-switch-and-switch-2-in-2025">revealed</a> last month with a 2025 release window, and while nothing has been <em>officially</em> shared, it looks like a more specific release date might have accidentally leaked — via the Xbox App, no less (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection-release-date-looks-like-its-been-leaked-early-by-xbox">IGN</a>).</p>
<p>As noted on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/">r/GamingLeaksAndRumours</a> Reddit forum, the Xbox App briefly had the upcoming collection listed for <strong>29th/30th September</strong> (thanks to the magic of time zones) over the weekend, though there was no official word from Digital Eclipse. The app listing has since reverted back to the 31st December 2025 placeholder that we so often see deployed for titles awaiting a specific date, but not before more than a handful of people clocked the change.</p>
<p>Speculation quickly ensued on the Reddit thread, with folks theorising that the devs might formally reveal the release date at EVO 2025 next weekend, or perhaps even that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/prominent-youtuber-doubles-down-on-belief-that-a-nintendo-direct-is-due-this-month">rumoured Nintendo Direct</a>. Either way, the specification of the app's date and its subsequent removal has made us a little less sceptical of this leak than we normally would be — even if we are still treating things with a pinch of salt.</p>

<p>For those who missed the Legacy Kollection reveal in last month's State of Play, this one sees Digital Eclipse hit up the "interactive documentary" format once again, with interviews, commentaries and interesting materials about some of the biggest games in MK history. That accompanies "over 20 different versions" of iconic Mortal Kombat titles, with the current lineup including the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mortal_kombat_ii">Mortal Kombat II</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/ultimate_mortal_kombat_3">Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/mortal_kombat_advance">Mortal Kombat Advance</a> and many more.</p>

			<p>Not every game, but some games, like Tripwire Interactive's Killing Floor 3, deliver exactly what you'd expect by looking at the cover. You shoot Zeds (read: zombies), and when you're done shooting Zeds in one level, there are more Zeds for you to shoot on another. In between the shooting, you'll level up your weapons, refill on ammo and gear, and then go back to shooting Zeds. Oh, and there are also a few narrative-driven tasks to complete, but the main course is shooting Zeds.</p>



<p>That's fine, really. I love a strong narrative, but I can just as easily get behind a game where the story is nothing more than a reason for the gameplay to happen. Or at least it would be, if shooting Zeds was worth the rest of the game's failings. It's not a bad thing for a game to be streamlined against everything else, but it's bad for those games to not even get their core pitch right.</p>



<p>Which is the unfortunate case Killing Floor 3 finds itself in. It's not about much more than shooting Zeds, and the shooting, along with the Zeds and everything else, is fresh from the 'just fine' section on the shelves of video game stores.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Tripwire Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>In some ways, it's not a bad shooter. There's a solid amount of Zeds that chase after you each wave, and their heads pop with enough satisfying zeal. Zeds are also varied enough, and present an interesting enough challenge as you try to deal with the different variants that'll shoot you, charge you, and jump you from every direction. Also, it's not the only issue I have with the sound mixing, but these have to be the quietest zombies I've ever not heard the way I've been caught off guard. Maybe that's just a me problem, and I have to get my ears checked, but it's come up enough times and like I said, it's not the only problem with how the game sounds.</p>



<p>There's a good deal of weapon variety, you can run around each map half-decently, and I appreciate that in a game so focused on bodily mutilation, you can drop the firearms and flamethrowers altogether and just enter the fray with a couple of swords. </p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Tripwire Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>It's a solid mix, and can help make the gameplay feel a little more engaging than it does when you stick to more tried-and-true combos, with my preference being a classic assault rifle/shotgun loadout.</p>



<p>There's also a good amount of synergy to be found with the six currently available classes to choose from. Between weapon, build and special ability coordination, there's a lot that you can combo up between teammates with a little communication and preparation. Unsurprisingly, it's better to hop into matches with others instead of try to run through any of these maps on your own. Playing solo is an option, but it's a huge grind to get anywhere compared to playing with others.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Killing Floor 3 boss Queen Crawler</figcaption></figure>



<p>And a grind is the only thing more plentiful than Zeds in Killing Floor 3. The amount of objectives there is to grind for is perfectly set up for new players to make Killing Floor 3 their new forever-game. Or at least that's clearly Tripwire Interactive's hope with how everything is already set up for it.</p>



<p>Not narrative objectives - there's only 10 main story-focused missions, through which Nightfall's director, Cordelia Clamely, narrates your way through as you jump back and forth between the Army Depot, R&amp;D Lab, Horzine Factory, Radar Station, Convoy, City Streets, and Offices. When they're done? </p>



<figure><figcaption>Killing Floor 3</figcaption></figure>



<p>Head back to all those same maps, plus one more (Sewers), and kill some more Zeds and the same three 'just fine' bosses, chasing after daily and weekly challenges, along with a random new challenge each week to mix things up a bit more if you are already getting tired of the base challenge the game's only core mode offers. Hear each of the characters rattle off their one-liners, and of course, there's also a battle pass with cosmetics for your character and weapons to work through. And then ramp up the difficulty when you get bored of running through each of the maps on the default 'Normal' setting.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Tripwire Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>Which, again, there's nothing inherently wrong with. I like a zone-out game as much as the next person, but Killing Floor 3 doesn't just feel like a surface-level game that you can zone out to. It feels like a game that's not totally there. That's not exactly complete, almost like the early access version of Killing Floor 3 before it's packed to the brim with DLC and actually chock-full of stuff to do and see. That's all on its way, of course. There's a<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1430190/view/517468222093525040"> first-year roadmap</a> already laid out, with a new specialist, new map, new Zed type to mow down, new bosses, weapons, mods, and more campaign-focused missions coming before the end of the year. In 2026, there's another map coming, more weapons, mods, a new Perk, which is what the classes are called, and then whatever is unannounced as part of the second year roadmap.</p>



<p>It all feels as hollow as the weapons unfortunately do, which is my other problem with the sound mixing and quality. Weapons don't sound satisfying on the trigger pull, and getting weapons to sound satisfying to fire is pretty much the whole game in shooters. Sure, there's a bunch of window dressing around that one aspect of the game, but how a gun sounds is the key element to how much fun it is to press the trigger. When that's lacking, practically nothing in the window dressing can make up for it.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Tripwire Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>There are more weapons, maps, specialists, perks, and everything else coming, but how much is tomorrow's promise worth today? In a game like Killing Floor 3, not much, thanks to the fact that you'll run out of things to do before the day is done, and then tomorrow the new content that's promised won't be out yet.</p>



<p>It's been nearly a full decade since <a href="http://wccftech.com/review/killing-floor-2-review-zombie-killing-never-looked-so-good/">Killing Floor 2</a>, which has been supported with a lot of content to work through in that time. Now, after some <a href="https://wccftech.com/killing-floor-3-has-a-july-release-date-after-unexpected-march-delay/">delay</a>, Killing Floor 3 has arrived, asking a full-price entry fee with nowhere near the kind of content Killing Floor 2 has. If you're brand new to the series, then it's easy to get in now on the ground floor (pun intended), but it's difficult to think that anyone who wasn't bored of Killing Floor 2 wouldn't just keep playing that instead of jumping into the third act of this trilogy.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Tripwire Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>And there's all of this before mentioning the fact that the game does not run particularly well at the moment. Tripwire Interactive is surely going to be putting out patch after patch to fix things, but its 'Mixed' review rating on Steam, with a good chunk of the 4,000+ reviews that players have left citing technical problems and a game that runs poorly, which it does, is another sign of a game released in an unfinished state.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Killing Floor 3 isn't a bad game, but at launch, it's a shell of the game that it's promised to be, a promise made by the fact that its predecessor is filled to the brim and then some with DLC. In the meantime, what we have is a game that doesn't fulfill the one ask I have of every shooter, where you can see everything you need to see in an afternoon, and where the rest of the time you're spent running around chasing giant objective lists that boil down to busy work. It's all just fine, and even knowing that the technical issues will hopefully be the first ones to get sorted, the bar is on the floor with Killing Floor 3. With the technical issues, you could say that it's not even hitting that minimum. Come back in a year and/or when it goes on sale to see if anything has changed.</p>

						<section>
				<p>Killing Floor 3 isn't a bad game in a lot of ways. The base pitch of killing Zeds can be fun, and when you get some friends together to properly line up different Perks, it can be a good time to pull different abilities together and get some good teamwork flowing. But there are better games you can play to accomplish all the things that Killing Floor 3 accomplishes, and with the flat sounding weapons and so little to do, on top of the early technical problems, Killing Floor 3 is not the kind of game you should run to your computer to check out at launch. Maybe in a year, though.</p>
				<div>
												<ul>
							<h6>Pros</h6>
							<li>Killing Zeds is a good time, even better and more chaotic with friends
</li><li>There's plenty of weapons and build variety to shake things up</li>						</ul>
																		<ul>
							<h6>Cons</h6>
							<li>It's a shell of a game with very little to do
</li><li>Guns sound hollow and aren't satisfying to shoot, even if Zeds still fall in a satisfying way
</li><li>Poor technical performance makes it a chore to run
</li><li>Progression is a grind, and an even worse one if you try to play the game solo</li>						</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Once known for their experiential horror titles focused on surviving rather than fighting, Bloober Team has slowly shifted their focus into a more combat-centric survival horror experience. After the success of last year’s remake of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/">Silent Hill 2</a>, the Polish developers recently unveiled a science fiction title they’ve been developing in tandem with The Medium. We and a small number of other journalists were recently invited out to Oakland, California, to get an early look at the first few hours of <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-dev-diary-outlines-combat-mechanics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>.</p>



<p>Sometimes it’s about writing what you know, and Bloober Team has taken that old adage to heart with Cronos: The New Dawn being set within a very familiar backdrop for the developers. Some of their earlier titles, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/observer-system-redux-dystopian-fear/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Observer</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-medium-silence-of-the-damned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Medium</a>, were also set within the country’s borders, but Cronos: The New Dawn represents a particular moment in time for the citizens. Following the aftermath of World War II and the Soviet occupation, the city of Nowa Huta was idealized in real life as a monument to the power of the Soviets and a utopian society centered around the city’s steelworks. It’s here, set many years in the future from the city’s intended groundbreaking, that Cronos: The New Dawn takes place. As one of the developers said, putting an authentic piece of the world into a horror story makes it more attractive because you can identify with it even if you’ve never been there.</p>



<p>As a Traveler, the player is tasked with venturing back into key moments of time and extracting a target before they are killed. This is done by piloting into time rifts and exploring the world with only a rough idea of where the intended survivor is. From there, the Traveler is largely on their own, taking over in the footsteps of where their predecessors might have fallen.</p>



<p>Cronos: The New Dawn takes a lot of inspiration from the development of Silent Hill 2 in how the game flows, from the intimate camera angles to inventory management and opening locked doors. What sets this science fiction horror apart from the more psychological traumas of James Sunderland are the enemies known as Orphans. These grotesque and often indescribable masses of flesh and tentacles seek out the player with indiscriminate focus, chasing them down and even coordinating their attacks to sneak up on the player while their back is turned. Something unique that Bloober Team has introduced in Cronos: The New Dawn is the ability for these creatures to merge into one another and combine attributes from a fallen comrade, making them more deadly and more difficult to put back down. Having to deal with one Orphan that can spit acid is bad enough, but once they get reinforced armor, fighting them face to face becomes a struggle.</p>



<p>The most efficient way of dispatching these Orphans once they’re knocked down or slain is by using fire. The Traveler can use accelerants scattered around the environment, like discarded jerry oil cans or conspicuously marked barrels, to fill the area with fire. The player can also restock up to a single fuel cell (at least this early on in the story) that can be used to shoot out a small flamethrower and engulf those around in flames. As Cronos: The New Dawn doesn’t feature your traditional dodge or evasion movements, the developers showed off that this flamethrower ability is their way of giving players a way to escape from enemies or mitigate an incoming attack. While the player can only hold one unit of fuel at a time, I did make an effort to see if the game would let me store one in the Item Box that litters many save rooms; the game already knows if you have any fuel in hand, even if it’s in one of these boxes, so there isn’t a way to break the game and carry around more than intended.</p>



<p>Inside these save rooms are a number of terminals that can be used to upgrade The Traveler themselves as well as their different weapons they pick up. From your modest pistol to a stronger shotgun and others, each gun can use the currency that The Traveler picks up on their mission to upgrade the various parameters, giving weapons more damage, a faster reload speed, or also giving the player more health to stand a better chance at surviving. There’s also a crafting table in most locations and the same materials used to make bullets are also used to craft healing supplies, so players must make a conscious decision as to which would give them a better chance of surviving.</p>



<p>The gunplay in Cronos: The New Dawn is largely similar to what players saw in Silent Hill 2 or even EA’s Dead Space series. Played in an over-the-shoulder perspective, players can freely target limbs on an enemy to knock them down or aim for the head for increased damage. Out of all the weapons that I picked up during my two-hour session, the shotgun was the only one that felt like it was properly effective. The pistol was little more than a deterrent unless you were willing to unload the better part of a full magazine into a single enemy to take them out. Of course, you could just as easily try to run around some of these enemies and save your bullets, but the tight corridors of Nowa Huta’s apartment buildings don’t give The Traveler much room to run past an enemy. Once they’re downed, you can always give them a good head stomp just to be sure, but that won’t stop enemies from merging. Only fire gives players that certainty.</p>

<p>My experience culminated in a boss fight against a writhing mass of tentacles that would form itself into a hulking black humanoid that would either chase me down and swing indiscriminately in my direction or start throwing parts of itself at me when I tried to shoot it at range. I was rather thankful that this was at the end of the demo, as I had used up all of my healing items and bullets that I brought with me and was limited to the ammo that I could scavenge from the enclosed arena to do the final bits of damage. It was a bit of a low point to the experience, not just because it took me multiple attempts before I could dispatch the boss and get to my final destination, but also at how spongy some of the enemies can be and just how many bullets they’d take to go down.</p>



<p>If you take a step off the beaten path and explore around Nowa Huta in Cronos: The New Dawn, there are multiple small side paths that often lead to lost artifacts that can be cashed in for currency or those essential few bullets or healing items necessary for survival. There are also a variety of collectibles, from your usual gamut of audio logs and written notes to comic books. Backtracking to a much earlier section of the demo with the wire cutters I picked up rewarded me with a quiet respite filled with collectible supplies and a single cat that was added to my lorebook, seemingly one of the various collectibles to scour and find throughout neofuture Krakow.</p>



<p>Cronos: The New Dawn merges a familiar take on the developer’s homeland with the science fiction of time travel and trying to divert a catastrophe from taking place. With an estimated runtime of sixteen hours, this will be longer than your usual survival horror trip. I am curious to see how Bloober Team intends to pace the story and how rescuing these survivors (or not) will affect how the narrative plays out.</p>



<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is tentatively set for a Fall 2025 release across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC/Mac.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ironically, humanity’s eternal fascination with the end of their lives always has them living outside of the moment. Memory’s the mission, of course, but this worry about whether there’s a reception after the end of everything is, rightfully, a massive roadblock, one which can be considered one of those final hurdles before you can comfortably exist. It’s a conundrum which <em>Heartworm </em>tackles head-on.</p>

<p>This is the debut commercial title spearheaded by Vincent Adinolfi: a survival horror tribute which initially received warm hype when it debuted alongside other titles in the first <a href="https://hauntedps1.itch.io/demodisc2020" rel="nofollow">Haunted PS1 Demo Disc in 2020</a>. Since then, <em>Heartworm </em>has become a labor of love which has seen resistance in the form of delays and, most unfortunately, <a href="https://filmstories.co.uk/news/developer-puts-out-a-call-for-help-as-ps1-style-horror-game-heartworm-loses-its-publisher/" rel="nofollow">a publisher drop-out in 2023</a>. Thankfully, DreadXP are here to save the day, hot on the heels after the runaway success of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/white-knuckle-early-access-preview-falling-from-cloud-9" rel="nofollow"><em>White Knuckle</em></a>.</p>

<p>You play as Sam, a young woman who is suffering from the effects of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder after her grandfather passes away. Unable to cope with the grief, Sam comes across a message board composed of users who’ve heard of a house in the backcountry which has a connection to the void beyond the void. Desperate and with seemingly no other options, Sam enters the house to find out for herself.</p>



<p>One thing that’s going to be immediately obvious about <em>Heartworm </em>– maybe even potentially off-putting – is how unapologetic it is about what came before it. Stylistically and mechanically, it’s punching towards the PS1’s entries of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/resident-evil-20-years-later" rel="nofollow"><em>Resident Evil</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/where-can-i-play-silent-hill-this-october" rel="nofollow"><em>Silent Hill</em></a>. Narratively, it seeks to execute the same environmental storytelling depth of something like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/genre-advancing-shooters-half-life" rel="nofollow"><em>Half-Life</em></a>, but in Adinolfi’s own words, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/22-years-later-half-lifes-influence-is-still-being-felt/" rel="nofollow">a more personal touch</a> has been embossed across the entire package.</p>

<p>Gameplay in <em>Heartworm </em>will consist of the usual type of survival horror shenanigans, that being logistically fantastical puzzles, fixed camera angles which sway between artistic, obstructing, or both, and very, <em>very </em>light combat. A lot of the puzzles can be considered “milquetoast” in a capacity: you find a sequence, memorize the sequence, use the sequence to continue, and this will be <em>Heartworm</em>’s main brain tester.</p>

<p>How it presents those sequences does vary, and <em>Heartworm </em>encourages making your own notes, but I was never challenged enough to go that far. There are never enough pieces or wrong answers to mentally take into account, and the answers are never far enough away from the question to be considered a burden. At the very least, they stay consistent, which is necessary for a story aiming to contort the space around you.</p>



<p>Still, it fares a hell of a lot better than what the combat offers over time. It’s described as “limited”, but contextually, it’s because there’s only one option, and that’s using your camera to stun them into oblivion, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/fatal-frame" rel="nofollow"><em>Fatal Frame</em></a>-style. Pop a few candid shots of your own inner fears, and watch them disappear before your eyes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this case, enemy variety is important, and how you interact with them in the heat of battle. <em>Heartworm </em>responds firmly with a fat handful of enemies, each of them unique in their lethality, the highlight of which will be your most common encounter: a walking spectre made of TV static. With its glitchy screams and wails calling for help, your first couple of encounters with them will be nail-biting, but this is where the intensity starts and ends.</p>

<p>As time goes on, combat doesn’t just become an intrusion, but it’s entirely recommended you avoid it entirely, and that’s not in <em>Heartworm</em>’s advice or favor. Enemies become less of a statement on the horror's intuition, but obstacles that speak to be nothing more than such, especially in the latter half of the game, where <em>Heartworm </em>is extremely stingy with ammo for your camera.</p>



<p>Does this feed into the sensibilities of survival horror? Intrinsically, yes, but at the same time, <em>Heartworm </em>is terrified of the player finding frustration in its mechanics of old – no checkpoints, spread-out save room locations, etc – that health items practically rain from the sky. Enemies will only ever deal physical damage to you over time, so don't worry about poison, crippling effects, so on and so forth.</p>

<p>As for the boss fights, you’ll find yourself in tricky situations, but the fights themselves suffer from a terrible case of waiting. There’s never much fortitude on display from the offerings of a giant spider, regardless of whatever game possesses them, but here, the giant spiders and the other looming bookends of each individual act will play similar roles of "they attack, you stun, they run, repeat".</p>

<p>Still, going to a horror game for the bosses is like going to a pizza place for a salad, and <em>Heartworm</em>’s aesthetic is the meal you're looking for. Where <em>Heartworm </em>picks and chooses to let its visual design and art direction fly free are when the game peaks, shimmering depictions of surrealist architecture and stress-inducing set pieces. How it envisions Sam in these environments does become a bit of an issue, especially when it zooms out and shows the full scale of the twisted psyche on display, and Sam becomes a black speck on the horizon -- this can happen even when you have the retro filters turned off.</p>



<p>I played through <em>Heartworm </em>twice, once for the gameplay, and once for the narrative, finding myself at the same conclusion both times in that Sam isn’t even the main character of her own story. Fairly quickly, her context, her reasoning, her history and presence, get snubbed in favor of a larger collective, one that also isn’t given the breathing room to justify considering how much time has been spent, and consecutively wasted on her.</p>

<p>When Sam’s story does return to the spotlight, it's done with such violent strokes of theming and messaging that it's painted in harsh juxtaposition with everything else. Every revelation and turn of the page is set up in implications, never a set statement that wants to mean something, or make you feel something. This is saved for the ending, which, without spoiling, sets up an entirely new implication which throws the entire message out of the water.</p>

<p>It’s a far cry from the previous demo’s of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/heartworm-preview-authentic-survival-horror" rel="nofollow"><em>Heartworm</em></a>, which establish her as more of a team player in terms of how she co-exists with the world presented, and those decisions are muted, but still present. In the full game however, she’s become a tourist to her own turmoils, her trials and tribulations seemingly ineffectual to the alarmingly blurry precedent on display. What messages exist in <em>Heartworm </em>are steeped in sympathy, but it’s hard not to feel apathetic towards a protagonist who, now, has had her resolution dismantled in the name of something I’m still not sure of.</p>

<h2><em>Heartworm&nbsp;</em>Review | Final Verdict</h2>

<p><em>Heartworm </em>is gorgeous. It’s so easy to fall in love with how it ticks and trickles its intricacies towards the player, but when the stakes ramp up, so much of its promise is dropped for too many ideas, that none of them get their proper chance to shine. It fades before you even get a chance to drink it in, and the memories it leaves behind are only able to become mere footnotes.</p>

<section><p>Bloober Team's follow-up to its successful remake looks to be similarly nerve-racking.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">After a few hours with Bloober Team's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-2/" data-ref-id="5000-574201">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, it became clear to me that the oft-derided developer had made something special, and the conversation about the studio was about to change. After a few hours with Bloober Team's next game, the sci-fi horror <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cronos-the-new-dawn/" data-ref-id="5000-647672">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, questions about the studio's capabilities are virtually an afterthought for me. I'm no longer wondering if the team can set and achieve lofty goals. Cronos has impressed in the two hours I've played it so far, and though I still have questions and will reserve my final judgment for the full game later this year, it's clear the team has found its secret weapon in how it has designed Cronos' combat gameplay.</p><p dir="ltr">When I previously saw Cronos during a hands-off showing in June, I likened its "merge system" of combat encounters to Dead Space, only played almost in reverse. Rather than strategically "cut off their limbs," like the famous bloody wall scrawl once instructed Isaac Clarke to do, Cronos delivers its own desperate plea: "Don't let them merge!" Enemies can absorb their defeated comrades, creating towering monstrosities that may well combine multiple classes into something more threatening.</p><p dir="ltr">For example, if one of the stalking husks of biomass that has blade-like appendages merges with one of the others that spews toxic bile at you, well, now you've got yourself a third, worse thing, offering the most horrific of both worlds. Sometimes the stakes are heightened from the get-go, with no shortage of motionless husks lying around any momentary battlefield you might find yourself in, and it may cross your mind to first burn away those buffs with a flamethrower--and maybe with a nearby fuel recharger, you can even accomplish this at times.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4538463-cronos_nest.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4538463" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4538463-cronos_nest.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4538463"></a><figcaption>By merging, enemies combine their strengths and become much more fearsome.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4538463-cronos_nest.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">But the real tension of any encounter comes when you're trying to manage not just how you'll kill enemies, but where. With an area-of-effect blast of your flamethrower that shoots out toward the ground in a small circle, you can permanently burn the bodies and prevent them from merging into a still-active enemy. This left me constantly worrying about where defeated enemies would fall, forcing me to sometimes purposely evade, but not yet kill, the game's monsters, or "orphans."</p><p dir="ltr">Flamethrower fuel was extremely limited in my demo, so the best practice was to get a few of them to die almost on top of each other, then light them ablaze like a big sci-fi viking funeral. But that's easier said than done, so inevitably I'd be faced with the choice to kill an enemy outright, whether its place of death was advantageous to me or not...which would then feed this felled monster back into my path as I'd watch it merge with other monsters still pursuing me.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a really clever wrinkle that once more gives Bloober Team an exceptionally tense combat system to lean into. In my <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/silent-hill-2-remake-review-born-from-a-wish/1900-6418296/">Silent Hill 2 remake review</a>, I wrote abou how I'd often make it out of a fight for my life and "observed my breathing return to normal, and felt my shoulders release their tension." Similar feelings defined my Cronos hands-on preview. Initially, I was quite proud of my smart combat decisions that did just what I was instructed to do: I wasn't letting them merge. However, as encounters became more complicated, <em>some</em> merging felt like an unfortunate inevitability. I couldn't be everywhere at once, and I didn't have enough fuel to burn away all the bodies, so I saw more than a few merged, ambulating nightmares, which always provided the healthy kind of stress and anxiety that horror games should offer.</p><p dir="ltr">With a gun that slowly charges to fire off its most powerful shots, ammo scarcity went beyond just the fuel, too. I could quickly fire off multiple, weaker rounds, using up more ammo, or I could try to nail more powerful single shots, but they were sometimes very difficult to land on target, and the enemies would charge toward me in the meantime, of course. Combined with the merging enemies, this created combat encounters that demanded I constantly consider my moment-to-moment choices. Lining up shots on one particular boss' weak points was difficult enough, and supplies were low enough, that it took me about four or five tries to finally kill the thing. Since my demo started from the game's opening, I understood this to be the first boss of the game. Future bosses are not likely going to be more forgiving, I assume.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4538464-cronos_hospital.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4538464" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4538464-cronos_hospital.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4538464"></a><figcaption>The slimy world of Cronos sets the stage for a time-travel horror story I'm eager to see for myself.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4538464-cronos_hospital.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">With gunplay and exploration taking plenty of cues from the genre's long history, I now find myself a few months out from Cronos' launch without much to worry about when it comes to gameplay. Upgrading my suit and weapons provided hard-fought and welcome buffs, I was constantly rewarded for going off the main path--like when I rescued a cat tied to a side quest that tasks you with saving many of them over the course of the story--and I especially loved the downbeat vibes of safe rooms, made whole with their own theme song like one of Capcom's finest.</p><p dir="ltr">There's still so much more to see before I know how the whole experience comes together. Bloober Team says the game will take about 16 hours to beat on a typical playthrough--more if you plan to see everything it offers. Cronos comes from a team of people within Bloober Team that is different from those responsible for Silent Hill 2. Naturally, the Silent Hill 2 remake enjoyed the blueprint of Team Silent's effort, so Cronos is the studio's chance to show it can do it all on its own. For now, at least, it seems the studio has found a way to make combat compelling and put its own original spin on the horror genre.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> modder behind a bunch of the game's most popular romance mods is set to make NPC showering an optional extra in two of their works, with the hopes that these "non-sexy mods" will no longer be "hidden unnecessarily".</p>
<p>Their decision comes as a response to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nexus-mods-are-set-to-introduce-adult-mod-age-verification-for-uk-and-eu-users-soon">recent changes Nexus Mods have made</a> regarding creations that're classed as "adult", something the modding site's done as a result of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/online-safety-act">Online Safety Act</a> coming into force in the UK. The legislation's seen the likes of social media and porn sites also have to adopt new age verification checks before allowing users to access a range of content deemed unsuitable for children.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Naturally, this has meant that mods which tinker with or add to how romancing characters works in the likes of 18-rated <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> Cyberpunk have been flagged as adult by Nexus. This currently includes <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4508">Judy Romanced Enhanced</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4626">Panam Romanced Enhanced</a> by prolific modder Phil 'Deceptious' Wright, as of writing the fifth and sixth <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/cyberpunk2077/mods?categoryName=Gameplay&amp;sort=downloads">most downloaded mods of all-time</a> when it comes to CD Projekt's Bladerunnery adventure.</p>
<p>While you might think from their names that these mods would be obvious candidates for age-restriction, the situation's a bit more complicated than that. You see, unlike plenty of <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/9573?tab=description">Wright's other works</a>, these Judy and Panam mods don't actually add in new sexual encounters, instead simply giving the two affected NPCs more detailed daily schedules and the ability to be quickly hugged/kissed. Less x-rated smut fest, more just helping make it easier for you to roleplay as boyfriend, girlfriend, or partner.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://x.com/DeceptiousPhil/status/1949479630517551124">Twitter post</a> from Deceptious - which ironically ended up being briefly hidden from me by one of the Musk platform's new adult content blocks - the thing that's seemingly led these two pretty innocent works to be pinged as NSFW is the fact they make Judy and Panam have regular, non-sexy showers as part of their schedules. To be fair, the mods don't lock their respective bathroom doors, though the Panam one does look to include optional opaque shower curtains in the name of privacy.</p>
<p>So, in order to avoid having "these non-sexy mods hidden unnecessarily", Wright's currently putting together new "family friendly" versions that'll see the two ladies permanently barred from having a wash, unless you download what'll either be optional plugins or separate mods that give them the ok to pick up a sponge.</p>
<p>It looks to be a pretty unique case as far as Cyberpunk mods that've been flagged as adult go. It's also exactly the kind of strange situation that folks had envisioned might happen with the new rules, given the notoriously unprudish nature of games like Cyberpunk. After all, mods with Sims-style shower blurring wouldn't really fit with the rest of the game. Though I guess you could spin it as a bit of cyberware V's secretly had installed, so that they aren't permanently scarred by the sight of a nipple or two during their breaks from brutally murderdeathing goons.</p>
<p>Anyway, it's good to see Deceptious has seemingly found a solution that works for him, in terms of both keeping the mods highly visible on Nexus and ensuring 90% or so of the stuff they include stays as is. Plus, it's <a href="https://x.com/DeceptiousPhil/status/1949536999766966593">helped him</a> unearth a bug that was trapping Panam in the shower.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-modder-makes-npc-cleanliness-optional-in-order-to-avoid-popular-non-sexy-mods-being-hidden-unnecessarily]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Australian pressure group Collective Shout has claimed responsibility for the recent Itch.io and Steam developments that have seen the platforms change how they deal with - and in some cases remove - NSFW games and content from their respective platforms.</p>
<p>The group had already been closely linked with the situation, which has seen <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-introduces-vague-new-rules-banning-certain-kinds-of-adult-content-to-appease-credit-card-companies">Itch.io and Steam scramble to appease payment providers like Visa</a> as they suddenly took an interest in the kind of games available on the platforms, especially those which contravened rules and "standards" the payment providers apparently had. It led to Itch.io deindexing all NSFW content from its browse and search pages, and Steam introducing vague new rules about adult content, while removing a slew of games.</p>
<p>"In response to false claims and misinformation about our campaign, we're setting the record straight," <a href="https://www.facebook.com/collectiveshout/posts/pfbid0To1Tp69DJ3P39utywXrMbFwGERcnWmcSBmQMZoUhL9EDu9sZjXBgAgrMDRJFs46Kl">wrote Collective Shout in a Facebook update</a>. "Some have asked why we involved payment processors, and others have claimed we are responsible for Itch.io removing all NSFW content.</p>

<p>"We raised our objection to r*pe and incest games on Steam for months, and they ignored us for months. We approached payment processors because Steam did not respond to us.</p>
<p>"We called on Itch.io to remove r*pe and incest games that we argued normalised violence and abuse of women. Itch.io made the decision to remove all NSFW content. Our objections were to content that involved s*xualised violence and torture of women."</p>

The group's actions - a mixture of petitioning, emailing, and lobbying - began in early April and led to the game being removed from sale later that month.</p>

</figure>
<p>The group continued to send hundreds of emails to Valve about problematic games that remained on Steam, but said it wasn't until it began lobbying payment processors such as Visa, PayPal and MasterCard that change began to happen.</p>
<p>This rush to appease payment processors has met with pushback from parts of the gaming community. There have been collective efforts, for instance, to counter-lobby payment companies like Visa in an effort to turn them around.</p>
<p>An open letter template to Visa, shared on Reddit (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/steam-gaming-industry-visa-payment-processors-adult-games-banned/">TheGamer</a>), reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I am concerned customer about Visa's recent efforts to censor adult content on prominent online game retailers, specifically the platforms Steam and Itch.io. As a long-time Visa customer, I see this as a massive overreach into controlling what entirely legal actions/purchases customers are allowed to put their money towards.</p>
<p>"Visa has no right to dictate my or other consumers' behavior or to pressure free markets to comply with vague, morally-grounded rules enforced by payment processing providers. Unless these Draconian impositions are not reversed, I will have no choice but to stop dealing with Visa and instead swap to competing companies not directly involved in censorship efforts, namely Discover and AmericanExpress."</p></blockquote>
<p>Some people have reportedly had responses from Visa to this letter, which insist the company is not moderating content, does not make "moral judgements" about content, and supports the sale of all content considered "legal". Visa's alleged response reads (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1m9ly2j/so_i_got_a_response_from_visa/">via Reddit</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"While we explicitly prohibit legal activity on our network, we are equally committed to protecting legal commerce. If a transaction is legal, our policy is to process the transaction. We do not make moral judgements on legal purchases made by consumers.</p>
<p>"Visa does not moderate content sold by merchants, nor do we have visibility into the specific goods or services sold when we process a transaction. When a legally operating merchant faces an elevated risk of illegal activity, we require enhanced safeguards for the banks supporting those merchants."</p></blockquote>
<p>No one will lament the removal of No Mercy from sale on Steam, but whenever a net like this is thrown over an entire area of perceived problematic content, there will be well-intentioned games caught in the net too. Specifically, LGBTQ+ games are under threat - games that don't align with the Christian values underpinning the pressure group Collective Shout.</p>

            <p>PlayStation 5 owners are reportedly getting two more Xbox-published titles added to their roster.</p>
<p>According to a report by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-gears-of-war-e-day-and-state-of-decay-3-are-coming-to-ps5">MP1st</a>, both Gears of War: E-Day and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/state-of-decay-3">State of Decay 3</a> will be coming to PS5.</p>
<p>The publication cited resumes of developers working on each game, with both listing the PS5 as a target platform for their respective titles.</p>

<p>Xbox has been steadily adding more of its games to additional platforms. Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-xbox-exclusive-games-heading-to-ps5-and-switch-according-to-phil-spencer">Microsoft confirmed its plans to bring four previously Xbox-exclusive first-party titles to PlayStation 5 and Switch</a>, with more to follow. And follow, they have.</p>
<p>Following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-published-sea-of-thieves-reportedly-surpasses-1m-sales-on-playstation-5">successful release of Grounded, Sea of Thieves and Hi-Fi Rush across additional platforms</a>, Microsoft has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-xbox-console-exclusive-forza-horizon-5-is-ps5s-highest-selling-game-of-the-year-so-far-says-analyst">since released the likes of Forza Horizon 5</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-selling-faster-on-ps5-than-steam-and-xbox">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on PlayStation</a>. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-of-war-coming-to-playstation">original Gears of War has been confirmed to be coming to PlayStation later this year</a>, as part of the revamped "Reloaded" edition of the game.</p>
<p>It therefore would not be surprising to see Gears of War: E-Day pop up on PlayStation 5, even if not as a day one release. The next new entry in the series is a prequel title <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marcus-fenix-returns-in-gears-of-war-prequel-e-day">set 14 years before the events of the original game</a>. Gears of War: E-Day is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bulletstorm-studio-confirms-project-maverick-is-a-gears-of-war-game">being co-developed with People Can Fly</a>. Late last year, it was revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-is-so-back-as-original-voice-talents-are-confirmed-for-gears-of-war-e-day">John DiMiaggio and Carlos Ferro will be reprising their roles as Marcus Fenix and Dominic Santiago</a> in Gears of War: E-Day.</p>
<p>As for State of Decay 3, this leads one to wonder whether the first two games in the series may eventually arrive on PlayStation as well. State of Decay 3 was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/state-of-decay-3-announced">initially announced</a> during Microsoft's 2020 Xbox showcase. Things went dark for a little while, and there were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/state-of-decay-3-report-details-troubled-development">reports alleging sexism and mismanagement at developer Undead Labs in 2022</a>. The game subsequently reappeared last year, with a new trailer.</p>
<p>To accompany the trailer, studio head Philip Holt teased some of the ideas driving State of Decay 3's development. "The first thing that I hope people pick up [from the trailer] is that there's four player characters we're highlighting," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/state-of-decay-3-resurfaces-after-four-years-with-new-cinematic-trailer">he explained at the time</a>, "three of them start in different places in the world - so we're implying this idea of a shared world experience, not just a ride-along, and that the boundaries in which you can go off independently are going to be much, much greater than they were in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/state-of-decay-2">State of Decay 2</a>."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/xboxs-state-of-decay-3-and-gears-of-war-e-day-heading-to-ps5-report-claims]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="﻿Pokémon Friends Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157643/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>It seems like every <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/pokemon-presents-july-2025-every-announcement-full-livestream">Pokémon Direct</a> spends more than half its runtime detailing updates for or announcing casual <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-pokemon-spin-off-games-of-all-time">Pokémon spin-offs</a>. From <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_cafe_remix">Pokémon Café ReMix</a> to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_sleep">Pokémon Sleep</a>, we’ve gotten so many Pokémon-themed experiences that any new announcements outside of the Generation X games feel as tired as a Snorlax after a large meal. This gives the most recent release — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_friends">Pokémon Friends</a> — an uphill battle to gain the attention of an increasingly broad Pokémon audience.</p>
<p>Pokémon Friends features a collection of simple puzzle-style minigames that reward you with different types of yarn that you can then throw into a Plush-O-Matic to pop out a collectible Pokémon Plush. From Sparky Yarn to Creepy Yarn, each corresponds with Pokémon types. For example, you’ll get Ghost and Poison-type Pokémon from Creepy Yarn like Gengar and Croagunk, while Sparky Yarn yields only electric critters like Pikachu and Pachirisu.</p>
<figure><a title="﻿Pokémon Friends Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157645/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Yup, Pokémon Friends is more or less a gacha game, albeit not a punishing one. Most yarn types have a rare Pokémon to pull at about a 2% rate compared to the other ‘mons at around 8%. You can place these plushies off in little room dioramas or give them to NPCs looking for a specific type to complete daily quests in order to collect more furniture for your rooms, and that's about it. There's no online functionality like a trading system or a way to share your rooms.</p>
<p>The plushies are definitely cute, but as there are only about a dozen to collect of each type of yarn, pulling your favourites doesn’t feel quite as exciting as pulling an Immersive card in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> or another comparable gacha game. I don’t count this as a negative, necessarily. TCG Pocket is far more 'predatory' while Pokémon Friends maintains a much less stressful vibe; that said, if you’re looking to grind out the full Plush Dex, you likely won’t find it all that rewarding an experience.</p>
<p>Actual problems begin to pop up like Digletts when you start playing the puzzles. These aren’t designed for 35-year-olds like myself who have played Pokémon since they were 9 years old; rather, they’re simple puzzles made with children in mind that were clearly created for mobile play and not the Nintendo Switch.</p>
<figure><a title="﻿Pokémon Friends Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157648/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>This is seen in the puzzles themselves — which we’ll get to — and the way they’re presented. In the free mobile version of Pokémon Friends, you need to drop $9.99 USD otherwise you’re locked to just a few puzzles each day. In turn, this means you’ll get to pull way fewer plushies, making the entire experience far more drawn out.</p>
<p>On Switch, you have to pay $9.99 to even download the game with two $15 puzzle packs available to purchase that add an additional 10 puzzles and 40 plushies each automatically into the pools. This means that with the initial purchase you can play as many sets of puzzles as you want and pull as many plushies as you want in a given day, unless you restrict yourself with an in-game setting.</p>
<p>As we purchased the Pokémon Friends Combo Bundle that comes with the two puzzle packs for the slightly discounted price of $35, we had a total of 50 puzzles to experience. Each time you play, Pokémon Friends throws at you three random puzzles with around three to six stages of that specific puzzle to complete.</p>
<figure><a title="﻿Pokémon Friends Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157640/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>They start off incredibly simple but level up in difficulty after each completion. Many of them focus on shapes, like Pumpkaboo’s Shadow Show, where you have to judge what the 2D silhouette of a 3D <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/tetris">Tetris</a>-like block will look like when Pumpkaboo casts light upon it. In others, like Lotad’s Ferry Service, you guide a cute little Bulbasaur across a pond by figuring out the correct Lotads to ride on.</p>
<p>Despite how much I enjoyed seeing some of my favourite Pokémon star in their own minigames, I grew tired of several of the puzzles rather quickly – even with all 50 puzzles unlocked. I can only imagine how tired I’d grow of Pikachu’s Power Line and Greninja’s Secret Shapes if I only had the base 30 puzzles to play, especially when those puzzles sometimes repeat the same stages at higher difficulties and you can't pick which ones you'd like to play or block the ones you're bored of.</p>
<p>Pokémon Friends was clearly designed with the mobile version’s daily restriction in mind, which makes playing for more than a couple of hours at a time a detriment to the experience.</p>
<figure><a title="﻿Pokémon Friends Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157637/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>And as you’d expect in a mobile-first title, most puzzles greatly benefit from the Switch’s touchscreen controls. You see, the quicker you solve the puzzles, the better quality yarn you receive, giving you a chance to pull an extra plush and to reach new high scores. If you want to play docked with a controller, you’ll still be able to clear every puzzle, but you’ll definitely lose a few seconds here and there.</p>
<p>On the other hand, trying to organise your plushies in a room with both the controller and touchscreen is an exercise in frustration; the drag-and-place function simply doesn't work all that well with room depth, which makes placing your Flygon next to your Salamance plush an annoying endeavour.</p>
<p>Despite starting off simple enough that toddlers can take them on, the puzzles begin to show some bite around level six or seven, with a max level of nine. Mind you, they never reach <strong>Professor Layton</strong>-levels of mind-straining difficulty, but even those 35-year-olds that grew up with Pokémon will have to pause and think every so often at higher levels.</p>
<figure><a title="﻿Pokémon Friends Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157642/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I certainly preferred some puzzles over others. Think Outside The Box had me rotate a box crammed with squares and rectangles to free a Rowlet or Slowpoke from within, providing a lot of thoughtful challenge at later levels. And I enjoyed most puzzles where I controlled a Pokémon directly, such as Topsy-Turvy Espeon that uses blocks and gravity in clever ways.</p>
<p>At the same time, I didn’t enjoy guessing the amount of hidden crates behind the visible ones in Blocked Boxes, nor did I find Square Solver and Tricky Triangle appealing when they popped up; both simply require you to connect-the-right-dots to make the required shape and have no relationship with Pokémon other than some background art.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether I enjoyed specific puzzles or not, they were all responsive and smooth on the Switch 2 I played on. That said, Pokémon Friends still seems out of place on Nintendo's handheld hybrids. The entire package has a 'freemium' mobile feel that would be easier to digest if it were, for example, a free-to-download title with $5 puzzle packs instead of a $9.99 base purchase with more expensive DLC.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In the end, even the fun puzzles began to grow stale after only a few hours of play as they're so quick to complete and pop up so often, which dampened my enthusiasm for unlocking Mudkip and Jirachi plushies to decorate my rooms with.</p>
<p>I have no desire to boot up Pokémon Friends daily for a few quick puzzles like how I rip packs in TCG Pocket, leaving me with the sense that this puzzle package will fade into the background with other casual spin-off titles, forgotten about until the next Pokémon Direct that announces a handful more overpriced puzzle packs instead of Generation X.</p></section>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-codename-3nm-rdna-5-magnus-apu/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The codenames for the APUs that will power the PlayStation 6 and the PlayStation handheld have been revealed by prominent leakers, effectively confirming that another leaked APU from AMD will power the next-generation Xbox console.</p>



<p>Following the release of a new video providing some new information on the leaked AMD Zen 6 Magnus APU, Moore's Law Is Dead provided <a href="https://www.youtube.com/post/Ugkx5bPPRXBb7iDre4lkQXKdfzbg0mY6x77d">an update</a> on the APU codenames for next-generation systems that have been circulating online in the past few days, revealing that Orion is the codename for the APU that will power the PlayStation 6 and Canis is the codename of the APU that will power the new PlayStation handheld. While no other known leaker confirmed if Orion is indeed the APU of the next-generation console by Sony, known AMD leaker Kepler L2<a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/grain-of-salt-moores-law-is-dead-ps6-soc-codenamed-orion-ps6-portable-soc-codenamed-canis.1686673/post-270660157"> confirmed</a> that Canis is indeed the APU of the PlayStation handheld, adding that it has a <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/grain-of-salt-moores-law-is-dead-ps6-soc-codenamed-orion-ps6-portable-soc-codenamed-canis.1686673/post-270662745">monolithic design.</a></p>



<p>As there were some doubts regarding the Magnus APU being the PlayStation 6 APU, now that it is known that Orion will be the system's APU, the AMD Zen 6 APU leaked <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-next-xbox-amd-zen-6-magnus-apu-11-cores-384-bit-memory-bus/">earlier this month</a> has been confirmed to be the one that will power the next-generation Xbox. In the video mentioned above, Moore's Law is Dead revealed some additional details on the APU, which will have a 3nm RDNA "AT2" GPU die, can go up to 70 CU, but it is expected to get 68 CU yields, and it will have a 192-bit memory bus, and not a 384-bit bus as previously revealed. Looking at the leaked specs, AMD leaker Kepler L2 <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-zen-6-magnus-leak-amds-massive-apu-for-next-gen-console-medusa-point-specs.1686433/post-270660139">speculates</a> Microsoft may use a split memory model again, as a 192-bit bus is considered too little to feed both CPU and GPU. </p>

<p>With the first information on the PlayStation 6 and the next-generation Xbox leaking online, it will likely not take much longer to learn more about what the two systems will be capable of. With machine learning having made its proper debut in the console space with the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution Upscaler, it will be very interesting to see what these systems will offer besides better specs than their predecessors.</p>

			<p>An ambitious The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind RTX Remix path tracing mod is in the works, and its first version is now available for download.</p>



<p>The Morro RTX mod, whose 0.1 version is now available for download from <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/morro-rtx">Mod DB</a>, aims to update the entire game with new light sources, PBR materials based on the original textures, enhance model geometry, and more. The first version of the mod updates the light sources in the Imperial Prison Ship, Seyda Neen, Balmora and Vivec areas, features over 300 individual model updates and some placement adjustments. While it's clear from the video outlining the project below that there's still a lot of work to be done, it shows great promise and hopefully will provide fans of the series with a new way to enjoy the classic game.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>While there's no indication The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind will ever be remastered or remade entirely, there's still the chance Bethesda could decide to bring back the classic game at some point.  The <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-registered-9-million-players/">amazing success</a> of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered clearly showed that fans are more than willing to re-experience the classic entries in the series with some choice improvements, so hopefully, the third entry in the series will receive the same treatment its successor got at some point, although Morrowind may need a gameplay update more than Oblivion did. You can learn more about how Virtuos updated the fourth entry in the series while leaving gameplay almost intact in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">review</a>.</p>

            <p>The showrunner behind Amazon's live-action God of War TV series has shared some new details about what we can expect from Kratos and co on the show's release.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://collider.com/god-of-war-series-adaptation-prime-video-update-ron-moore/">Collider</a> at San Diego Comic-Con, series showrunner and former Battlestar Galactica executive producer Ronald D. Moore confirmed Amazon's God of War adaptation will remain largely faithful to Sony Santa Monica's 2018 game, though it won't be a frame-by-frame remake.</p>
<p>"This world and this universe are really rich, and it's interesting, and it's really been fun to adapt," Moore explained. "It's an adaptation, so it's an adaptation-slash-interpretation as you go into live-action, and it's been really fun to sort of go, 'Wow, there's a lot here we can play with. Okay, we want to keep the story. We want to keep the characters and the spirit of it'. There's all this stuff that you can keep turning to for inspiration. </p>
<p>"It's really been interesting."</p>

<p>The showrunner also added that game director Cory Barlog is actively involved with the project, with Moore calling Barlog - who also helmed 2022's God of War sequel Ragnarök - a "genius".</p>
<p>"I've had several meetings with Cory, and you ask Cory, 'Well, tell me about the backstory of this or how this works', and he just can talk because he holds it all in his head," Moore said. "And I usually pride myself about, as a showrunner, I can hold the season in my head. I know what the 10 episodes are, and I can tell you about them. Cory can tell you the whole thing in every possible way - all the mythology, how it connects one to the other, what the puzzles were, why they did this, and what that artifact did. It's really impressive.</p>
<p>"I mean, it is like a gigantic novel, even bigger than the Outlander novels, which is a lot to digest."</p>
<p>
In a separate interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjRM2TFvekQ">IGN</a>, Moore hinted that some of Kratos' previous escapades prior to Santa Monica's God of War reboot may also make an appearance. "You'll have to wait and see," Moore teased. </p>
<p>At the present time, those 10 episodes of Moore's God of War adaptation are still in the "scripts" phase. Filming may begin in 2026 at the earliest, Moore said.</p>

<p>Moore hasn't always been involved with the God of War TV show, only <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-lands-new-showrunner-in-former-battlestar-galactica-executive-producer">joining the project towards the end of last year</a> following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-reportedly-starting-from-scratch-as-showrunner-departs">departure of the original team</a>. Despite the shakeup, PlayStation Productions' Asad Qizilbash, Carter Swan, Sony's Hermen Hulst, Vertigo's Roy Lee and of course Barlog remain involved with the project. Santa Monica's Jeff Ketcham is also a co-executive producer on Amazon's God of War adaptation.</p>

We mean that in a figurative sense, of course — it's the game that has dominated most of our time of late — but some arty fans have taken it much more literally.</p>
<p>Take Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/freakintoddles/">freakintoddles</a>, for example, who recently took to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/">r/NintendoSwitch</a> forum to share their latest creation: a Switch 2 dock cover modelled on DK's iconic barrels. It looks bananas in the best possible way and, what's more, its creator has even shared how you can make one yourself... if you have a 3D printer to hand.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4rnumkp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>The cover is designed to clip around your Switch 2 dock, with the barrel design only encasing the front of the stand to let those fancy cooling fans do their job on the back. You can get a closer look at the print in the following snaps from its <a href="https://makerworld.com/en/models/1632494-switch-2-donkey-kong-dock-cover#profileId-1724371">Maker World</a> listing:</p>

<p>In the absence of any Switch 2 special edition models, we'd be lying if we said that the funky DK design didn't look a little bit nice — and is there really any better way to show your Bananza love than a dock cover that <em>might</em> send your Switch 2 blasting through brambles at any moment?</p>
<p>We called DK's latest "an almighty re-introduction to the world of 3D platforming for DK, and arguably the Switch 2's first absolute must-play" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">our review</a>, which you can check out in full below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With the fantastic <em>Star Trek: Strange New Worlds</em> back for season three, the potential for the franchise feels so strong. As opposed to back in January when <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-trek-section-31-cameo-big-name-jamie-lee-curtis-1851747475&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-trek-section-31-cameo-big-name-jamie-lee-curtis-1851747475"><em>Section 31</em> came out</a></span>, and the potential for the franchise felt desperately weak. That’s <em>Star Trek</em>: as good as its last outing. So where will the forthcoming <em>Starfleet Academy</em> series leave us? Hints arrive with the first teaser trailer for the show. But can something this po-faced and “uplifting” offer anything compelling?</p><p>You know what? I’m left with no idea at all. What a strange trailer, telling us absolutely nothing substantive whatsoever. Lots of things to say, “Ooh look, he’s back!” but if someone asked you what it’s <em>about</em>, you’d be pretty stumped.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Set in the 32nd century, a thousand years after the original <em>Star Trek</em>, this is very much a spin-off from the dismal final seasons of <em>Discovery. </em>In that show, once a lovely story about a ship equipped with a unique means of instantly transporting itself anywhere in the galaxy, things got so out of control that it ended up sending itself 900 years into the future and then not knowing what to do when it got there. However, on arrival it <em>did</em> discover that Starfleet still existed, albeit in a much reduced and fragile form, with its Academy still up and running. Thus, <em>Starfleet Academy</em> as a series.</p><figure id="" data-id="d0bf29339b62f5f5c13f98ac4d891d12" data-recommend-id="image://d0bf29339b62f5f5c13f98ac4d891d12" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1084" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Holly Hunter as the captain of the academy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Holly Hunter as the captain of the academy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d0bf29339b62f5f5c13f98ac4d891d12" data-recommend-id="image://d0bf29339b62f5f5c13f98ac4d891d12" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1084" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Holly Hunter as the captain of the academy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So, in the trailer, we see a few familiar faces. There’s the fantastic Tig Notaro reprising engineer Jett Reno—one of the few characters you were always pleased to see in <em>Discovery</em>. Oded Fehr will also guest as Admiral Charles Vance, a character with the personality of a plank of wood in the previous show. And there’s Robert Picardo as the Doctor, the holographic medic from <em>Star Trek: Voyager</em>, now over 900 years old and still teaching nearly a millennium later after he began the role in kids’ cartoon&nbsp;<em>Star Trek: Prodigy</em>.</p><p>Then there are some even more well-known faces from outside of <em>Trek</em>. Holly Hunter is in charge, playing Captain Nahla Ake, who is half-Lanthanite (a long-lived race of aliens who were apparently living on Earth long before first contact with the Vulcans), <em>Bob Hearts Abishola</em> creator Gina Yashere as an as-yet unnamed first officer who is apparently a Klingon/Jem’Hadar hybrid (?), and right at the end, Hollywood A lister Paul Giamatti looking like the series’ cartoon villain. And joining the hybrid gang, he’s Klingon crossed with Tellarite.</p><figure id="" data-id="9d5037c3aa518457ef44e6f7ca285ebf" data-recommend-id="image://9d5037c3aa518457ef44e6f7ca285ebf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1643" data-height="924" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Paul Giamatti as a baddie." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Paul Giamatti as a baddie." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9d5037c3aa518457ef44e6f7ca285ebf" data-recommend-id="image://9d5037c3aa518457ef44e6f7ca285ebf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1643" data-height="924" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Paul Giamatti as a baddie." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Notably absent, however, was Mary Wiseman, who played Sylvia Tilly in <em>Discovery</em>. Her character was endlessly away at the Academy during the final seasons of the show, making it incredibly odd that she’s not a main character here. She is, instead, lined up as a guest star, and didn’t even make the cut for the trailer.</p><p>And the rest look like a sickeningly pretty bunch of starry-eyed hopefuls, all smiling and dancing and I already hate all of them equally. Especially the mopey Klingon Jay-Den Kraag. Gosh, what fun we’ll have learning about how hard it is for him to control his Klingon aggression in Starfleet by having him endlessly fucking mope about it.</p><figure id="" data-id="7bbc7672c2e86471838b40f2fbd5e65b" data-recommend-id="image://7bbc7672c2e86471838b40f2fbd5e65b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1422" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Klingon moping on a windowsill." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Klingon moping on a windowsill." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7bbc7672c2e86471838b40f2fbd5e65b" data-recommend-id="image://7bbc7672c2e86471838b40f2fbd5e65b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1422" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Klingon moping on a windowsill." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Honestly, I don’t have high hopes, but I would sure be glad to be proven a big, stupid wrong-face. Alex Kurtzman’s so-called “expanded <em>Star Trek </em>universe” is so wildly variable, and there’s no pattern to it. Kurtzman is showrunner on <em>Academy</em>, and it was his taking over <em>Discovery</em> in its third season that began that show’s descent into dreadfulness. It’s tempting to therefore credit <em>Strange New Worlds</em>’ showrunner Akiva Goldsman with delivering better <em>Trek</em>, and his name <em>isn’t</em> attached to <em>Academy</em>. But then he was also a showrunner on <em>Picard</em>, a series so abysmal people should probably have gone to prison. So who knows! Holly Hunter is always compelling, so that bodes well. Paul Giamatti as a possible villain is also a fantastic thought! But there are so many factors that could be a problem.</p><p>First and foremost is the setting. <em>Discovery</em>’s 32nd century was a very silly place, with a bizarrely claustrophobic galaxy across which it tried to portray both impossibly futuristic god-like tech <em>and</em> ancient, cobwebby mysteries. Starfleet by this point has technology so advanced as to be inseparable from magic. They now have “programmable matter,” nano-molecules that can be altered into <em>anything</em>, to the idiotic degree that it’s used for things as mundane as having platforms and bridges extend out in front of people as they walk, while spaceships can reconfigure themselves on a molecular level  while in flight. So, er, anything is possible. Every single storyline is going to have to not only be about why transporter technology can’t be used because, um, it’s a bit windy, but also why they can’t just reprogram any old coffee cup to be whatever MacGuffin is needed.</p><p>“We need a recoupling manifold upgrade-integrator or the whole station will blow up?”</p><p>“Why did this have to happen on a No-Reprogrammable Matter Tuesday?”</p><p>But more than anything else, it’s Starfleet itself. It’s just so insufferable. It’s Life Lessons University, where everyone strives to be the lovely-best they can be, and that’s going to be tripled down on by its newfound underdog position in the galaxy. I’m finding it so hard, following that teaser of wide-eyed gleeful positivity, to imagine anything other than the modern equivalent of a <em>He-Man</em> cartoon, where everyone learns an important message by the end of the episode.</p><p>Please let me be wrong. Please let the completely superb lessons of <em>Strange New Worlds</em> have been learned. Those being: episodic stories are where <em>Star Trek</em> shines, not long, meandering arcs, and that it’s possible to have a lot of fun if you’ve got a ground cast with believable relationships. I want a <em>Starfleet Academy</em> that’s capable of sustaining its own equivalent to <em>SNW</em>’s musical episode, or a <em>Lower Decks</em> crossover, or whatever this puppet-based episode set for season four is going to be!</p><p>Or, and again the trailer doesn’t betray anything close to this, a new <em>Deep Space Nine</em> situation, with deep intrigue taking place in a fixed location, allowing huge, spiraling stories set in new sectors to take place. Anything other than watching a bunch of adorable cadets learn to not think for themselves, like <em>Star Trek</em>’s true Borg mind, Starfleet.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/starfleet-academy-trailer-comic-con-strange-new-worlds-1851787096]]></content:encoded>

Over 1 million players have signed up for the latest Skate playtest, and that's a milestone for EA.</p><p>According to EA, the eye-popping represents the biggest playtest sign-up in the history of the company. Although sign-ups are currently closed, EA indicated that everyone who registered for the current playtest will get their invitation by the end of July.</p><p>The original Skate was released in 2007, but the series had been on ice since Skate 3 in 2010. In 2020, EA announced that a Skate reboot was in development. The new title isn't following the same single-player path as the original trilogy. Instead, Skate will be a free-to-play game with live-service elements. Developer Full Circle recently revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/eas-new-skate-game-is-always-online-reconfirmed-for-2025-launch/1100-6531121/" data-ref-id="1100-6531121">Skate will require a constant internet connection</a> because it was developed as a multiplayer sandbox title.</p><p>Last year, I Think You Should Leave's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tim-robinson-basically-did-an-i-think-you-should-leave-sketch-to-reveal-skates-story/1100-6524066/" data-ref-id="1100-6524066">Tim Robinson appeared in a promo for Skate</a> that explained the game's backstory. Robinson played a desperate M-Corp executive who attempted to downplay his company's decision to abandon the city of San Vansterdam. In M-Corps' absence, players can turn the entire city into a giant skate park.</p><p>EA's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/eas-skate-is-getting-a-big-update-ahead-of-next-playtest/1100-6532519/" data-ref-id="1100-6532519">most recent update for Skate</a> gave the game a visual upgrade ahead of the current playtest. Skate will be released later this year on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wuchang-fallen-feathers-dev-outlines-performance-and-balance-improvements-coming-with-future-patches.1254840/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers is getting performance and game balance improvements in the future, the game's developer confirmed in a new message shared today.</p>



<p>Today, developer Lenzee Games provided an&nbsp;overview&nbsp;of the improvements that are coming to the Soulslike released last week, including improved framerates, optimized default settings for some graphics cards, better stability, enhanced texture quality, asset detail, and precision in low-resolution areas. The development studio is also taking a good look at the game's balance, and is aiming to correct the character's raising speed after getting knocked down, reduce damage and number of certain tramps, lower impact resustance of some low level enemies, reduce <em>"exploration pressure"</em> in some areas, improve AI logic for regular enemies and bosses. Unfortunately, no timeframe has been provided as for when these improvements will be implemented, but still, it's good to know the developer is looking to fix some of the game's critical issues.</p>



<p>It's a shame WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers launched with its performance issues on PC and consoles, as I have found the game to be entertaining enough, despite all of its issues. Hopefully, the improvements will give the game's combat system the chance to shine, as I have found it to be the best feature of the game, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wuchang-fallen-feathers-unleash-the-madness/">review.</a></p>



<p>WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>

All you have to do is point your phone at your monitor with <em>Death Stranding</em> open, activate the in-game photo mode, and then get Sam to look at the camera.</p><p>I used this technique on Discord and the face scanning verification (k-ID) asked me to open and close Sam’s mouth, so I obliged using the facial expressions in the photo mode. I did the same thing on Reddit, but this time the face scanning tool (Persona) asked me to move Sam’s face around, so I panned the camera around until it was accepted. Both were completed within seconds, and it was unbelievably easy to bypass these age checks.</p><p>Discord uses the <a href="https://www.k-id.com/">k-ID</a> face verification service, while Reddit uses the <a href="https://withpersona.com/">Persona</a> service. Both services were fooled by the virtual Sam Bridges. I tried to bypass Bluesky’s age verification, which uses the Yoti service, and it failed with the virtual Sam Bridges. Yoti says Instagram <a href="https://www.yoti.com/blog/helping-instagram-create-safer-online-experiences-teen-accounts/">will also use</a> its facial age estimation technology as an option “for people who need to prove they are over 18.”</p><p>This bypass not only lets adults verify as an adult on multiple services, but it also lets you avoid sharing your face or credit card details with yet another third-party company. It also means you don’t have to pay for a VPN service to continuously bypass these age checks, as long as the service you want to access offers a face scanning option that falls victim to the virtual Sam Bridges.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/report/714402/uk-age-verification-bypass-death-stranding-reddit-discord]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Dusty extract-o-shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-forever-winter">The Forever Winter</a> got an update over the weekend that added another mech to the growing list of horrifying war machines that roam its post-apocalyptic world looking for fleshy idiots to squash and eat. "The StiltWalker is a multi-legged destruction machine: equipped with multiple missile and machinegun weapon systems," say the developers in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2828860/view/547867519580373226">an update post on Steam</a>. Pfft. What's so scary about that? Just shoot some rockets at it.</p>
<p>"It is also equipped with a point defense system that can detonate explosive munitions that are fired at it from a distance."</p>
<p>Ah. Well. Nevertheless.</p>

<p>"Its peripheral missile systems are direct-fire," the update continues, "but its core missile systems are ATGM guided munitions that will sail into the sky before raining down on Europa’s foes with deadly homing accuracy." Big talk from someone with skinny little legs. You can see what it looks like in the trailer above. Developers Fun Dog do love recording doomy panning shots of their ashen wastelands peppered with tracer fire and the odd explosion. I suppose when it looks this atmospheric who can blame them?</p>
<p>The update also adds a new region to explore - a rubble-strewn city called "Lost Angels" with its own quests to complete. Although the devs say that this region, like much of the game, is a "work in progress". Alongside all this there are a bunch of performance improvements and other tweaks, like a change to the weight and speed of player characters, and some alterations to weapon reload rates. You can also now spam a button to get up more quickly after being knocked down. Stuff like that.</p>
<p>It's been interesting to track this third-person shooter as it's scavenged its way through the early access wastes. It was in a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-forever-winter-struggles-into-early-access-with-poor-performance-and-a-deadly-thirst-for-your-time">shonky state</a> when it first broke cover, with hostile troops spawning right on top of players and enemy tanks flipping out and flying across the sky. The game's water resource system was divisive too. It was designed so that precious water drained away even while you weren't playing, which could once theoretically result in losing all your gear. </p>
<p>But it looks more and more like many of the early pains have been somewhat soothed. The water system was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-forever-winters-water-will-no-longer-drain-away-while-youre-offline">completely overhauled</a>, for one thing, and recent monthly updates have seen <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2828860/view/547864982714319391">changes to the way stealth works</a> and a way to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2828860/view/547862446583317590">hack radar mechs</a> to reveal a better picture of the enigmatic and eternal three-way war that rages around you. As for other buggy war machines, they continue to get fine-tuned in this month's patch: "Tanks now move much more reliably," it says. No more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/U-ktTg7ACeI">trips to the moon</a>, lieutenant. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-spidery-new-mech-crawls-onto-the-eternal-battlefield-of-the-forever-winter]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Earlier today, July 28, Wuchang: Fallen Feathers developer Leenzee issued an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2277560/WUCHANG_Fallen_Feathers/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>updated statement via Steam</u></a>, to further apologize for the game's launch issues and promise a "comprehensive explanation" of what went wrong is on the way. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the meantime, Leenzee said it was "closely monitoring all community channels" and "every voice — from criticism to suggestions — has been received, carefully listened to, and actively discussed to find solutions."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following up on issues with pre-order rewards — as well as the compensation Leenzee has initially offered — Steam Deluxe Edition owners will now get three extra sets of deluxe costumes and four new weapons. Standard and Deluxe edition owners will get three additional headgear items. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for performance and optimization issues?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We will continue to optimize performance issues and will keep adjusting the game based on your suggestions — such as difficulty levels and boss encounters — in upcoming patches," Leenzee added, listing the following "optimization efforts":
</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fix crashes across different devices</li><li>Improve frame rates and reduce lag on certain graphics cards</li><li>Optimize default settings for some graphics cards</li><li>Correct the speed of getting up after being knocked down</li><li>Reduce damage and the number of some traps</li><li>Lower impact resistance of certain low-level monsters</li><li>Reduce exploration pressure in some areas</li><li>Fix issues caused by missing items leading to quest interruptions</li><li>Improve AI logic for monsters and bosses</li><li>Enhance texture quality in low-resolution areas</li><li>Improve asset detail and precision in some regions
</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">"We deeply value every player’s support and encouragement. We are actively reflecting on our workflows and striving to improve our capabilities to deliver higher-quality services more efficiently," Leenzee concluded. "We ask for your patience as we tackle these optimizations step by step. We hope that one day, both our work and our team will prove worthy of your expectations."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time of writing, the game's Steam user rating remains "Mostly Negative."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>ORIGINAL STORY</strong>: Last week, we reported that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/wuchang-fallen-feathers"><u>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</u></a> has opened to 114,000+ concurrent players on Steam, making it one of the biggest launches on Steam for a non-FromSoftware Soulslike game yet. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This milestone comes in spite of<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wuchang-fallen-feathers-clocks-up-114000-concurrent-player-peak-on-launch-day-but-reports-of-poor-performance-dominate-player-reviews"><u> 'mostly negative' on Steam</u></a> as players report issues with "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198992555658/recommended/2277560/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>extremely awful performance</u></a>," a "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/wakeupneo/recommended/2277560/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>completely lifeless</u></a>" main character, and "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2277560/reviews/?browsefilter=toprated&amp;snr=1_5_100010_#scrollTop=5435.5" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>clunky</u></a>" combat and gameplay.

"We are looking to issue a patch as soon as we can."

We are currently working with Steam to restore the correct pricing," the team said, and then addressed a pre-order reward error.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The root cause is a bug in the reward distribution for the Standard and Deluxe editions, which prevented players from receiving the correct items. We are fixing this issue in the upcoming patch," Leenzee said. "As a token of our appreciation, we will give all players who purchase the game on Steam a free digital copy of the original soundtrack. We will look to process refunds of all those who have already purchased the soundtrack via Steam."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Any players who bought the deluxe edition in the future will also receive "a brand-new exclusive costume," although be patient — "understand that this may take some time."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We are fully committed to investigating and resolving these issues as quickly as possible. Our team is prioritizing these problems at the highest level, striving to fix and handle everything promptly to ensure you have the best possible gaming experience," the statement concluded. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers is a Soulslike action-RPG set in the land of Shu during the dark and tumultuous late Ming Dynasty. You play as a mysterious warrior afflicted by a horrific feather disease, who uncovers hidden secrets and battles supernatural enemies in an ancient empire teetering on the edge of collapse.
