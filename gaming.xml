            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Activision has unveiled a poster for this year’s iteration of The Haunting, the annual Halloween-themed event that hits the Call of Duty platform every October. This time around, players will come face-to-face with Predator.</p>



<p>The first news regarding this year’s The Haunting event was featured in a blog post published yesterday on the Call of Duty site. It was mentioned that The Haunting lands with the final season of Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty: Warzone, and that <strong>all</strong> studio partners have weighed in on the event in some capacity.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-happening-with-the-haunting-this-year">What’s Happening with The Haunting This Year?</h2>



<p>The recent <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-patch-notes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty blog post</a> didn’t do much to clear up what’s coming in The Haunting 2025:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Haunting will return with Season 06 of Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty: Warzone, and we (including all our studio partners) have some Halloween fun just around the corner.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>All we know is that The Haunting starts this week, on October 9th. It arrives as the Black Ops 7 beta comes to an end, marking the closure of a divisive, debate-laden trial period that has produced mixed feelings about this year’s Call of Duty title.</p>



<p>Here’s the post (and poster) that was uploaded to social media by Activision:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Shortly after announcing The Haunting 2025 with the poster, the Call of Duty team responded ‘ok’ <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1975327267858293053" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to a post</a> from September 2023 requesting that Activision add a Predator skin to the game. It was a strange throwback, but perhaps it reveals how long the team has been considering this idea.</p>



<p>Last year’s The Haunting event ran between September and October and introduced Mike Myers, a character tied to the Call of Duty series, in a rather nostalgic way (IYKYK). Activision’s studios prepared spooky map variants, new modes including Zombie Royale and Hordepoint, and a fresh reward path for those participating in the event.</p>



<p>It’s safe to assume that The Haunting 2025 will be a similar affair.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The announcement for PowerWash Simulator 2’s release date was slated to drop this week, but in an early trailer upload, the beans have been spilled. It has been three years since the first PowerWash Simulator game dropped, entertaining gamers everywhere and allowing them to clean everything from skateparks to carnival rides, and from trains to planes, with high-powered power washers.</p>



<p>The trailer has since been removed from YouTube, but not before eagle-eyed gamers were able to capture the release date for PowerWash Simulator 2.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-powerwash-simulator-2-coming-out">When is PowerWash Simulator 2 Coming Out?</h2>



<p>In the leaked trailer (which no longer exists), <strong>it was revealed that PowerWash Simulator 2 is coming out on October 26</strong>.</p>



<p>Early impressions of PowerWash Simulator 2 have been positive, even if it’s understandably tough to improve upon such a simple concept. In PowerWash Simulator 2, you’re still cleaning things with power washers and utilizing an array of attachments and cleaning liquids, but previews have remarked on how ‘different’ it manages to feel.</p>



<p>The news regarding the leaked trailer was published on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1nzlvtg/powerwash_simulator_2_release_date_trailer_leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gaming Leaks and Rumours subreddit</a>, with one user sharing the link to the now removed release date trailer for PowerWash Simulator 2. Using an archive platform simply reveals that the video now sits in a private state, ready to go live soon.</p>



<p>In the comments under the original post on Reddit, fans of the original PowerWash Simulator game were raving about how good it was. There are recollections of users pouring over 100 hours into the game, spraying endlessly, and cleaning dirt from surfaces in a game that’s pure relaxation and satisfaction.</p>



<p>Many have dubbed it an incoming Game of the Year contender, but that’s tongue-in-cheek at best.</p>

                <p>FromSoft's massively popular--and just plain massive in general--received a co-op spinoff called Elden Ring: Nightreign earlier this year. The game sees groups of 1-3 players teaming up to take on the titanic threats in the new realm of Limgrave. It's been a hit with fans and critics alike, but it's also a big departure from the gameplay of the original Elden Ring. If you've been on the fence, now is a great time to give it a chance, as the Amazon-exclusive <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DVMVRN9Z?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Elden Ring: Nightreign Deluxe Edition</a> is discounted to $45 for Big Deals Days. This retailer-exclusive edition offers access to post-launch DLC, a mini digital soundtrack, and a digital art book. It also comes with an exclusive poster of Nightreign's key art in the box. The deal applies to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DVMVRN9Z?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DVMPV5JF?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Series X</a> of the game--but it's only available during Prime Big Deal Days on October 7 and 8.</p><div title="6535065 -- Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo Blu-rays" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4483" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6535065 -- Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo Blu-rays" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DVMVRN9Z?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DVMVRN9Z?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DVMVRN9Z?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DVMVRN9Z?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DVMVRN9Z?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DVMVRN9Z?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">$45 (was $55)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>While the combat mechanics in Nightreign are identical to Elden Ring, the overall structure is where you'll see some big differences. Players team up, choose a boss they want to fight, and then set off on an expedition that takes around 35- to 45-minutes to complete. This journey is split across three in-game days, as during the day your team will explore the land of Limveld--an alternate version of Elden Ring's Limgrave--and level up for the fight ahead of them.</p><p>Before your squad gets to the main boss, they'll have to take on smaller bosses as the map closes in on them, and on the third day, the grand showdown begins. This core gameplay loop has gone over well with fans, and it has been further polished with post-launch support since then.</p><p>"Elden Ring's DNA is ever-present, but Nightreign is also a game of striking subversions: a From Software game that asks you to play it unconventionally, disregarding meticulous exploration, isolation, and measured combat for a cooperative multiplayer game built on speed and aggression. In many ways, it's the antithesis of what people typically come to From Software games for, and yet somehow, someway, this experimental non-sequel is an absolute triumph," Richard Wakeling wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-nightreign-review/1900-6418368/">Elden Ring: Nightrein review</a>.</p></div>                      </div><p>If you haven't played it yet, the original Elden Ring game is also on sale. Amazon is offering the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SPYK271?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS4 physical edition</a> for $30 (was $40), while the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09743F8P6?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5 and Xbox Series X versions</a> have been discounted to $40 (were $50). If you're planning to play on PS5, the PS4 deal is the best one here because Bandai Namco released a free upgrade for it a few years ago. This added an optional performance mode on PS5 that targets 60fps, increased graphical quality, ray tracing, and several other tweaks to Elden Ring's visuals. Elden Ring is considered to be one of From Software's greatest games, and is well worth picking up while it's discounted.</p><h2>Elden Ring Deals</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4576173-eldenringroadtoerdtree.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4576173" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4576173-eldenringroadtoerdtree.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4576173"></a><figcaption>Elden Ring: The Road to the Erdtree</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4576173-eldenringroadtoerdtree.jpg"></figure><p>For a different spin on Elden Ring, check out the official Elden Ring: The Road to the Erdtree manga.

It's also part of Bandai Namco's infamous "UGSF" crossover universe that includes Galaga, Galaxian, Dig-Dug, Mr. Driller, and even Ace Combat 3 as canon entries--which means fans of classic Bandai Namco series can expect plenty of easter eggs and in-universe references to all those games and more. </p><p>Looking for more metroidvanias? You'll find a digital code for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hollow-Knight-Silksong-Standard-Nintendo/dp/B0FPJHY6T3?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> on sale at Amazon as well. The highly anticipated game has lived up to the hype--though many find it to be remarkably difficult, thanks to punishing bosses and tricky environmental hazards.</p><p>For additional Pac-Man gear, check out the vibrant <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arcade1Up-PAC-MAN-5-foot-tall-full-size-stand-up-linux/dp/B0BYQNPTCF?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arcade1Up Pac-Man Deluxe Arcade Machine</a>. Along with several classic Pac-Man games, it lets you play titles like Dig Dug, Galaga, Mappy, and other retro hits.

It's much cheaper and fits in the palm of your hand, yet still comes with a color screen, classic music, and a tiny control panel.</p><p>For more Prime Big Deal Days discounts on video games, anime, and beyond, be sure to check <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">GameSpot's deals hub</a>.</p><hr><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-powera-cheap-wireless-controller-super-mario-amazon-deals/1100-6535215/">Get Super Mario And Kirby Switch 2 Wireless Controllers For Up To 50% Off</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-audible-premium-plus-sign-up-prime-big-deal-days-black-friday-holiday-2025-deal/1100-6524536/">Audible Premium Plus Holiday Deal: Get 3 Audiobooks For $3</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-prime-big-deal-days-4k-blu-ray-best-deals/1100-6535093/">Prime Big Deal Days Movie Sale: Check Out Amazon's B2G1 Free 4K Blu-Ray Catalog</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-preorder-guide/1100-6535007/">ROG Xbox Ally X Preorders In Stock At Best Buy, Sold Out Everywhere Else (September 27)</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-trading-cards-restock-where-to-buy-amazon-walmart-best-buy-target/2900-6271/">New Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy Chocobo Bundle &amp; Scene Boxes Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-game-boy-restocked-at-amazon-and-its-shipping-early/1100-6533358/">You Can Get The $60 Lego Game Boy Early From Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/history-of-middle-earth-5440-page-box-set-drops-to-all-time-best-price-for-big-deal-days/1100-6526926/">Complete History Of Middle-Earth Collector's Box Set Restocked With $170 Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-shining-movie-4k-blu-ray-special-edition-steelbook-the-film-vault/1100-6534223/">The Shining's New Numbered Limited Edition Is Up For Grabs At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>

Many of these are <strong>available for their lowest price ever</strong>, with price cuts of over $100 for select models. This includes premium models capable of playing most modern games without a hiccup and budget-friendly options for those seeking to upgrade an entry-level PC during Amazon's sale, which lasts through October 8.</p><p>One of the biggest discounts is for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DS6WTXGP?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus TUF GeForce RTX 5070 Ti (16GB GDDR7 OC Edition)</a>, as it's matching its best price ever of $850 (was $1,000). The RTX 5070 Ti is among the most powerful consumer GPUs available right now, and this OC Edition with 16GB GDDR7 should be more than capable of handling most games when played at high resolutions. If you don't need all the firepower provided by the RTX 5070 Ti, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FFKWFMYM?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus Prime GeForce RTX 5070 (12GB GDDR7 White OC Edition)</a> is now listed for just $580 (was $710). This card hasn't seen any notable discounts this year, so be sure to check it out during Prime Big Deal Days.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4580707-81lkyg-43rl._ac_sl1500%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4580707" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4580707-81lkyg-43rl._ac_sl1500%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4580707"></a><figcaption>Asus TUF GeForce RTX GPU</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4580707-81lkyg-43rl._ac_sl1500%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>Want to keep your spending under $500?

That Gigabyte Aero model is also listed for its lowest price ever, and it's probably a great fit for most shoppers.

Essentially, this technology allows the CPU to retrieve data faster than expected, as it boasts an impressive 96 MB L3 cache (which is extremely noticeable while gaming). It's built on the 5nm Zen 4 architecture, and it's powerful enough for both gaming and work applications like photo editing or intense coding.</span></p><p>The 8-Core, 16-Thread processor is great at multitasking, so you shouldn't have any issues if you decide to stream a TV show or launch into Chrome while waiting for the next round of Counter-Strike. The 7800X3D is widely regarded as one of the best gaming processors on the market, and it's a hard bargain now that it's under $350.</p></div>                      </div><p>While we're big fans of the AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D, it's not the only CPU discounted for Prime Big Deal Days. Both AMD and Intel components are on sale--so be sure to shop around to find the best fit for your gaming setup. However, most will likely find the 7800X3D to be the best fit. If you don't mind stretching your budget, you can pick up the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DFKC99VL?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Intel Core Ultra 9 Unlocked (24-Core, 24 Thread)</a> for $499 (was $599). Keep in mind that it's not designed for gaming, but folks running intensive video editing applications will find it to be a nice choice.</p><p>While the AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D Processor is quite budget-friendly with this new discount, there are plenty of cheaper options. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09VCJ171S?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">AMD Ryzen 5 5500 (6-Core, 12-Thread)</a> is down to $61 (was $159), the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BBJ59WJ4?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">AMD Ryzen 9 7900X (12-Core, 24-Thread)</a> is $285 (was $549), and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/" data-target="true">Intel Core i7-12700K (12-Core, 20 Thread)</a> is $185 (was $510). All three are reasonable choices for gaming, making them worthy alternatives if you're looking to save a few bucks.

<p>The rumours about <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/red_dead_redemption_2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> getting ported to Nintendo's Switch successor have been doing the rounds on the internet for some time now.</p>
<p>In an update on this, podcaster and YouTuber 'NateTheHate' has responded to a recent comment <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1974887737678553101">on social media</a>, claiming the Switch 2 version does indeed "exist" (<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/they-exist-red-dead-redemption-2s-ps5-xbox-series-and-switch-2-versions-are-still-happening-its-claimed/">thanks for the heads up, VGC</a>). As for the timing of the release, he's got no news to share at this stage.</p>
<figure data-uuid="b546e6866da9a"><a title="Red Dead Redemption 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b546e6866da9a/red-dead-redemption-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / via X</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This follows <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/rumour-red-dead-redemption-2-may-be-heading-to-switch-2-pretty-soon">a rumour in May</a>, which reported "sources close to Rockstar Games" had indicated that the second entry starring Arthur Morgan and the Van der Linde Gang would be released on the Switch 2 within the current fiscal year - so, <em>before</em> the end of March 2026.</p>
<p>Rockstar is already gearing up for a huge 2026 after it announced the delay of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/grand-theft-auto-6-has-been-delayed-and-will-now-launch-in-may-2026">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> earlier this year. This anticipated release will now launch for Xbox and PlayStation platforms next year on 26th May.</p>
<p>The first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/red_dead_redemption">Red Dead Redemption</a> game was ported to the Switch in 2023. You can check out our review here on Nintendo Life for more information.</p>

<p>Pre-orders are now available</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>If you're still on the hunt for certain Switch 2 accessories and are looking for alternatives to Nintendo's products, there are plenty of third-party offerings already popping up. Accessory maker Turtle Beach recently released a headset, and it has now announced multiple other products.</p>
<p>This includes a new range of wired and wireless controllers, cases, and screen protectors. There's the Rematch, Afterglow Wave and Afterglow controllers, as well as a PlayTrek 2-in-1 Case and cases for the standalone system.</p>
<p>Controllers start at $29.99 / £24.99 wired, and will set you back $64.99 / £54.99 for a wireless one. Apart from different models (including features like Hall-Effect thumbsticks, RGB, and a GameChat button), there are also different designs available. The two-in-one PlayTrek carry case costs $49.99 / £39.99 and travel cases are priced between $19.99 / £14.99 - $29.99 / £19.99.</p>


<p>All of these are officially licensed products and pre-orders for these products are NOW <a href="https://www.turtlebeach.com/collections/nintendo-switch-2">live on the Turtle Beach website</a>. We also reviewed the company's Switch 2 headset not long ago, and thought it was a great budget accessory. Here's a quick summary, in case you missed it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Judged purely on its sound quality and features, this is a very solid headset that gets done what's needed. Throw in the better-than-expected design, and that budget-price point and, for folks looking a bargain buy, the Airlite Fit for Switch 2 creep up into highly recommended territory."</p></blockquote><blockquote>

<p>The fan favourite <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/paper_mario_the_thousand-year_door">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> made its grand return last May, and in an update to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a> app today, the game's soundtrack has <em>finally</em> been added.</p>
<p>This includes not only the <a href="https://share.music.nintendo.com/en-US/US/officialPlaylists/d87d523c-cb7c-4412-aafd-fa668b65defd">Switch version</a> of the soundtrack but also the original <a href="https://share.music.nintendo.com/en-US/US/officialPlaylists/1b466e17-95ee-4c62-9b97-14b4d7152cd8">GameCube album</a>. The Switch album is apparently loaded with a whopping 275 tracks, and there are 111 songs for the classic GameCube release.</p>
<p>Before you begin your jam session, just so you know - Nintendo won't be releasing any new tracks on the service next week. It didn't provide a specific reason for this, but there's a national holiday in Japan next week. It skipped weekly updates previously, which have also lined up with public holidays.</p>

<p>If you didn't play Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door back in the day, or haven't tried out the Switch version just yet, be sure to check out our review here on Nintendo Life. We said it was still the king of Mario's RPG outings. Here's our summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"For 20 years, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door has been held as the best Mario RPG of all time, and the Switch remake proves it has earned that title. This is a fantastic RPG adventure, whether you’re a Mario fan or not, with some best-in-class combat, brilliant writing, and a few little creases ironed out to make this the definitive way to play Thousand-Year Door."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is getting the cross-generational treatment, releasing on both the Nintendo Switch 1 and the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>Sure, most people are going to focus on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-pokemon-legends-z-a-starters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game’s starters</a> or the new mega evolutions, but, as with many other Switch games, the performance is going to matter.</p>



<p>Here is a breakdown of the Switch 1 and Switch 2 performance differences in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, and which version you should consider buying.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-different-in-pokemon-legends-z-a-switch-1-and-switch-2">What’s Different in Pokémon Legends: Z-A Switch 1 and Switch 2?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The Switch 2 gives a smoother experience. Image by Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The difference in the Pokémon Legends: Z-A Switch 1 and Switch 2 versions is purely based on performance. The Switch 2 version has a better framerate and resolution. Outside of that, both versions have the same content.</strong></p>



<p>On the original Switch, games like Pokémon Legends: Arceus and Pokémon Scarlet and Violet were criticized a lot for the performance issues both had. Luckily, the Switch 2 is more powerful, and that power allows Game Freak to get more out of their game with the new hardware.</p>







<p><strong>The version of Pokémon Legends: Z-A you should buy comes down to your situation</strong>.</p>



<p>Obviously, if you only own a Switch 1 and have not upgraded to a Switch 2, you should buy the Switch 1 version. However, it’s not a full guarantee that you should go with the upgraded version if you have the newer console.</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is backwards compatible with many Switch 1 games, and this includes Pokémon Legends: Z-A. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-much-does-pokemon-legends-z-a-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The cost of the game</a> is $10 more expensive on the Switch 2 for that bump in performance. If you need to save money, you are fully capable of buying the Switch 1 version and then <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition-upgrade-pack-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">upgrading later in the Nintendo eShop</a>.</p>



<p>While the Switch 2 version does have the performance enhancements over the Switch 1, some people might not tell a drastic difference between the two. We are sure the difference is notable when shown side by side, but that isn’t as applicable when you only see one version.</p>



<p>To sum it up, if you are a Switch 2 owner, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-switch-2-exclusive-platform-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 version</a> will give you the best performance. However, if you are in a spot where you need to save a little money, buying the Switch 1 version will still give you the full Pokémon Legends: Z-A game, with maybe a negligible performance difference when played on a Switch 2.</p>

Before a single line of dialogue hits viewers' ears, that song sets a tone, teases an emotional arc, and lets fans know whether a show is gonna punch them in the gut or kick their heart in its ass. Basically, a good OP is a part of an anime’s holy trinity: art style, voice cast, and theme song. When it slaps, you don’t skip it; you sing along with it week in and week out.&nbsp;</p><p>So when <a href="https://gizmodo.com/gachiakuta-doesnt-just-redefine-shonen-anime-it-anoints-itself-as-the-next-big-thing-2000622249" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Gachiakuta</em></a>, the trashpunk shonen anime from Bones Film (of <em>My Hero Academia</em> fame), needed a new theme to match its explosive second cour, it wasn’t just about finding any fairweather musician to do the job. It needed someone who <em>gets it</em>. Someone who’s lived and breathed anime and knows what makes it work. Enter <a href="https://rollingstonejapan.com/articles/detail/38289/4/1/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mori Calliope</a>.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Gachiakuta | MAIN TRAILER" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yeRvDchyo44?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Mori Calliope isn’t just a megapopular VTuber with<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL_qhgtOy0dy1Agp8vkySQg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> 2 million subscribers</a> and a discography that goes hard—she’s also a diehard <em>Gachiakuta</em> manga fan who’s lowkey been fiending for this kind of opportunity. She’s a part of the crowd who liked it before its anime adaptation made it mainstream. Her upcoming <em>Gachiakuta </em>theme song, “Let’s Just Crash,” aims to be a sonic embodiment of <em>Gachiakuta</em>’s volatile rage and righteous fury, mirroring Rudo’s descent into The Pit and his fight to reclaim justice.</p><p>In our chat, Mori Calliope broke down how “Let’s Just Crash” channels Rudo’s ongoing journey as the anime’s hero, how VTubbing let her cross the line from fan to creator, and how she hopes this collab will be the first of many to come as anime and VTubbing jointly become core tenets of pop culture.&nbsp;</p><h2>A VTuber manga reader fan’s dream come true</h2><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">！？！？！？so happy！！！！</p>— 裏那圭◾️KEI URANA (@KEI_URANA) <a href="https://twitter.com/KEI_URANA/status/1941380304159244710?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 5, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p><strong>Isaiah Colbert:</strong> How did you first get involved with singing <em>Gachiakuta</em>’s second cour theme—was it something you were approached to do, or was it something you wished to pursue as a fan of either Studio Bones' anime adaptation or Kei Urana’s ongoing manga?</p><figure></figure><p><strong>Mori Calliope:</strong> Honestly, it was a combination of both. I’ve been a fan of <em>Gachiakuta </em>since 2022. It was always in my heart—<a href="https://x.com/moricalliope/status/1880242188539527568" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being such a big fan of the manga</a>—that I thought to myself, “I’d really love to sing the opening for this manga whenever it becomes an anime.” I didn’t know if I could do it, though, or if I was the right choice or experienced enough, but sure enough, the offer came to me from my label. My producer wanted to meet with me to give me the good news, and that’s how I knew it was really good news.&nbsp;</p><p>It didn’t feel real at first when I got the offer, but as I started making the song, it became a lot more real very quickly. It’s been a crazy emotional time, but I’m really happy to have been given the opportunity as a huge fan of the manga. I’d even say it’s <a href="https://x.com/moricalliope/status/1796936112876974332" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my favorite manga ever</a>, so I’m just really happy to be here.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="BEHIND GACHIAKUTA | Creators Interview &amp; Behind-the-scenes" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mQQF81ubINM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>IC:</strong> What about <em>Gachiakuta </em>drew you to liking it enough to want to make a theme song for it? Was there something about its world, tone, art style, or characters that immediately clicked with you and your musical style?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>Honestly, I feel like the first thing that drew me into wanting to read more of the manga was definitely Urana's art style, because there's just this amazing combination of Western and Eastern sensibilities within the art. I'm a really big fan of Western cartoons. I know that Urana is also a fan of Western cartoons, and even back in the day when I used to draw, I'd combine those art styles together and always think, “I wish I could be better at this.” Seeing Urana’s art, I felt this is the exact style that I’ve longed to see in any piece of media and I just love it so much.&nbsp;</p><p>I also love the way Urana writes characters as well and their relationships with each other. Everybody’s got their own story going on, but they all intersect in a really beautiful way. And this overarching theme of becoming more and more human together in a dark and desolate world… I just love it so much. I think Urana’s a fantastic storyteller.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Gachiakuta Opening | &quot;HUGs&quot; by Paledusk" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9f89PWhv8YE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>IC:</strong> <em>Gachiakuta</em>’s first cour opening, “Hugs” by metalcore band Paledusk, as well as its original soundtrack, saw the anime lean heavily into rap and heavy metal genres—things you’ve also embraced over the years with your own original songs. Having listened to your theme song, “Let’s Just Crash,” I wanted to ask if there was a particular character, arc, or emotional beat in the lead-up to <em>Gachiakuta</em>’s second cour that served as the emotional anchor for the song’s lyrics, tone, and title?</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>I was informed that this cour—without giving too much away—you can already tell from the PV that there’s a lot of battles going on. Because I was informed about that, I knew I had to make something that was very dynamic and impactful as much as possible. So I tried to lean a little bit more into the anisong feeling—rock rap with a little bit of metal in there as well. Just a touch of it, it’s more rock than anything, I think.</p><p>But in particular, I really wanted to channel Rudo’s rage. It’s one of the main things that got me into the comic and kept me reading—wanting to learn more about his story and seeing the results of his anger come to a head over time through his character development. At the beginning of the song, you may hear an iconic line from Rudo, except I’m the one screaming it. I hope fans will look forward to that for sure, because I wanted to write most of it from Rudo's perspective. But the song also includes a lot of hopefulness, as well as what I feel he has gotten from befriending the Cleaners. I hope that it will be a fitting second cour opening.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Kei Urana/Hideyoshi Andou/Kodansha</span></figcaption></figure><div><p><strong>IC: </strong>Was there any particular moment in production, whether it's a lyric or a riff, where you geeked out over singing?</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>A lot of lyrics within the song draw from specific moments within the manga, and now the anime as well. I didn’t write all of them. I only wrote the English lyrics, but especially in the intro, I want fans to listen to that. There are some parts that I rap in the first verse that I think are very indicative of what Rudo’s inner monologue might be, so I want people to focus on those parts, as well as the screams that I do in the chorus that have this big ensemble feeling for this ensemble show.&nbsp;</p></div><p><strong>IC: </strong>Did you read ahead in the manga or preview episodes from the second cour to get in the headspace of writing the lyrics for the song, or were you only given a concept of where the story was going to go emotionally to have to match that sonically?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>By the time I got the offer, I was already caught up with <em>Gachiakuta</em>. Up until the actual production of the song, I just kept rereading it (maybe out of excitement as well). I was really hype about that. But of course, we also got requests from the production side as well. We had a formal meeting where I got to meet everybody working on the anime and hear their requests for what they wanted the song to sound like, including Urana’s request. I combined those with my own ideas and sensibilities about what I wanted the song to sound like.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="[MV] Wanted, Wasted - Mori Calliope x Takuya Yamanaka (THE ORAL CIGARETTES)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XEHbF1PsLI4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>IC:</strong> What was Urana’s specific request for what this cour theme would sound like?</p><p><strong>MC:</strong> She specifically wanted something intense.&nbsp; Of course, rock is a huge part of the world of <em>Gachiakuta</em>, but she also wanted me to do a lot of shouts and yells as well.<strong> </strong>Interestingly enough, there was a song that I wrote a couple of years ago that I very openly said was inspired&nbsp; by <em>Gachiakuta</em>. She referenced that song of mine. It’s called “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXwCOIwQZ18" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wanted Wasted</a>.” I wrote the lyrics in English for that song and created that song with <em>Gachiakuta </em>in mind. So she brought up that song and said she’d like it to sound like that as well my song “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbNF8FqzIMs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cult Following</a>” from my <a href="https://lnk.to/mc_PHANTOMIME" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Phantomine </a>album.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>IC:</strong> As a VTuber whose persona and aesthetic are deeply rooted in anime, what does it mean to you to have your voice officially tied to a series like <em>Gachiakuta </em>that’s being heralded as the next big shonen series?</p><p><strong>MC:</strong> It’s honestly a complete and total dream come true for me. Even now, it doesn’t totally feel real. I’m honored that Urana is a fan of mine, as I am also a huge fan of hers. That’s kind of how our friendship was born—from just being fans of each other. I feel happy and also lucky. The stars really aligned on this one. That’s why the production of the song was very difficult for me, because I wanted to make the song as good as possible because it means so much to me.&nbsp;</p><p>I think from here on out, even if I do receive offers for other songs, this was really my true end goal: to make an opening or a song for something that I love so much. So I’m just extremely happy about it.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="ja" dir="ltr">wwww ナイス帽子ぺこ！！！</p>— Mori Calliope💀holoEN (@moricalliope) <a href="https://twitter.com/moricalliope/status/1949491897040601191?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 27, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p><strong>IC:</strong> You recently had a solo concert that you performed earlier this year. Is there ever a feedback loop between being a VTuber and a musician?</p><p><strong>MC:</strong> In this industry, there are people who focus on one, the other, or both. There are certainly folks that want music to be their main image, but I think it’s a difficult path to walk because you need to focus mostly on originals and maybe some covers, and streaming should be supplemental to your musical activities. Then there are folks that want to focus mostly on streaming, being a personality. They might make some character songs, but that’s about it.&nbsp;</p><p>From where I’m standing, I have always been a musician. I was a musician before beginning this career, and I’ve always wanted it to be central to my image. But I love streaming so much that I feel like streaming has also become very essential to who I am. So I’m a bit of a hybrid, I guess.</p><p>My hope is that from here on out, as a virtual artist, more virtual artists might be able to get these kinds of opportunities, because a lot of us are taking music very seriously and are working very hard to create music as our main activities. I’m looking forward to seeing what else could come from this opportunity that I’ve gotten here for the world of VTubers, virtual artists, virtual singers, etc.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Crunchyroll/Bones Film</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>IC: </strong>&nbsp;Beforehand, anime was a niche thing no one really talked about, but it’s become a big thing everyone’s talking about. Likewise, VTubing evolved from being a subgenre of live streaming to becoming more commonplace. Do you see this kind of crossover, where VTubers contribute to an anime’s sonic identity, as part of a larger shift in how mainstream streaming culture and traditional pop culture media are blending together?</p><p><strong>MC:</strong> I feel like, as you said, [VTubing has] always been very separate. But now, because anime is becoming more mainstream, you see it happening especially from big shonen getting even bigger overseas—for example, all the people that love <em>Gachiakuta </em>as well would be a testament to that. Because VTubing is intrinsically tied to anime, I feel it’s a natural result of anime becoming more mainstream overseas and globally. Because of that, I feel that VTubing is also moving in that direction, and [especially] streaming on platforms like Twitch or YouTube, [which] are integrating our existence more into the mainstream.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m very much focused on the anime sphere of things. Anime and games are where I’m based and where I like to be. But I think that from here on out, more YouTubers that have an interest in hitting the mainstream will probably be able to branch out there for sure. We’ll see more of that happening in the years to come.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Gachiakuta | Official Cour 2 Trailer | Crunchyroll" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wId1ejSTvcA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>You can hear a snippet of Mori Calliope's "Let's Just Crash" here.</figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>IC:</strong> What do you hope fans feel in their souls whenever they hear your theme song for <em>Gachiakuta</em>, both as a VTuber artist, musician, and anime fan?</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>I want people to remember this song in a similar way that I remember anime openings from my childhood. There are gonna be people out there who are kids that will—hopefully—remember this song as they grow older in the same way that I have with my past favorite OPs. If they could feel, as the song says in Japanese, “hope in the gutter,” then I would be extremely happy if this song could give people an outlet for their tumultuous feelings inside but still finding hope within the dirtiness and darkness of the world. That would make me extremely happy.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Gachiakuta </em>fans can look forward to hearing Mori Calliope’s opening theme, “Let’s Just Crash,” in the anime’s second cour, which debuts on October 12 on Crunchyroll.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/one-battle-after-another-review-aftercha"><h3>One Battle After Another Is An Instant Classic That Plays Fast And Loose With Its Politics&nbsp;</h3></a><p>One Battle After Another is an instant popcorn classic that explores the murky, ugly side of revolution and the sexual hangups of fascism.</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/gachiakuta-mori-calliope-vtuber-opening-anime-crunchyroll]]></content:encoded>

<figure data-uuid="30d0aa4f33500"><a title="Mina The Hollower" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/30d0aa4f33500/mina-the-hollower.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Yacht Club Games</em></figcaption></figure><p>Yacht Club Games' new title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mina-the-hollower">Mina the Hollower</a> was on track for a 31st October 2025 release, but it seems the plans have now changed.</p>
<p>In an official statement on the company's website, the "delay extravanganza" continues – with the team behind this new retro <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/legend_of_zelda_links_awakening_dx">Zelda</a>-inspired adventure having to make the "tough decision" to delay the title on Switch, Switch 2, and all other platforms, as "it's just not quite there yet". Fortunately, this delay isn't a major one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week, our team made a tough decision: we decided to delay Mina the Hollower. The entire crew has been working tirelessly day and night to finish development for release on Oct 31st, but we’re just not quite there yet. This isn’t a major delay, it’s just a stretch of time to apply some final polish and balancing to make the game truly shine.</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="W9fsZhwHLmM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W9fsZhwHLmM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/W9fsZhwHLmM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W9fsZhwHLmM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5efcbeplisxv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div><blockquote>
<p>With that said, we would like to apologize! Nevertheless, we will not waver on our commitment to quality. Our goal is to make sure our development team has the time and resources to deliver an incredible adventure and we will be giving you just that. That’s no hollow promise!</p>
<p>We don’t want to announce another release date until it’s submitted to platforms, so please hang tight as we reach the finish line.</p>
<p>The game is <em>so</em> close to being done- we’re playing it from start to finish every day. In the final hours, this is what the crew is working on:</p>
<p>- Finalizing design, art, and sound<br>
- Overall game balancing<br>
- Implementing localization<br>
- Eating cheese<br>
- Testing, testing, testing… on all platforms!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As noted, there's no new release date just yet, but again, it sounds like fans won't have to wait too long, as it's adding the final polish to select areas to make the game "truly shine". The original launch date was previously revealed in August of this year, and alongside it was the launch of a free demo, which will even carry over save data to the final build.</p>
<p>Over the past month, games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/professor-layton-and-the-new-world-of-steam">Professor Layton</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/terminator_2d_no_fate">Terminator 2D: NO FATE</a> have also been delayed.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-clears-out-govee-smart-lamp-stock-now-selling-for-less-than-a-basic-floor-lamp-2000632160</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-clears-out-govee-smart-lamp-stock-now-selling-for-less-than-a-basic-floor-lamp.1318102/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Your living room deserves smart lighting that doesn’t drain your wallet. Smart floor lamps have become incredibly popular for transforming spaces with dynamic colors and voice control but the price tags often make people think twice. Not anymore. Right now, the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4546/">Govee RGBIC floor lamp has dropped to just $59 on Amazon, down from its usual $99 price</a>. This Prime Big Deal Days offer <strong>marks an all-time low</strong> for one of the most popular smart lamps on the market.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4546/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This is not another mood-decorating, color-changing lamp: The Govee floor lamp is 136cm high and<strong> produces 1000 lumens of light which means it genuinely functions as actual light for your room</strong> (rather than mood decoration). At that level of brightness, it places it on a par with standard floor lamps so you can employ it for reading, working or ambient room light when it’s day, then shift over to bright color modes when night falls.</p>
<h2>What Makes This Smart Lamp Worth Your Money</h2>
<p>The RGBIC tech (that IC means <em>Independent Control</em>) distinguishes this lamp from less expensive ones: <strong>Each of the light strip segments is capable of showing disparate colors at the same time</strong>&nbsp;which lets you have flowing rainbow effects or gradients or multi-color schemes that plain RGB lamps aren’t up for. At your fingertips, <strong>you’re looking at 16 million different available colors and 58 dynamic built-in scenes</strong> named Cheerful, Romantic, and the like. Want your lamp pulsing red and orange, like a campfire? Done. Want a chilly blue-to-purple gradient for a late gaming marathon? Easy. The range goes deep enough that you’ll be able to fine-tune your lamp with holiday decorations or a party theme or just your mood of the moment without ever using the same look twice.</p>



<p>Voice command with Alexa or Google Home allows you never to have to rummage for your phone. Simply ask your smart speaker to turn the lamp on, change the hue, or reduce the brightness while cooking, working, or already settled on the sofa. The Govee Home app (installable through QR code on the box) adds additional control features with scheduling, so your lamp automatically wakes you gently with morning hues or unwinds with warm hues at bedtime. The app interface makes it simple to create custom scenes, allowing you to set specific hues for varying segments of a scene and then save your favorite sets for instant recall.</p>
<p>With sync mode,<strong> this light springs to life at parties, movie nights, or when playing video games</strong>. Inner microphones detect sound in the room and translate it into dynamic, real-time changes in brightness. Thump-heavy tunes create pulsing results, dialogues stay gentle, and action scenes erupt with corresponding changes in color. This dynamic lighting delivers real immersion for entertainment without cluttered setup.</p>
<p>The physical build makes this lamp suitable for real homes: Aluminum construction makes it firm (non-wobbling, non-tipping) yet light enough for simple transport from one room to another. Sections on the base fasten immediately without tools. At 136cm tall, it comfortably inhabits a corner, behind a sofa or next to a desk without overwhelming your space.</p>
<p>Stock sells out fast on Prime Big Deal Days, so this all-time-low pricing won’t last indefinitely.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Roborock launched the Saros 10R in June 2025 and introduced its latest flagship generation that redefines what premium robot vacuums can achieve. This is <strong>the most advanced model in Roborock’s entire lineup</strong>, and it delivers power and capabilities that dwarf every other robot vacuum currently sold on Amazon.</p>
<p>Now, for Prime Big Deal Days, this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4545/">technological marvel has dropped to a new record low of $1,199, down from its usual $1,599</a>. The reason people invest in premium robot vacuums like this is simple: they want their <strong>floors genuinely clean</strong> without lifting a finger, and cheaper models simply can’t deliver the thoroughness, intelligence, or convenience that justify the automation.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4545/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>22,000 Pa Suction Power Eradicates Dirt on Entire Surfaces</h2>
<p>Conventional robot vacuums are 3.8 to 4 inches high due to the necessity for a raised LDS (<em>Laser Distance Sensor</em>) tower on top for mapping. Roborock Saros 10R features the StarSight Autonomous System 2.0 which eliminates the extending sensor unit and <strong>reduces the profile to a mere 3.14 inches high</strong>. The vacuum slides under beds, sofas, cabinets and coffee tables that stand in the way of chunkier rivals.</p>
<p>The 3D sensing capabilities accurately map rooms even under spindly-legged furniture and drop-down cabinets with the VertiBeam Lateral Obstacle Avoidance system avoiding obstructions such as cables and poly-legged furniture legs without getting stuck. The advanced algorithms identify and respond to 108 different types of obstructions, so the vacuum cleans your whole home without incessant supervision or rescue interventions.</p>



<p>The <strong>HyperForce suction system produces 22,000 pascals of vacuum pressure</strong> which is about double/triple what mid-range robot vacuums deliver. This brute strength removes ground-in dirt from carpet fibers, draws out debris from grout gaps between tiles, and sucks up fine dust particles from hardwood left behind by weaker robots. The Zero-Tangling DuoDivide main brush features a <strong>dual-sided design that keeps hair from tangling around the roller</strong>, automatically ejecting and depositing long hair and pet fur directly into the dustbin. The FlexiArm Riser side brush <strong>extends automatically when it senses corners and edging</strong>, sweeping out debris from baseboards and cramped corners that round robots almost universally ignore.</p>



<p>The first-of-its-type AdaptiLift Chassis adjusts the height of the robot dynamically, navigating through obstructions up to 4 cm high like door thresholds, area rug corners, and U-shaped chair leg furnishings that would cause lighter robots to stall. As soon as it senses carpet, <strong>the two rotating cleaning mops and their mounting bracket automatically lift up</strong> so you don’t wet your carpets, then lower when returning to hard floors.</p>
<p>The multifunctional dock 4.0 handles ten different maintenance tasks autonomously: It washes mops with 176-degree Fahrenheit hot water, dries them with 131-degree hot air to prevent mildew, <strong>empties the robot’s dustbin automatically with 60 days of capacity</strong>, refills the water tank, dispenses cleaning solution, and even cleans itself with hot water. The dock recharges the robot in 2.5 hours, and when it detects heavily soiled areas during cleaning, it triggers automatic re-wash and re-mop cycles for deep cleaning.</p>
<p>At $1,199 during Prime Big Deal Days, the Saros 10R costs less than several mid-range variants but delivers flagship performance for which full automation is justified.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>This weekend, Amazon dropped the <strong>Jackery Explorer 1000 (v2)</strong> to $429 for early <em>Prime Big Deal Days</em> access. Now the retailer has taken things even further by lowering the displayed price to $399, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3722/">plus an additional 10% off at checkout for eligible buyers, bringing the final cost down to potentially $359 (down from $799)</a>. This is an absolute record low price for this power station, and here’s what makes it remarkable: <strong>no competitor offering a 1500W portable power station has ever come close to this pricing</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3722/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>You’re<strong> looking at half off the usual $799 retail price</strong> on a product that solves one of the most frustrating problems for campers, RV owners and anyone preparing for emergencies. Running out of power during outdoor adventures or losing electricity during storms creates genuine hardship, and the Jackery Explorer 1000 provides enough capacity and output to keep essential devices running for extended periods.</p>
<h2>Days of Power, Not Hours</h2>
<p>The 1070 watt-hour capacity provides robust energy storage translating to real-world usage most users are familiar with. You’ll be able to <strong>charge a laptop around 10 times, run a mini-fridge for approximately 15 hours</strong>, support LED lights for a few days or run a CPAP unit for a number of evenings. The LiFePO4 battery chemistry is a step up from lithium-ion batteries employed for lower-end power stations: LiFePO4 batteries last for approximately 4,000 charge cycles until capacity dips at 80%, for reference, standard lithium-ion batteries last for around 500 to 1,000 cycles at the 80% level.</p>
<p>The majority of portable power stations have a peak output of between 300W and 500W which makes for charging small devices like cell phones or a mini portable fan at once. The <strong>1500W of continuous output with a 3000W surge delivers</strong> sufficient power for actual household devices like microwaves, electric kettles, power tools, or a small air conditioner unit. The surge amount addresses the starting burst of power when starting motors which is relevant for devices like refrigerators that consume several multiples of their-rated wattage for a number of seconds at starting time. The unit contains <strong>everyday AC outlets</strong> which accept typical three-prong plugs, and a<strong> 100W USB-C Power Delivery outlet</strong> for quick charging a laptop or tablet without bulky AC adapters.</p>



<p>The fast charging for one hour <strong>allows you to go from zero to full battery in 60 minutes</strong> via a common wall outlet which is extremely fast for a battery of this size. Most rival power stations need 6-8 hours for a full recharge. This quick turnaround is priceless on multi-day camping trips when you may have shore power available for a few hours here or there, or when there are rolling blackouts when you have a quick top-off between outages. The unit also has solar charging capabilities with optional solar panels, allowing you to have power on tap indefinitely off-grid when you harness energy from the sun during the day.</p>
<p>The Jackery Explorer 1000 v2 currently the <strong>highest-rated best-seller on Amazon for generators for outdoors</strong>, with over 4,000 units sold this month alone and a 4.6-star overall rating out of nearly 3,000 reviews. At $359 using the checkout discount on Prime Big Deal Days, you pay less than some 500Wh power centers with half the capacity and a much lower lifespan.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-macbook-air-m4-256gb-16gb-ram-now-costs-half-the-price-of-a-pro-amazon-rushes-to-clear-out-space-2000632140</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>MacBook Air models dominate Apple’s laptop sales because they handle everyday computing needs for the vast majority of users (without the complexity or cost of Pro models). The catch has always been the price: You need to budget at least $1,000 for the standard configuration and upgrades can quickly push you toward $1,500, the territory where MacBook Pro models begin.</p>
<p>For <em>Prime Big Deal Days</em>, Amazon has essentially eliminated its entire profit margin on the best-selling configuration, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3761/">bringing the 2025 MacBook Air 13-inch with M4 chip down to $799 from its usual $999</a>. This represents the lowest price ever for the 2025 model <strong>with 256GB storage and 16GB unified memory</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3761/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>M4 Chip Designed for Apple Intelligence</h2>
<p>The M4 chip is Apple’s latest silicon design which is <strong>custom-built for handling Apple Intelligence features</strong> which require intensive processing for on-device AI calculations. That means features like sophisticated editing of photos, real-time translation, voice transcription, and intelligent writing assistant are executed locally on your laptop rather than being sent off to cloud servers.</p>
<p>The performance benefit extends beyond AI features: The M4 handles dozens of web tabs, many productivity applications, video calling and background applications without a hitch or fan functioning. Because it is fanless, the <strong>MacBook Air stays silent for any amount of intensive usage</strong>&nbsp;which is not possible for regular Intel-based laptops which require active heat management when under load.</p>



<p>Apple’s unified memory architecture pools RAM across the CPU, the GPU, and the Neural Engine, so data moves between disparate processing units without the performance penalty that individual pools of memory cause in older computer architectures. The 16GB setup affords sufficient headroom for professional uses like photo editing in Final Cut Pro, video editing or virtual machines. This is important because earlier versions of the MacBook Air had 8GB, which meant that users had to constantly juggle what apps they had open.</p>



<p>The <strong>13.6-inch Liquid Retina display uses IPS LCD tech with a resolution of 2560 pixels by 1664 pixels</strong>. The Liquid Retina display includes the P3 wide color gamut, a brightness of 500 nits and remains legible outdoors under direct sunlight when cheaper laptop screens dim down and become unreadable. True Tone tech automatically changes colour temperature based on ambient illumination for less eye strain when working for long periods at a time.</p>
<p>The 12MP Center Stage camera at last elevates MacBook video call quality. <strong>Center Stage utilizes machine learning when you’re on the go</strong>, automatically framing you by zooming and panning to create the ideal video call composition. This gives you a more professional appearance when participating in online Zoom conferences and eliminates the bothersome need for you to repeatedly shift your position or angle to remain visible on camera.</p>
<p>This laptop sells for $799 on Prime Big Deal Days, which places the 2025 MacBook Air M4 on equal terms truly with mid-range Windows notebooks but with Apple’s superior build quality, battery life, and ecosystem integration.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/megabonk-quick-review.1318063/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Megabonk is a 3D survivors-like with a very <em>specific </em>sense of humor that has been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/why-this-indie-game-is-going-viral">getting a lot of buzz lately</a>. I've played about 15 hours as of writing this, so while this quick look is more meant to share my early impressions across that time rather than being a full, scored review, I’ve already done plenty worth talking about. There is still a fair bit I haven't seen, but I got a little more than half the achievements and unlockables in that time, and I have been enjoying myself a lot. Adding an extra axis of movement does a lot to set it apart, and it's more than competent at all the usual conventions of the genre already.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've played these kinds of games before, the basics are pretty much the same. You run around and fight endlessly-spawning waves of enemies that get harder and harder as the time ticks down. It'll start with little goblins, and then you'll get goblins with swords, and eventually build up to some more dangerous stuff like ogres or giant scorpions. Every once in a while a miniboss will pop up and those add some variety and a nice little spike of challenge. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also shrines that let you summon powerful elite packs and even more bosses with the promise of greater rewards, and I always appreciate that kind of thing where I'm not going into a menu and turning the difficulty up, but I can kind of tweak the difficulty as I go based on the decisions I make in the run. I prefer that, honestly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As is common for these kinds of games, all of your weapons do their things automatically, whether that's a sword or a rocket launcher. The only controls you're worried about are movement-related. I like the variety and the bombastic attitude of the weapons. There are no two that feel overly similar, and they're all pretty fun to use in different situations. Getting the revolver and the missiles and stacking bonuses to the number of projectiles I can spawn is great.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But of course the most obvious and I think the coolest difference here is that Megabonk is built with fully 3D levels and 3D movement. You can jump, and even get power-ups that give you better jumps or double, triple, quadruple jumps which is a ton of fun. There's an item that makes all your weapons do more damage while you're airborne, which can be quite powerful. One of the characters, Monke, can actually climb walls, which gives him some big advantages.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There's a frantic but tactical loop of going fast while planning out your path carefully.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">And this exploration and planning routes across steep cliffs, up and down ramps, is a big part of Megabonk, which makes every run feel interesting and challenging in some ways a lot of survivors-style games aren't. First off, to finish a level, you have to locate the boss gate so you can summon the final boss before the timer runs out and you're eventually overwhelmed by endless waves of ghosts. So there's that added need to get out and comb the map, unless you get lucky and spawn right by the boss gate which sometimes happens, and I like that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then the second part is that the map is littered with breakable containers, shrines, and chests, and your power level is going to be directly related to how many of these you can hit within the time limit before you move on to the next level. So there's this frantic but also very tactical loop where you want to go fast while planning out your path carefully to avoid backtracking and tag as many points of interest as possible. Chests also, at least most of them, cost gold to open, and that price goes up every time you open one, so sometimes you have to know when to pass one up because it's not worth waiting around to farm coins when you're not going to be able to afford to open every single chest anyway. The number of considerations I have to weigh in my head to put together a really good run feels satisfying and like I can usually overcome at least a lot of the capricious force of randomness by playing smart.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now I do have to talk about the humor, because it's one of the first things I noticed. The entire theme of Megabonk seems to be Millennial and Gen Z internet brain rot. And it's honestly hard to tell if – at the rist of sounding a bit mean or snotty – this supposed to genuinely make me laugh in a surface-level way. Like is this the straightforward sense of humor the developers were aiming for? Or are they doing a Tim and Eric cringe comedy thing, like the <em>real</em> joke is that it's kind of stupid on purpose? How many layers of irony deep are we? In the former case, it doesn't work that well. But if it's the latter, it kind of does.<br>Yeah, in 2025, I'm totally still sending my friends all the latest GigaChads. Remember him? There's an item that spawns "borgars." Dang, did John Hammond show up to pop your champagne after you dug that one up? (The irony is not lost on me that I'm using a reference from a 1993 movie to criticize how old this meme is, but it's a classic, okay?) There's a surprisingly safe for work boss called "Scorpionussy." There's a power-up that "claps cheeks." Practically everything you pick up is some kind of reference to years- or decades-old meme culture. It never got in the way of the gameplay for me, but there were a few times I thought my eyes were going to roll so hard I might sever my optic nerves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Megabonk currently only has two levels, a spooky forest and a deadlier desert, at least unless there are some secret ones I'm not aware of. But they do each have three different tiers of increasing difficulty. The first is just a single stage, while each subsequent tier adds one additional stage with a new boss that lets you carry over all your power-ups from the previous one. I do find the lack of changing scenery a bit disappointing. Those two biomes are definitely starting to feel repetitive, and I couldn't find anything like a roadmap that said the devs plan to add more. It's not labeled as Early Access either. But the three tiers definitely provide a good challenge and give me more room to push myself.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Len's Favorite Roguelikes and lites</h3><p>Some of my favorite Roguelikes/lites from over the years.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Meta-progression isn't super deep, but it is meaningful and rewarding. Everything outside of a run costs a separate currency called silver that you can pick up on runs. Getting permission to buy new characters, items, and power-ups requires you to first complete an objective or achievement thematically tied to each one, which is kind of neat. Then you have the more straightforward buffs to level up like getting more rerolls or more weapon slots. I appreciated that you only have to pay for the ability to toggle unlocked items on or off once and then you can use it as much as you want, since I really like to optimize my loot pool going into a run in these types of games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The characters are mostly pretty simple in their design but enjoyable to use. I think my favorite is CL4NK who is a robot cowboy gunslinger that starts with the revolver and gets increased critical chance every level. But you've also got a skeleton on a skateboard who does more damage the faster he moves, and the ninja is also a lot of fun because he automatically kills any enemy who misses him with an attack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As far as survivors-likes go, this is a pretty strong one. Especially with the added consideration of the jump button and the whole vertical axis, and the emphasis on route-planning and exploration, I found it had that crucial ability to make me want to start a new run as soon as I finished the last until it was suddenly several hours later. I'm regularly groaning at some of the uninspired image board humor, but I feel like I can sometimes appreciate it in an ironic way, and otherwise just ignore it. I'd say it's worth a look if you have an appetite for another one of these that isn't basically just a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-review">Vampire Survivors</a> reskin. I just wish there was a little more level variety.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mina-the-hollower">Mina the Hollower</a> is quite clearly a Halloween game. The thing about Halloween is that there should always be a little bit silliness amongst the horrific and the scary, and Yacht Club Games' next retro throwback seemed quite well fitted for the season. It was so appropriate that it was even planned to be released on October 31st! All of this to say, yes, Mina the Hollower is delayed, and it doesn't have a new release date either.
</p>
<p>
"The entire crew has been working tirelessly day and night to finish development for release on Oct 31st, but we’re just not quite there yet," Yacht Club Games explained in a <a href="https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/delay-extravaganza-ii-the-tail-continues/">blog post</a> announcing the delay. "This isn’t a major delay, it’s just a stretch of time to apply some final polish and balancing to make the game truly shine." They also noted in the post that a new release date isn't being revealed just yet, as they're waiting until the game is submitted to its various platforms.
</p>
<p>
To be fair, it is apparently "so close to being done," and it sounds like it's only smaller things like finalising design, art, and sound, balance tweaks, localisation testing, platform testing, and the act of eating cheese that's holding up the release that was meant to take place this month.
</p>
<p>
On the one hand, this is definitely a bit of a shame as I have been hankering for something akin to the GBC Zelda games, and I love a Halloween activity given I am not too far away from my thirties and am very childless so trick or treating is not something I can partake in. On the other hand, as ever there are too many games - both Unbeatable and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/possessors">Possessor(s)</a> are launching in the first half of November, and boy howdy do I not have the time for either of them.
</p>
<p>
Fingers crossed Yatch Club Games find a new release date soon enough! And selfishly, one that's far away from other games I also want to play.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>October was going to be a special month. For the first time since <em>Shovel Knight</em> came out over a decade ago, Yacht Club Games was going to release a new game that had nothing to do with its hit 8-bit platformer. It’s a <em>Link’s Awakening</em>-sized adventure <a href="https://kotaku.com/shovel-knight-mina-the-hollower-zelda-castlevania-game-1848463038">called <em>Mina the Hollower</em></a>. Unfortunately, it also just got indefinitely delayed.</p> <p>“This week, our team made a tough decision: we decided to delay <em>Mina the Hollower</em>,” the studio wrote in <a href="https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/delay-extravaganza-ii-the-tail-continues/">a new blog post on Monday</a>. “The entire crew has been working tirelessly day and night to finish development for release on Oct 31st, but we’re just not quite there yet.&nbsp; This isn’t a major delay, it’s just a stretch of time to apply some final polish and balancing to make the game truly shine.”</p>

 <p>Unlike its 2D side-scrolling predecessor,<em> Mina the Hollower</em> is a top-down action game that focuses a bit more on puzzles and combat. Think <em>Castlevania</em> if it fell on the ground with a <em>Zelda</em>-inspired interconnected map. It has all the signs of becoming another clever, charming retro homage if Yacht Club can deliver. Apparently, it still needs more time to cook. There’s no new release date yet, but that doesn’t mean it’s necessarily far away from finally coming out.</p>

 <p>“We don’t want to announce another release date until it’s submitted to platforms, so please hang tight as we reach the finish line,” Yacht Club wrote today. “The game is&nbsp;<i>so</i> close to being done- we’re playing it from start to finish every day.” In the meantime, the developers say they’re working on finalizing design, art, sound, game balance, localization, and QA.</p> <p><em>Mina the Hollower</em> is the third notable game <a href="https://kotaku.com/every-game-release-october-2025-pokemon-battlefield-ninja-gaiden-2000630373">to drop out of the busy October release calendar lineup</a>. Roguelike dungeon game <em>Moonlighter 2 </em>moved to November and <i>Kingmakers </i>is missing its Early Access date this week with no new date announced yet. <em>Mina the Hollower</em> is the one I was looking forward to most, however. I’d love to be spending my end-of-year travel season cozied up to my Switch like it’s 1998 again and the Game Boy Color just came out. We’ll see if it still ends up arriving in time for the holiday.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/gopro-is-going-wild-for-prime-day-the-hero13-black-is-practically-being-given-away-on-amazon-2000632012</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gopro-is-going-wild-for-prime-day-the-hero13-black-is-practically-being-given-away-on-amazon.1318015/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><strong>GoPro almost never puts its cameras on sale</strong>. Outside of a handful of major shopping events each year, and exclusively through Amazon, you’re paying full price. That’s why <em>Prime Big Deal Days</em> and Black Friday are the only real opportunities to snag a deal on their latest gear. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4525/">the HERO13 Black bundle (including two batteries) is down to $399 from its usual $499, and this is an all-time low for the newest model</a>. If you’ve been waiting to document your ski trips, capture your kids’ soccer games from unique angles, mount a camera on your mountain bike for trail footage or simply record your travels in stunning quality that your phone can’t match, this is your moment.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4525/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This package comes complete with goodies that truly make a difference: You receive <strong>two Enduro batteries</strong>, which is a big deal because action camera batteries have a short life when you’re recording in chilly weather or capturing high-def video. Enduro batteries are also designed to hold up better when it’s cold outside and have a longer overall life, <strong>giving you up to 2.5 hours of solid 5.3K recording per battery pack</strong>.</p>
<p>Another welcome innovation is t<strong>he waterproof shutter remote</strong> which allows you to initiate recording or stop recording from a distance of up to 196 feet away. This allows you to affix the GoPro HERO 13 Black camera on your helmet, your ride or a tripod and operate it without awkwardly pressing the small buttons on the camera which is extremely handy when your hands are gloved or the camera is mounted somewhere out of easy reach.</p>



<h2>Film-Like Experience That Accommodates Your Trek</h2>
<p>The <strong>HERO13 Black captures at 5.3K resolution</strong> which provides 91% more information than regular 4K and a whopping 665% more resolution than 1080p. That extra resolution provides serious leeway in post-editing. Crop-in on your shots, firm up shaky frames or punch-in on details without sacrificing quality. The GoPro Quik app even allows you to <strong>pull 24.7-megapixel still images straight out of your 5.3K video</strong>&nbsp;so you never have a bad photo because you happened to be recording video rather than pics.</p>
<p>One of the coolest capabilities is <strong>Burst Slo-Mo which takes action at 13 times normal speed</strong>. Just think about being able to capture a skate trick, a breaking wave, or a bike jump with all the little details witnessed in silky smooth slow motion. And you <strong>can capture 4x slow motion at the full 5.3K resolution</strong>&nbsp;which creates extremely detailed slo-mo video that freezes movements and moments your eye might otherwise miss.</p>



<p>The GoPro HERO13 Black includes native support for HB-Series Lenses that are automatically switched when you put them on the camera. The Ultra Wide Lens Mod is perfect for POV shots when you need to see all that’s in front of you, from ski slopes to surf sessions. The Macro Lens Mod places you very close to the subject for close-ups of small objects, details, or animals. Neutral Density filters enable you to naturally blur fast-paced scenes for motion blur and exposure control for sunny scenes, adding a cinematic effect to your clips.</p>
<p>Designed to withstand the toughest environments, the <strong>HERO13 Black is water-resistant up to 33 feet without the need for extra housing</strong>. Water-repellent lens cover minimizes lens flare, giving you clear shots even when wet.</p>
<p>For that price, getting the complete bundle with two batteries is a steal.</p>

                <p>The follow-up to Yacht Club's indie hit Shovel Knight will have to wait a little longer, as the studio has announced that Mina the Hollower will be delayed out of its previously announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shovel-knight-devs-mina-the-hollower-launches-on-halloween-demo-out-now/1100-6532145/" data-ref-id="1100-6532145">Halloween release date</a>. While Yacht Club said this delay will be a short one, it isn't prepared to nail down an exact date just yet.</p><p>"This week, our team made a tough decision: we decided to delay Mina the Hollower," the team wrote on its <a href="https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/delay-extravaganza-ii-the-tail-continues/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official site</a>. "The entire crew has been working tirelessly day and night to finish development for release on October 31, but we’re just not quite there yet. This isn’t a major delay, it’s just a stretch of time to apply some final polish and balancing to make the game truly shine."</p><p>Though the delay is short, though, Yacht Club said it doesn't want to announce a new release date until it's submitted to all platforms. In the meantime, it's working on finalizing design, art, and sound, game balancing, localization, and testing. And eating cheese.</p><p>"Our goal is to make sure our development team has the time and resources to deliver an incredible adventure and we will be giving you just that," the studio said.</p><p>Mina the Hollower is Yacht Club's first original franchise after the breakout success of Shovel Knight in 2014. The studio has been busy in the meantime, though, creating loads of extra DLC campaigns for Shovel Knight, as well as developing and publishing spin-offs like Shovel Knight Showdown and Shovel Knight: Pocket Dungeon.</p><p>Mina the Hollower is inspired by the classic top-down Zelda games, with an art style that pays homage to that color palette as well. It stars a little mouse in a kingdom of animals, and as the name implies, she can burrow underground to solve puzzles and surprise enemies.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Shovel Knight Developer Yacht Club Games has delayed its anticipated follow-up, the Zelda-inspired <a href="https://gameinformer.com/sgf-2025/2025/06/06/mina-the-hollower-the-next-game-from-the-creators-of-shovel-knight-launches">Mina the Hollower</a>. The upcoming game was scheduled to launch on October 31.</p><p>Initially crowdfunded via Kickstarter, Mina the Hollower centers on the titular mouse, a scientist and explorer who embarks on a mission to rescue a cursed island. The top-down action game sports a retro aesthetic reminiscent of Game Boy Color titles while its combat evokes The Legend of Zelda and Castlevania. As a Hollower, Mina can burrow underground, which plays a substantial role in combat and exploration.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3KT4R9pu1Ew"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3KT4R9pu1Ew" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>In a <a href="https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/delay-extravaganza-ii-the-tail-continues/">blog post</a>, Yacht Club explains that despite working tirelessly to get Mina ready for launch, &nbsp;it says, “we’re just not quite there yet.” The studio then clarifies that the delay won’t be a big one, and the team will spend this time applying additional polish, fine-tuning balancing, finalizing art and sound, and implementing localization.</p><p>“With that said, we would like to apologize! Nevertheless, we will not waver on our commitment to quality. Our goal is to make sure our development team has the time and resources to deliver an incredible adventure and we will be giving you just that. That’s no hollow promise!" reads Yacht Club's blog post. Yacht Club did not announce a new launch date for Mina the Hollower, as it wants to wait until the game is submitted to platforms for review.&nbsp;</p><p>Mina the Hollower is currently slated to launch on PC and all major consoles, including a recently announced Switch 2 version.
