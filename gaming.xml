			<p>The <strong>PS Plus Essential</strong> games for <strong>March 2026</strong> have been <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/25/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-march-pga-tour-2k25-monster-hunter-rise-slime-rancher-2-the-elder-scrolls-online-collection-gold-road/">revealed</a>, and after February's lineup <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-essential-february-2026-games-undisputed-ace-combat-subnautica-ultros/">added a couple of strong indie titles</a>, this month's lineup of four games includes a few bigger names like <strong>PGA Tour 2K25</strong> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-such-great-heights/"><strong>Monster Hunter Rise</strong> </a>headlining this month's batch.</p>



<p>Plays subscribed to the bottom tier of <strong>PS Plus</strong> or higher will get access to the two aforementioned games, along with <strong>Slime Rancher 2</strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-zenimax-interview-free-content-battle-pass/">The Elder Scrolls Online Collection: Gold Road</a></strong> next week starting on <strong>March 3, 2026</strong>. As always, if you want to access these games after this coming month, you'll need to add them to your library before they're gone.</p>



<p>Speaking of adding these titles to your library, with next month's PS Plus Essential games arriving on March 3, that means <strong>March 2, 2026</strong>, will be your last chance to add February's games (<strong>Ultros, Undisputed, Subnautica: Below Zero</strong>, and <strong>Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown</strong>), to your library.</p>

<p>It's not the most exciting of PS Plus Essential game batches, but if any of these games are within your wheelhouse, they'll all certainly be able to provide you with hours of gameplay to dig into, particularly in the case of The Elder Scrolls Online and Monster Hunter Rise.</p>



<p>The bright side of this batch is that PS Plus Extra and PS Plus Premium members are actually getting new games to add to their library, instead of what can often happen where the new batch of Essential games includes titles that PS Plus Extra and higher-tier subscribers already had access to through PS Plus.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>President Trump gave his State of the Union speech to Congress last night. I skipped it and played video games instead as part of my ongoing 2026 resolution to practice more self-care. But pinhead sycophants like CNN contributor Scott Jennings and Trump advisor Stephen Miller thought it killed, especially one moment in which the president tried to trick Democrats into appearing unpatriotic by not standing in support of <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/1/us-judge-orders-release-of-five-year-old-and-father-from-ice-detention">ICE kidnapping kids off the street</a>.</p> <p>“If you agree with this statement, then stand up and show your support: The first duty of the American government is to protect American citizens, not illegal aliens,” Trump told Congress. Got ’em! Sick burn, Mr. President! That’s how the charmless toadies riding his coattails responded on social media. “Will be signature moment of this speech,” Jennings, who gets paid <a href="https://www.status.news/p/scott-jennings-cnn-deal">the big bucks</a> to launder fascist talking points on cable TV, wrote somewhat normally. “Trump nailed them.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Why does this guy always talk like a World of Warcraft npc <a href="https://t.co/HWIIhBWpSz">https://t.co/HWIIhBWpSz</a></p> <p>— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) <a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/2026696988272546182?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 25, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Then Miller responded like that friend at the party who promised you they they’d be chill and then moments later won’t shut up about the<em> Magic: The Gathering</em> banned card lists from 20 years ago. “Democrats declared to the world their searing disdain for, and profound disloyalty to, the actual citizens of the United States,” he wrote. “They were repeatedly entreated to stand. Over and over. They refused. It was a moment that chills to the bone and which will live for a thousand years.”</p> <p>Sounds about right for the guy <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/celebrity/articles/stephen-miller-danced-ice-ice-020716169.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAABw1aucCtL0V3ooK882fxCGI3X9QkIovPuwGEiGYga_saAdGOLkXEfWwJdp4GXy_J7NKxRUKksUF1JrPccktILsrFTZ165XDBCDN7u8m0wwvMdWQaInFvi2yW8B2X6uw6y7LBUiRR3Mt7EH6_D3r_GLcmA3t8XWgmnGDKdlBQuuh">dancing like this</a> to “Ice Ice Baby” at Mar-a-Lago hours before his wife announces their fourth child. “Why does this guy always talk like a World of Warcraft npc,” Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wrote back. “Holy shit…Wasn’t expecting to catch that stray today…” responded veteran Blizzard designer Chadd Nervig in the comments. Previously a developer on <em>World of Warcraft</em>, Nervig now works on <em>Hearthstone</em>, which has immortalized some of the MMO’s best NPCs in card form. It would all be that much funnier if Miller wasn’t foaming at the mouth 24/7 to ruin other people’s lives.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-developers-comment-on-new-locales-trailer-more-ign-fanfest-2026</link>
            <guid>1446457</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection’s release date is right around the corner, and IGN had the chance to speak to the developers in depth about a brand new locales trailer released at IGN Fan Fest. We’ve got never-before-seen concept art of the three main bases in the game – Azuria Castle, Shepharden, and Galyad – and insightful commentary from director Kenji Oguro, art director Takahiro Kawano, and lead game designer Daisuke Wakahara. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a> is shaping up to be a beautiful game, which is wholly supported by the diverse scenery you’ll encounter on your journey as an environmentalist Ranger. The Monster Hunter Stories 3 team allocated a lot of time and research into making the locations enjoyable for players, and their attention to detail shows. You can watch the new locales video with commentary direct from the developers above, or, if you’d like to immerse yourself in the scenery with no commentary and a few bonus scenes, check out the trailer below. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Azuria </h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve played the free demo version of Monster Hunter Stories 3, you’ve seen Azuria. This land features fields, forests, and picturesque mountains on the horizon with a castle town on a lake, lending a classic storybook backdrop. 
</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Azuria Concept Art - Monster Hunter Stories 3</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“In the design process, we wanted to make the stereotypical fantasy castle type of design to depict how peaceful Azuria is, and to depict the beautiful nature of the world of Azuria and the castle itself,” Kawano said. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team had some real-world inspiration that made its way into the concept art for the surrounding area of Azuria and its castle, specifically, a Spanish castle called Alcazar de Segovia. This wouldn’t be the first time the castle has inspired a creator – as part of its 100th anniversary, The Walt Disney Company revealed in 2023 that it was the inspiration for Snow White’s castle. A magical locale, indeed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kawano also described how the wing-like flags represent the wings of Rathalos to signify the special bond Azuria has with the endangered species. The town even has a runway of sorts for monsters to take flight, something uniquely logical for the Stories series, where Riders form bonds with monsters called Monsties and, as the name suggests, ride them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The attention to detail in the scenery carries into the connection of Twisted Reflection's story as well. The main catalyst of the plot in Stories 3 is the “Crystal Encroachment,” a phenomenon with unknown origins affecting both the environment and monsters, but the Egg Quartz it leaves behind is used by the residents of Azuria and elsewhere as a source of light. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Shepharden</h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Shepharden Concept Art - Monster Hunter Stories 3</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Shepharden is the second locale the protagonist and the rangers will visit, and if you’ve played a certain entry in the regular Monster Hunter lineup, you may recognize the lush environment. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“One key feature of [Shepharden] is that monsters from Monster Hunter Rise inhabit the area around it,” revealed Kawano. “So based on Monster Hunter Rise, as you may have known, it has a very Eastern, Asia-like taste. So Shepharden and the surrounding area is also designed after that art style.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You might also notice a structure at the base of the stairs to the village elder’s place inspired by Japanese torii gates, clearly recognizable as orange, angular arches. Right beneath that torii gate are masks stuck into the ground, which represent the graves of the former elders of the village, explained Kawano. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another Shepharden detail the team had to consider is that this village is not built for Riders the way Azuria is. As such, there aren’t stables – so Ratha, the protagonists’ Rathalos, is stuck into a very small space that’s part of an unused residence. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Galyad</h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Galyad Concept Art - Monster Hunter Stories 3</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Galyad is a bustling, prosperous town surrounded by desert and relatively desolate lands compared to Azuria and Shepharden. It’s covered in decoration, stones, and jewelry, somewhat fueled by the residents’ successful trade of Egg Quartz. Kawano described that as you get deeper into the city of Galyad, you might discover a boundary between the prosperous residents and the not-so-fortunate residents, and find slum-like areas. 
</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The city’s architecture and design is actually inspired by Mediterranean regions and even has a Lagiacrus fountain in the city center. It's especially interesting given the desert environment – Lagiacrus is, after all, a Leviathan monster known to inhabit the water. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Galyad used to be an ocean port city that was floating on top of the ocean,” Kawano explained. “So all the jewelry and the decorations were based off of the Mediterranean sea theme, but desertification has caused the city to lose all the water and it is currently barren, sandy. So that is the reason why there's a difference between the decorations and the actual cityscape itself.” 
</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Monster Hunter 3: Twisted Reflection Q&amp;A </h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, I had to take advantage of the time I had speaking with the Monster Hunter 3: Twisted Reflection developers, so I asked a few questions unrelated to the new trailer I thought might be interesting. We got into the game's more mature protagonist, the weapon availability, the habitat restoration mechanic, and dual-element monsters. 
</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>The interview below has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: I'd say habitat restoration is one of the biggest new gameplay mechanics in Monster Hunter Stories 3. Can you describe the inspiration behind building the system and why you included it?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kenji Oguro: </strong>The first reason we wanted to implement this feature into Stories 3 is because of the protagonist. He or she is the captain of the Ranger Corps and their objective is to protect and preserve the environment. So we wanted to express the preservation of the environment, not just only in the storyline, but in the actual gameplay cycle itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tthe second reason we implemented habitat restoration is to expand on the Monster Hunter Stories series formula, where deepening bonds with the monsters is very important. In the previous entries, you would collect monster eggs from dens, hatch them, and raise them, but the places where you could get those eggs were very limited and were the same across all players. But for Monster Hunter Stories 3, by implementing this habitat restoration feature, every player will have their very own environment. So your environment and my environment might differ a lot. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">By restoring the monster populations and sending them off back to the wilds, you might be able to find some rare eggs with dual-element monsters, as well as Deviant Monsters. [Deviant Monsters] are popular monsters from the previous Monster Hunter mainline series games. You might be able to find eggs of the Deviant monsters by raising the ecosystem rank within the habitat restoration feature. We wanted to reward players for helping to protect the environment and restoring the endangered species and growing their population in the world by providing rare monsters that might hatch from the eggs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: In the first Monster Hunter Stories, changing a Monstie’s element worked differently, and was achieved by swapping genes to change their stats. Can you tell us the reason behind changing this method to the new one? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kenji Oguro: </strong>In the first Stories game, when you change the genes of the monster and get a dual-element monster, the element that monster possesses completely changes. So that might end up as a disadvantage for a player if you get the wrong combination. But for Stories 3, the team wanted to expand the user's options more and also make habitat restoration more unique. So they implemented habitat restoration and by raising the ecosystem rank and getting the rare eggs, you are rewarded with the dual-element monster. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For Stories 3, the dual-element monster will retain their original element. So if the original monster has a fire element, they will keep the fire element, and on top of that, they'll get their second new element. So in the combat, players might want to keep the original fire element and get a new element on top.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This gives players an advantage and more options when they are forming their parties. Usually for RPG games, players tend to go for the strongest character or strongest monster with the highest stats and abilities. But developing Monster Stories 3, with the dual-element feature, you get special monsters with different appearances. One of [my] favorites is the Velocidrome imbued with the dragon element. So you get a pitch black Velocidrome, very badass. And that was [my] favorite monster within the development cycle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After finding [my] favorite dual-element monster, [I] found that, "Hey, maybe I can just play with my favorite monster instead of focusing on the stats or the ability skills." So that's one of the ways that the players can enjoy the game. It's not just going for the strongest, most powerful monsters, but instead finding a true partner that you love and want to bond with.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: I played the Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflections demo, and I did notice that the Long Sword was added to this game. It hasn't been in Monster Hunter Stories yet. But I didn't see the Sword and Shield in my bag. Can you tell me if the Sword and Shield is in Monster Hunter Stories 3, and why you decided to add the Long Sword?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Daisuke Wakahara: </strong>So first off, we implemented the Long Sword because the Long Sword itself throughout the Monster Hunter series is very popular amongst hunters and riders. However, we did have some trouble implementing the weapon itself into the RPG formula in the previous games. But in Monster Hunter Stories 3, we were able to come up with a formula to have the Long Sword join the weapon roster.</p><p>In terms of Sword and Shield, unfortunately, it is not going to be included in Monster Hunter Stories 3.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">And in terms of Sword and Shield, unfortunately, it is not going to be included in Monster Hunter Stories 3 this time around. The reason why we came to this decision is because we had to carefully think about the weapon balance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When looking at the overall weapon roster for Stories 3, we have Slash, Blunt, and Piercing weapon types. And having both Long Sword and Sword and Shield would change the roster to go towards the Slash weapon types a little too heavily, so we had to take out the Sword and Shield from the roster, unfortunately.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: The main character this time around is more of an adult than the previous protagonists in the Monster Hunter Stories series. Can you tell me why you made that decision to make the protagonist more mature this time around?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Takahiro Kawano: </strong>We wanted to differentiate this with the previous entry stories, Monster Hunter Stories and Monster Hunter Stories 2, where the focus was on a child growing into a young adolescent. We decided to start the story off with a full-grown adult as the elite rider. So in terms of the setting for Monster Hunter Stories 3,  the protagonist actually starts off already grown up as a prince or a princess of Azuria, and is an elite rider.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Is there anything else you want to say to the fans watching before we let you go?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Takahiro Kawano: </strong>As you've seen in the video, we put a lot of effort into the background character designs for Monster Hunter Stories 3. So we’d like to have the players have fun and enjoy the beautiful scenery and the characters in Monster Hunter Stories 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Daisuke Wakahara:</strong> Thank you to all the players for supporting the Monster Hunter Stories series from the first title. You'll be surprised at how much the Monster Hunter Stories series has evolved throughout Stories 2 and the newest entry, Monster Hunter Stories 3. We are very confident in this game and that any player can enjoy it as an RPG title. So even if you haven't tried out the Monster Hunter Stories series yet, we highly encourage new players to try out the Monster Hunter Stories series. </p><div data-cy="paragraph"><p><strong>Kenji Oguro:</strong> [I’ve] played through Monster Hunter Stories 3 10 to 20 times during the development process. And every time I go through the gameplay, there's something new that the player can find. I’m very surprised that there's many, many cards up the development team’s sleeves. So we highly encourage you, the players, to have fun with the game. </p><p>Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection is coming to PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch 2 on March 12, 2026. You can play a free trial right now featuring a huge portion of the first area, Azuria, and continue your progress in the full release.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Casey DeFreitas is Deputy Editor of Guides at IGN, and is a first fleet Monster Hunter.

              <p>Full Circle, the studio behind the online-only <a href="https://kotaku.com/skate-season-2-update-skin-tone-changes-tired-stoners-character-changes-2000649710"><em>Skate</em></a> reboot that launched last year, has announced that an unspeciifed amount of developers have been laid off.</p> <p><a href="https://www.ea.com/ea-studios/full-circle/news/an-update-from-fullcircle">On February 25,</a> EA-owned developer Full Circle posted on its official website that it is “reshaping” the studio to “better support” <em>Skate’s</em> “long-term future.” What does that actually mean? Well, it translates to some members of the studio being laid off.</p>

 <p>“These shifts mean making changes to our team structure, and some roles will be impacted,” posted Full Circle. “The teammates affected are talented colleagues and friends who helped build the foundation of skate. Their creativity and dedication are deeply ingrained in what players experience today. This decision is not a reflection of their impact and we’re committed to supporting them through this transition.”</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> has contacted EA for more information on the layoffs.</p> <p>Full Circle says its work on <em>Skate</em> will continue, adding: “Our commitment to <em>Skate</em> and to the millions of players who believe in it, remains strong.” The post wraps up with a message to the devs who are losing their jobs. “To our departing teammates: thank you. <em>Skate</em> exists because of your hard work and dedication to the craft.”</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/respawn-layoffs-star-wars-jedi-apex-legends-titanfall-1851778330">This is just the latest in a string of recent layoffs</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-panther-ea-cliffhanger-monolith-productions-1851782787">and game cancellations at EA</a>. Full Circle’s post doesn’t connect these layoffs to the massive <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-sale-saudi-arabia-madden-pif-jared-kushner-2000629829">$55 billion Saudi Arabia-backed buyout</a> that is currently in the works. <a href="https://kotaku.com/skate-4-steam-reviews-microtransactions-always-online-2000626503"><em>Skate</em> launched in September</a> of last year with a high playercount on SteamDB, but the online-only MMO-lite skating game has struggled to keep players around and news of a <a href="https://kotaku.com/skate-4-grom-paywall-location-new-map-island-2000671466">new paid map expansion hasn’t helped win back frustrated fans.</a> The game’s third season launches March 10.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Prediction Markets Need Insider Trading, Despite What They Say]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/kalshi-mrbeast-insider-trading/</link>
            <guid>1446403</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>An editor for MrBeast was suspended from Kalshi and reported to the feds for insider trading, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2026/02/25/nx-s1-5726050/kalshi-insider-trading-enforcement-actions?ref=aftermath.site"><u>NPR</u></a> reported Wednesday. According to NPR, Artem Kaptur “traded around $4,000 on markets related to” the popular streamer, and that “Kaptur had ‘near-perfect trading success’ on bets about the YouTuber's videos with low odds, making the wagers appear suspicious.” Let me be the first to say: lmao, what did you think would happen.</p><p>Kaptur was reportedly barred from withdrawing his winnings, fined $20k, and reported to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. In a statement to NPR, a spokesperson for Beast Industries, James “MrBeast” Donaldson’s company, said the company has “a longstanding policy in place against employees using proprietary company information” and that employees are not allowed to bet on markets relating to MrBeast.</p><p>According to NPR, this marks “the first time [Kalshi] has publicly revealed the results of an investigation into market manipulation,” though “Kalshi says in the past year it has opened 200 investigations into insider trading, 12 of which are still ongoing.”&nbsp;</p><p>Insider trading isn’t allowed on Kalshi or similar prediction market Polymarket, but this rule seems to fly in direct contrast to these companies’ promotions of themselves as sources of legitimate data. Prediction markets have been getting in bed with <a href="https://aftermath.site/journalism-prediction-markets/"><u>news outlets</u></a> lately, most recently with Polymarket’s increased involvement with Substack, in which it wrote in an <a href="https://news.polymarket.com/p/polymarket-is-doubling-down-on-substack?ref=aftermath.site"><u>announcement</u></a> that “data produced on our exchange has value for everyone on earth, especially for news readers who might never make a single trade.” This quote has been haunting me since I read it last week: what news or informational value is there in a bunch of <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/2025/12/prediction-markets-and-the-suckerifcation-crisis-with-max-read/685330/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>manosphere-pilled</u></a> randos betting on what might happen <em>except</em> through <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/ng-interactive/2026/jan/30/polymarket-prediction-markets-betting?ref=aftermath.site"><u>insider trading</u></a>? The only thing that makes any of this “data” in a journalistic sense is if people placing bets have some unique insight into the outcome; otherwise it’s just vibes. Several high-profile instances of suspicious bets have already emerged from these markets: a <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/a-400000-payout-after-maduros-capture-put-prediction-markets-in-the-spotlight-heres-how-they-work?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Polymarket user won $400k</u></a> on a bet related to Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro, and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2026/02/12/nx-s1-5712801/polymarket-bets-traders-israel-military?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Israeli authorities have arrested and charged several people</u></a> on suspicion of betting on military operations.</p><p>Betting on MrBeast’s subscriber numbers or what he might say in an upcoming video, as NPR describes the market around the YouTuber, is far less consequential than international military moves. But it’s precisely these kinds of low-stakes situations that are <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-game-awards-2025-polymarket-kalshi-gambling/"><u>the lifeblood of these prediction markets</u></a>, and that are ripe for insider trading. At <a href="https://www.theverge.com/business/881967/polymarket-kalshi-journalism-sponsorship-ad?ref=aftermath.site"><u>The Verge</u></a>, Elizabeth Lopatto called them “pseudo-events… planned events that can be repeated, such as awards shows, press conferences, political conventions, and earnings calls.” They’re minor and, to some extent, predictable in their flow, and scores of everyday people are involved in their planning, production, and rollout. That makes them the perfect place for both outsiders and insiders to seize a chance to make a quick buck.</p><p>In December, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/coinbase-ceo-earnings-call-words-prediction-markets-bets-2025-12?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong rattled off a list of words</u></a> Polymarket users had bets that he would say at the end of an earnings call. He claimed he was “just having a little bit of fun” and that he didn’t bet on the outcome himself, but the situation perfectly highlights the insider trading risk of these markets, especially surrounding minor events that can be pre-planned and manipulated. Armstrong himself even gets it, noting in a conversation with a nominee to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission&nbsp; that "You actually want insider trading [on these markets]... You want [someone]... who has really good information to be trading so you get better, higher quality signal out of them, right? Now, if you want to preserve the integrity of those markets, maybe you don't want insider trading, right?"&nbsp;</p><p>But Polymarket and Kalshi can’t have both “higher quality signal” and “integrity.” Unlike regular gambling, where bettors wager against the house, prediction markets make their money off transaction fees. So they need a high volume of transactions; they need people betting on everything and anything, the novelty of bets that are basically glorified shitposts to get people into their apps. They need those big, headline-making payouts to attract people to the service with the promise of cashing out, the kinds of wins only an insider trader can achieve. They need the idea that bettors have unique knowledge to make their markets seem valuable to people <em>not </em>placing bets, to get investments and news outlet money and for what happens in their markets to show up on TV–but they <em>also </em>need the whole thing to seem fair. Their quest to paint themselves as legitimate sources of information <em>needs</em> people like Kaptur and other insider traders, as much as the companies might make a show otherwise.</p><p>And the insider traders need this too. Lopatto writes that insider trading&nbsp;</p><blockquote>doesn’t matter much to the purveyors of gambling-addiction-as-a-service; because contracts are peer-to-peer, the house isn’t getting ripped off. It’s only the punters dumb enough to enter the bet without insider information who’ll lose their shirts…&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>For the insiders to make their money, there must be a steady supply of suckers. And there is! Only about a third of traders actually make profits, and “a large number of traders systematically lose money to a small minority of skilled participants.”</blockquote><p>If these markets are going to embrace nihilism, financializing everything to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/aliciapark/2025/12/02/how-kalshis-luana-lopes-lara-cofounder-went-from-professional-ballerina-to-worlds-youngest-self-made-woman-billionaire/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>turn their owners</u></a> into <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/aliciapark/2025/11/29/inside-the-deal-that-made-polymarkets-founder-one-of-the-youngest-billionaires-on-earth/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>billionaires</u></a>, they have no incentive for “deterring and finding the bad actors, manipulators, and those who willingly cheat,” as Kalshi head of enforcement Robert DeNault told NPR. The whole system is manipulators and bad actors–not just insider traders, but the markets themselves, luring people into their apps with the false promise of an easy payday. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[A Privacy Policy Change has Genshin Impact Players Concerned Their Voice Chat Data was Used to Train AI Models, Unless They Opted Out]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/hoyoverse-added-clause-to-genshin-impacts-privacy-policy-train-ai-model-on-players-voice-chat/</link>
            <guid>1446391</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>With <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/ai/">Generative AI (GenAI)</a></strong> remaining the most controversial topic in the video game industry, any mention of GenAI or AI in general is making the hair on players' arms stand up. The latest occurrence of this comes from <strong>Genshin Impact</strong> players looking a little more closely at <strong>Hoyoverse's</strong> recent updates to the popular free-to-play game's Privacy Policy, which appears to have indicated that unless players opt-out, Hoyoverse will collect players' <strong>in-game voice chat data</strong> to train an internal AI model.</p>



<p>Initially spotted on a now-removed Reddit post, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cevian.bsky.social/post/3mfnpxo44xc2u">Bluesky user Cevian</a> shared a change to Genshin Impact's privacy policy that was made as recently as <a href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/company/privacy"><strong>January 14, 2026</strong>.</a> The change specifically referred to a clause from Section 1, subsection XVIII, being removed, which read, "<em>Where applicable, our services may offer voice-based chat functions that allow users to communicate with others in real time using voice. If you choose to use such features, <strong>we may process voice communication data</strong> for the purposes described in Section 2 and Section 13 of this Privacy Policy, including providing communication services, maintaining service security and stability, content moderation, and complying with applicable laws and regulations.</em>"</p>



<p>Now, with the above section removed, Section 2 of the Privacy Policy, titled "<em>Why We Collect and Process Your Personal Data</em>," simply reads:</p>



<p>"<em><strong>Like many AI-powered experiences, we may use your user-generated input such as chat data to train and improve the model that we use to provide our Services. You can opt-out of model training anytime in your Service-related settings. Opting out will not affect your existing gameplay.</strong></em>"</p>



<p>It's worth noting that the now-removed subsection XVIII statement is referring to Hoyoverse using the data it collects for things like improving its customer support and its moderation efforts. Essentially, there's no indication that Hoyoverse is using this data to train an internal GenAI model, which appears to be part of the concern players had when this policy was first spotted.</p>



<p>We've reached out to Hoyoverse for a comment on the situation, and despite the fact that it doesn't appear to be the case that Hoyoverse would be using this data for anything unsavory, the concern players have seems to mostly come from a feature like this being on by default, with users having to manually opt out.</p>



<p>That's what caused players to have issues with <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-training-gaming-copilot-ai-watching-you-play-games-unless-you-turn-it-off/"><strong>Microsoft's</strong> <strong>Copilot Gaming AI</strong></a>, which added an 'on-by-default' feature that initially appeared to be recording your gameplay to train Copilot. That wasn't <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-comments-gaming-copilot-ai-controversy/">exactly the case</a>, but the fact that it was on automatically, without players being sufficiently asked about it in the first place, is what caused the uproar around it. And it's worth betting that people would care more about their voices being recorded without their knowledge or proper consent, over some of their gameplay footage.</p>



<p>Hopefully, we'll have some word from Hoyoverse soon to properly explain the situation.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/electronic-arts/" id="52204">Electronic Arts </a>has unfortunately announced layoffs for the makers of Skate.</p>



<p>On February 25, 2026, <a href="https://www.ea.com/ea-studios/full-circle/news/an-update-from-fullcircle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Electronic Arts issued a statement </a>announcing that it is reshaping the studio behind Skate, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/full-circle/" id="96165">Full Circle</a>. In their statement, they announced that they are changing the team structure and “some roles will be impacted.” The company’s statement does not specify how widespread the restructuring will be or how many roles will be affected.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/skate/" id="352">Skate </a>launched in Early Access in September 2025.</p>



<p>The Full Circle statement, however, states that the decision is not a reflection on those affected and that they will support them through their transition.</p>



<p>“Our work on skate. continues. We look forward to working with you as we move faster, listen more closely, and deliver consistently for all of you. Our commitment to skate., and to the millions of players who believe in it, remains strong.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately, several studios have been making similar statements about layoffs and major restructurings lately. Riot Games recently severely <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-downsizing-2xko-team-focus-shifts-to-core-improvements/" id="175347">downsized to restructure the team around 2XKO</a>. Highguard’s development team was also<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Why-Highguard-Failed-Highguard-Layoffs-Explained-guide.jpg" id="176090"> heavily restructured</a> less than a month after the game’s release.</p>



<p>Ubisoft continues to make major changes and is restructuring its teams moving forward. Several game projects were canceled, including the much-anticipated remake of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. Learn more about those canceled projects <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/six-games-ubisoft-canceled/" id="176792">here</a>.</p>







<p>Microsoft Gaming and Xbox are also in the midst of a massive restructuring, following Phil Spencer’s retirement and Sarah Bond’s resignation. However, while there have been major changes to the Xbox executive team, no major in-house studio shakeups are planned.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Wrestler provided motion capture for the latest DLC.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">On March 17, Street Fighter 6 is getting a new DLC character: the pro wrestling-inspired Alex, and All Elite Wrestling's own Kenny Omega is the man behind the motion capture. At IGN Fan Fest 2026, he explained how the opportunity to do the motion capture actually came out of a simple misunderstanding. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When the news broke and they told me, we signed the NDAs and we know who the characters are and Alex will, in fact, be one of them. And they said, 'For you being such a good sport, it'd be cool if we put a move of yours in,' maybe one or two or a taunt or something," Omega told IGN. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I had said, 'Wow, that would be great. I just don't know when I could fit that into my schedule to do the mocap for it.' And they'd said, 'Oh, wait, you do the mocap for it?' I said, 'Yeah, is that what you were talking about, or no?' They said, 'Oh my, if you would do the mocap for it, that would be awesome.' And so a misunderstanding on my part is what led to me actually going to the studio and doing a slew of mocap for the character. If there was ever a better time to be stupid, that was one of them, because it worked out in my favor completely to not understand what they were talking about at that moment. So because of that one discussion, I got invited back to the next year's Tokyo Game Show. And then before doing the game show, I stopped over at Osaka, where they do the mocap for Capcom. And we hammered it out in one day. It was a grueling 10- or 11-hour shoot. I remember losing like 8 or 9 pounds of water weight, but it was so worth it and so fun." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">He also revealed that the developers were open to suggestions – he can see how his ideas were incorporated into the final game animations – and that wrestling without an audience wasn't as alien of an experience as people might expect. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think because of COVID, I got used to wrestling and performing in front of no one. It reminded me of being back into an empty arena and just having cameras all around me, but there's no sound. There's no adulation. There's no people. I see staff here and there, but it brought back memories of the COVID era, for sure."   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alex first appeared in 1997 Street Fighter III: New Generation in arcades. Early concept art shows the professional wrestler character was initially positioned as the new face of the franchise. In Street Fighter 6, his super moves include Raging Spear, Sledgecross Hammer, and The Final Prison. He also has an alternate level 2 super called the Omega Wing Buster, which is a sequence of moves inspired by Kenny Omega's own trio of signature moves, including the V-Trigger, Snap Dragon Suplex, and of course, the One Winged Angel. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is just the latest news from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ign-fan-fest-2026-how-to-watch-and-what-to-expect"><u>IGN's Fan Fest 2026</u></a> – check the schedule to see what else is coming and to keep up to date on all the latest from the worlds of games and entertainment.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rachel Weber is the Head of Editorial Development at IGN and an elder millennial.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Discord co-founder and chief technology officer Stanislav Vishnevskiy has announced the company is delaying the global rollout of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/discord-mandatory-age-verification-sensitive-content-teen-by-default">controversial age verification requirements</a>, admitting it "missed the mark".
</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, Discord revealed it would begin a "phased global rollout" of a new update in March that would give all new and existing users a "teen-appropriate experience" by default. Essentially, this meant many of the platform's features - including access to age-gated channels, servers, app commands, and "sensitive content" - would be heavily restricted unless users had been age verified. This, the company said at the time, would enable it to give "teens strong protections while allowing verified adults flexibility".
</p>
<p>
The outcry was swift, with some raising the spectre of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/discord-customer-service-system-breached-by-authorised-party-gaining-access-to-a-small-number-of-government-id-images">last year's Discord security breach</a>, which saw hackers successfully acquiring an unspecified number of users' personal data, including government IDs. And Discord has now acknowledged users concerns, pausing its rollout until a later date.
</p>
<p>
"The way this [announcement] landed," Vishnevskiy wrote in a <a href="https://discord.com/blog/getting-global-age-assurance-right-what-we-got-wrong-and-whats-changing">new blog post</a>, "many of you walked away thinking we're requiring face scans and ID uploads from everyone just to use Discord. That's not what's happening, but the fact that so many people believe it tells us we failed at our most basic job: clearly explaining what we're doing and why. That's on us. On top of that, many of you are worried that this is just another big tech company finding new ways to collect your personal data. That we're creating a problem to justify invasive solutions... But that's not what we're doing."
</p><p>
"We know many of you believe the right answer is not to do this at all. We hear you," Vishnevskiy continued. "We also know these changes carry different weight for different communities, and that for some, questions of privacy and identity aren't just preferences but safety concerns shaped by real experience. That's not lost on us, and it directly informs the choices we're making."
</p>
<p>
In an effort to offer clarity on Discord's previous announcement, Vishnevskiy says most users - even those wanting to access age-restricted content - will never need to submit video selfies for facial age estimation, or supply identification documents to Discord's vendor partners. Rather, the company's own internal systems will attempt to automatically determine a user's age, based on the time their account has existed, any payment method on file, the types of servers they're in, and general patterns of account activity.
</p>
<p>
Less than 10 percent of users, he claims, will need to undergo alternative age verification methods to access age-restricted content. This may be because Discord's systems can't confirm they're an adult or because local laws - such as those in the UK and Australia - explicitly require facial age estimation or ID checks. For those users needing to be verified by a third party, Vishnevskiy acknowledges there may be scepticism around "how we handle partnerships", particularly in light of last year's security breach. However, he insists Discord no longer works with the company involved in that incident and pledges to publish every verification vendor it works with - alongside their data handling practices - while also providing users with choices about the vendors they use.
</p>
<p>
This vendor transparency will be part of changes Discord is making to its global age verification rollout, which has now been delayed into the second half of this year. Vishnevskiy says the company won't work with vendors whose facial age estimation is not performed entirely on-device, and that alternative verification options, including credit card verification, will be added before rollout. Elsewhere, it's launching a new "spoiler" channel for servers that have previously utilised age-restricted channels as a way of separating users from non-adult topics they "may prefer to engage with on their own terms". It'll also publish a technical blog before rollout making it clear how its automatic age determination systems work, and will include information - on the number of users asked to age verify, the methods used, and how often Discord's automated systems handled verification - in its transparency reports. 
</p><p>
What it won't do, however, is halt the rollout entirely. As Vishnevskiy explains, "The number of teenagers on Discord has significantly increased since the pandemic, and they deserve an experience appropriate to their age. At the same time, we believe adults should be able to have a full content experience on Discord. Doing both responsibly means having safeguards that help ensure age-restricted content stays in adult spaces."
</p>
<p>
It's currently unclear how - or indeed if - the changes announced by Vishnevskiy will impact countries like the UK and Australia, which explicitly mandate facial age estimation or ID checks for adult content. Already, Discord has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/discord-advises-uk-users-that-they-may-be-part-of-an-experiment-where-instead-of-their-age-verification-data-never-leaving-their-phone-it-will-now-actually-leave-their-phone">generated a second wave of controversy</a> in the UK after it launched an "experiment" that would see age verification data leaving users' phones, despite previously stating otherwise. There's been additional concern over Discord's decision to use Persona as the vending partner for its "experiment". Persona has funding ties with Peter Thiel, whose data and surveillance company Palantir is currently used by US federal agencies, <a href="https://www.404media.co/elite-the-palantir-app-ice-uses-to-find-neighborhoods-to-raid/">including ICE</a>.

			<p>Last year, <strong>EA</strong> brought back one of its most beloved franchises from the seventh generation of consoles with the return of <strong>Skate</strong>. It was absolutely not the <strong>Skate 4</strong> that fans of the series had hoped they might get one day. It was EA's attempt at turning the franchise into a live service game that could churn out cash for the publisher, and despite it being the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/top-3-best-selling-aaa-pc-console-games-all-ea-games-battlefield-6-ea-fc-25-ea-fc-26/">most-downloaded free-to-play PC and console game</a></strong> in 2025 according to a new Sensor Tower report, less than six months from its launch, developer <strong>Full Circle</strong> has been impacted by <strong>layoffs</strong>.</p>



<p>A statement from the studio on its <a href="https://www.ea.com/ea-studios/full-circle/news/an-update-from-fullcircle">official website</a> announced the cuts, though in the standard style of these kinds of announcements, it does not specify how many developers were impacted or provide any real clarity behind the decision to make these cuts. </p>



<p>"<em>Since launching Early Access in September, tens of millions of you have stepped into San Vansterdam</em>," the statement begins. "<em>Your passion, creativity, and feedback have reinforced our belief in what skate. can become. As skate. continues to evolve, we’re transforming as a studio. We’re reshaping Full Circle to better support skate.’s long-term future and focus the team on the things that matter most to you - and making those things great</em>."</p>



<p>"<em><strong>These shifts mean making changes to our team structure, and some roles will be impacted.</strong> The teammates affected are talented colleagues and friends who helped build the foundation of skate. Their creativity and dedication are deeply ingrained in what players experience today. This decision is not a reflection of their impact and we’re committed to supporting them through this transition.</em>"</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>EA was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-spent-most-on-ads-2025-ea-biggest-publisher-game-downloads-pc-console-ps5-xbox-steam/">biggest publisher by game downloads in the PC and console space last year</a>. It had all three of the top-selling AAA PC and console games in its portfolio, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/"><strong>Battlefield 6</strong> </a>ahead of everything else in a year when shooters and action games were the most popular genres. </p>



<p>While it's always a bit mind-boggling to see major publishers lay off developers while they're having a strong commercial year, one likely factor in this instance of it is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-shareholders-officially-approved-55bn-sale-to-saudi-arabia-pif-silver-lake/">not-yet-official <strong>buyout of EA</strong> by the <strong>Saudi Arabia PIF</strong> and <strong>Silver Lake</strong></a>. The <strong>$20B</strong> of debt EA will take on as part of the deal, should it go through, has been identified by several analysts as <a href="https://wccftech.com/20-billion-debt-ticking-time-bomb-ea-studios-says-analyst/">a "<em>ticking time bomb</em>" for layoffs</a>, and this could just be the first of many to come from EA this year in preparation and anticipation of the deal going through.</p>



<p>Which is not yet a guarantee, as it still has to get approval from several global regulatory bodies, including the US's <strong>FTC</strong>. Members of Congress in the States have <a href="https://wccftech.com/46-congress-members-express-serious-concerns-over-ea-saudi-arabia-buyout-ftc/">already petitioned the FTC to take extra care when scrutinizing this deal,</a> and it'll be interesting to see whether the FTC tries to fight it like it did <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-us-federal-trade-commission-v-microsoft-over-the-activision-blizzard-deal-has-come-to-an-end-the-ftc-officially-drops-the-case/">Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard.</a></strong></p>

            <title><![CDATA[“Reactive Medieval Fantasy World” Valorborn From Laps Games Arrives in Early Access in April 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/valorborn-release-date-early-access-medieval-fantasy-rpg-laps-games/</link>
            <guid>1446334</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Valorborn</strong>, the upcoming open-world sandbox RPG that developer <strong>Laps Games</strong> describes as a "<em>dangerous, reactive medieval fantasy world full of freedom, tension, and possibility</em>," officially has an early access release date. It'll arrive on PC first through Steam, and it'll be out in early access on <strong>April 15, 2026.</strong> </p>



<p>Sim and city-building fans may already recognize Laps Games as the developer behind <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1981570/Land_of_the_Vikings/">Land of the Vikings</a></strong>, the 2023 strategy city-building sim that lets you create intricate Viking colonies and challenges you to lead your people through difficult winters, military expeditions, all while managing resources so your colony can thrive instead of just getting by.</p>



<p>Valorborn zooms its focus in on your individual character rather than an entire colony, with emergent storytelling that evolves depending on where you choose to explore. It's a world that'll continue to grow and evolve with or without you, with villagers in their routines, different factions constantly vying for power on their own clock, and a shifting world that may seem safe when you leave it only for its most dangerous elements to be right on your doorstep when you return.</p>



<p>When it arrives in early access, you'll be able to start your journey in <strong>Thareon</strong>, the first major kingdom you'll be able to explore. Thareon is one of several kingdoms that were part of the <strong>Allarion Empire</strong>, with your journey kicking off just after the fall of the Allarion Empire. More kingdoms within the fallen empire will be made available as the game continues to grow and develop, and each will bring its own unique quirks and customs, like how the worst crime you can commit in Thareon is practicing magic. A significant contradiction to the fact that magic was once a significant part of Allarion, and remains a significant force in the world.</p>



<p>Because Valorborn is a game that moves on even when you're not playing, with you driving your own path, one of its more significant elements is <strong>permadeath</strong>. Laps Games calls it a <strong>core feature</strong> in the game's design, forcing you to think very carefully about how you move through the world, whether you've chosen to be a sword-for-hire, a thief, a hunter, a lone traveler or a member of a larger party.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>Valorborn</em>&nbsp;is an ambitious project for us, and it was made possible by the support we received for&nbsp;<em>Land of the Vikings</em>," said Laps Games founder <strong>Onurhan Akçay,</strong> in a press release. "<em>That support gave us the foundation to build something bigger and more systemic. With&nbsp;Valorborn</em>, <em>we wanted to create a world where players can truly choose their own path and write their own stories. A lot of our inspiration comes from games like&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/mount-and-blade-ii-bannerlord-war-sails-qa-interview-with-taleworlds-entertainment/">Mount &amp; Blade</a>,&nbsp;Wartales, and&nbsp;Kenshi, and from worlds like&nbsp;Game of Thrones&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-game-studios-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-cancelled-again-amidst-mass-layoffs/">The Lord</a> <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-game-studios-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-cancelled-again-amidst-mass-layoffs/">of the Rings</a>. Those inspirations helped shape the kind of experience we wanted to make, a dangerous, reactive medieval fantasy world full of freedom, tension, and possibility.</em>"</p>

<p>Laps Games also says that <em>Valorborn</em>'s world will be fully realized, which means that "every building, cave, and point of interest is fully enterable" and there will be "no fake doors or decorative entrances".</p><p>You'll be able to choose on what level you want to engage with <em>Valorborn</em>. Will you be a sellsword, fighting off threats for coin? Perhaps you'll take the role of a hunter, living off the land and eschewing the benefits of civilization.</p><p>Whatever you choose to be, you'll be able to take on <em>Valorborn </em>alone or assemble a party to experience the game's world with you. Bear in mind, though, that this is very much a single-player project, so you won't be able to play alongside your friends.</p><p>According to Laps Games, permadeath will be "a core part of the experience" in <em>Valorborn</em>, but setbacks are intended to be "part of each player's story rather than a dead end".</p>
<p>Over the course of <em>Valorborn</em>'s time in Early Access, you can expect more kingdoms to explore, more starting options for new journeys, and "more ways for adventurers to define their own origin".</p><p><em>Valorborn </em>arrives on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3372530/Valorborn/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on April 15th.

              <p>Another AA publisher is hanging on for dear life. Amazon continues to flee AAA gaming like it didn’t just make $77 billion in net income last year. And a $20 million fine on Reddit shows why the scourge of online age-verification requirements has become such a messy fight. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture. Were you waiting for the right time to check out <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>? It was a lot of fun and <a href="https://x.com/TeamNINJAStudio/status/2026688643667214432">is about to get new DLC</a>.</p> <p>I’m still trying to read the finely crumbled tea leaves in the new CEO of Xbox’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/asha-sharma-xbox-future-plans-roadmap-2000673378">first big interview since taking over</a>. She promises AI won’t displace creativity and that nothing is off the table in terms of a rethink. But she’s also waiting to complete a listening tour before deciding what to change. Matt Booty, meanwhile, promises first-party development remains a key pillar of Microsoft Gaming, including small indie games like Double Fine’s <em>Keeper</em>. Only one thing is for certain: Xbox’s Major Nelson is <a href="https://x.com/majornelson/status/2026423036908618209">ready to report back for duty</a>.</p>

 <h2>Nacon has some overdue bills</h2> <p>The French publisher announced it doesn’t currently have enough cash to pay its debts, leading it to file for insolvency, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nacon-files-for-insolvency-says-its-assessing-all-possible-solutions-to-continue-running/"><em>VGC</em> reports</a>. It says the “procedure will enable the company to continue its business, renegotiate its debts, and develop a credible and effective continuation plan.” It recently released the underwhelming <i>Styx: Blades of Greed</i> and is preparing for the launch of the troubled RPG sequel <em>Greedfall 2</em> in March.</p> <p>Last year it published <em>Hell Is Us</em>, a grim but novel Soulslike that received a fair amount of praise but not much wider attention. It follows an AWOL military operative searching for his family in a war-torn country infested with supernatural beings. Unlike most modern games, it eschewed clear objectives and quest markers, which some found refreshing and others found tedious.</p>

 <p>Nacon was also set to publish <i>Terminator: Survivors</i> last year but the game was unexpectedly delayed indefinitely. The survival shooter also dropped its plans for Early Access and multiplayer co-op.</p> <h2>Amazon abandon’s <em>Forza Horizon</em> director’s new open-world game</h2> <p>UK developer Maverick Games is no longer working with Amazon, <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/amazon-abandons-its-open-world-driving"><em>The Game Business</em> reports</a>. The studio was cofounded in 2022 by former <em>Forza Horizon</em> creative director Mike Brown to make a AAA narrative-led game, with the tech giant signed on to publish. It’s unclear what will happen if the team doesn’t find a new partner. “Development of our debut title continues to progress as strongly as planned,” Maverick Games said. “We’re in active dialogue with partners who share our long-term ambition for the IP and look forward to sharing more later this year.”</p>

 <h2>Xbox cloud gaming gets an upgrade on console</h2> <p>“We’re now rolling out up to 1440p, higher bitrate streaming for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members, delivering sharper visuals and more responsive gameplay across supported titles and regions,” reads a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/02/25/february-xbox-update-1440p-streaming-rog-xbox-ally-updates-and-more/">new post on Xbox Wire</a>. A bunch of updates have also been rolled out to the Xbox PC gaming app to make navigation feel more responsive.</p> <h2><em>Magic: The Gathering</em> lawsuit gets dismissed</h2> <p>Filed earlier this year, it accused Hasbro executives of misleading investors about the sustainability of the card game’s profits and alleged that overprinting was happening despite the known harm it would do to the brand. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/mtg-hasbro-2026-lawsuit-magic-card-overproduction/"><em>Polygon</em> reports</a> it was voluntarily withdrawn while another shareholder lawsuit continues. Hasbro previously said the claims had no merit.</p>

 <h2>Reddit gets fined nearly $20 million over child privacy issues</h2> <p>UK regulators said the company shirked its responsibility to know which of its users were 13 or younger and handle any personal information collected accordingly (via <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyx0xggepjo">the <em>BBC</em></a>). It’s one of the regulatory pressures leading companies like Reddit, Discord, and others to implement AI age checks which are in turn making users mad. “The ICO’s insistence that we collect more private information on every UK user is counterintuitive and at odds with our strong belief in our users’ online privacy and safety,” a spokesperson for Reddit said. The company will appeal the ruling.</p> <h2>20 years later, modders are still trying to “fix” <em>Morrowind</em></h2> <p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/02/inside-the-quixotic-team-trying-to-build-an-entire-world-in-a-20-year-old-game/">A great new feature at <em>Ars Technica</em></a> details the long-running efforts of <em>Elder Scrolls</em> fans to make <em>Morrowind</em>‘s world feel as vast as that of its predecessor, <em>Daggerfall</em>. The result is multiple groups of modders spanning decades working together to try and piece together all of Tamriel in the 2002 PC game.</p> <p>“We have some really wonderful people who are the old guard that feel like they are the comfortable welders, and they’re all very wise,” college-age modder Meadhainnigh said. “But even in the newest editions, we’re not here because we think that it’s all going to be done within our lifetimes. We like to joke about 2090 and about raising our children to work on the project. We just like to look at the next release, and that tends to be exciting enough to get us going.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/charity-steam-pc-games-bundle-best-deal-2026-fps-cultic-selaco-boltgun-2000673339">This boomer shooter bundle for charity is the best gaming deal of the week</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/tokyo-scramble-switch-2-worst-game-2026-2000673341">A new worst game of 2026 has arrive and it’s a Switch 2 exclusive&nbsp;</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-delays-controversial-age-verification-requirements-2000673309">Discord delays its age-verification rollout but blames the backlash on people misunderstanding the details</a></strong></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>
