		<p>Grizzly Games has confirmed that its minimalist strategy game Thronefall will be leaving Early Access on October 11th, and that it will be released on Nintendo Switch the same day. The full release of Thronefall includes new levels, taking the total to 10, new hero units balanced by new enemies, weapons, and perks.</p>

<p><em>“We’re so grateful for the attention&nbsp;Thronefall&nbsp;has gotten since we launched into Steam Access. The reception has been far beyond anything we had imagined,”</em> says Jonas Tyroller. <em>“With the most recent editions and the Nintendo Switch launch, we hope there’s something in it for everyone to enjoy and brings the game to more people; from the kid who’s playing their very first strategy game to the veteran who simply doesn’t have time to sink hundreds of hours into learning how to play something new..”</em></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/08/03/thronefall-review/">Thronefall Review</a></h2>
<p>Since its Early Access launch, Thronefall has sold nearly a million copies, been wishlisted over 550,000 times, and received a lot of positive reviews. I played the early access release of Thronefall last year, and in my early access review, I said, <em>“Thronefall may be a minimalist strategy title, but it is big in heart and has a lot of depth to it. It is a game that is simple to play, but will challenge you at every turn. It is incredibly tough to put Thronefall down as it has that one more turn feel down to a tee. The challenge will be offputting for some, and there is a possible bug of enemies running around a wall, but other than that Thronefall is worth your time.”</em></p>

<p>In our Metaphor: ReFantazio preview, Dom said, <em>“A mouthful in all senses, Metaphor: ReFantazio, an original IP from Studio Zero – a team made up of Persona veterans – continues to stretch the word soup of game names to its limit. But what does it mean? Well, just like part of its namesake, it’s an idea, a comparison, and an image that is designed to take your mind to unexpected places. This becomes even more clear when you actually play it, with Metaphor: ReFantazio drawing on the grotesque and off-kilter ideas of the Persona franchise and spinning them out into an all-new RPG experience…Our hands on gave us a massive taste of the world that Studio Zero are building, and it looks utterly fantastic across the board. Persona fans, or those seeking this year’s freshest RPG experience, should be salivating at the prospect.”</em></p>

<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio will be releasing October 11th for PC, PS5, PS4, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <p>
The AssCreed faithful have waited a thousand years for a sequel set in feudal Japan, birthplace of ninjas and samurai. Woe unto ye dreamers of Ubisoft takes on Tenchu, for you must carry that candle for a little longer. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> has been delayed till next year. It was due to launch on 12th November 2024 - now, it will release on 14th February 2025.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The news comes in the shape of <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/09/25/2953181/0/en/Ubisoft-updates-its-financial-targets-for-FY2024-25.html">an updating of Ubisoft's targets</a> for the financial year 2024-2025, primarily in response to the "softer than expected launch for Star Wars Outlaws". According to Uncle Ubi, Assassin's Creed Shadows is "feature complete", but needs more time in the oven to avoid a similarly dismal showing.
</p>
<p>
"While the game is feature complete, the learnings from the Star Wars Outlaws release led us to provide additional time to further polish the title," the statement reads. "This will enable the biggest entry in the franchise to fully deliver on its ambition, notably by fulfilling the promise of our dual protagonist adventure, with Naoe and Yasuke bringing two very different gameplay styles."
</p>
<p>
In news that will delight the ears of people who think live service expansion roadmaps are the Devil's downloadables, Ubisoft are also "departing from the traditional Season Pass model", though players who preorder the game will be granted the first expansion for free. Shadows will also now "mark the return of our new releases on Steam Day 1" - it'll launch there rather than being exclusive at first on Ubisoft's own storefront. Makes sense - I'm pretty sure Steam has a larger audience than Ubisoft's own store, given that I'd forgotten they had one.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft haven't washed their hands of Outlaws just yet. They're going to update it extensively ahead of the Steam launch on 21st November. "In response to player feedback, Ubisoft's development teams are currently fully mobilized to swiftly implement a series of updates to polish and improve the player experience in order to engage a large audience during the holiday season to position Star Wars Outlaws as a strong long-term performer," reads the statement. The phrasing here puts me slightly in mind of British generals promising that WW1 will be over by Christmas, but I'm probably being unkind - I hear that Outlaws is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-outlaws-review">quite good</a>, for a star war.
</p>
<p>
The principal audience for these statements are the investors, of course, from whom Ubisoft have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-ubisoft-investor-wants-to-dethrone-ubisofts-founders-so-ubisoft-can-lay-more-developers-off">getting it in the neck</a> lately over their slumping share price and lower-than-hoped returns on blockbuster games. In some accompanying exec commentary, CEO Yves Guillemot acknowledges that "our second quarter performance fell short of our expectations" while promising a greater focus on "player-centric, gameplay-first approach and an unwavering commitment to the long-term value of our brands". He adds that "Open World Adventures and GaaS-native experiences" are Ubisoft's bread and butter. 
</p>
<p>
He also makes brief reference to the on-going, ermmm, discussion about the representational politics of Ubisoft's games. In case you missed it, Outlaw's choice of a female lead who doesn't look like an AI-hallucinated Jessica Rabbit has earned it the ire of certain internet misogynists, while Shadows is getting similarly dumped on by racists for having a Black samurai protagonist (if you dislike what you've seen of either game, please don't get mad at me in the comments - there are other reasons to dislike these games!). In keeping with time-honoured company exec practice, Guillemot deals with this by lifting his eyes to the skyline and benevolently refusing to agree with anybody at all.
</p>
<p>
"Finally, let me address some of the polarized comments around Ubisoft lately," he writes. "I want to reaffirm that we are an entertainment-first company, creating games for the broadest possible audience, and our goal is not to push any specific agenda. We remain committed to creating games for fans and players that everyone can enjoy."
</p>
<p>
I saw Assassin's Creed Shadows up close at Summer Games Fest, and it seemed fine as Assassin's Creeds go, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-is-actually-two-games-competing-for-your-affections">an unusually hearty ratio of stealth and melee</a>. But I can definitely wait till 2025. Delaying an open world blockbusters these days is like postponing a solar eclipse, granting smaller games with no established brand presence a chance to bask in the heat a little. Enjoy the breathing room, uhhhh [checks calendar] <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slitterhead">Slitterhead</a>!

Aoki also said that not including a disc drive in the box was aimed at giving players “choices.”</p><p> “For the disc drive, it is an option for players,” he told<em> IGN</em>. “Not all players have discs, even though most players may...but we have the option for being able to add that for those players.

<p>Ubisoft had quite a few announcements today regarding Assassin’s Creed Shadows. Not only were fans informed that the upcoming RPG will be delayed until February 2025 (three months), but the company also released that they will be departing from the traditional Season Pass model.</p>



<p>So, what does this mean exactly?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-to-depart-with-traditional-season-pass-model">Assassin’s Creed to Depart with Traditional Season Pass Model</h2>



<p>In a recent announcement, Ubisoft announced that the new Assassin’s Creed Shadows will depart from the traditional Season Pass model. </p>



<p>Originally, the Season Pass was set to allow gamers who purchased it to play a bonus quest available at launch and then have access to two later expansions. While the Season Pass will still be there, fans who purchase the game on launch will be able to enjoy it in its entirety, regardless of whether they have the Season Pass or not.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The company also announced that those who preorder the game will have access to the first expansion once released, regardless if they have the Season Pass. The game will also mark the return of Ubisoft’s new releases on Steam Day 1.</p>



<p>As of now, however, this is all the information released about what Ubisoft means when saying they will be departing from the traditional Season Pass model. More could be announced as time goes on.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-when-will-the-game-be-released">When Will the Game be Released?</h2>



<p>So, when does Assassin’s Creed Shadows actually release? Well, with the new pushback, the game has been delayed to February 14, 2025. The game was set to originally release this November, meaning it is being delayed an entire three months.</p>



<p>Hopefully, this delay allows Ubisoft to polish the game and release one of the best Assassin’s Creed games of all time. Only time will tell, though.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/how-dragon-age-the-veilguard-grapples-with-the-series-wildly-expansive-lore-and-your-choices-in-it<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Somewhat famously, the fourth game in the Dragon Age series has gone through <em>a lot </em>of changes in the ten years since Dragon Age: Inquisition. What’s now known as Dragon Age: The Veilguard began development in 2015 and in that time, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-past-and-present-of-dragon-age-4-1833913351" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>reports emerged</u></a> of Dragon Age 4 going the live-service route, with a heavy multiplayer component.</p><p>The eventual confirmation that EA would let <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-25/electronic-arts-pivots-on-dragon-age-game-removes-multiplayer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>BioWare go full single-player with Dragon Age 4</u></a>, keeping with the series’ history, led to a major sigh of relief from many fans. And when I got my hands on the game last month for our IGN First coverage (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-exclusive-first-hands-on-preview"><u>read my full preview here</u></a>), I struggled to catch any whiffs of its multiplayer past in the gameplay, so I can only imagine the overhaul that was done behind the scenes.</p><p>But, interestingly, there was one thing that Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s creative director, John Epler, tells me never changed throughout the near-decade of development: “There was never a version of the story of Dragon Age 4 where Solas was not at the center,” he says. Basically, if you were worried that the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-dreadwolf-dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay"><u>name change from Dragon Age: Dreadwolf</u></a> to The Veilguard would mean we’re not focused on Solas, think again.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Solas, of course, was once the companion to the player character, the Inquisitor, in Dragon Age: Inquisition. A mild-mannered, mysterious apostate, Solas (<strong>Spoiler warning for Dragon Age: Inquisition</strong>) disappeared at the end of the base game, only for a massive reveal at the end of the Trespasser DLC: Solas is actually the elven god known as Fen'harel, or the Dread Wolf, and he has plans to tear down what’s known as The Veil in order to restore the world of the ancient elves. Doing so will destroy the world of Thedas as we know it, essentially making your once-friend (or even romantic interest) the new big bad.</p><p>The “bones” of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, Epler explains, were always going to come from where that story was left in Trespasser.</p><p>“When we ended Trespasser, we felt that we were making a promise, a commitment to our fans of, ‘This is the story we're going to tell. This is where we want to go with it,’” Epler says. “There were different versions of the story. There were versions of the story where maybe you didn't necessarily progress as far in your fight against Solas, but Solas has always been at the center of Dragon Age 4’s story.”</p><p>That much was evident in my own time with the game. When The Veilguard picks up, the customizable player character, Rook, has been recruited by Dragon Age series mainstay Varric to help stop Solas’ ritual. After Rook foils Solas’ plan (and accidentally frees two blighted elven gods in the process,<em> whoopsie</em>), the two have a heated confrontation, and it quickly becomes clear that Rook will have their own unique relationship with Solas, as the Inquisitor did before them.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“I think what's been fun for us, too, is trying to build Rook as kind of almost a mirror of Solas."</p></div><p>“Rook does get in Solas' way and now there's a connection between the two of them,” Epler says. “I think what's been fun for us, too, is trying to build Rook as kind of almost a mirror of Solas because that gives us a lot of opportunities to build some interesting interactions and reactions between the two of them.”</p><p>It’ll also give us ample opportunity to learn more about Solas. As has already been revealed in IGN First’s coverage and other previews, players will even get to see some of Solas’ memories firsthand.</p><p>“Solas wasn't always the character he is now. Thousands of years ago, he was a rebel,” Epler says. “He was the kind of person who stood up for the little guy. He still has a tremendous love for spirits who he sees as these beings that are being unfairly treated, unfairly maligned. So Rook became this character that we could explore some aspects of Solas' personality but also give you a protagonist that, because it's a BioWare game, you can shape to a large degree.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/24/da-ign-first-lore-illo-1-1727214231250.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Illustration by Julia Rago for IGN.</figcaption></figure></output><h2><strong>From the Inquisitor to Rook </strong></h2><p>The focus on Solas, the elven gods, and the connections to Dragon Age: Inquisition does bring up an interesting question: how will Dragon Age: The Veilguard ease in new players with its wildly expansive lore? The campaign starts with a surprisingly succinct and effective recap from Varric, but even as a longtime fan, I imagined it might be a lot for players new to the franchise (or even those who’ve forgotten some of the details after all these years).</p><p>It’s one of the advantages of having a relative outsider in Rook to lead the proceedings. Epler clarifies that, at this point, Rook has known Varric and Harding (a Scout from Inquisition who’s now a full-blown companion in The Veilguard) “for a little while.” But otherwise, Rook is something of a blank slate aside from the pre-written backstories that derive from one of six factions you can choose.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Dragon Age: The Veilguard - 15 Exclusive Screenshots Taken Using Photo Mode</h3></div></output><p>But Rook marked an intentional pivot from the Inquisitor in other ways, too. It’s hard to deny a heavy presence of the classic “chosen one” trope in Dragon Age: Inquisition, as your character is the only one with a mark on their hand that can save the world. The Inquisitor becomes a religious figure (whether they choose to embrace it or not), essentially heralded as a messiah while amassing a wealth of political power as leader of the Inquisition. </p><p>Epler says that the team wanted to avoid not a “power creep,” but something of a “reputation creep” when it comes to the protagonist of The Veilguard.</p><p>“At the end of Inquisition, you are the chosen one,” he says. “Eventually you shut down the Inquisition or you hand it over to the Chantry because, through this almost mythological hero-building that's come around you as a character, it's become too big and unwieldy. With Rook, we wanted to give you an opportunity to see things from a different perspective in the world, someone who has to kind of earn their place. There's nothing about Rook that somebody looks at and is like, ‘Well, I wasn't going to trust you, but you've got this magic hand or these documents.’ Rook has to earn the respect, has to earn the trust of these different groups in Thedas.”</p><p>All of that being said, it’s not as if the Inquisitor has <em>zero</em> role in the proceedings. On the contrary, game director Corinne Busche even <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-will-allow-you-to-import-your-choices-from-previous-games-through-the-character-creator"><u>confirmed to us months ago</u></a> that players will be able to recreate their Inquisitor in the character creator.</p><p>“Bringing the Inquisitor into The Veilguard was simultaneously one of the most challenging and, I think, one of the most rewarding things we've done,” Busche tells me. “And the reason I say ‘challenging’ is because Dragon Age: The Veilguard is now about 10 years on from the events of Inquisition and Dragon Age: Trespasser, and even still, the fanbase has such an affinity towards their Inquisitors, the fan art, their stories. There is a certain reverence there about the Inquisitor that was very important for us to capture.”</p><p>For all the reveals that have been made pre-release, however, Epler, Busche, and the rest of the team are especially tight-lipped about what the Inquisitor's actual role will be. It’s something I’ve been particularly curious about, especially as an unabashed Solas romancer (or a “Solavellan” as the fanbase calls it, a combination of Solas with an elven Inqusitor’s surname, Lavellan).</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"I'd say the Inquisitor, to some degree, feels guilty or responsible for what Solas is doing to the world."</p></div><p>Still, I tried. “You’re going to want to see for yourself,” Busche insists when I ask the question of how the Inquisitor will show up. </p><p>“But [they’ll have] some very interesting contributions, given their history, their relationship with Solas, which can be quite complicated as a Solavellan player,” she says. “And don't judge me too hard, but as a Solavellan player, you know how complex that relationship between the Inquisitor and Solas could be. That is something we needed to pay off, and I'm happy to say, I think we did.”</p><p>Epler also acknowledges that the Inquisitor “obviously has a very personal relationship with Solas,” one that will need to be reckoned with in The Veilguard.</p><p>“Whether you're Solavellan and you've romanced Solas, or even just any other Inquisitor, you journeyed with Solas for quite some time,” he says. “And I'd say the Inquisitor, to some degree, feels guilty or responsible for what Solas is doing to the world. So while we're not going to get too far into details about what role they may play, they absolutely are somebody who is going to be interested and invested in the outcome of Rook's journey in The Veilguard.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/24/da-ign-first-lore-illo-3-1727214261179.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Illustration by Julia Rago for IGN</figcaption></figure></output><h2><strong>Decisions, Decisions</strong></h2><p>The Inquisitor is also somewhat representative of yet another big challenge facing The Veilguard: not only does Dragon Age have incredibly expansive lore at this point, but the player could, in previous games, make massive decisions that would impact that lore. How is BioWare grappling with not only the various decisions Rook can make in The Veilguard, but also the decisions the player has <em>already made</em> in past games? </p><p>Inquisition had The Keep, where players could import their saves from Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age II to carry over their world states. The Veilguard, meanwhile, will allow players to select a few story decisions via tarot cards in the "Adventurer's Past" section of the character creator, where you can remake your Inquisitor. Those decisions are: who your Inquisitor romanced (with the options gender- and lineage-locked in the same way that they were in Inquisition), whether or not you disbanded the Inquisition, and whether you vowed to stop Solas or save him.</p><p>Granted, that might not seem like a ton of choices when it comes to a series like Dragon Age. There’s a couple of reasons for that: for one, the team focused on choices that they felt they could react to meaningfully – not just a cameo or one-liner. But it’s also part of the advantage of moving the setting up to Northern Thedas, Epler says, with the prior games in the series taking place in Southern Thedas, a significantly different region both geographically and sociopolitically.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>“Our philosophy when it comes to integrating past player choices and world states is wherever possible we want to avoid contradicting what has happened before. We never want to invalidate your choices,” he says. “For Dragon Age: The Veilguard, among many reasons why we moved to Northern Thedas is it becomes a little bit more of a clean slate for us. There's not as many decisions you have made up to this point that have an impact on what's happening in Northern Thedas. And we don't have to speak directly to things like who is the Divine? Because again, that's happening in the South.”</p><p>“There's never a sense of, ‘Oh, that decision doesn't exist.’ But maybe we don't touch on it in this particular title,” he says. “Much like Inquisition didn't touch on every decision from Origins, much like DA2 didn't touch on every decision from Origins, it's kind of in that same vein of we're not going to contradict it. We just may not always reference it directly.”</p><p>Epler reiterates previous statements both he and the rest of the BioWare team have made about there not being an “official canon” when it comes to player choice in Dragon Age. Those choices, he says, are a large part of what makes Dragon Age such a “personal story” for fans.</p><p>“We don't want to ever imply that a decision is the wrong decision or the right decision,” he says. “We might <em>joke </em>about things like, ‘Oh, you let The Chargers die? Well, that's clearly the wrong choice.’ But again, it's not because it's canon. We want those stories to be personal.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"For Dragon Age: The Veilguard, among many reasons why we moved to Northern Thedas is it becomes a little bit more of a clean slate for us."</p></div><p>Clearly, it’s a delicate balance. But “wherever possible,” Epler says, the goal is to avoid contradicting the players’ choices – even if that means some of those choices won’t be referred to in specifics. </p><p>But all this talk about lore, choice, and story leads to something of a question mark for Dragon Age at large: are we building to some sort of endgame? Regardless of whether or not The Veilguard does well enough to justify a fifth game, will there ever be a shortage of stories to tell within Thedas, even after the Solas of it all is dealt with?</p><p>In response to that question, Epler brings up what he says is one of his favorite quotes from Inquisition’s Trespasser DLC: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r-F3EGCY54" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an optional line for the Inquisitor</u></a>, in which they yell in frustration, “could one thing in this f*cking world just stay fixed?” </p><p>That line is somewhat indicative, he says, of the larger story of the series as a whole: “Dragon Age has always been a little bit less about a very specific threat and more about a world in conflict.”</p><p>‘That's kind of the story of Dragon Age,” he says. “Things don't stay fixed forever. Things break. Because Dragon Age is a story about people, there's always going to be somebody who wants more power, wants to change the world for what they see as a good reason but ultimately is going to harm people. So there's always going to be that sense of conflict.”</p><p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard releases on PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S on October 31.</em></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><em>Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.

These battles range from standard combat to those with somewhat unique victory conditions, allowing you to enjoy Triangle Strategy’s combat on an even deeper level. </p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Quest 2 and Quest 3 Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Triangle Strategy | Meta Quest Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q5Y7dKcwZnY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>A free demo for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metaphor-refantazio/" data-ref-id="5000-590950">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>, the new turn-based JRPG from the creators of Persona, is available now on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. Progress made in the demo will carry over to the full version of the game when it releases in October.</p><p dir="ltr">The demo lets players check out the prologue of the upcoming fantasy-RPG and can be played repeatedly if desired. Metaphor's opening moments see the fully voiced protagonist and their fairy companion Gallica traversing to the Royal Capital, only for their caravan to be attacked. The two then traverse the wastes outside the city on foot, with the goal of enlisting in the royal military in order to deliver an important message. This detour serves as the game's way of introducing players to how Metaphor's combat and exploration work.</p><p dir="ltr">Those who have played Persona will instantly recognize Metaphor's stylish menus and UI, and its turn-based combat will also look familiar, though there are some key differences. When facing more powerful enemies, the game features turn-based combat where players will look to exploit enemy weaknesses. For low-ranked cannon fodder, Metaphor will let players quickly defeat them in real-time combat. Rather than using Personas, characters instead channel various Archetype classes, with more than 40 to choose from.</p><p dir="ltr">In a recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-is-a-fantastical-politically-charged-adventure-that-i-dont-want-to-stop-playing/1100-6526308/" data-ref-id="1100-6526308">Metaphor: ReFantazio hands-on preview</a>, we said the greatest praise we could give Atlus' latest was that we didn't want to put it down, and were intrigued by the game's metanarrative choices and its implementation of Persona's various social-sim systems.</p><p dir="ltr">Metaphor: ReFantazio releases October 11, and will be available on Xbox Game Pass day one.</p>

            <p>
Ubisoft has announced a full return to Steam, with all its new releases set to launch day one on Valve's storefront starting with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> on 14th February next year.
</p>
<p>
Assassin' Creed: Shadows will be the first Ubisoft game to get a day one release on Steam since Starlink: Battle for Atlas all the way back in April 2019. Since then, the publisher has opted to launch its PC titles on its own storefront and the Epic Games Store.
</p>
<p>
In fact, for a long time, new Ubisoft titles weren't available on Steam at all, but that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-valhalla-headed-to-steam">changed in December 2022</a>, when <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-valhalla">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a> made the jump to Valve's platform - some two years after its initial release. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/anno-1800">Anno 1800</a> and Roller Champions followed, and the experiment was  seemingly a success; in the years since, the majority of new Ubisoft titles have been released on Steam, albeit trailing other digital stores by several months at least.

<p>
Now, though, as part of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">Assassin's Creed Shadows delay announcement</a>, the publisher has confirmed a change of strategy for its PC titles, revealing Shadow's 14th February launch will "mark the return of our new releases on Steam Day 1".
</p>
<p>
The news follows a challenging few years for Ubisoft, which officially adopted a strategy of "increased cautiousness" in 2023 amid <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-cancels-three-unannounced-games-delays-skull-and-bones-again">disappointing financial results</a> - an announcement that preceded numerous <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-free-to-play-shooter-the-division-heartland-cancelled-three-years-after-being-announced">cancellations</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-suffers-third-round-of-job-losses-this-year">job cuts</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-delays-rainbow-six-mobile-and-the-division-resurgence-beyond-march-2025">delays</a>. The last year has also seen Ubisoft's share price drop by over 50 percent to a near 10-year low, with a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/game-developer-ubisoft-slides-amid-muted-reception-star-wars-outlaws-2024-09-03/">recent report by Reuters</a> blaming poor sales of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-review">Star Wars Outlaws</a> and lack of interest in free-to-play shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tom-clancys-xdefiant">XDefiant</a> cited as key reasons for the slump.

The 2021 RPG is the latest entry in the <em>Tales of</em> series and a fantastic point of entry for newcomers. Like<em> </em>with a new <em>Final Fantasy</em>, you don’t need to know anything about past games and can just go in blind. <em>Tales of </em>games have a real-time combat system that puts you in a small arena with the enemy and your party, where you can execute commands to do damage. This can be a boring or downright messy system in some entries, but <em>Arise </em>brings a smoothness to the system that makes it a breeze. Dealing damage while also instructing your party to lay down support or trigger special synchronized attacks feels incredible, especially in the game’s climactic boss battles. The story, however, is where <em>Arise </em>really shines. It exemplifies the best of the series, bringing together an easy-to-love cast full of well-written characters who go on a whirlwind adventure to save the world. There’s classic fantasy, sci-fi, and lots of romance to enjoy.</p><figure id="" data-id="6f93e42a2addbdc70c51023a5e57de1e" data-recommend-id="image://6f93e42a2addbdc70c51023a5e57de1e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A samurai wields dual katanas against a giant spider" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A samurai wields dual katanas against a giant spider" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Koei Tecmo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6f93e42a2addbdc70c51023a5e57de1e" data-recommend-id="image://6f93e42a2addbdc70c51023a5e57de1e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A samurai wields dual katanas against a giant spider" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Meanwhile, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/sale/KOEITECMO2024&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/KOEITECMO2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Koei Tecmo is running a sale</a></span> of its own, which runs until October 7, and is the perfect place for Soulslike fans to pick up some gems.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-%E2%80%93-yves-guillemot%E2%80%99s-internal-memo-to-staff-amid-company-struggles.992025/</guid>

<p>Insider Gaming has received an internal memo from Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot that was sent to staff before today’s earnings call.</p>



<p>The memo includes announcing the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows delay</a> and the news that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-underperformed-ubisoft-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars Outlaws underperformed</a>.</p>



<p>The full memo reads,</p>



<hr>



<div><p>“Dear All, </p><p>We just issued a press release announcing our revised financial targets for the current fiscal year. </p><p>First, Star Wars Outlaws’ initial sales proved softer than expected, despite solid ratings from players that recognized the game’s faithful transcription of the original trilogy’s essence and richness: 76 on Metacritic, 3.85/5 on PS store, ~4/5 on Xbox and 4.4/5 on Epic. While players praise the sense of detail and the beauty of the graphics, the effectiveness of the reputation system, and endearing characters like Nix, some also noted areas of improvement. The development teams are already hard at work on this, focusing on save issues, stealth mechanics, more frequent quest checkpoints, and better NPC AI. I’m confident that these updates will significantly improve the player experience by allowing us to deliver on its promise, and make Star Wars Outlaws a must-play game and long-term seller. In parallel, the Publishing teams and developers are closely collaborating to increase the engagement with the game and boost player acquisition during Black Friday and the holiday season.</p><p>In today’s ultra-competitive market, players expect extraordinary experiences and ultra-polished games on Day 1. We need to continue to improve when it comes to fine-tuning our games and delivering outstanding gameplay. This is what will enable Ubisoft to again create the best games in the industry.</p></div>



<div><p>Consequently, we decided to delay Assassin’s Creed Shadows to February 14, 2025. The game is already playable and of high quality, and has all the features the team wanted to integrate into this ambitious experience. This unusual decision at such an advanced stage is motivated by our desire to offer an optimal experience from launch on all platforms and various PC configurations, and to remove the small frictions we typically used to address in post-launch title updates. We will also use the extra time to complement the experience with a few high-impact secondary quests that will bring even more memorable. </p><p>Additionally, as a result of listening to player feedback on other topics, our new releases, starting with Assassin’s Creed Shadows, will again be available on Steam on launch day, in addition to being available on first parties’, Epic’s and Ubisoft’s stores. Also, we are currently rethinking our Season Pass model for our upcoming games. For Assassin’s Creed Shadows, all players will have access to the game at the same time, and those who have pre-ordered the game will get the first expansion for free.</p></div>



<div><p>Beyond the first important short-term actions that I’ve outlined above, the company’s top management will focus on accelerating the improvement of our production, communication, and publishing practices and processes in close collaboration with all these teams, with the objective to put players at the heart of all our decisions. We will regularly update you on the progress we’re making. </p><p>Lastly, I’d like to address the recent polarized coverage around our creative choices. We are an entertainment company. As such, our objective is not to endorse any specific agenda. Our mission has always been to entertain players and enrich their lives with original and memorable experiences, that resonate with a global audience. </p><p>This setback should not discourage us but serve as a learning experience and drive us to act even more quickly. More than ever, let’s continue to believe in our ability to bounce back, while approaching the challenges we face with lucidity and determination. I would like to thank you for your commitment and to reiterate my confidence in our collective ability to surprise and meet the expectations of a growing number of passionate players in the long term. </p><p>Yves</p></div>

<p>It has been announced that Ubisoft’s Executive Committee and Board of Directors will launch an investigation and review of the company.</p>



<div><p>The news came via a company financial statement and update, which included the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delay of Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> and the announcement that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-underperformed-ubisoft-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars Outlaws underperformed</a>. The statement read,</p><p>“In the light of recent challenges, we acknowledge the need for greater efficiency while delighting players. As a result, beyond the first important short-term actions undertaken, the Executive Committee, under the supervision of the Board of Directors, is launching a review aimed at further improving our execution, notably in this player-centric approach, and accelerating our strategic path towards a higher performing model to the benefit of our stakeholders and shareholders.</p><p>Finally, let me address some of the polarized comments around Ubisoft lately. I want to reaffirm that we are an entertainment-first company, creating games for the broadest possible audience, and our goal is not to push any specific agenda. We remain committed to creating games for fans and players that everyone can enjoy.”</p></div>



<p>At the time of writing, Ubisoft stock has decreased to 11.42 euros and has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-stock-price-falling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drastically fallen these past few months</a>. Last month, Insider Gaming reported that&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers-2/">XDefiant was at risk of losing its much-needed post-launch support</a>&nbsp;after dwindling player numbers and following the release of a mild Star Wars: Outlaws launch,<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-stock-tanks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;Ubisoft’s stock price&nbsp;fell to a near 10-year low</a>.</p>



<p>Speaking with current and former Ubisoft employees, I am told that the move was inevitable and “the writing was on the wall,” as many Ubisoft studios have been struggling due to poor management. While I have reported on some of these issues in the past, Insider Gaming will have a more in-depth report in the coming days or weeks. </p>

                <p>Earlier this week, Ubisoft canceled a press event for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6523576/" data-ref-id="1100-6523576">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> with little explanation.

Instead, Assassin's Creed Shadows will now arrive on February 14, 2025.</p><p>Ubisoft's Marc-Alexis Côté--the Vice President Executive Producer of the Assassin's Creed franchise--made the announcement on social media that Assassin's Creed Shadows was delayed to give the developers more time to polish the game.

Star Wars Outlaws also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-sales-worse-than-expected-ubisoft-admits/1100-6526702/" data-ref-id="1100-6526702">launched with much softer sales</a> than Ubisoft expected, and the company clearly doesn't want Shadows to suffer the same fate.</p><p>As part of the announcement, Ubisoft also noted that Assassin's Creed Shadows will not be following the company's usual season pass model. Instead, anyone who preordered the game will get the first expansion for free, and all players will be able to jump into Assassin's Creed Shadows' recreation of feudal Japan on February 14. It will also be available on Steam at launch, which marks a shift in Ubisoft's recent business strategy.</p>

		<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows has been delayed to next year, Ubisoft has confirmed in a statement to investors, setting a new date for 14th February 2025.</p>
<p>There’s a bit of a sweetener to get people to pre-order <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, though, as buyers will all receive the first expansion for free, instead of having to buy into the Season Pass.</p>


<p>The delay follows on from an abrupt cancellation of Ubisoft’s Tokyo Game Show plans, and with the company under a bit of a cloud following the launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>.</p>
<p>“While the game is feature complete,” Ubisoft says, “the learnings from the Star Wars Outlaws release led us to provide additional time to further polish the title. This will enable the biggest entry in the franchise to fully deliver on its ambition, notably by fulfilling the promise of our dual protagonist adventure, with Naoe and Yasuke bringing two very different gameplay styles.”</p>
<p>CEO Yves Guillemot elaborated, “Our second quarter performance fell short of our expectations, prompting us to address this swiftly and firmly, with an even greater focus on a player-centric, gameplay-first approach and an unwavering commitment to the long-term value of our brands.”</p>

<p>I’m not entirely sure that a February launch is going to help them here. Assassin’s Creed Shadows will now be going up against <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/21/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview-kuttenberg-gameplay/">Kingdom Come Deliverance II</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/03/avowed-gets-new-release-date-of-february-18th-2025/">Avowed</a> just days on either side, and both of which had shifted from their own late 2024 release plans – Avowed specifically trying to avoid other big game launches, too.</p>
<p>It also feels like this is perhaps the seventh time in as many years that Ubisoft has recommitted itself to being more player-centric and meeting expectations better, so it’s not entirely clear how this will play out any differently. Taking more time to polish a game is still a positive, and Assassin’s Creed Shadows has potential to be a very popular game, thanks to the long-awaited Japanese setting. That said, the game has had a strange public perception ever since it was announced, thanks in no small part to featuring a black immigrant samurai as one of the two playable characters – something that Ubisoft has at times struggled to communicate well with fans and gamers around the world.</p>
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows takes us back to 16th century Japan during the Azuchi-Momoyama era, featuring a female ninja and a male samurai for its lead characters. That man is a historical character based off Yasuke, a man of African origin who was one of the rare immigrants to Japan and who served Oda Nobunaga.&nbsp;The female ninja is named Naoe from Iga Province, who is inducted into the local Assassin’s order to battle all those dastardly Templars.</p>
<p>Her story will be intertwined with that of Yasuke, letting you master complimentary playstyles as both characters have contrasting abilities – Naoe for stealth, Yasuke for direct combat. This will be a fresh take on the twin protagonists that we’ve seen on occasion through the Assassin’s Creed series.</p>

			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-pulls-out-of-tokyo-game-show-cancels-press-previews-of-assassins-creed-shadows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors</a> were true: Ubisoft has just <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1838971189722562906" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed</a> Assassin's Creed Shadows to February 14, 2025. The reason to do so was the softer-than-expected performance of Star Wars Outlaws, which contributed to a disappointing financial result in Ubisoft's second quarter (<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-stock-prices-drop-another-7-shareholders-concerned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following the stock price crash from a couple of weeks ago</a>).</p>
<p>Ubisoft aims to polish the game even further to avoid a similar issue, hence the delay. Furthermore, Assassin's Creed Shadows is abandoning the Season Pass model; the game will launch for everyone on the same day (instead of the early access launch of the more expensive editions), and pre-orders will enjoy the first expansion for free. Lastly, Assassin's Creed Shadows will be available on Steam on day one, marking a return to Valve's platform after Ubisoft had tried to sell its games via Ubisoft Connect and the Epic Games Store.</p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws will be the first game to make the jump. It is due to launch on Steam on November 21, and Ubisoft Massive is said to be at work on a series of updates to improve the player's experience and position the game as a 'long-term performer'.</p>
<p>Ubisoft CEO and Co-Founder Yves Guillemot commented on the Assassin's Creed Shadows and Star Wars Outlaws news with the following statement:</p>
<p><em>Our second quarter performance fell short of our expectations, prompting us to address this swiftly and firmly, with an even greater focus on a player-centric, gameplay-first approach and an unwavering commitment to the long-term value of our brands.</em><br>
<em>Although the tangible benefits of the Company’s transformation are taking longer than anticipated to materialize, we keep on our strategy, focusing on two key verticals – Open World Adventures and GaaS-native experiences – with the objective to drive growth, recurrence and robust free cash flow generation in our business.</em></p>
<p><em>In the light of recent challenges, we acknowledge the need for greater efficiency while delighting players. As a result, beyond the first important short-term actions undertaken, the Executive Committee, under the supervision of the Board of Directors, is launching a review aimed at further improving our execution, notably in this player-centric approach, and accelerating our strategic path towards a higher performing model to the benefit of our stakeholders and shareholders.</em></p>
<p><em>Finally, let me address some of the polarized comments around Ubisoft lately. I want to reaffirm that we are an entertainment-first company, creating games for the broadest possible audience, and our goal is not to push any specific agenda. We remain committed to creating games for fans and players that everyone can enjoy.</em></p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows now joins an already super-cramped February that includes Civilization VII and Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 on February 11, Avowed and the first episode of Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage on February 18, Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii and Monster Hunter Wilds on February 28.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has announced an&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>delay, with the open-world action-RPG now set to launch early next year instead of on its originally intended November release date.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1838971189722562906" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Ubisoft says that while the game is a "dream project", it needs more time to "polish and refine the experience" and push "some of our key features" further. As such, the game will now launch on February 14th.</p>
<p>It's not all bad news, though;&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>will now officially launch on Steam on day one, along with the other platforms on which it's arriving, so if you don't feel like using Ubisoft Connect, you no longer have to.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-yasuke.jpg?itok=O1pL_vzt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-yasuke.jpg?itok=JAGIxzbC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>needs a little more time to cook, apparently.</figcaption></figure><p>The announcement of&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>' delay comes alongside an announcement that Ubisoft is <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/5U6140Jg0IaqobyAIIEawC/af3b587a1c81f379d57bc64eefdd0285/PR_Trading_update_25092024_final.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">updating its financial targets</a> for the 2024-25 fiscal year.</p>
<p>In its statement, Ubisoft admits that&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>' initial sales were "softer than expected", and that a series of updates to "polish and improve the player experience" are in the works.</p>
<p>Additionally,&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>will land on Steam on November 21st, and going forward, all of Ubisoft's PC games will, it seems, launch on Steam on day one. Presumably, you'll also be able to play them on Ubisoft Connect if you really want to.</p>
<p>Ubisoft head Yves Guillemot (the man <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activist-ubisoft-investor-open-letter-change">some investors want rid of</a>) says Ubisoft's second quarter performance "fell short of our expectations", and that the benefits of the company's "transformation" are taking "longer than anticipated to materialize".</p>

<p>As part of that statement, Ubisoft also says it's "departing from the traditional Season Pass model", and that everyone who pre-orders&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>will be able to enjoy its first expansion for free as well.</p>
<p>It might be tempting to chalk&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>' delay up to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-controversy">ongoing backlash</a> from some sections of the gaming community, but that doesn't seem to be the case; Ubisoft doesn't mention the controversy at all in its delay announcement.</p>
<p>Additionally, in response to what he calls "polarized comments about Ubisoft", Guillemot says the studio is an "entertainment-first company" and that it doesn't intend to "push any specific agenda".</p>
<p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/shadows" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/assassins-creed-shadows/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/assassins-creed-shadows/9N9P758CH65M" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on February 14th.

After showing off <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172151/assassins-creed-shadows-gameplay-trailer-ubisoft-forward-2024">12 minutes of gameplay in June</a>, it looked like Ubisoft was set to deliver its next <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>installment in the usual holiday period, but now the publisher says it needs more time to get its new parkour and stealth systems ready.</p><p>“We realize we need more time to polish and refine the experience, pushing further some of our key features,” says Marc-Alexis Côté, vice president and executive producer of<em> Assassin’s Creed</em> at Ubisoft.</p><p><a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/5U6140Jg0IaqobyAIIEawC/af3b587a1c81f379d57bc64eefdd0285/PR_Trading_update_25092024_final.pdf">Ubisoft says</a>, “the learnings from the Star Wars Outlaws release led us to provide additional time to further polish the title,” and that it’s also changing up its traditional season pass model. “All players will be able to enjoy the game at the same time on February 14th and those who preorder the game will be granted the first expansion for free,” says Ubisoft.</p><p><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>will also be available on Steam on day one, marking a return of Ubisoft’s new releases on Valve’s store as part of what appears to be a push for “greater efficiency.” Ubisoft’s board of directors is also “launching a review aimed at further improving our execution, notably in this player-centric approach, and accelerating our strategic path towards a higher performing model to the benefit of our stakeholders and shareholders.”</p><p><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>will now debut just days before Obsidian’s next RPG, <em>Avowed</em>, launches on February 18th. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/2/24212338/avowed-has-indeed-been-delayed">Microsoft announced the <em>Avowed</em> delay last month</a>, saying it wanted to “give players’ backlogs some breathing room.”</p><p>The delay comes just a day after Sucker Punch debuted a first look at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/24/24253576/ghost-of-tsushima-2-yotei-ps5-pro-2025"><em>Ghost of Yotei</em></a>, which is due for release in 2025. <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>will be set in Japan and is the latest entry in the series to have dual protagonists. Players can pick between the samurai Yasuke and the shinobi assassin Naoe. <em>Shadows</em>&nbsp;is launching on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X / S on February 14th.&nbsp;Ubisoft also confirmed earlier this year that <em>Shadows </em>is coming coming to macOS in the future as well.</p><p><em><strong>Update, September 25th</strong>: Article updated with comments from Ubisoft about a board of directors-led review of the company.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

She can ride her shark-themed surfboard on land and water alike with little interruption. Making her even more valuable is her ridiculous damage potential that scales off of her HP. She’s capable of a lot, but she needs to be built right to make the most use of her.</p><h2 id="h613"><a id=""></a>Best Mualani team composition</h2><figure id="" data-id="a1c8eef6a30bf5dccb914e9a32933c81" data-recommend-id="image://a1c8eef6a30bf5dccb914e9a32933c81" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1054" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Four characters on the party setup screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Four characters on the party setup screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HoYoverse / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a1c8eef6a30bf5dccb914e9a32933c81" data-recommend-id="image://a1c8eef6a30bf5dccb914e9a32933c81" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1054" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Four characters on the party setup screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Since her kit is straightforward and damage will be dealt as soon as she attacks, you’ll want to use her as the primary DPS to trigger elemental reactions. <strong>The ideal setup is to inflict Pyro on enemies and then attack with Mualani for a Vaporize reaction.</strong> Doing it in this order will provide a two-times damage multiplier.</p><p><strong>A Pyro sub-DPS character is necessary to make this all work, and Xiangling is naturally a shoo-in for the role.</strong> Her skill and burst abilities do a great job applying Pyro even when she’s off-field. Just make sure to time Mualani’s attacks to come after the enemy is on fire for that extra damage.</p><p><strong>To further assist Xianling, I of course have to recommend Bennett.</strong> He’s commonly partnered with her since she can make excellent use of his ATK buffs and energy generation. Although he won’t directly benefit Mualani much, he’s worth a spot on a team just to help Xianling cast her elemental burst more often.</p><p>There’s nothing wrong with adding even more damage with the right support. <strong>My top recommendations to accomplish this task are Kazuha or Emilie.</strong> Kazuha can pull in enemies close and then use attacks that absorb different elements. Emilie is most suited for using her Dendro element with Pyro for Burning reactions, pairing well with Xianling before Mulani comes in with her attack.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/genshin-impact-xbox-release-date-nintendo-switch-port-1851627237&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/genshin-impact-xbox-release-date-nintendo-switch-port-1851627237"><em>Genshin Impact</em> Finally Hitting Xbox In November But Still No Nintendo Switch Port In Sight</a></span></p><p>Adding another character from the Natlan region is also worth your consideration.

Those that boost the HP will be a priority since so much of her damage scales off that stat. Any buffs to normal attack DMG will be helpful too since her skill’s attack do count as normal attacks.</p><p><strong>Surf’s Up is a 5-star weapon available on the Epitome Invocation banner alongside Mualani.</strong> Unsurprisingly, this unique item that perfectly fits her kit is the best option. It increases the user’s max HP by a considerable amount, in addition to providing Scorching Summer stacks that increase normal attack DMG. More of these stacks can be accumulated if you can trigger Vaporize reactions.</p><p><strong>If you want to use something more accessible, Ring of Yaxche is a great free-to-play pick.</strong> Triggered by activating an elemental skill, it increases normal attack DMG by 0.6 percent for every 1,000 HP the user has. All you need to do is visit a blacksmith in Natlan to craft this weapon.</p><h2 id="h615"><a id=""></a><strong>Best Talents to level up</strong></h2><p>Of the two Natlan characters released so far, there’s a common focus on relying on their skill for traversal and combat. Mualani’s normal attack stats are only being factored in when she’s on her feet, and we want her on the Sharky Surfboard as often as possible. Here’s the order you should prioritize upgrading:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Elemental Skill - Surfshark Wavebreaker</li><li>Elemental Burst - Boomsharka-laka</li><li>Normal Attack - Cooling Treatment</li></ul><h2 id="h616"><a id=""></a><strong>Best Artifact Sets for Mualani</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="5a4d314cf8db5b10f0b9afd6a30c66bb" data-recommend-id="image://5a4d314cf8db5b10f0b9afd6a30c66bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1052" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A girl surrounded by floating items on the Artifacts screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A girl surrounded by floating items on the Artifacts screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HoYoverse / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5a4d314cf8db5b10f0b9afd6a30c66bb" data-recommend-id="image://5a4d314cf8db5b10f0b9afd6a30c66bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1052" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A girl surrounded by floating items on the Artifacts screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Finally, we come to the choices for Artifacts. Hydro DMG and HP buffs should naturally be top of mind, but the most optimal set is something different.</p><p><strong>Obsidian Codex is a brand-new artifact set and it is perfect for Mualani.</strong> The two-piece effect will increase her DMG by 15 percent whenever she uses her skill and activates Nightsoul’s Blessing mechanic. The four-piece will meanwhile increase CRIT Rate by 40 percent when a Nightsoul point is consumed. It can be earned by completing the Sanctum of Rainbow Spirits Domain of Blessing.</p><p><strong>The next full set worth considering is Heart of Depth.</strong> The two-piece increases Hydro DMG by 15 percent while the four-piece increases Normal and Charged attack DMG by 30 percent for a limited time after using a skill. This set can be earned by completing the Peak of Vindagnyr domain in Mondstadt.</p><p><strong>Building off on the idea of buffing normals, Martial Artist can be very effective on Mualani.</strong> The two-piece increases normal and charged attack DMG by 15 percent. The four-piece works similarly to the previous set, granting a 25 percent increase to DMG for a limited time after using a skill. This set will also require you to work through an Artifact domain, specifically The Hidden Palace of Zhou Formula in Liyue.</p><hr><p>Mualani is the first 5-star character from <em>Genshin Impact</em>’s new Natlan region and a great DPS to boot. Even without the unique Nightsoul’s Blessing mechanics, the damage she can do with the Vaporize reaction is incredible. If you want someone who’s formidable in combat and has fun traversal, Mualani is worth pulling for.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
