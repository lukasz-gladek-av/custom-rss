            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/black-myth-wukong-ambition-journey-to-the-west<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> does not, ultimately, care what I think about it. To the degree that criticism matters (reporting being a different beast), mine has never mattered less. There is something liberating and refreshing about that. The <em>Journey To The West </em>themed game is a breakout hit, selling <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-05/investor-who-risked-it-all-on-wukong-scores-another-sales-win?utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=markets&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-markets&amp;embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">18 million copies</a> in 2 weeks, primarily in China but not insignificantly internationally. It is a very good game – bold, ambitious, and constantly innovative. It is also a little lopsided at times, charming in some ways and less so in others, both of which speak to the relative newness of developer Game Science in producing this kind of game. It is a game that matters quite a bit to the future of games; its ambition should not be ignored.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>This game has the highest density of Buddhas in any game, possibly surpassing the champion: Asura's Wrath.

Many times you will find several American movies on the list due to our outsized cultural presence, but in the case of China it will be movies like <em>Wolf Warrior 2</em>, <em>Detective Chinatown 3</em>,<em> The Battle at Lake Changjin </em>– a mix of comedies and military flicks that you don’t usually watch in the States. Have you ever heard of the movie <em>YOLO</em>? It grossed $479.5 million dollars and came out this year. Though there have been attempts at breakout crossover hits from China (Zhang Yimou succeeded brilliantly with <em>Hero</em>, only to direct the laughable <em>The Great Wall </em>later) most are made for domestic audiences. Though <em>Black Myth: Wukong </em>is almost jarringly in this vein, it differs a little in part because of the nature of gaming and the specific quirks of digital distribution.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Many Chinese blockbusters make obscene money domestically but never cross over. <em>Yolo</em>, a remake of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_Yen_Love" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">100 Yen Love</a>, </em>came out this year and made $479.5 million dollars. Credit: Deng Feng International Media, Wanda Pictures</figcaption></figure><p>Though <a href="https://aftermath.site/nobody-needs-to-know-how-many-people-are-playing-a-singleplayer-video-game-nobody" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nobody needs to know how many people are playing a single player game</a>, it is impossible to miss a gargantuan $70 million blockbuster single player game just sitting fully wrapped on Steam beating <em>Counter-Strike</em> in concurrents. Through sheer gravity in a digitally distributed marketplace, it attracts attention in a way that movies often struggle to do unless they arrive on a streaming platform. What’s more, there’s a degree to which gamers can just kind of roll with something if the game plays well and the spectacle is grand enough, and largely that is true here.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Baby Buddha. Credit: Game Science</figcaption></figure><p><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>’s popularity in the West, to the degree that it can be quantified, reminds me quite a bit of the popularity of Telugu hit <em>RRR </em>in more ways than one. As pure spectacle, the appeal of that film is universal – you do not need to know history and geopolitics to understand why picking up a motorcycle and hitting a guy with it is pretty sick. But <em>RRR</em> is suffused with cultural, nationalistic and religious symbolism that goes beyond the basic literacy of many Western audiences.&nbsp; Most gamers who are not Buddhist probably do not know who Maitreya is and why they are in a video game, in much the same way that most Westerners who watched <em>RRR </em>on Netflix didn’t know who Komaram Bheem is, why there’s an extended sequence about the god Rama near the end, and the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/the-man-behind-indias-controversial-global-blockbuster-rrr-s-s-rajamouli" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">religious and political implications</a> of such a scene.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>It's Zhu Bajie, but he's tiny! Credit: Game Science</figcaption></figure><p>That <em>Black Myth: Wukong </em>does not stop to explain itself adds to the confidence of its execution. Of course you know who Sun Wukong and Zhu Bajie are! Everyone knows that. The game presumes you know Erlang Shen, Princess Iron Fan (Rakshasi), The <a href="http://bull_demon_king/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bull Demon King</a>, and the demonic child Red Boy. Allusions are made to the shapeshifting bone demoness <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baigujing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baigujing</a>. In the abstract you could argue that <em>God of War</em> does a similar trick, but the prior knowledge of the plot of <em>Journey to the West</em> is far more load bearing here. <em>Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</em> also does something similar, but it is nowhere near to this level of scale, polish, or success, and it is helped in the West by <em>Dynasty Warriors </em>being a long-running franchise. Compounding this is the fact <em>Black Myth: Wukong </em>is not an adaptation but a sequel to <em>Journey to the West</em>. Save for the very beginning, you do not directly play as Sun Wukong but the “Destined One,” an entirely different monkey attempting to take up his mantle. That the Destined One is a taciturn, silent protagonist is a bit disappointing to me given that Sun Wukong’s whole deal is that he’s one of the biggest loudmouthed pricks in fiction, but this is ultimately a game that is attempting to comment on the story instead of telling it directly, which is the correct approach when limited to 6 chapters and 35-50 in-game hours. Many of the most successful movies about <em>Journey to the West </em>take the tack of either limiting the scope out of necessity or being loose with the source material (Stephen Chow has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Chinese_Odyssey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">starred in</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_to_the_West:_Conquering_the_Demons" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">directed</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_to_the_West:_The_Demons_Strike_Back" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">written </a>many of these), because you just don’t have the time to do it in a non-serialized format.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>The game has an incredible density of freaky little dudes. Credit: Game Science</figcaption></figure><p>I would be remiss to talk about this game without touching on the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-black-myth-wukong-developers-history-of-sexism-is-complicating-its-journey-to-the-west" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reporting about sexism surrounding developer Game Science</a>, as well as the<a href="https://aftermath.site/black-myth-wukong-feminist-propaganda-politics-twitch-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> very strangely worded list of do’s and don’ts</a> sent to streamers by Game Science collaborator Hero Games. I’m not the best person to analyze the potential misogyny of the Chinese gaming scene or game development culture, but trying to draft this game into a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/23/24226834/black-myth-wukong-hands-on-impression-game-science" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Western culture war</a> has always struck me as funny given how tame the actual plot is. Though it does not necessarily reflect on the development of the game, women are well-represented in the story, although much of that happens much later in chapters 3-5. None of the political issues present in the influencer guide are commented upon in the game itself. For all the controversy surrounding the game’s development and release, the actual <em>text </em>of the game is anodyne in the way that most blockbusters have to be, and which is unsurprising given its source material.</p><figure><figcaption>The art direction in this game is so striking.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> is a work of gargantuan ambition and enthusiasm tempered by growing pains. Part of this has to do with general pacing and level layout. As some of the largely positive reviews have pointed out, the basic layout of the levels are confusingly similar at times, compounded by arbitrary invisible boundaries, and are easy to get turned around in, particularly since the game doesn’t have a map. This improves a bit as you move away from the first chapter and see other zones that are not just a forest, but levels remain labyrinthine. Sometimes this adds to the general mood of the game. The lack of a map makes the secrets you find feel particularly special. As the game progresses, the settings become increasingly imaginative and robust. You begin to anticipate the ways that the stages wind and twist. In a spider cave later on in the game (note: if you are afraid of bugs, this game is not for you), this is combined with a lot of verticality.</p><figure><figcaption>The game picks up steam at the second half of chapter 2 and then proceeds to add new quirks as the game goes on. Credit: Game Science.</figcaption></figure><p>The game does not start on its best foot after its bombastic opening. The combat can feel uneven and sluggish until you hit the second chapter to third and everything finally clicks. Much of this has to do with the general rate at which the game drip feeds you your full moveset, and the pace of combat only makes sense if your full suite of abilities can be cycled and cooled down. Both <em>God of War </em>and <em>Lies of P </em>have similar issues with tech tree windup<em>. </em>In fact, I found many comparisons between <em>Wukong </em>and <em>Lies of P</em>, which seem to find their footing and confidence as they progress. When everything does finally snap into place, the game’s combat becomes as tight as a drum.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Combat in this game goes from being simple and very easy to punishingly hard near the later chapters. The game improves as your kit opens up. Credit: Game Science</figcaption></figure><p>Both <em>Lies of P</em> and <em>Black Myth: Wukong </em>are innovative and unabashedly “soulslike,” although the latter is only punishingly brutal in parts and does not contain the signature roguelike elements of a Souls<em> </em>game. FromSoft’s influence is unambiguously present, not just in terms of storytelling, combat and tone, but also in terms of general visual language of the monsters and world. “Between <em>Sekrio </em>and <em>God of War</em>” is how I have been pitching what <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> does. Both <em>Wukong </em>and<em> P</em> are also shockingly good first attempts at action adventure games, from companies that had little to no experience in it, in ways that add to and at times outdo the games they are influenced by.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Black Myth: Wukong - PC Tech Review - The High-End Graphics Experience" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OItx2QHZt68?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>I'm not gonna lie, this game is gorgeous but was rough going when I played it.</figcaption></figure></div><p>There is a shocking degree of creativity on display in how Game Science has decided to render the universe of <em>Black Myth: Wukong, </em>from towering, trans-dimensional pagodas in snowy climates to dense spider caves. It looks gorgeous, many of Unreal Engine 5’s bells and whistles like Nanite have been turned on, and the game makes extensive use of particle effects in several fights, from billowing smoke to snow and sand or leaves. One fight makes aggressive use of floating pages of Buddhist scripture. <em>Black Myth: Wukong </em>is also a poorly optimized game at times, although definitely not the worst I have seen, with framerates often plummeting suddenly in certain areas. But what strikes me is the sheer confidence, the boldness of every choice in the game.There are no half-measures in <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>; it is clearly the work of a company that has yet to hit its stride, but which is trying to make a scene with its arrival.</p><figure><figcaption>Wukong's animated segments are some of the best I have seen in any game, and feature anime segments from anime veterans. It's like they threw <em>The Animatrix</em> in there as an extra. Credit: Game Science</figcaption></figure><p>What really elevates the <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> is the sheer density of it. Much of the production (although not polish) is on par with some of Sony’s best first party titles, but no part of it feels extraneous or watered down. You fight more than 100 bosses in the game, and a shocking percentage of them are not repeated. The ones that are repeated are done with good reason. Creatures and characters from the original novel are not only rendered and interpreted faithfully down to minute details, but every one of them has a dense, <em>Final Fantasy XII </em>style bestiary illustration and lore entry complete with poetry.&nbsp; Elaborate in-game animation and motion capture, fantastic voice acting, and wildly creative choices are around every corner. The headless <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanxian" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sanxian</a> player, played by Xiong Zhuying, is one of my favorite cameo characters in a long time. The <a href="https://x.com/AniNewsAndFacts/status/1828444919502893113" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">elaborate anime segments</a> between chapters, done by accomplished animators like <a href="https://x.com/cekibeing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chengxi Huang</a> and <a href="https://x.com/hiromatsu1988" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hiromatsu Shuu</a>, are <a href="https://x.com/Hiromatsu1988/status/1836045802701295836" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jaw-dropping</a> not only in their complexity, but in the way that they add to the backstory in a way that is parallel to the plot. Each one is unique, often animated in entirely different styles and mediums, with each feeling incredibly distinct. It’s like if you put an <em>Animatrix-</em>tier animation anthology in the middle of a <em>Final Fantasy </em>game. Even the way the game’s combat fuses existing gameplay conventions with new behaviors plucked right from Sun Wukong’s story is shockingly innovative.&nbsp; I can think of some games that do some of these things well, but none that do all of them well.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Every enemy has a beautifully written and drawn entry in your journal. Credit: Game Science</figcaption></figure><p>The more I played <em>Black Myth: Wukong </em>the more I was struck by its sheer ambition. For more reasons than are expedient to reiterate, blockbuster games have felt stagnant, broken or conventional lately. The ones that are operating at this level are often coasting on a prior success or are severely half-baked. <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> is something new, huge and unique – a AAA non-gacha success story out of China that, though imperfect and messy in its release, does what it does well and is worth taking seriously.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-says-ai-is-the-very-core-of-its-business-what-does-that-mean<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>On Tuesday, Electronic Arts (EA) held its annual Investor Day —  a three-hour presentation intended for its investors to learn more about the company's direction and promises to make them money in the coming year. But you'd be forgiven if you thought this was some sort of AI tech conference given how effusively the technology was brought up and touted as a key component of EA's future.</p><p>While we've known for a while that EA and a number of other gaming companies are experimenting with and investing heavily in AI, it was nonetheless a bit overwhelming just how often AI came up throughout the entire presentation. It was mentioned it just about every single segment in some capacity, had its own dedicated segment near the end, and was described during CEO Andrew Wilson's introductory speech as "the very core of our business" — a rather shocking new mission statement for a company that ostensibly makes and publishes video games.</p><p>We watched the entirety of the three-hour Investor Day presentation, and did our best to round up all the AI "highlights" in an effort to paint a picture of what, exactly, EA is doing with AI and what we can expect to see in the coming years if its investments and interest in the tech pan out.</p><h2>Core of the Business</h2><p>The first mention of AI in the presentation took place right at the top, in Andrew Wilson's opening speech. In addition to referring to AI as "the very core of our business" and "not merely a buzzword," he announced that EA apparently has over 100 active "novel AI projects" in the works right now, ranging from the practical to the very experimental. Wilson divvied these up into three categories: efficiency, expansion, and transformation.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/18/electronic-arts-investor-day-2024-28-53-screenshot-1726682740176.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Andrew Wilson at EA's Investor Day 2024</figcaption></figure></output><p>Wilson describes the "efficiency" projects as not just cost-saving, but related to doing things faster, cheaper, and at "higher quality." Specifically, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-25-review">he cites College Football 25</a>, saying the developers could not have made the game's 150 different stadiums and over 11,000 player likenesses without AI.</p><p>Wilson elaborated by saying he believes AI can give developers "richer colors" to paint "more brilliant worlds" and make characters with "more depth and intelligence" while offering "more authenticity and deeper immersion" to the company's sports games. And for transformation, Wilson describes this as looking into the future and finding entirely new kinds of experiences that don't currently exist in games, especially around user-generated content. </p><p>Chief strategy officer Mihir Vaidya went into more depth about what the "transformation" element will mean for EA in a later section, but Wilson's opener made it clear that he's more than bullish on the technology.</p><h2>AI Examples</h2><p>In the talks that followed, a number of EA leads highlighted ways in which EA was already working with AI tech in its existing games. Laura Miele, president of EA entertainment, technology, and central development, talked about something called The Sims Hub, the first AI features coming to The Sims universe. EA plans to release a platform with "supercharged discovery tools" that use AI to allow players to find user-generated content more easily. She showed off an AI application that uses a photo search feature, allowing users to drop in photos of real life houses and then find user-generated houses that look similar to them. Miele also highlighted how the AI can be used for character creation, with users able to drop in an image of a celebrity or person in a certain outfit and then generate a Sim that matches up. Miele says The Sims Hub will be released "soon."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/18/electronic-arts-investor-day-2024-55-58-screenshot-1726682542759.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Laura Miele speaking about The Sims Hub at EA's Investor Day 2024</figcaption></figure></output><p>On the internal tech side, Miele talked about EA's asset library, which she described as "like the Smithsonian of game assets." Essentially, EA has a massive database of assets from all of its games and work behind the scenes over the years, and it's using it to train its machine learning capabilities and large language models. Those capabilities are then being used by the company's "SEED" innovation lab, aka "Search for Extraordinary Experiences Division", for things like EA's "Script to Scene" tool.</p><p>Script to Scene lets developers "create characters, direct performances, and define worlds all from text." Miele shows an example on screen, prompting an AI chat assistant to "build me a Parisian-style residential building." She then asks to make it taller, changes it to a modern high rise, and expands it into a larger neighborhood. With Script to Scene, Miele claims EA developers could eventually make an entire scene in a game using simple text prompts.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/18/electronic-arts-investor-day-2024-1-3-4-screenshot-1726682599723.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Laura Miele explains Script to Scene at EA's Investor Day 2024</figcaption></figure></output><p>After Miele, president of EA Sports Cam Weber took the stage to talk about, well, EA Sports. He showed off the <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/ea-sports-fc/fc-25/news/pitch-notes-fc-25-fc-iq-deep-dive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">already announced FC IQ</a>, which uses "tactical AI" and real-world data to more accurately simulate how players and teams play together in EA Sports FC 25. And he highlighted Wilson's prior statements about using AI in College Football 25, noting that the stadium creator AI tools in particular reduced creation time "by about 70%" and allowed developers to focus on building the "pageantry" and unique traditions of each school instead. "The investment in these tools and tech will benefit the rest of our portfolio in the months and years ahead," he said.</p><p>And finally, chief experience officer David Tinson briefly talked about an early prototype of a predictive simulation tool EA is working on. He claims the tool will combine EA game data, AI, and IQ ratings to allow users to run more accurate simulations and answer questions of which team would win in a match, who would have won in a hypothetical match, and which team is the best.</p><h2>Cardboard boxes and AI soccer stars</h2><p>If all that somehow wasn't enough AI chatter for you, chief strategy officer Mihir Vaidya took the stage next to talk about AI and nothing but. He opened by comparing the technology to the advent of makeup tutorial videos and cat videos, which he says people initially dismissed as trivial or niche, but now are ubiquitous and wildly popular. He says EA's experimental AI efforts should be viewed the same way as "early YouTube videos", and that while what he shows might feel rudimentary, it will naturally get better as AI improves.</p><p>Vaidya was specifically brought onstage to talk about the "transformation" portion of AI that Wilson mentioned earlier. He says the experiences he shows onstage are "not intended to replace AAA games, but instead unlock new and adjacent categories that add as opposed to take away from the existing gaming market."</p><p>Those "new and adjacent categories" Vaidya wanted to show off largely seem to involve apps of some sort that let people use AI to shuffle around EA proprietary assets and spit out minigames of a sort. One example he shows involves two people asking an AI to "make a maze out of cardboard boxes." They then ask the AI to make it more complex, then multi-level. Then they ask the AI to "make two characters with weapons," allowing them to select from a gallery of existing EA characters before settling on two that purport to be community-designed, then equip them with guns from a library of weapons. They then select from a handful of game modes and start chasing each other around the cardboard maze. The video ends with one of them asking the AI to "make it more epic," resulting in a giant cardboard box pyramid seemingly appearing in real-time to the astonishment of the two players.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/18/electronic-arts-investor-day-2024-2-12-25-screenshot-1726682289456.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>A screenshot of an AI experiment at EA's Investor Day 2024</figcaption></figure></output><p>In a second demonstration, Vaidya wants to demonstrate how AI can be used to create "more believable characters" that players care about even more. Unfortunately, we didn't get to see much of that in action, as Vaidya encourages investors to check out the demo at the investor event after the presentation is over. But we do see a few seconds of what he's talking about: an AI version of soccer star Jude Bellingham is apparently available to answer questions posed by investors using AI to simulate his likeness, voice, and likely responses. Vaidya demonstrates by asking him what it was like to play at Bernabéu "in front of millions of screaming fans." Bellingham briefly explains the indescribable thrill of the experience in a flat monotone, expressionless.</p><p>Finally, Vaidya demonstrates how EA wants to use AI for "social ecosystems", specifically something codenamed Project AIR. Project AIR seems to be a way to use short text prompts to generate characters, have text-based interactions with them, and then share those conversations with friends. In his example, he creates a "legendary investor" character using the prompt, "A high-stakes VC who swims in the deep waters of innovation." </p><p>He then decides the "game" will be to pitch business ideas to him. In an interface that looks suspiciously like Tik-Tok, the user pitches "self-tying shoes" only to be slapped down. He then invites a friend to help him pitch, but lost for any ideas on how to make self-tying shoes more interesting, he uses an AI co-pilot to write the pitch for him, which ultimately succeeds.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/18/electronic-arts-investor-day-2024-2-24-15-screenshot-1726682353881.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>A screenshot from an AI experiment at EA's Investor Day 2024</figcaption></figure></output><h2>What does it all mean?</h2><p>That's <em>a lot</em> of noise about AI, almost an astonishing amount even from a company we knew was pushing the tech hard. And it's a lot of noise specifically about <em>generative </em>AI. Artificial intelligence, broadly, has been used in games for decades. But generative AI, which is involved in most of the things EA shared yesterday, is different. Generative AI effectively spits out brand new images, text, sound, or other content based on data it's fed, which has led to numerous ethical questions regarding its use. Some of those EA has managed to answer effectively. For instance, EA is training its AI on its own proprietary material, so there's seemingly no concern about it stealing copyrighted work (we've reached out to EA for comment).</p><p>But other concerns remain. There's the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00478-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">environmental impact</a>, for one, which we've also asked EA about. And then there's issues of using personal likenesses. EA says Jude Bellingham agreed to let EA train an AI on his likeness and voice for the model we saw yesterday, but will EA ensure it has permission from every single individual it uses in the future? What about voice actors for beloved characters, who are still at this moment on strike from companies including AI over these exact protections? We've asked EA for comment on all this, too.</p><p>On the game development side, how does this implementation of AI impact individual creatives at the company? It's easy to say that tools such as Script to Scene are intended to free up developers to work on other things. But it's a practical reality that the games industry has seen <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ive-never-seen-it-this-bad-game-developers-explain-the-huge-layoffs-hitting-riot-epic-and-more">two years of unprecedented layoffs</a> just as AI is beginning to creep into the mainstream, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-to-lay-off-around-670-to-advance-the-way-we-work">EA has been a part of that</a>. There are no guarantees that this tech might not eventually be used to replace developers eventually. Developers <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cl44mv0jnv5o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">have said over and over</a> that they are rightfully nervous about this possibility, but neither EA nor its investors seem to be especially interested in addressing that. Nor does it seem apparent to them the difference between the intentional, creative work of designers assembling a thoughtful map for a shoorter, and anyone at all prompting an AI to spit out a random array of cardboard boxes. It's all content to be sold in the end.</p><p>As some have pointed out online, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-nft-blockchain-future-gaming">EA is no stranger to pushing hard on new tech</a> before immediately <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-not-driving-hard-direction-nfts">backing off the second the wind changed</a>. But this feels different. EA leadership made it abundantly clear at the Investor Day that the company is already very, very deep in on AI even if the experiments themselves are still in their infancy. Investors might be kept happy by these experiments, but perhaps fans of EA's 40-year history as a video game company ought to be asking why AI, not games, has suddenly become the "core" of its business.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

<p>After 20 years, it's now possible for solo players to finish storylines in the massively multiplayer online role-playing game <em>World of Warcraft</em> that previously required a group to do an intensive raid.</p>
<p>That's thanks to "<a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24137818/going-solo-in-world-of-warcraft-a-heros-journey">Story Mode</a>," a new raid difficulty that was added for the final wing of the first raid of the recently released <em>The War Within</em> expansion.</p>
<p>Over the years, developer Blizzard has expanded the difficulty options for raids to meet various players and communities where they're at in terms of play styles. The top difficulty is Mythic, where the semi-pro hardcore guilds compete. Below that is Heroic, where serious, capital-G gamers coordinate with friends in weekly raid schedules to progress. Then there's Normal, which still requires some coordination but isn't nearly as challenging and can typically be completed by a pick-up group within a few tries.</p>
<p>The most accessible difficulty is Raid Finder, where you're matched up with random players automatically to complete a vastly easier version of a raid. Now Story Mode has been added to the mix, and it's even easier than Raid Finder.</p>
<h2>How Story Mode works</h2>
<p>In Story Mode, you fight only the raid's final boss, which has been scaled back in stats and complexity so that it's beatable for a single player or a very small group of friends. Challenging encounter mechanics have been removed, and the whole fight has been retooled to focus exclusively on the narrative aspects.</p>
<p>There are some rewards, but they're not the same as those on more difficult raids; the goal was to avoid cheapening the experience for those who <em>do</em> want to go all the way.</p>
<p>So far, Story Mode is available exclusively for <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-gb/world-of-warcraft/24135892/nerub-ar-palace-mythic-story-mode-raid-finder-wing-2-now-live">the newest raid</a>, which is called Nerub-ar Palace. It hasn't been made available for other encounters yet, but Blizzard has hinted that this could be the long-term goal.</p>
<h2>Supporting new (well, actually, old) play styles</h2>
<p>Throughout <em>WoW</em>'s history, it's been common for the conclusion of a major storyline to involve defeating the final boss of a raid or dungeon. In the earlier years, Raid Finder didn't exist, so only a small percentage of players who were willing to take on hardcore raiding could see those narrative outcomes.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>Raid Finder was added in the <em>Cataclysm</em> expansion, but that still required grouping with other players, which isn't everyone's cup of tea. For some players, the social aspect of <em>WoW</em> is simply guild chat while doing solo activities at their own pace. Some people even play <em>WoW</em> without interacting directly with other players at all, treating others in the game as background crowds that add immersion to the experience.</p>
<p>In most areas, <em>WoW</em> has been better than most of its peers at supporting this kind of play. I played <em>WoW</em> socially early on, but I've played almost exclusively solo for the past several years. To see the endings of storylines I encountered while questing, I often turned to YouTube to see the cutscenes players got when they beat the raids.</p>
<p>Story Mode is also relevant for older content; Blizzard wisely introduced a new approach to leveling new characters where players can essentially pick a past expansion to level through. It's tuned so that the players reach the level cap and are ready for current live content at more or less the same time they finish the final solo zone quests in that expansion. But it's only during special Timewalking events that those players got the opportunity to find other players to do the raids with, so they often didn't get to finish the stories.</p>
<p>Story Mode solves both of those scenarios, and it's a fundamental philosophy shift for how <em>WoW</em> approaches endgame content.
</p><p>A lot of players enjoy <em>WoW</em>'s positive community aspects but don't like the pressure of having to perform for others in a high-stress situation. Raid Finder addressed some of their concerns, but since some people just play for the story, there was no good reason for Blizzard not to have done this ages ago.</p>
<p>Story Mode might even be enough to get lapsed players back who might have left because they didn't have time for the demanding social schedules associated with raiding. It also doesn't take away from hardcore players' satisfaction or enjoyment if casual solos can see some version of the final encounter and cutscene of a story arc, especially since the rewards are so distinct.</p>
<p>Sometimes, casual and hardcore players can play the same game without ruining each other's experience. That's a fine line that Blizzard has struggled to walk sometimes, but Story Mode is one of a handful of cases where it's a win for everyone.</p>

I could move on. A cutscene played but the audio was missing. That happens a lot in this game. And then the final screen appeared, showing me how many collectibles I had snagged and side activities I had completed. I hit the “A” button to move on to the final level. I hit “A” few times. I mashed it. Nothing. I restarted the controller. Nope. I tried a different one. Still nothing. The game had soft-locked on me. So, I restarted <em>Funko Fusion</em> and played <em>Hot Fuzz</em>’s fourth level again. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196394" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Killing Your Heroes, And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="97" data-playlist="196394,196470,196299" data-current="196394"><div><p>The Week In Games: Killing Your Heroes, And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21942.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Previously, this same level had locked up on me twice before.

Those games mixed popular movies, like <em>Star Wars</em>, with colorful Lego pieces, brick-breaking gameplay, and cartoonish antics. But instead of cute Lego characters, every person and creature in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/funko-fusion-pop-new-game-chucky-jurassic-park-landfill-1850375748&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/funko-fusion-pop-new-game-chucky-jurassic-park-landfill-1850375748"><em>Funko Fusion</em> is based on Funko Pops</a></span>. It immediately sucks a lot of the charm and whimsy out of the game when every character is a big-headed toy with no mouth and dead black eyes. It also doesn’t help that many of the movies included in the game, like <em>Hot Fuzz</em> and <em>The Thing, </em>don’t really feel like a good fit for a family-friendly action-puzzle game starring plastic toys.<br></p><p>But do you want to know a secret? Don’t tell anyone, but part of me was kind of excited about <em>Funko Fusion. </em></p><p>No, the Funko Pop characters didn’t win me over. The way the game was being marketed, as an IP SANDBOX to play in, also didn’t do much for me either. And yet, I’m a sucker for taking a big movie like <em>Jurassic Park</em> or <em>Star Wars</em> and squishing it into a new, smaller, cuter form that can provide a new way to experience a franchise I love. And even with the Funko Pops and their dead, cold, black, shark-like eyes, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/funko-fusion-trailer-mummy-nope-jurassic-release-date-1851447102&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/funko-fusion-trailer-mummy-nope-jurassic-release-date-1851447102"><em>Funko Fusion</em></a></span><em> </em>could have been something fun. Something cool. Sadly, almost no part of this game feels good or is fun to play. And that’s kind of a big problem for a video game.</p><p><em>Funko Fusion </em>works like this: You pick a figure at the start. You can choose characters from <em>He-Man</em>, <em>Battlestar Galactica</em>, <em>Umbrella Academy</em>, <em>Jurassic World</em>, or other franchises. That unlocks a hub world based on that character’s IP. Then you complete five levels based on the franchise, fight a boss at the end, and then unlock a new world based on something else and repeat. </p><p>This is a fine setup for a game featuring a ton of different movies and franchises.  It’s just a shame that playing <em>Funko Fusion</em> is a miserable experience.</p><hr><p>Let’s start with combat. You’ll be shooting a lot of stuff in <em>Funko Fusion</em>. Every character I played used some kind of ranged weapon, usually a gun. I remember hopping into the first level of<em> Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World</em> and being excited that I wouldn’t be shooting stuff. Scott uses a guitar and the movie is all about rock music, comic books, and colorful melee fights. But nope! Scott just shoots projectiles from his guitar.<br></p><p>Perhaps if the shooting in <em>Funko Fusion</em> was enjoyable, I’d not mind every character playing as a generic third-person shooter protagonist. But the combat in <em>Funko Fusion</em> is the opposite of enjoyable. Guns feel very weak and aren’t satisfying to use. Part of the problem is that every enemy is a bullet sponge, able to take more damage than you’d expect. Fights become frustratingly dull events as <em>Funko Fusion</em> tosses way too many enemies at you, often not stopping until you finish an objective. And that’s basically the only type of combat encounter you’ll face in the game. </p><p>Over and over again, I was walking to a bad puzzle or away from an annoying fight only to be ambushed (again) by a few more enemies. At other times, <em>Funko Fusion</em> locked me in an area and forced me to kill waves of baddies until the game decides it had punished me enough and let me move on to the next level. And sadly, that level typically sucked, too.<br></p><p>At least <em>Funko Fusion </em>looks nice. The levels are detailed and often feature loads of references to different movies and franchises. And I think the game’s textures and lighting are impressive at times. The<em> He-Man</em> area looks like a 3D cartoon. The <em>Battlestar Galactica</em> levels perfectly capture the original show’s cheap late-’70s sci-fi vibes, complete with grey carpet and office chairs. Sadly, some levels, like the <em>Jurassic World</em> ones, run like garbage and make it hard to enjoy due to performance problems.<br></p><p>But all of these levels go on too long and include some of the most annoying puzzles I’ve run into in 2024. And that’s not because the puzzles are hard. Instead, the puzzles in <em>Funko Fusion </em>simply suck because you have to grab each key item, like a crystal or key card, and manually walk it back to where it’s needed. Every. Single. Time. Bring the wrong item? Well, you have to walk all the way back, fighting ever-spawning enemies, grab the correct key item, walk it back, drop it to fight enemies that might kill you, and then hopefully unlock the next area by solving the puzzle. </p><hr><p>And after slogging your way through bad puzzles, framerate problems, and annoying combat encounters, you might have to restart the whole level because you tried to craft a healing item. Or needed to craft a quest item. Or you tried to move on to the next area. Or the game just breaks in some other way and forces you to restart the level.<br></p><p>The headline above says <em>Funko Fusion </em>soft-locked on me 21 times and that’s true, but it would likely be <em>higher </em>if I didn’t avoid crafting stations, which would often lock up on me and force me to restart the game or level. Even when I avoided these crafting stations, I still got screwed by the game. One time an enemy I needed to kill just never spawned. Another time a character I needed to escort just disappeared. </p><figure id="" data-id="6c7c0735ee5ba74e7765bec3af9a8db1" data-recommend-id="image://6c7c0735ee5ba74e7765bec3af9a8db1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Funko Fusion &quot;Thing&quot; level.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Each time <em>Funko Fusion</em> locked up on me, I had to restart from the beginning of the level, rewatch all the cutscenes (none of which can be skipped), and then be forced to listen to the same song loop over and over in the background as I desperately tried to complete the level again while praying to<em> Funko Fusion’s</em> gods that I be allowed to continue. Begging the game not to force me to restart the level yet again. As you might have guessed, the <em>Funko Fusion</em> gods are cruel bastards. I think I ended up replaying about half the levels I finished multiple times due to soft locks. Not fun!<br></p><p>I’ve not finished <em>Funko Fusion.</em> I’m not sure I ever will. I don’t want to play it anymore. Beyond everything I’ve already shared here, there are so many little problems with the game, too. Chests take forever to open, managing your inventory isn’t fun, cutscenes are forgettable, level geometry gets reused a lot, and sound effects often sound bad or don’t work properly. </p><p><em>Funko Fusion</em> could have been something fun! A wacky adventure mixing together different franchises and worlds. Instead, its a boring, annoying, barely functional third-person action game starring ugly <em>Funko Pops </em>solving bad puzzles and fighting the same 10 enemies over and over again with guns and laser pistols. Don’t play <em>Funko Fusion.</em> Save your money, buy some pizza, and watch one of the movies included in this collection instead. It will be much more enjoyable and you won’t have to restart the movie five times to reach the end.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That's a great price for a 10K power bank that's equipped with a USB Type-C output with up to 20W of Power Delivery. It's an excellent battery backup for your Nintendo Switch since it can charge the console at its maximum rate of 18W.</p><h2>Baseus 10,000mAh 20W Power Bank for Just Over $10</h2><div id="187616" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Baseus 10,000mAh 20W Portable Charger</h3></p></div><p>The 10,000mAH power bank is the perfect compromise between battery capacity and size, especially if you're looking for a battery backup for something as small as the Nintendo Switch. This Baseus model measures 6" long and 2.7" wide, about the same size as an iPhone 14 Pro, and only 0.7" thin. It weighs in at about 9 ounces. The 10,000mAh capacity is no slouch either. Factoring in charging inefficiencies, you should still expect this power bank to charge a Switch about 1.5 times. If we go by Nintendo's official claim of 4.5-9 hours from the battery, you're essentially extending that to 11-22 hours.</p><p>There are three ports for versatility: a USB Type-C port, USB Type-A port, and Micro USB port. The USB Type-C port is both <strong>output and input</strong>, which means you can charge the power bank OR charge your devices from that same port. This is the port you want to use to get the 20W charging rate. Since the Nintendo Switch can charge at a cap of 18W, the Type-C port will max out the Switch's charging speed.</p><p>The Baseus power bank is UL certified and comes with built-in safety protections you'd expect from a decent quality power bank. It also has an LED battery indicator that you can check with a press of a button. Although not as well known as Anker, Baseus is still a popular brand on Amazon and has plenty of positive reviews. I have a Baseus power bank myself and it hasn't given me any problems.</p><h2>The Baseus Power Bank is TSA-Approved</h2><p>Spare lithium ion and lithium metal batteries, including power banks and cell phone battery charging cases, must be carried in carry-on baggage only. Power banks must be under either 27,000mAh or 100Whr in capacity. This Baseus power bank's 10,000mAh battery capacity is well below TSA's 27,000mAh limit, so it can be brought onto airplanes without worry. This power bank is small and discreet enough that it's hard to imagine TSA even noticing the power bank in the first place.</p><p><em>Looking for more alternatives?

The latest installment in the long-running <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tag/yakuza&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tag/yakuza"><em>Like a Dragon</em>/<em>Yakuza </em>series</a></span> is comically full of things to do. On one hand, it’s a turn-based RPG epic, splitting its narrative between two larger-than-life protagonists in entirely different settings complete with their own villains, party members, and side stories. On the other hand, it is more game than anybody could possibly need, housing several side activities, minigames, and at least two-full sized games within itself. <strong>If you’re a person whose chief concern about a game is getting the absolute most bang for your buck, there has rarely been a better game to pick up than <em>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</em>, which is now discounted at $42 on both PlayStation and Steam.</strong></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196578" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Total Recall: Why Yakuza Is So Much More Than A Japanese GTA" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="387" data-playlist="196578,196055,194088" data-current="196578"><div><p>Total Recall: Why Yakuza Is So Much More Than A Japanese GTA</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196578/196578_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196578/196578_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196578/196578_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196578/196578_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22135.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>At its core, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/yakuza-like-dragon-infinite-wealth-guides-jobs-dondoko-1851265546&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/yakuza-like-dragon-infinite-wealth-guides-jobs-dondoko-1851265546"><em>Infinite Wealth </em>is just massive</a></span>.

While they spend part of the game together, they largely lead their own stories, which finds the player splitting time between familiar settings like Kamurocho and Isezaki Ijincho and a brand new environment in Honolulu City in Hawaii. Though they aren’t all lent the same level of depth, that’s still three ridiculously layered maps for players to explore in one game.<br></p><p>Over the course of the several dozens of hours that players are bound to spend in <em>Infinite Wealth</em>, the characters run around town making banter, fighting gangsters and maybe even a few construction vehicles, and forging unbreakable bonds in the face of adversity in true <em>Like a Dragon </em>fashion. Along the way, they’ll level up and attain increasingly ridiculous jobs that modify their specialties, movesets, and equipment in battle. My version of Ichiban, for example, ended up as a Desperado, which satirizes the Hollywood western hero by equipping him with water guns. Fortunately, this made my Ichiban fantastic at dealing with large crowds of enemies, since he could spin around and launch volleys of water from his dual revolvers, as well as putting enemies to sleep. One of my party members, Chitose, bounced around collecting a slew of skills from a range of jobs before I finally settled on making her a Kunoichi.<br></p><p>It’s all absurd in the best way and rarely ever lets up. The narrative features a cult, an evil Vtuber who basically sentences Ichiban and his friends into exile, and at least one instance of men having a climactic fight with their shirts off. If a lengthy and deeply emotional (if wildly uneven) story isn’t what you’re here for, however, the fun carries over to <em>Infinite Wealth</em>’s side content. You can go perform karaoke, unlock hidden dialogues by dining at establishments around town, and take multiple “real” jobs that play out as minigames. Maybe you’ll come across a restaurant that desperately needs a waiter, forcing you to play a memorization game, or maybe you’ll encounter a movie director who hates CGI and demands you literally run through hellish oncoming traffic to get his perfect shot. </p><p>If those distractions sound too domestic or tame, <em>Infinite Wealth </em>also contains full games with their own mechanics and storylines, in keeping with the franchise’s time-honored traditions. Sujimon is <em>Like A Dragon</em>’s version of Pokémon, except you recruit thugs, career criminals, and all types of weirdos you run into on the street and have them fight in 3v3 battles complete with elemental weaknesses and super moves. When you aren’t collecting or battling with Sujimon, you can also escape to an abandoned resort island, take it over, and restore it to its former glory in an entire side game that plays like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/like-a-dragon-yakuza-infinite-wealth-animal-crossing-1850959672&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/like-a-dragon-yakuza-infinite-wealth-animal-crossing-1850959672"><em>Animal Crossing </em>for adults</a></span>. You can customize the placement of businesses and build the island out however you want. Residents will be attracted to the island based on how posh or sleazy it is, and throughout their stay, you can maximize their enjoyment by giving them gifts that align with their personalities and taking out the trash pirates trying to keep their hold on the land.<br></p><p>I could keep going. There’s a procedurally generated underground dungeon in the center of the town to grind away at. There’s crafting in case you come to RPGs to unlock ultimate weapons to decimate foes with. By interacting with the party members while running around town and drinking with them, you can unlock their personal quests, which make them more effective in battle and deepens your understanding of them. There are also dozens of side stories and side activities that I haven’t called out, like a <em>Pokémon Snap</em>-style game in which you ride a trolley and take pictures of insanely buff men in diapers. There’s also, coincidentally, a side story featuring a recurring crew of buff men that absolutely made me tear up, because if there’s one thing <em>Like a Dragon </em>loves to do, it’s sucker punch its audience in the most surprising and baffling manners.</p><p><em>Infinite Wealth </em>is a game for everyone. It’s the most game you’re going to play this year, and while there are tons of huge RPGs to play, I don’t think any of them are as routinely absurd and joyful as this one. Maybe pick up some of the older <em>Yakuza </em>games, too, just to get a handle on some of the characters and plotlines that are threaded throughout <em>Infinite Wealth </em>(especially Kiryu’s), but this game is an absolute time-suck and a steal at this price, so don’t sleep on it. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>It's seemingly confirmed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-rated-by-esrb-for-ps5-and-pc/">Horizon Zero Dawn is getting a remaster</a>, despite the fact it really doesn't need one. Sony is focusing on making the games look a bit cleaner and visually striking instead of rebooting or porting franchises that people actually care about. Although it hasn't been officially confirmed that a Horizon Zero Dawn remaster is coming, it's quite likely since the rumor has been floating around since 2022. People now believe this is happening because the supposed remastered version has been rated by the ESRB, listening to PC and PlayStation 5 as the platforms. In the latest Game Mess Morning, Jeff Grubb mentioned that there is a "less exciting" remaster to be announced at the State of Play.</p>
<p><iframe title="Alleged Images of Nintendo's New Switch Have Surfaced | Game Mess Mornings 09/18/24" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_KSS0zxxn3w?start=1100&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It's rumored that Horizon Zero Dawn will be getting a remaster to add more accessibility options. Both Lucy James and Jeff Grubb mentioned this in the conversation and said that while it would be good to see more accessibility options added, the game doesn't need a remaster to do so.</p>
<p>It wasn't particularly speculated on what the "less exciting" remaster could be, but <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/rumor-jeff-grubb-says-the-state-of-play-next-week-could-feature-another-less-exciting-remaster-besides-horizon-zero-dawn.984768/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the comments</a> suggest games such as God of War and God of War Ragnarok, with a lot of jest comments suggesting another Last of Us remaster. When thinking about what games could possibly be remastered, it's hard to think of any that are in dire need of it from the PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 5 category other than games like Bloodborne or even Demon's Souls onto PC.</p>
<p>The following State of Play is rumored to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-announced-state-of-play/">September 19-20, 2024</a>. However, Sony has not yet confirmed it. In this Game Mess Morning, they speculate that third-party partners will most likely present their games rather than giving players something that they want from first-party productions. Grubb goes on to say, "Prepare to be disappointed by the State of Play. They are marketing obligations more than they are anything else."</p>
<p>However, in the conversation, he mentioned that a game like Ghost of Tsushima needs to come out to make the PlayStation 5 Pro worthwhile, as it was a game that is well-loved by both PC and PlayStation players. It's even possible that this game could get a remaster, as it was released in 2020 for the PlayStation 4. Of course, there is the Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut that added an expansion and was released in 2021. However, it's possible that they could do what they did with The Last of Us and try to milk that game as much as possible by updating the graphics and adding more accessibility options.</p>

The winners will be inducted into the illustrious museum. Among those finalists are iconic tabletop games, including the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pokemon-trading-card-game" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Pokemon Trading Card Game</em></a>.</p>
<h2>The National Toy Hall of Fame Finalist Announcement</h2>
<p>According to National Museum of Play's <a href="https://www.museumofplay.org/exhibits/toy-hall-of-fame/2024-finalists/">official website</a>, the twelve National Toy Hall of Fame finalists were selected as part of their annual Player's Choice ballot. A method where toy fans can submit thousands of potential inductees to the museum.</p>

Balloons, hobbyhorses, trampolines, Hess Toy Trucks, and R/C cards. Two of them are even part of beloved toy franchises: <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/my-little-pony-dark-skies-over-equestria-review-changeling-mischief" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>My Little Pony</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/transformers-roleplaying-game-review" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Transformers</em></a>.</p>
<p>The other five National Toy Hall of Fame finalists are where things get interesting. They include the <em>Pokemon Trading Card Game</em>, Choose Your Own Adventure gamebooks, card games <em>Phase 10</em> and <em>Sequence</em>, and the board game <em>Apples to Apples</em>.</p>
<p>They are interesting since they aren't just toys; they are staples of tabletop gaming. Choose Your Own Adventure game books were pioneers in interactive narrative such as Dever's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/joe-devers-lone-wolf-series-returns-to-print" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Lone Wolf</em></a> series. <em>Apples to Apples</em> effectively set a template for the raunchier <em>Cards Against Humanity</em>.</p>

Second only to <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>, it is a game played by millions of people around the world with expansions <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/pokemon-company-previews-pokemon-tcg-stellar-crown-and-two-premium-boxes-are-coming" rel="noopener" target="_blank">releasing to this day</a>. Considering it first launched in 1996, that is an impressive cultural impact.</p>
<p>Only three of these twelve National Toy Hall of Fame finalists will be inducted into the National Museum of Play. If you are a fan of any of these options, you can <a href="https://www.museumofplay.org/players-choice-ballot/">vote for one</a> until September 25. The final three will be revealed this November.</p>

            <p>Farm life sim snowclone My Time At X is getting a third entry. My Time At Evershine looks to feature more sowing, reaping, kissing and combat, similar to the previous games My Time At Portia and My Time At Sandrock, but with a new art style, campaign co-op and citybuilding elements. You'll get a glimpse of the new art style in the announcement trailer below.

<p>The art style is still clearly anime-influenced, but the characters are more realistically proportioned than in the previous games. The overall effect seems specifically designed to make the boys hot, and fair play, they know their audience.
</p>
<p>All the systems seem to be getting amped up in some way, too. There's a new story campaign, with promises of "a more defined antagonist." The campaign is now playable in co-op, as well as solo. You can still build facilities and expand your town, but also now recruit and customise NPCs to handle day-to-day tasks around that town. You can befriend and smooch folks, but also recruit three followers to boss about.
</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/my-time-at-portia-review">My Time At Portia review</a> back in 2019 found a game that was ambitious and charming, but which perhaps stretched its ideas and resources too thinly. Our early access <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/my-time-at-sandrock-early-access-review">My Time At Sandrock review</a> meanwhile found a game that was similarly expansive but more polished even early in its development, "a compelling and lusciously detailed life simulator with an endlessly rewarding mine-and-build loop, and a set of diverse career paths so richly designed that it’s difficult to pursue them all." More of that seems a compelling prospect, then.
</p>
<p>Developers Pathea Games say they already have a substantial development budget for My Time At Evershine, but as per the previous games they're returning to Kickstarter to help expand the scope of development. You can <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mtae/my-time-at-evershine-the-next-my-time-tale">sign up here to be notified when the crowdfunder goes live</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Later in court, Fleck rebuts a witness on the stand. “You don’t think this is me?” he says. “Well maybe, maybe you don’t know who I really was.”</p><p>If <em>Joker: Folie à Deux</em> has some tricks up its sleeve, it’s hidden them very high up. While the first <em>Joker</em> was a new spin on the villain’s origin story fused with contemporary societal angst, the sequel will have to stand on its own two feet and potentially offer fans something more than just a deeper dive into the depraved psyche of its central character. Without a Batman to play off of, Gaga will have a lot to shoulder in terms of being a foil, rather than just a love interest or enabler, for the Joker. </p><p>The sequel hits theaters October 4 and continues a steady march of comic book movies this year, beginning with the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/madame-web-movie-reviews-rotten-tomatoes-reaction-1851264337?_gl=1*mquhm5*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNjY2Njg5MS4xNTAuMS4xNzI2Njg5MDE4LjYuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/madame-web-movie-reviews-rotten-tomatoes-reaction-1851264337?_gl=1*mquhm5*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNjY2Njg5MS4xNTAuMS4xNzI2Njg5MDE4LjYuMC4w">much maligned <em>Madame Web</em></a></span>, peaking with the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/deadpool-and-wolverine-credits-fox-marvel-goodbye-1851611168?_gl=1*1eg0atc*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNjY4NjkxMy42My4xLjE3MjY2ODg3MDMuMy4wLjA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/deadpool-and-wolverine-credits-fox-marvel-goodbye-1851611168?_gl=1*1eg0atc*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNjY4NjkxMy42My4xLjE3MjY2ODg3MDMuMy4wLjA.">box office juggernaut<em> Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em></a></span>, and continuing on now into the fall with <em>Joker: Folie à Deux</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/venom-last-dance-knull-explained-spider-man-marvel-1851647953&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/venom-last-dance-knull-explained-spider-man-marvel-1851647953"><em>Venom: The Last Dance</em></a></span>, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kraven-hunter-spider-man-trailer-rhino-deadpool-1851621883&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kraven-hunter-spider-man-trailer-rhino-deadpool-1851621883"><em>Kraven the Hunter</em></a></span>.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-new-details-on-the-next-battlefield-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-%E2%80%93-new-details-on-the-next-battlefield-game.984882/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-new-details-on-the-next-battlefield-game/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It’s been a good week for Battlefield fans. To start, the head honcho of Battlefield, Vince Zempella, confirmed <span>many details on&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insider Gaming’s past reporting</a>, including that Battlefield would return to 64-player matches, the classic four-class system, and&nbsp;</span>a more “back to basics approach.” Battlefield General Manager Bryon Beede also revealed that the game will have “large-scale community-driven testing” early next year, in addition to stating that the game has had nearly daily internal testing for over a year.</p>



<p>Zempella also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-modern-era/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed a “new experience”</a> from Ripple Effect, which Insider Gaming has reported will be Battlefield’s take on a new free-to-play Battle Royale to tie in with the game’s premium release, akin to how Call of Duty found success with Call of Duty: Warzone.</p>



<p>So what’s new? Following our original report and the recent confirmation of those details, we wanted to dive into some of the nitty-gritty details that players might want to hear. To start, let’s focus on the core of the game. Insider Gaming understands that the game will take place somewhere between 2027 and 2030, with the campaign focused on a massive private military going up against NATO. The game will be set in various locations worldwide, including Gibraltar (as seen in the game’s first released concept art) and the USA, which is also believed to be the setting for the Battle Royale experience (tropical location).</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="EXCLUSIVE: Brand New Battlefield Features And Details" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e4-UgSr8a-I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>But let’s cut to the chase and talk multiplayer. The aim is currently for 45 different weapons on launch, double that of what Battlefield 2042’s core multiplayer experience launched with. In addition, the goal is for around 10 multiplayer maps, putting it in line with the likes of Battlefield 1, 3, and 4.</p>



<p>The game will also see a significant overhaul to its destruction and while I couldn’t verify if this means the return of levolution, over half a dozen sources mentioned that the game would have caliber-based destruction, akin to Rainbow 6 Siege, with different calibers causing different amounts of destruction. It’s also understood that the game will see some changes to movement, with one example given by multiple sources the ability to pick up and move downed players. While this has almost certainly been incorporated for the Battle Royale experience, it’s been implied that this is all of the changes and is a part of the team’s “Battlefield moments” initiative to bring back the moments that made Battlefield… well… Battlefield. </p>



<p>I’ve also been told that the team is currently weighing up the name of the game. Over the past year or so, the team has been carrying out mass surveys (some of the biggest I’ve heard about), with participants voting on which game name they prefer: Battlefield or Battlefield 6. So, fingers crossed, we might not have to wait long until that is officially announced.</p>



<p>Finally, regarding “large-scale community-driven testing,” I am very much inclined to believe that this is more than just an open or closed beta but rather the return of the Battlefield CTE, which really helped the development of Battlefield 1 and 4.</p>



<p>Are you excited for Battlefield? Let us know in our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forums</a>, where I’ll also be doing a AMA later this week!</p>

Bursting at the seams with dungeon-crawling hijinks, <em>9th Dawn Re</em>make lovingly riffs on the original <em>9th Dawn</em> game—evamping the combat and streamlining quests to deliver a novel, exhilarating <em>9th Dawn</em> experience. <em>9th Dawn Remake</em> has also been localized into French, Spanish, German, Korean, Japanese, Simplified Chinese, and Brazilian Portuguese!</p><p><strong>New Features</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->

            <p>
If you're a Minecraft fan with a penchant for playing while wearing Sony's PlayStation-branded VR goggles, prepare youself for some disappointing news: developer Mojang has announced it's ending Minecraft's PSVR support in March next year.
</p>
<p>
Minecraft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-gets-playstation-vr-support-this-month">originally gained PSVR support</a> in September 2020, as a free upgrade for the PS4 version (this year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-for-ps5-is-finally-here">PS5 edition</a> doesn't include similar support for PSVR 2). However, the studio has now confirmed the feature's imminent demise in a <a href="https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/30220110283533-Minecraft-1-21-30-Bedrock">new post on its website</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Our ability to support PlayStation VR  has come to an end," the developer wrote, "and will no longer be supported in updates after March of 2025." But while PSVR functionality will cease, the game will remain playable outside of VR, and will continue to receive updates.

<p>
"From this point on," Mojang continued, "you can keep building in your worlds, and your Marketplace purchases (including Tokens) will continue to be available. You will no longer be able to use your PlayStation VR with Minecraft as it will no longer be supported in the latest updates."
</p>
<p>
Mojang's PSVR news was shared in release notes for Minecraft's latest Bedrock version, which introduces bug fixes, gameplay tweaks, and a new experimental Bundles feature. Bundles - which must be enabled when creating a new world - are crafted using one String above one Leather, and let players stack different blocks or items together in the same inventory slot to save space.
</p>
<p>
Today's update follows Mojang's recent announcement it'll be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-ditching-single-summer-update-for-more-regular-releases-ps5-version-incoming">ditching Minecraft's traditional single summer update</a> in favour of multiple content drops throughout the year.

            <p>I don't think I'm going out on a limb by saying that Ubisoft's best game of this year won't be Star Wars Outlaws or the as-yet unreleased Assassin's Creed Shadows, it'll be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown">Prince Of Persia: The Lost Crown</a>. The sidescrolling metroidvania is a rich, expansive, and surprisingly challenging take on a genre typically dominated by indies, and it's precisely the kind of game I wish mega-publishers produced more.
</p>
<p>It's also now got a story expansion, Mask Of Darkness, which came out yesterday.

<p>Marsk Of Darkness adds a new chapter accessible in The Lost Crown's late game, which traps protagonist Sargon in the mind palace of Radjen, one of the Immortals you spend your time with in the original's runtime. She was the only one of the group that didn't come to a clear resolution, which was a big flashing bulb signalling an inevitable expansion.
</p>
<p>Since this is a late-game DLC, it's expected that players will have unlocked all of Prince Of Persia's powers before you tackle it, and that you've attained some mastery of its tricky jumps, dashes, and blocks. Ubisoft recommend you refresh your skills by first playing the Divine Trials, which are 22 expert-level challenges that were added in a free patch back in June. 
</p>
<p>Honestly, those Divine Trials are thumb-breakingly hard, and I'd expect the story DLC to be a cut below overall, at least bar the no-doubt inevitable boss fight. Either way, The Lost Crown is the rare game which I finished wanting more of, which puts me in the unusual position of being the hypothetical target audience for an expansion. Break my thumbs, then.
</p>
<p>Mask Of Darkness costs £4.29/€5/$5, which doesn't seem too bad to me, via Ubisoft Connect and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown--mask-of-darkness">the Epic Games Store</a>. It's also available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3102580/Prince_of_Persia_The_Lost_Crown__Mask_of_Darkness/">via Steam</a>, since the game joined Valve's storefront <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-is-coming-to-steam-in-august">back in August</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And while the long-running animated series might not be as good as it was back in the day, many of these shorts have been fun, bite-sized reminders of how funny T<em>he Simpsons </em>can still be all these years later.

Past shorts have been focused on Christmas, Marvel characters, <em>Star Wars</em>, or that one about Lisa hanging out with Billie Eilish.

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1934680/Age_of_Mythology_Retold/"><em>Age of Mythology: Retold</em></a> brings a lot of the usual advancements that you'd expect for a reboot of both <a href="https://archive.arstechnica.com/reviews/02q3/Ageofmythology/aom-1.html">the increasingly dated 2002 original game</a> and its <em>previous</em> reboot: 2014's Extended Edition, which is still perfectly playable and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/266840/Age_of_Mythology_Extended_Edition/">available on Steam</a>. The newest version of this real-time strategy classic comes with the requisite improvements in graphics and user interface, making the whole game much easier to look at and parse at a glance. And while the updated voice acting isn't going to win any awards, neither is the stilted, bare bones dialogue that those actors are working with (which seems faithful to the original game, for better or worse).</p>
<p>But <em>Retold</em> does add one thing that I wasn't really expecting in a modern real-time strategy game—full support for a handheld controller. Developers have been trying to make RTS games work without the traditional mouse and keyboard since the days of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1mbIXFV498">SNES <em>Populous</em></a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2QAAWQMNuA"><em>Starcraft 64</em></a>, usually with limited success. Microsoft hasn't given up on the dream, though, fully integrating controller support for <em>Age of Mythology: Retold</em> into both the PC version (which we sampled) and, obviously, the Xbox Series X|S release.</p>
<p>The result is definitely the best version of an RTS controller interface that I've tried and proof that a modern controller can be a perfectly functional option for the genre. In the end, though, there are just a few too many annoyances associated with a handheld controller to make it the preferred way to play a game like this.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<h2>Too many functions, too few buttons</h2>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/aomcontroller.jpg" data-height="766" data-width="1361" alt="A detailed map."></a><figcaption><div><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/aomcontroller.jpg" data-height="766" data-width="1361">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> A detailed map.</p></div><p>Microsoft</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>To get a feel for what I mean, just look at the "Controls Popup" summarizing all the things a single controller needs to do in a game like <em>Age of Mythology</em>. The game makes full use of every single button and directional input on the Xbox gamepad for some function or other. Things are so crowded that commands like Stop and Delete need to be mapped to a combination of two shoulder buttons, with different functions for holding and tapping (and there are a few other multi-button menu toggles that aren't even listed here).</p>
<p>If anything, this diagram undersells the control complexity here. Tapping either trigger brings up context-sensitive radial menus full of general commands or construction options for the currently selected building. Finding the right option then often means scrolling through multiple pages of radial menus in this full-screen interface, an awkward solution to the problem of having too many options for too few buttons.</p>
<p>To the game's credit, it does its best to limit how much of this menu-based fumbling you have to do. Tapping the Y button when a building is selected, for instance, automatically starts construction on the most common unit you'd want to create with that building. And holding down the Y button maximizes the production queue for that building quickly, saving the need to spend a few seconds clicking through menus to do so.</p>
