The announcement comes a little over a month <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/707586/analogue-3d-4k-n64-delay-august-2025">after the console’s previous delay</a>, which would’ve seen it ship at the end of August.</p><p>While the July announcement cited the ongoing mess around tariffs as the reason for that delay, the cause for the current delay is less clear.</p><p>“Analogue has been moving at maximum pace, processing shipping to everyone who has been patiently waiting,” the company wrote in a statement. “Unexpected, uncommon issues are rare. Especially in a negligible degree under esoteric circumstances. We’re ensuring every detail meets our standard.” The statement added that the launch is “at 99% percent. Hardware, system, packaging — the full kit — been set for months. The last one percent is where we’re focused.”</p><p>The company also says that the currently vague Q4 timing is “intentionally set conservatively,” presumably to avoid having to announce another delay. Full refunds <a href="https://x.com/analogue/status/1958247804884677035">are available</a> for those who pre-ordered.</p><div><p>The Analogue 3D was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/16/23915941/analogue-3d-nintendo-64">first announced in 2023 with plans to launch the following year</a>, and was delayed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24265587/analogue-3d-nintendo-64-price-preorder-date">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/631816/analogue-3d-delay-nintendo-64-modretro-teaser">times</a> since then.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>After being in development for quite some time, Phantom Blade Zero will finally get a release date this year. The news comes from Future Games Show, which held a “Deep Dive” with the team. Alongside new gameplay, we got some new details on the combat and style.</p>



<p>Phantom Blade Zero follows an elite assassin tasked with finding the killer of The Order’s patriarch. It mixes the gameplay of Soulsborne titles and RPGs to craft an intricate combat system. Since its big reveal in 2023, fans have been hungry for more of the game, and Future Games Show delivered some promising news.</p>



<h2 id="h-phantom-blade-zero-s-release-date-announcement-happening-within-the-year">Phantom Blade Zero’s Release Date Announcement Happening Within The Year</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>In the deep dive at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpPmmXxffiQ">Future Games Show</a>, director Soulframe Liang showed off new gameplay of Phantom Blade Zero. In addition, we saw cool new weapons, over 30 in fact, and wicked action combat. However, the most notable comment was about the game’s release. At the end of the presentation, Liang said that, before the year ends, we will know when the game will come out. Whether the date is concrete or a release window remains to be seen.</p>



<p>The game has been played by critics from various sites not too long ago back in July. For many, the wuxia-inspired combat system and stunning visuals left a positive mark. Following the success of other Chinese games like Black Myth: Wukong and Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, Phantom Blade Zero could be the next big one, if done right.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">I don't know that we've ever seen a year quite like this one when it comes to new co-op experiences. From major-publisher-backed hits like Split Fiction and Grounded 2, to indie darlings like REPO and Peak, there hasn't just been a significant quantity of games meant for co-op play, but they've gone in so many different, yet similarly exciting, directions.</p><p dir="ltr">Still, I've been left wanting for one specific reason, and I imagine other parents can relate: It's hard to find games to play with my kids, so I'm glad <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/lego-voyagers/" data-ref-id="5000-681511">Lego Voyagers</a> is just around the corner.</p><p dir="ltr">Split Fiction, for example, may be regarded as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-co-op-games/2900-5361/">best co-op game</a> of the year and, more broadly speaking, a possible Game of the Year contender, much like It Takes Two before it. But Hazelight's co-op games aren't meant for smaller, less-experienced hands. Their puzzles and action sequences demand a lot from players, to the extent that I can't play it with my six-year-old, who is a lifelong gamer, but still finds such games a bit too chaotic to handle. And then there are games like REPO, a game about repossessing valuables from locales stalked by monsters, and Peak, where Boy Scouts scale mountains to reach help after a plane crash, but often plummet to their cartoonish deaths. While I'm personally okay with some of the more mature visuals and themes in these games and play them with my older child often, they can still ask too much of my youngest on the controller, and that's if their anxiety-inducing gameplay doesn't undo her.</p><p dir="ltr">Lego Voyagers thankfully avoids leaving me with these hang-ups as a gaming parent looking for the next great bonding experience. Instead, what I saw in a recent hands-on demo is a laid-back, creative play space full of platforming puzzles that felt welcoming to virtually anyone.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J4Zq-A6FAw" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1J4Zq-A6FAw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Filling in for my kids in my scheduled demo was my colleague, Jason Fanelli, who did a great job as my proxy child. In Lego Voyagers, we each took on the role of a small Lego brick featuring a single eye sticker. His red fella and my blue dude rolled around a world that looks very much like Light Brick Studio's earlier award-winning game, Lego Builder's Journey. Our path was paved with bricks constructed and colored to look like the sights you'd see on a nature walk. Quickly, we came upon a Lego playground, with various contraptions familiarizing us with the world's physics-based systems, before a rocket launch in the distance had us on our way to explore some more.</p><p dir="ltr">With the world consisting of what you could call a series of interconnected micro-sets, it was up to us to complete these dioramas with our ingenuity. In each section, Lego bricks of different shapes, sizes, and colors would be freely available for us to build a solution to a problem posed by the location. One of the earliest sections tasked us with traversing a gap over water. Naturally, a bridge was in order, so Jason and I worked together to build one. There was no timer, no enemy presence. It was just us, some loose bricks, and the problem in front of us. It gave me the distinct, familiar feeling of spilling out a bunch of Lego bricks onto a table and seeing what my kids and I come up with, free of any instruction booklet.</p><p dir="ltr">A bridge is simple enough--though I won't hide the fact that it took us a few minutes to master the building controls--but later sections demanded a bit more thought. Still, the level of strategy and controller inputs needed to succeed never got to the extent that I felt like any would-be players would be left behind due to a skill gap, at least not from what I've played so far. I got the sense this was an intentional choice, which we'll hopefully see throughout the entire game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4553481-legovoyagers_screenshot_06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4553481" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4553481-legovoyagers_screenshot_06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4553481"></a><figcaption>You'll build bridges, both literal and figurative, in Lego Voyagers.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4553481-legovoyagers_screenshot_06.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As an example of the types of puzzles you'll face, one memorable moment saw us needing to throw together a bunch of loose cylindrical pieces, creating a tall pole-like object. With each of us at an end of this pole, we could climb the terrain, wobbling up and over each natural step, moving end over end like a stiff Slinky. It was very satisfying, and though I'm sure this was the intended solution, the game's physics meant the answer still felt imprecise and experimental in a manner that ties nicely with Lego.</p><p dir="ltr">Like those aforementioned Hazelight games, Lego Voyagers must be played in co-op. There's no solo mode, and that's for good reason. The entire game's aesthetic creates the sense of a cozy bonding experience built specifically for two people to collaborate and enjoy each other's company. It's made complete with a soft soundtrack of chill, lo-fi music that I instantly adored.</p><p dir="ltr">As a whole, the game reminded me of the difference between a Studio Ghibli movie made for kids and something like The Minions Movie. The former balances adolescent whimsy with its mature writing so well, trusting its younger audience to get on its level, and leaving space for its world to breathe. The latter feels like a loud ad for a sugary cereal that no "balanced breakfast" actually requires. Surely there can be times for each type of experience, but I really appreciated how Light Brick Studio sought to provide an environment more conducive to restful, creative play.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4553483-legovoyagers_screenshot_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4553483" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4553483-legovoyagers_screenshot_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4553483"></a><figcaption>Waterfront property is a bit more affordable in Lego form.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4553483-legovoyagers_screenshot_01.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Growing up with Lego, I've always found something so meditative about its building process; working through its numbered instructions can put a person in something like a flow state as they thoughtfully place each brick where it belongs. Playing Lego Voyagers gave me a strong sense of that familiar feeling I never outgrew, and I'm excited my kids will be able to enjoy it with me, just like when we decorate the dining room table with hundreds of colorful toy bricks.</p><p dir="ltr">LEGO Voyagers launches on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch on September 15.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/delta-force/" data-ref-id="5000-621469">Delta Force</a> is a free-to-play tactical FPS that offers explosive 32v32 battles across three unique modes. With so many players in each match, it's perfectly reasonable to expect cross-play support to ensure that you're always able to find enough players to fill out each team. Plus, if you're trying to play with your friends, you'll want to be sure you can all group up together regardless of your platform preferences. So, let's take a look at Delta Force's cross-play situation, as well as break down its cross-progression situation.</p><h2>Does Delta Force have cross-play?</h2><p><strong>Yes, Delta Force does have cross-play between PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC players</strong>. But players on those platforms can not play with anyone on iOS or Android, as the mobile versions are only cross-play with one another.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgXRDS1_GEs" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QgXRDS1_GEs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>If you're on console, you can check in <strong>Settings &gt; Game</strong> to ensure you have cross-play toggled on. If you'd prefer to only play with folks on consoles, you'll want to keep this toggled off. However, if your friends are on PC, this has to be toggled on for you to play with them. The game does not have a cross-play toggle on PC, meaning PC players will always be placed in potentially mixed lobbies.</p><h2>Does Delta Force have cross-progression?</h2><p>Cross-progression in Delta Force is a bit complicated. Everything revolves around a <a href="https://pass.levelinfinite.com/?lang=en" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Level Infinite Pass</a> (rather humorously abbreviated to LIPASS), and if you're not careful, you may encounter limitations that can stop you from being able to use cross-progression altogether.</p><p>If you've already played Delta Force on PC or mobile, you'll have already been forced to sign up for a LIPASS, as it's required on those platforms. As such, <strong>make sure you immediately sign in to your LIPASS account when you first start the game on console</strong>. If you play the game without linking to your LIPASS account, you'll be blocked from using cross-progression.</p><p>If you're just starting Delta Force on console and have never played it elsewhere, you'll still want to make sure you <strong>create a LIPASS account when prompted on your first bootup</strong>. If you fail to do so, your account will be stuck on the console you're on, meaning you can never carry your progress to any other platform in the future.</p><p>If you're a console player and know beyond a shadow of a doubt you'll never play Delta Force on any other platform, you can skip creating a LIPASS account. Again, however, just be aware that you'll never be able to move that progress over if you change your mind, so give it some careful consideration before making that decision.</p>

			<p>Wolcen Studio has finally revealed the real title of its PvPvE extraction game, which, up until now, we've only known as <a href="https://wccftech.com/wolcen-studios-project-pantheon-will-host-its-second-closed-alpha-test-later-this-month/">Project Pantheon</a>. It's officially called Gods, Death, and Reapers, and we just got a new gameplay trailer showcased during the Future Games Show at Gamescom 2025.</p>



<p>The isometric RPG is still fairly early in development, as there was no release date or even release window announced alongside the official title reveal, but it is available for you to try if you're interested. Just head over to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3086590/Gods_Death__Reapers/">Steam page</a> and request access for the closed playtest to jump in now.</p>

<p>"<em>Gamescom 2025 marks a huge milestone for us as we finally get to share&nbsp;</em><em>Gods, Death &amp; Reaper</em>'s official name and gameplay with the world," said game director Andrei Chirculete in a press release. "<em></em><em>Gods, Death &amp; Reapers</em>&nbsp;is a game that started from one simple idea: what if you could play an extraction game that looks like a top-down ARPG? Now that this idea has turned into&nbsp;<em>Gods, Death &amp; Reapers</em>, we can't wait to hear from our players what they think, as it will help us shape up the best version throughout the coming Closed Alpha tests!"</p>



<p>To learn more about Project Pantheon, now Gods, Death, &amp; Reapers, you can <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-pantheon-qa-a-post-apocalyptic-fantasy-extraction-arpg-from-the-makers-of-wolcen/">check out our interview with Wolcen Studio from earlier this year</a>, after a conversation with the team at Gamescom 2024.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Publisher Xbox Game Studios and developers Team Ninja/PlatinumGames have unveiled the official PC system requirements for Ninja Gaiden 4 on the game's store pages. From the looks of it, the game will be very easy to run, considering that the GPU listed in the minimum requirements is the GTX 1060 which launched nine years ago. Granted, this will be at 1080p resolution, 30 frames per second, AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution set to Quality, and everything set to Low. To play at 1080p resolution and 60 frames per second with Medium settings, you will need an RTX 2060 SUPER.</p>



<p><strong>Minimum:<br></strong>OS: Windows® 10/11, 64bit<br>Processor: Intel® Core™ i5-8400 or AMD Ryzen™ 5 3400G<br>Memory: 16 GB RAM<br>Graphics: NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 1060 (VRAM 6GB) or ​ AMD Radeon™ RX 590(VRAM 8GB)<br>DirectX: Version 12<br>Storage: 100 GB available space<br>Sound Card: 16bit 48kHz ステレオ<br>Additional Notes: SSD Required. ​ 1080p / 30FPS​ FSR quality "Low"​ Object Quality "Low"</p>



<p><br><strong>Recommended:<br></strong>OS: Windows® 10/11, 64bit<br>Processor: Intel® Core™ i5-10400 or AMD Ryzen™ 5 3600<br>Memory: 16 GB RAM<br>Graphics: NVIDIA® GeForce® RTX 2060 Super(VRAM 8GB) or AMD Radeon™ RX 5700XT(VRAM 8GB)<br>DirectX: Version 12<br>Storage: 100 GB available space<br>Sound Card: 16bit 48kHz ステレオ<br>Additional Notes: SSD Required. ​ 1080p / 60FPS ​ FSR Quality "Middle"​ Object Quality "Middle"</p>



<p>Unlike <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-2-black-the-edge-of-the-dragon-sword/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a>, which was remade with Unreal Engine 5, Ninja Gaiden 4 is believed to run on PlatinumGames' proprietary engine. This engine prioritizes performance over visuals, especially for this type of action games that require low latency (and, therefore, high frame rates) to execute pitch-perfect moves.  </p>



<p>The game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-gameplay-gamescom-onl-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">playable for the first time at Gamescom 2025</a>. Our Francesco De Meo checked it out earlier today, so stay tuned for his hands-on impressions. Hint: as a long-time fan, he was favorably impressed.</p>



<p>The full game will be released on October 21 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>The other shoe has dropped at Cloud Chamber. Following an internal delay and management shakeup, the studio making <em>BioShock 4</em> has now laid off 80 people, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-20/take-two-guts-bioshock-studio-after-a-decade-of-development"><em>Bloomberg</em> reports</a>. Originally, the sequel had supposedly been targeting a late 2026 release, but it will likely take longer now as significant aspects of the game, including the story, are reworked.</p> <p>Layoffs announced on Tuesday amounted to about a third of the staff at the roughly 250-person studio. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, the next <em>BioShock</em> has gone through multiple studios and leadership teams over the last decade, with problems arising at Cloud Chamber in part due to the need to create a new studio while also meeting sky-high expectations for the franchise. One of the stumbling blocks was reportedly its rapid growth and the game’s shift to the newest version of Unreal Engine.</p> <p>“While we’re excited about the foundational gameplay elements of the project, we’ve made the decision with studio leadership to rework certain aspects that are core to a <em>BioShock</em> game, and in doing so are reducing the size of the development team to focus on this work and give the game more time in development,” 2K Games president David Ismailer <a href="https://kotaku.com/bioshock-4-delay-layoffs-rod-fergusson-diablo-gears-2000618449">wrote in a memo to staff</a> this week that was shared with <em>Kotaku</em>.</p> <p><em>Bloomberg</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/bioshock-4-delay-cloud-chamber-2k-take-two-remake-2000614413">reported</a> earlier this month that<em> BioShock</em> 4’s latest stumble occurred following a negative internal review with executives, with particular concern about the game’s narrative. Publicly, 2K Games has said that the new <em>BioShock</em> is good but not good enough. “Some of our competitors have realized maybe a little late in the day that consumers are not okay with okay,” Strauss Zelnick, CEO of 2K parent company Take-Two, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-4-is-going-to-come-out-take-two-ceo-strauss-zelnick-promises-that-i-can-say-hand-on-heart-without-question">told <em>IGN</em></a> in a recent interview. Industry veteran Rod Fergusson is now leading the project, <a href="https://kotaku.com/bioshock-infinite-update-multiplayer-modes-cut-gears-5933119">the second time</a> he’s been tasked with clawing a <em>BioShock</em> game out of development hell.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Take-Two Interactive has laid off around 30% of staff at Cloud Chamber, the studio behind the next BioShock game, reports state.</p>



<p>Already a decade into development, the next BioShock game was due to be released in late 2026 or early 2027, but it will be delayed further, with the decision made to give the game more time in development.</p>



<p>More than 80 jobs were cut in the changes, with the studio said to have around 250 employees before the layoffs, representing a huge portion of the workforce.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Long wait. Image via 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p>The details are shared by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-20/take-two-guts-bioshock-studio-after-a-decade-of-development?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NTcxNDU0NSwiZXhwIjoxNzU2MzE5MzQ1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMUIxVEZHUFFRN1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.zVepbosqQPRpkHaMvUcaBAlKk73_0IkMGOvNKaKU6mE&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier</a>, which includes an email sent to staff by 2K President David Ismailer that states a decision was made to “rework certain aspects that are core to a BioShock game.”</p>



<p>This resulted in “reducing the size of the development team to focus on this work and give the game more time in development,” although BioShock is already one of the longest-running productions in gaming history.</p>



<p>Plans for the next BioShock instalment began in 2014, the year after the release of BioShock Infinite, though there were significant changes as Irrational Games, originally at the helm, was shattered by 2K after director Ken Levine left to start a smaller studio within Take-Two.</p>



<p>The report from Bloomberg says the trouble didn’t end there, with Certain Affinity taking the reins and working on the game for roughly two years, and a deal to acquire the studio fell through. Take-Two then decided to start an in-house studio to lead development, hiring in 2017 for what would become Cloud Chamber.</p>



<p>It’s not clear what the plan is now for the next BioShock game, though it’s clear that there won’t be a release window anytime soon, as the long wait will rumble on.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Infinity Nikki is getting some sort of crossover collaboration with Stardew Valley beginning September 1, and though we really have no idea what all it involves, there are already some surprisingly mixed reactions coming from the community in the wake of the announcement. But it's not Stardew Valley's fault - it's the result of five months of increasing community frustration directed at Infinity Nikki's developer, Infold.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🌟 Dear Stylists,</p><p>We're overjoyed to announce an official collaboration with the beloved Stardew Valley!</p><p>Cozy surprises await you, and adventure is in the air. Prepare your senses for a harvest of wonders.</p><p>The collaboration begins on September 1st (UTC-7). The first seeds of… <a href="https://t.co/JfnYECzqpr" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/JfnYECzqpr</a></p></div>— Infinity Nikki (@InfinityNikkiEN) <a href="https://twitter.com/InfinityNikkiEN/status/1958125632539558069?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 20, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from a video posted to the official Infinity Nikki Twitter/X account, that shows Stardew Valley's Junimos entering the world of Infinity Nikki. "Cozy surprises await you, and adventure is in the air," reads the post. "Prepare your senses for a harvest of wonders." While it's fairly likely this means new outfits for Nikki, there's really nothing to indicate exactly what the collaboration entails. It's also impossible to tell if anything Infinity Nikki will show up on the Stardew Valley side, especially since Stardew crossovers have been few and far between over the years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this news seems like it would be entirely positive, one glance at the community suggests that's not the case. What players are mad about isn't the collaboration itself, though, but the announcement's timing and framing following ongoing tension between the Infinity Nikki community and developer Infold.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The community has been riled up for some time, ever since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/infinity-nikki-players-threaten-to-uninstall-the-game-as-dev-introduces-controversial-changes-with-update-15">update 1.5 this past April</a> added some controversial changes to the game. The changes were multifaceted - some seemed to retcon Infinity Nikki's story, while others caused player frustration by ramping up the money and time investments required to collect full outfits. In response, the community launched a boycott campaign that they ultimately had to rename a "girlcott" when official Infinity Nikki channels appeared to block the use of the word "boycott" entirely. While Infold did apologize and rectify some of the issues, not all of them were fixed, the community remained dissatisfied, and the studio <a href="https://www.pockettactics.com/infinity-nikki/interview" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dodged further questions posed by reporters</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But more recently, a new controversy has struck. Infold notoriously doesn't reveal new outfits or new updates until right before they're due to launch, which over time has led to leakers sharing outfits in advance so the community can make better decisions about whether or not to spend money on certain outfits, or wait for the next update.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Early this week, however, Infold decided it had enough, and <a href="https://x.com/InfinityNikkiEN/status/1957367080074007028" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published a lengthy essay on its social channels</a> denouncing leakers, complete with an image that reads, "<strong>LEAKS</strong>, [sic] ARE <strong>POISON</strong> TO ALL CREATION!!"</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Dear Stylists, </p><p>We recently became aware that some unauthorized development materials from our game have been illegally shared on multiple platforms. These creative works were meant to be revealed at the right time, but instead have been exposed through improper channels.</p><p>Since… <a href="https://t.co/q6oeze3dk5" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/q6oeze3dk5</a></p></div>— Infinity Nikki (@InfinityNikkiEN) <a href="https://twitter.com/InfinityNikkiEN/status/1957367080074007028?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 18, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the message in full:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's not all, though. That "Pounding Hammer" given out in the game alongside this message? It's got a fascinating item description in-game: "There are moments when one's hands itch, eager to raise a mighty hammer toward a certain target."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Needless to say, the community is <em>not thrilled.</em> Since this message, players have been expressing frustration on various Infinity Nikki social channels, arguing that the message was juvenile, unnecessarily harsh, and ignored the real issue the community is facing: that people feel they can't make informed decisions about how to spend their money because the studio doesn't communicate its plans well. Players are rallying in support of the leakers now, though others are pushing back, arguing that Infold has a right to go after leakers and announce updates when and how it chooses.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/20/hiwtmqm2rujf1-1755712261781.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image source: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/InfinityNikki/comments/1mu0c6z/until_the_day_i_die_ill_never_rat_on_a_leaker/">https://www.reddit.com/r/InfinityNikki/comments/1mu0c6z/until_the_day_i_die_ill_never_rat_on_a_leaker/</a></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Which brings us back to Stardew Valley. No one's actually mad about Stardew Valley - in fact, there's plenty of fun speculation about what outfits might be tied to the collaboration. What players are upset about is the timing, which some are suggesting is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/InfinityNikki/comments/1mvdn1d/infinity_nikki_community/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all-too-convenient</a> to distract from the controversy around leakers. While most recognize that the timing is coincidental (Gamescom is this week, it's understandable Infold would have something big to announce), the fundamental problems the community has with the studio continue to go unanswered, and seem likely to be swept under the rug again in the wake of another cute outfit reveal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's just too bad for Stardew and its fans, who rarely get crossovers like this and are now caught in the middle. Poor Junimos.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. You can find her posting on BlueSky @duckvalentine.bsky.social. Got a story tip?

The player takes on the role of a broken but powerful ex-soldier named Clem, a war veteran, talented fighter and expert mech pilot. Clem attempts to shed the guilt and shame of her past and become a legitimate force for good in the Red Expanse, a post-post-apocalyptic version of the American Southwest.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Customizable Mech Action</strong> – You pilot the Desert Raptor MKII, a Mech of extraordinary power. It is a highly-customizable battle vehicle that can be equipped with a variety of offensive systems: heavy, high-powered melee weapons, steam powered hydraulic siege weapons, explosive firearms, and more. It can also be equipped with a variety of defensive systems; high-speed thrusters, boosters for dashing, riot shields, among others.</li><li><strong>Become a Bounty Hunter</strong> – The Red Expanse is a rich farming and mercantile region plagued by violent <a title="Companies > crim [23 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">crim</a>inals and dangerous beasts. The government that remains outsources justice to experts like Clem—bounty hunters who are free to pursue their targets into whatever dangerous corners of the world they hide. She’ll fight her way through many corners of the region and deal with these marks as she sees fit.</li><li><strong>Repair and Upgrade Your Homestead</strong> – Clem comes into an isolated and run-down garage that serves as a suitable base of operations and home—just barely. Build out water and power supply lines, grow and cook food, produce ammunition and fuel for combat, and raise animals. This decrepit ruin has a lot of potential, but it will have to grow alongside Clem.</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->

			<p>Fellowship, a multiplayer online dungeon adventure game, or "<em>MODA</em>," as its developer Chief Rebel calls it, will launch in Early Access on Steam this coming October 9, 2025, developer Chief Rebel and publisher Arc Games have announced during the Future Games Show 2025 presentation. You'll be able to try it out ahead of that launch, though, as it'll have an open beta for players next month, from September 18-23.</p>



<p> "<em>All dungeons, all the time</em>," the trailer from today's Future Games Show boasts as it showcases new gameplay from the co-op adventure game, and that really is Fellowship's whole pitch. When <a href="https://wccftech.com/fellowship-hands-on-and-qa-a-game-all-about-mmo-like-dungeons/">Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo played the upcoming MODA earlier this year</a> ahead of one of its public playtests, he noted that "<em>strips practically everything else, such as open world and narrative content, focusing entirely on the dungeon mechanics, with the goal of providing a highly replayable cooperative experience with some competitive elements through leaderboards and the like."</em></p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>According to a press release, Chief Rebel plans to keep the game in early access for six months before reaching its 1.0 launch next year. While the early access version will include all the dungeons you might've already seen during public playtests or that you will see in the upcoming open beta, Chief Rebel is planning to have more playable content arrive as part of the 1.0 version. </p>



<p>The studio will also launch a cosmetics store with the full-game launch, though these cosmetics will remain optional and will not have an impact on gameplay. </p>



<p>Fellowship will be available for $24.99 USD on PC when it launches on October 9.</p>

			<p>Ubisoft doesn't have the biggest presence at <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom 2025</a>, but it's not entirely absent from the festivities. <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-release-date-ps5-xbox-series-xbox-game-pass/">The Rogue Prince of Persia was shadow-dropped</a>, and now a new province coming to Anno 117: Pax Romana has been debuted at the convention, alongside the news that fans will get their first chance to play it next month with a free demo launching on September 2, 2025.</p>



<p>The new province is Albion, bringing its wet lands and expanding on Latium, the province that was first shown off and the one that houses Rome. </p>



<p>Albion is a Celtic province, and it'll be your choice whether you want to keep and encourage Celtic traditions or assimilate the province under Roman customs. Either is viable, but whatever you choose will require its own unique approach and will further shape your own journey in Anno 117: Pax Romana.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Regarding the demo coming next month, it'll only be available for a limited time, from September 2-16 on Steam, the Epic Games Store, and of course, Ubisoft Connect. So if you want to check it out ahead of its launch this coming <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-reveals-release-date-for-anno-117-pax-romana-a-1-0-release-window-for-the-rogue-prince-of-persia-and-showcases-a-new-game-morbid-metal-at-sgf-2025/">November 13</a>, then make sure to clear your gaming schedule for those two weeks, since there's no limit on how many times you can replay the demo.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We recently reviewed <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/witcher-path-of-destiny-review-when-theme-is-only-skin-deep" rel="nofollow">The Witcher: Path of Destiny</a>, and while we were unimpressed by its lack of strategic depth and paper-thin&nbsp;<em>The Witcher </em>theme, we persevered with the available expansions to see if they added anything more to it. Some of these expansions are crowd-funding only, and we'll specify which are available and retail and which aren't.</p>

<p>We previously covered <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/witcher-old-world-review" rel="nofollow">The Witcher: Old World</a> and its <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/witcher-old-world-expansions-review" rel="nofollow">expansions</a>, as well as the recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/unmatched-witcher-realms-fall-and-steel-and-silver-review" rel="nofollow">Unmatched sets</a>, featuring characters from <em>The Witcher</em>. You can also read our review of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/witcher-3-wild-hunt-review-new-benchmark-for-rpgs" rel="nofollow">The Witcher 3</a>, and check out our&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/witcher-4-official-reveal" rel="nofollow">news</a> for the upcoming <em>The Witcher 4</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-witcher-path-of-destiny-expansions-2.jpg?itok=ELtz6eF_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-witcher-path-of-destiny-expansions-2.jpg?itok=rDRLM61Y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Witcher Path of Destiny</em>&nbsp;Stretch Goals boxes includes more of the same from the core box, but also with some fantastic legacy elements.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Witcher: Path of Destiny Stretch Goals</h2>

<p>In <em>The Wticher: Path of Destiny</em> Stretch Goals box from the crowdfunding campaign, there are several new characters, stories, and extra play options, some of which will be available at retail eventually, and some are exclusive to the crowdfunding.</p>

<p>The <em>Path of Destiny</em> stretch goals box includes:</p>

<ul><li>5 new characters</li>
	<li>5 new tales</li>
	<li>Companion and Villain additional play options</li>
	<li>Voice of Reason additional play options</li>
	<li>A new solo opponent board</li>
</ul><p>The 5 new characters offer more of the same from the core game. They're a welcome addition, providing multiple options, including for solo opponents, but they still lack the depth and feeling I'd like in order for them to feel like real characters. Dijkstra and Letho feel the most thematic, with Dijkstra's initiative interaction and card selection abilities, and Letho's messing with other players, but they're all still let down by the once-per-game abilities that don't have a consistent enough impact to make you feel any different from any other character.</p>

<p>The 5 new tales offer a huge amount of replayability from those in the core set, giving 8 in total when all combined, but they all suffer from the core mechanics' lack of depth. The Skellige tale is the most stand-out, with a built-in mini-game where you try to work out who the killer could be.</p>

<p>The Companion and Villain cards add some more interaction with a companion card being placed by one of the face-up card drafts and offering use of their ability if the player picks those cards. 5 companions are available, each with 5 cards (except Zoltan, who has 6, including the crowdfunding exclusive Field Marshal Windbag card). The villains are all crowdfunding exclusives, with 2 of them, Leo and Vilgefortz, having 3 of their cards suffed into the normal card deck, gaining the players victory points when they're defeated, and Gaunter offering a pact, with a victory point bonus or loss if its condition is met or not.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-witcher-path-of-destiny-expansions-3.jpg?itok=EyaP72ZF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-witcher-path-of-destiny-expansions-3.jpg?itok=3HdBfg_q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Witcher Path of Destiny </em>Triss A Grain of Truth expansion sees the first of the stretch goals box releasing to retail.</figcaption></figure><p>The Voice of Reason envelopes offer a legacy element to the game, with 9 envelopes (1 for each of the 8 tales and 1 for the <em>Path of Destiny Ronin</em> tale). Once the conditions on the envelopes are met, they can be opened and their components added to your game. We won't spoil any here, but it is very cool to have elements permanently added when playing through new tales, especially if you're playing with the same group, or through a solo play-through campaign.</p>

<p>The stretch goals also include a double-sided solo board for playing against the Crimson Avenger/Crimson Asshole, which adds a bit more variety on top of the 5 extra solo boards for the new characters in this pack.</p>

<p>The first retail release that includes the strech goals products is Triss A Grain of Truth, which has the Triss character, the Grain of Truth tale and the miniatures for both in the pack.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-witcher-path-of-destiny-expansions-4.jpg?itok=pIUNfgm2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-witcher-path-of-destiny-expansions-4.jpg?itok=AsjAYn7u 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Witcher Path of Destiny </em>Legendary Monsters pack remove the tales cards and as a result, improves its grasp of theme and makes it more fun.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Witcher: Path of Destiny Legendary Monsters</h2>

<p>The Legendary Monsters expansion for<em> The Witcher: Path of Destiny </em>feels like what I wanted the core game to be. The focus is on fighting 1 of 4 available monsters, Ancient Leshen, Hym, Katakan, and Aguara. There are no tale cards, and the sole symbol is the fight symbol, with players needing to convert the other symbols to deal damage, or keep them to meet condition cards to gain experience.</p>

<p>This focus feels like it should have been the core gameplay all along. It doesn't even need to be monsters, the story cards could have contained the element players needed to work towards, chipping away at the target number, rather than the disconnected focus of trying to get symbols and work out what others might be getting. It's such a simple change, but the Legendary Monsters expansion completely changed my <em>Path of Destiny</em> experience and brought the theme to the front. The characters still don't feel unique or thematic enough for me, but the end experience was much more rewarding, it's just a shame it focuses on combat and not the other elements that make <em>The Witcher</em> so great.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-witcher-path-of-destiny-expansions-5.jpg?itok=JoCwos2c 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-witcher-path-of-destiny-expansions-5.jpg?itok=G6CmsxGm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Witcher Path of Destiny </em>Wild Hunt makes the core game 1 v many, and again improves the gameplay considerably.</figcaption></figure>

<p>The Wild Hunt is another great <em>The Witcher: Path of Destiny</em> expansion that changes the gameplay to either 1 player controlling the Wild Hunt vs all the other players, or a solo player playing against the automa Wild Hunt. It uses the expansions' own Tale and follows mostly the same rules as the core game, only this time you are competing directly against the Wild Hunt, with their own character board.</p>

<p>On top of their character board, there is also a general's play mat that each of the 4 Wild Hunt generals advances on a track, gaining effects as they do. Each general also has an ability card that usually causes issues for the other players. These abilities, combined with the standard abilities on the player board, go some way to making the Wild Hunt feel thematically worthwhile, which will leave the other player feeling pretty jealous with their bland characters with limited in-game effects.</p>

<p>As with Legendary Monsters, it's such a shame that this is an expansion, and not the core gameplay, because it locks you into the single tale in this pack, rather than being able to take the most thematically feeling parts of the expansions, and use them in the core game. This means that while both of these expansions are fun, the replayability is limited, while the core, more lifeless game, has 8 tales for a lot more replayability.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-witcher-path-of-destiny-expansions-6.jpg?itok=f7ga5e3x 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-witcher-path-of-destiny-expansions-6.jpg?itok=0oY6SPtk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Witcher Path of Destiny </em>Naglfar expansion adds to the Legendary Monsters and Wild Hunt expansion sets.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Witcher: Path of Destiny Naglfar</h2>

<p>The Naglfar mini expansion for <em>The Witcher: Path of Destiny</em> is a crowdfunding excuslive expansion for the Wild Hunt, or Legendary Monsters expansions, and requires the core game and one of those expansions to use.</p>

<p>In the Wild Hunt, the Naglfar ship protects a general from the players, and the players get access to the Broken Sextant cards to offset that, which do things like ignore the ability of the general protected by the Naglfar. In Legendary Monsters, you can use the Naglfar expansion to make the Wild Hunt a monster against which the players battle.</p>

<p>It's a nice expansion, adding another dynamic to the game, but if you missed it at crowdfunding, it's not an essential gameplay inclusion, unless you love Legendary Monsters, in which case this adds more than it does to the Wild Hunt expansion.</p>

<p>The Geralt on Roach expansion for <em>The Witcher: Path of Destiny</em> is a crowdfunding-only expansion and won't be available at retail. Luckily, it doesn't add much to games, so if you missed it, you're not missing out on much. The expansion includes a miniature, a player board, and 5 starting cards for Geralt on Roach.</p>

<p>The miniature, as you would expect, shows Geralt mounted on Roach, drawing one of his trademark swords from his back. The player board changes Geralts' once-per-game abilities from the core set, adding in some randomness, allowing you to reveal a random card for an effect. The 5 starting cards are exactly the same as those in the core set, just with different art.</p>

<p>The one area that would have made this expansion interesting would have been a change to the starting cards. They're what gives you the most strategy in game, and differentiate the characters the most from each other. The once-per-game effects have little serious effect, and Geralt on Roach's are completely random, so beyond using the expansion once for fun, you'll be back using the core set Geralt.</p>

<p><em>The Witcher: Path of Destiny Ronin</em> isn't an expansion for <em>The Witcher: Path of Destiny,</em>&nbsp;it's a standalone game that uses most of the rules from the core game, with a few subtle differences. The main difference in the mechanics is that between each player, an alliance board is placed. These boards allow players to unlock their partner's abilities for use, which is done by playing matching symbols on the cards used in the draft, which include teacups facing different directions. Players need to play these cards facing each other to progress on the alliance board.</p>

<p>The other difference is that the tale cards don't have any text on them, the chapter cards simply detail which symbols are the active symbol for that chapter, and 2 of the 4 active symbol cards are put on the board. Victory and experience points are also reversed from the core game, with players now scoring victory points for the active symbol they have the least of, and experience points for the active symbol they have the most of.</p>

<p>Aside from the aesthetics, which are thematically glorious, <em>Path of Destiny: Ronin</em> doesn't feel that much different from the core game, which is still that the characters don't feel much different from each other, and apart from the focus on partnerships, it doesn't really feel much like <em>The Witcher,</em> and the card playing to match symbols feels a bit lifeless when compared to the art and components.</p>

<p>The art throughout is great, and when combined with the bamboo play mat, it looks amazing on the tabletop. It's just a shame that it won't be out much, because the core gameplay isn't up to scratch, and the fact that it is completely standalone, so the good parts of Legendary Monsters, the Wild Hunt, and the tale elements of the core game can't even be used as part of it.</p>

<h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On The Witcher: Path of Destiny Expansions?</h2>

<p><em>The Witcher: Path of Destiny</em> has some great expansions. Wild Hunt and Legendary Monsters both make the game feel like <em>The Witcher</em>, and should have been the core game. The fact that most are incompatible with each other just emphasizes the lack of join up with the products. The stretch goals, with the extra characters and tales, just add more of the same, and don't help the mechanics grip the theme, or add much variety beyond the tales' flavor text and once-per-game abilities of the characters. The voice of reason envelopes are a great addition, and add a fantastic legacy feel to the game, especially when playing in a consistent group, but I'm not sure the mechanics have the scope for that level of replayability, when all the new character and tale variety just add more of the same lack of depth.</p>

<p><em>Path of Destiny Ronin</em> looks glorious, and the gameplay changes are interesting, but it changes nothing in terms of how light the gameplay feels, and the lack of difference between the characters fails to capture any feeling of theme with them. It's also frustrating that it's completely standalone, and none of the other expansions, which are what save the core game, can be added to this.</p>
