			<p>Michael '<a href="https://www.nintendo-insider.com/pachter-nintendos-a-bad-company-with-iwata-a-poor-ceo/">Nintendo is a bad company</a>' Pachter, also known as Michael '<a href="https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2022/03/10/michael-pachter-on-ps5-vs-xbox-series-x/">PlayStation is doomed</a>' Pachter, and sometimes known as Michael Pachter, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-01-24/this-netflix-analyst-has-cost-investors-a-2-000-return">the analyst who cost investors a 2,000% return when he advised them to sell their Netflix stock</a>, is back to an old stomping ground with a new claim that "<em>Sony is blowing it in the games business,</em>" because he predicts that games will move to cloud-based experiences connected to your TVs.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CktSxc9_4uk&amp;t=706s">Yahoo Finance</a> discussion (spotted on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/michael-pachter-sony-is-a-terrible-company-they-are-blowing-it-in-the-games-business-games-are-moving-to-connected-tv-via-the-cloud.1312330/">ResetEra</a>) about <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-55-billion-deal-might-bring-massive-layoffs-ai-pivot-20-billion-debt/">EA going private through its $55 billion sale</a> and where people should place their stock market bets in the videogame industry, when asked if people should be buying Sony stock, Pachter immediately responded, "<em>No, Sony for sure not, Sony is a terrible company, and they actually are blowing it in the games business.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Look, games are moving to connected TV,</em>" he continues. "<em>So, think about all the participants that are going to deliver games the way we get movies via Netflix, and forget the subscription model. Just think about iOS becoming on your TV. So free-to-play games on your TV, who's going to deliver that? Cloud providers, AI, anybody whose investing in making that happen is where you want to be.</em>"</p>



<p>Pachter continued to comment that if people looking to invest in the videogame industry want to invest in any current publishers, they should look towards <a href="https://www.playtika.com/">PlayTika, a mobile game company</a> that Pachter owns 500,000 shares of. Pachter added that it is currently trading at "<em>about a four and a half multiple</em>" and that if it were to get an EA-level multiple, he would make "<em>several million dollars</em>."</p>

</p></figure>



<p>This isn't the first time Pachter has bet on <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-losing-to-sony-is-a-wrong-gamers-perception-says-pachter-they-want-to-win-business-not-console/">cloud and non-console-based experiences</a> in videogames being the future. He also previously claimed that Microsoft adding <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-to-reach-100-million-when-activision-games-are-added-says-pachter/">Activision titles to Xbox Game Pass would bring the service 100 million subscribers</a>, and claimed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-will-get-to-200-million-subs-in-10-years-bets-michael-pachter-exclusivity-model-is-wrong/">in the next decade, Game Pass will have 200 million subscribers</a>.</p>



<p>At this point, Pachter has made a career out of these kinds of wild claims and <a href="https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/michael-pachter">has been wrong more often than he's been right</a>. It's worth wondering when we can start considering Pachter just an old man shouting at clouds. Or, more accurately, about clouds.</p>



<p>Just days ago, Sony Interactive Entertainment chief executive officer Hideaki Nishino called the PS5 Sony's "<em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-says-ps5-is-the-most-successful-playstation-generation-ever-making-136-billion-in-sales-so-far">most successful generation to date</a></em>," with $136 billion in sales generated.</p>

            <p>Halo Studios will be giving a "deep dive" presentation on its next projects at the Halo World Championship next month.</p>
<p>The event takes place from 24th - 26th October in Seattle, and will feature a Community Stage holding a number of panels, including one with voice actors Steve Downes (Master Chief) and Jen Taylor (Cortana).</p>
<p>Further details on the studio's next projects will be shown on the Main Stage, but there will also be a further "deep dive" panel on the Community Stage.</p>

<p>Last year, developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-developer-343-industries-rebrands-confirms-multiple-new-games">343 Industries announced it was rebranding as Halo Studios</a> and is working on multiple new games for the franchise. It shared a video titled A New Dawn, which included a look at Project Foundry: an experiment into how Halo games will look using Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>"It's fair to say that our intent is that the majority of what we showcased in Foundry is expected to be in projects which we are building, or future projects," Halo Studios boss Pierre Hintze said at the time.</p>
<p>Until now, the studio has been using its own Slipspace engine. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-halo-is-moving-to-unreal-engine-5-and-the-first-footage-looks-impressive">Digital Foundry</a> stated the change to UE5 could provide "a seismic shift in presentation and development".</p>
<p>The latest <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/halowc25-sept">HaloWC blog post</a> on Halo Waypoint doesn't specify anything on these new projects, but Halo fans won't want to miss the announcements.</p>
<p>The blog reads: "Back in June we let the community know that we'd be continuing the conversation from last year's HaloWC and the 'A New Dawn' video and sharing more about what we’ve been working on. Like last year we'll be on the Main Stage to talk about it but this year we've also got a 'deep dive' panel planned for the Community Stage that you won't want to miss."</p>
<p>The last Halo game released was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo-infinite">Halo Infinite</a> in 2021, which saw the Xbox's flagship shooter move to a semi-open world. While it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-infinite-campaign-review-master-chief-makes-a-leap-of-faith-and-nails-the-landing">received positively</a>, player numbers for its multiplayer mode have since plummeted.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="3c6d69b342a2a"><a title="Mario Galaxy Star" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3c6d69b342a2a/mario-galaxy-star.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>We are mere days away from the long-awaited arrival of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> on Switch (at least, the second one has been long-awaited). The new bundle arrives on <strong>2nd October</strong>, and the reviews have started rolling in.</p>
<p>Our very own Ollie Reynolds put virtual pen to virtual paper for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/super-mario-galaxy-plus-super-mario-galaxy-2">our review</a> and, surprise surprise, he still had a wonderful time with this pair of classics. Mr Reynolds awarded the galactic return an excellent 9/10 and enjoyed just about everything they threw at him. Here's a snippet of the review:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With gameplay that subverts expectations and scenarios that wouldn’t be possible if not for the creative freedom of the cosmos, they represent the Mario series at its absolute best. They look better than ever, boast small yet welcome additions, and expand upon the narrative with new storybook pages.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:188104 @ 1759245303 -->
<p>But we're not the only ones with thoughts on Nintendo's latest, oh no! Below, we've put together a round-up of the critical consensus as it stands, and it'll come as no surprise to hear that it's really rather positive.</p>
<p>We'll kick things off with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/super-mario-galaxy-12-review-despite-pointer-issues-this-is-still-3d-platforming-at-its-very-best/">VGC</a>, where Galaxy 1 + 2 got a full 5/5. The outlet had some issues with the new gyro aiming, but ultimately felt that "Both games remain the high point of creativity in the platform game genre":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Odyssey may have since topped the Galaxy games with its sheer craftsmanship, but, in my eyes, this is still 3D Mario platforming at its very best, which also makes Galaxy and Galaxy 2 some of Nintendo’s very best games.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingbible.com/reviews/super-mario-galaxy-1-2-review-nintendo-switch-2-492056-20250930">GAMINGbible</a> awarded a similar 10/10 in its review and found very little to be negative about:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Super Mario Galaxy 1 + 2</em> are effectively the perfect package: two of the greatest video games of all time, just as you remember them, with only a few minor touchups here and there. This is, for my money, the best way to play two of the greatest video games ever made.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Things dropped ever so slightly in <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/super-mario-galaxy-1-and-2-switch-review/">Destructoid</a>'s 9/10 review, where the only real sticking point is the bundle's much-discussed price:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While it's hard not to talk about the price, it's hard not to deny that these games are still masterpieces nearly 20 years after their release on Wii.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/nintendo/super-mario-galaxy-and-super-mario-galaxy-2-are-as-magical-as-ever-on-nintendo-switch-2">TechRadar</a> gave Galaxy 1 + 2 a 4.5/5, agreeing that it's the "definitive way to play two of the best Mario adventures of all time", though half-wishing there was a little more new content thrown in too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The combination of rock-solid performance, upgraded visuals, and new story content makes these experiences worth revisiting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/super-mario-galaxy-1-and-2-nintendo-switch-review-price/">TheGamer</a> opted for the marginally lower 4/5, enjoying almost everything the package had to offer, but struggling to get past the price or occasionally outdated mechanics and controls:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is now the definitive means to experience two of the best platformers ever made, it’s just unfortunate that the package is prohibitively expensive and borderline insulting to those who want to enjoy it most.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>All in all, it's off to a pretty rock-solid start, eh? Will you be picking up this pair of classics later this week? Let us know in the comments.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/round-up-the-reviews-are-in-for-super-mario-galaxy-plus-super-mario-galaxy-2-on-switch]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Ghost of Yōtei day-one patch introduces plenty of improvements to the game, including ray tracing and performance improvements.</p>



<p>As confirmed to <a href="http://ign.com/">IGN</a>, the 1.006 patch will be live by the time the game officially launches on October 2, and it is a highly recommended download for those who are going to play the game with a retail copy, as it will introduce some critical improvements. Chief among them will be multiple improvements to environmental rendering performance, fixes for Ray Tracing Mode to ensure lighting consistency and performance, and various performance improvements in missions with high character counts.</p>



<p>The Ghost of Yōtei day one patch doesn't stop at improving just performance and stability. It is also packed with gameplay fixes, animation improvements, significant environment enhancements, and interface fixes. The full details on every improvement and fix can be found in the<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-details-ghost-of-yotei-day-one-patch-notes-includes-an-extensive-list-of-improvements"> full patch notes</a>.</p>



<p>Although improvements are always welcome, Ghost of Yōtei was not in dire need of them, as the game looked and played great even without the day-one patch, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-yotei-exploring-the-price-of-vengeance-in-17th-century-ezo/">highlighted by Alessio in his review</a>. The game's only major issue, which no patch can fix, is its extreme similarity to the first entry in the series, although it is one that is easy to look past, considering its quality.</p>



<p>Ghost of Yōtei launches worldwide on PlayStation 5 on October 2. If its predecessor is anything to go by, the game is also expected to release on PC in the future</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you happen to be on the hunt for a new laptop, whether that’s because you’re a student in need of something to complete assignments, a small business owner looking to handle your business needs, or just some guy looking to watch YouTube and draw pictures, come check out the Dell Inspiron 15. This laptop has a touchscreen and is bundled with some bonus accessories. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4388/">The Amazon listing has the full price set at $2,200, but the limited time deal indicates its been marked down by 64% to just $800</a>. Some quick napkin math will tell you that’s a $1,400 discount.</p>
<p>You might be thinking that’s absolutely ridiculous. How can this laptop be on sale for that much off? Well, you’re right to be suspicious. When we look at this bundle’s price history, we can see it has only existed on Amazon for about a month. After first being listed, it immediately dropped in price and it’s mostly been at that $800 amount since.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4388/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Lots of sellers on Amazon will artificially inflate the list price so that when they mark it down, the sale looks enormous. Even if we go to Dell’s website, we’ll find versions of this model laptop going for about the same as you find it here. All that said, this is a pretty good value.</p>
<p>What you’re getting is a 15.6-inch touchscreen laptop that’s powered by the AMD Ryzen 7 7730U. With that we also have an integrated graphics card, 32GB of memory, and a full 1TB of internal storage on its SSD. This laptop is designed to be able to take on school, work, entertainment, and any other sort of everyday task an average user might encounter — and it’s got the specs to support that.</p>
<p>The screen’s touch controls allow you to operate the laptop as if it’s a tablet, choosing to use pinch, zoom, and swipe gestures like you would on a mobile device. It has a resolution of 1080p and uses an anti-glare coating to help minimize reflections, making for more comfortable viewing in bright settings.</p>



<h2>Bonus Gifts Included</h2>
<p>Along with the laptop, you also get a number of free accessories. This Dell Inspiron 15 comes with a stylus pen to be used on the touchscreen, a cleaning clothe, a laptop sleeve for traveling, a USB flash drive with 128GB on it, as well as some port covers and webcam covers. Plus, the laptop comes pre-installed with Windows 11 Pro.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4388/">Right now, you can get the Dell Inspiron 15 and all these goodies for just $800.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4388/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/jurassic-world-evolution-3-the-final-preview.1312522/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">While I've spent dozens of hours building my perfect dino park in Jurassic World Evolution 2, Frontier's prehistoric series always felt like it was sort of a younger sibling to their other park-builders, Planet Zoo and Planet Coaster. There are a lot of features in those two games that didn't make it into the first two Evolution entries. So when I got to play Jurassic World Evolution 3, I was most excited to see that it finally seems like a fully-fledged member of the Frontier flock, with the extremely deep customization and personalization features I've come to expect from the studio. Oh yeah, and the baby dinosaurs are pretty dang cute, too.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Spared No Expense</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Evolution 3's story takes place some time after Jurassic World: Dominion, at a point where dinosaurs reintroduced to the wild in the previous films are struggling to adapt and survive on their own. That brings us as park managers to work with the Dinosaur Integration Network, seeking to help them thrive and, let's be honest, make a tidy profit showing them off to people who definitely, probably, are not going to get eaten. I mean it's honestly very uncommon at this point, and we've learned a lot over the years from myriad disasters, but we are still going to need you to sign this waiver.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And the dinosaurs we'll help to integrate have definitely never looked better, both in terms of textures and animations. Some of them are still stuck with their 1993 designs based on what is at this point 30-year-old paleontology, which is a bit of a shame to me as someone who likes to keep up-to-date on these things. But I suppose you couldn't really make a Jurassic game without the distinctive creature designs from the films, and there are also some more scientifically accurate models like the gorgeous Utahraptor, joining the base game here after becoming the breakout star of Evolution 2's DLC.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The marquee feature for Evolution 3 is the breeding system and juvenile dinosaurs. And they are, as you’d guess, super cute.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, the marquee feature for Evolution 3 is the breeding system and juvenile dinosaurs. And they are, as you’d guess, super cute. It's not just the babies adding variety to the roster, though, since adult males and females can now sport subtle differences in size and body shape as well. You can even customize the skin patterns for males and females separately to more easily tell them apart. And this means group dynamics need to be carefully managed, too, since different species will require different ratios of males to females to be content. Some can get along with more than one male in the same enclosure, while others can't. And most species will not like being segregated by sex, so you'll want at least one of each.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Next Generation</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Breeding will also be central to the management gameplay, with the ability to raise a dinosaur's appeal rating by selecting parents with high ratings. You can even breed for specific traits, like a longer lifespan or the ability to coexist with other species more peacefully. Otherwise, wellbeing is a pretty straightforward matter of making sure the dinos have enough space, food, water, and their preferred terrain mix. Smaller herbivores like low ground cover, whereas some flying species actually prefer a barren landscape they can easily scan from above. There's also an added consideration of nest placement, since some species won't, well, do the deed if pesky little mammals with their funny flashing rectangles are watching. You should at least have to pay extra for that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I didn't have enough time in my 90-minute demo to really dig super deep into this. I didn't get a great idea of how the financial management side is balanced, either. We did get to see a little bit of the campaign layer, though, which featured maps based on the Southwestern US, Hawaii, and Western China. And these maps look truly stunning even without prehistoric beasts wandering around them, showing off dramatic elevation changes, towering waterfalls, and unique vegetation. I especially enjoyed the one set in China's Sichuan Basin, which mixed the architecture of an alpine ski resort with the new East Asian building theme and a focus on flying species.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The basic routine feels pretty similar to Evolution 2 overall. You hire scientists, send them out on digs to collect DNA, synthesize new species, then let them out into the enclosure. It's at that point your breeding program takes over, which is the way to attain the highest appeal ratings. Naturally-bred dinosaurs are more interesting to guests than artificially incubated ones, which increases with the number of generations they have been breeding on their own. It's a bit of a challenge at first, since the low compatibility between artificially-incubated males and females makes producing viable offspring more difficult and time-consuming. But this compatibility can be improved over succeeding generations with help from your genetics team.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">All Systems Online</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Your scientists will also be responsible for researching new dig sites, enclosures, guest amenities, park administration buildings, and all the usual stuff. Each has a skill rating in three different areas and a special trait, like making expeditions faster or incubations cheaper, and demands a salary based on their proficiency. I did find it somewhat difficult to get a good spread of skills with the five slots and limited budget I was given, and I'm not sure if staff can develop new skills over time yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Managing the park requires ranger teams to visit enclosures and observe each animal to give you data on their physical and mental state, and you could be missing a major problem brewing if you don't set up your patrol routes well. You'll also need to provide camera coverage across your fence lines, or else you won't be notified if someone starts trying to chew a hole in one. Again, this is rare, but please, you came all this way, so you might as well sign the waiver.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But the bulk of the new stuff doesn't have anything to do with directly controlling capture and repair teams, which is still pretty cool. It doesn't even have to do with dinosaur breeding. It's the rich wealth of customization options now available. Terraforming is extremely powerful, with tons of tools that each have plenty of settings for raising, lowering, smoothing, adding noise, and creating ramps. You can paint custom ground textures. You can even build enclosures that use steep cliff edges instead of fences as part of their design to keep the dinos in.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Land Before Time</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The way water works is a little bit strange. Aquatic species use their own dedicated lagoons, which is a whole other thing. But simply placing ground water isn't quite the same as it is in other park-builders. You can't just build a giant pit and fill it up to a certain height with water. Rather, ground water requires a flat surface as a starting point, and the depth is fixed using the water tool. This does let you create some fairly deep areas for semiaquatic species to wade and fish in. It looks nice! It's just not quite as flexible as what you can do on dry land, and took a bit of getting used to.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But when it comes to buildings, I was almost overwhelmed with all the new options. Similar to Planet Zoo and Planet Coaster, Jurassic World Evolution 3 contains all the rotatable, resizeable, and recolorable building pieces to create just about anything you can imagine. Even the pre-made structures include the ability to select, remove, copy, and remix existing pieces down to the smallest bits like roof corners and floor tiles. Windows can even be edited to make it look like there are various different kinds of shops inside when you really zoom in for a peek.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The editing tools are quite impressive and generally pretty easy to use.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, the editing tools are quite impressive and generally pretty easy to use. It was a ton of fun to mess around with, even in the very limited amount of time I had, and I can't wait to see what other people who are more creatively skilled than me can do with them – especially since you'll be able to upload your creations to share with other players. And if you don't have the time to custom-build absolutely everything, there are several different pre-made building themes to pick from, including the East Asian-inspired set that I especially enjoyed.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Just about everything I've seen so far of Jurassic World Evolution 3 has me excited to thrill my guests and make my lawyers nervous (seriously, we do need you to sign that waiver). From dino breeding to dramatic and different new park locations to extremely robust customization tools, it feels like it truly deserves its spot at the table with Planet Zoo and Planet Coaster now, rather than relying on the, you know, freakin' dinosaurs to make up for some of what it was missing. We'll be able to decide whether or not to endorse this park in its entirety on October 21.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/jurassic-world-evolution-3-the-final-preview]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Target acquired.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision has warned PC gamers that they will not be able to play <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> during the beta and at launch if they do not enable TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like rival shooter Battlefield 6, TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot are required for Black Ops 7 to run on PC as part of strict anti-cheat measures. These features block modified hardware and unauthorized software, with the goal of creating a fair, secure environment for all players even as cheaters ramp up their efforts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, Activision has said it’s well aware Call of Duty cheaters will hammer on the Black Ops 7 beta, insisting: “that’s exactly what we want.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-ricochet-anti-cheat-update" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new blog post</a>, Activision suggested PC gamers enable both TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot now to be ready on day one, with the Black Ops 7 beta set to kick off on October 2 for those with early access, then October 5 in open beta form.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, some Battlefield 6 players ran into issues enabling TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot, preventing them from playing on PC. Speaking to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-really-sucks-battlefield-6-technical-director-bummed-out-about-those-unable-to-play-due-to-secure-boot-requirement-believes-anti-cheat-cat-and-mouse-game-will-never-end" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Eurogamer</u></a>, Battlefield 6 technical director Christian Buhl lamented the situation. "The fact is I wish we didn't have to do things like Secure Boot," Buhl said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It does prevent some players from playing the game. Some people's PCs can't handle it and they can't play; that really sucks. I wish everyone could play the game with low friction and not have to do these sorts of things."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Multiplayer Maps</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Enabling Secure Boot involves tinkering with a part of a computer not all PC gamers will be instantly familiar with: the BIOS. You need to make sure your Windows disk is GPT and not MBR (not everyone will know what these are), too. All this before you can even enable Secure Boot — and then you may not be able to enable it anyway, which then means you need to refer to your manufacturer for guidance. While this won’t be a problem for more experienced PC gamers, it will be an intimidating process for some.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps with this in mind, <a href="https://support.activision.com/articles/trusted-platform-module-and-secure-boot" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Activision has released guides to help Call of Duty players enable TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot</a>, including BIOS updates for the top 10 motherboard makers used by Call of Duty players. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When Black Ops 7 launches on November 14, these requirements will combine with our newest RICOCHET Anti-Cheat upgrades,” Activision said. “At that point, we will introduce a remote verification system (known as Remote Attestation) to provide the strongest safeguard possible. This type of attestation is the most secure method of validation, more stringent than the client or local attestation methods found in other games, allowing us to validate TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot settings with Microsoft Azure servers in the cloud.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This creates a tougher environment for cheats to operate in and ensures that the protections these features detect cannot be bypassed or spoofed, which would be possible if we used local verification on a player’s PC. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Our layered defense that combines TPM 2.0, Secure Boot, and RICOCHET Anti-Cheat’s upgraded detection systems delivers our most advanced anti-cheat protection yet, safeguarding fair play across Call of Duty.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision continued: “We're setting a new standard for gaming security. TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot are not optional; they are the foundation of our multifaceted defense system, and with your help, they ensure a fair and secure experience for everyone.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty has a reputation for cheating, especially with the free-to-download battle royale Warzone. Activision has spent a significant amount of time, money, and energy in response, even taking on cheat makers in court, although it, like all video game developers, faces an uphill battle in the war on cheaters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And Activision knows cheaters will descend upon the Black Ops 7 beta (despite it being a beta, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-fans-are-already-worried-about-cheating-in-the-modern-warfare-3-beta">it happens with Call of Duty every year</a>, and indeed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cheaters-already-spotted-in-battlefield-6-open-beta-despite-secure-boot-requirement">the Battlefield 6 beta suffered the same fate</a>). In the blog post, Activision welcomed the onslaught that is to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Cheaters will try to test the limits during the Beta. That’s exactly what we want because #TeamRICOCHET is here, watching, learning, and removing them as they appear," Activision said. "Any account permanently banned for cheating during the Beta will be banned across all Call of Duty titles, from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare to future releases.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that Activision has highlighted its new aimbot detection, which it said is “one of the strongest detection systems we have ever built,” and its new wall hacking detections, “making it harder for cheaters who manipulate the game to see enemies through surfaces harder to escape detection.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-reveal-highlights-include-futuristic-tech-18-maps-and-travis-scott">all the Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 multiplayer details announced so far</a> to find out what to expect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

                <p>It appears that Sony is working on an updated PlayStation 5 controller with a removable battery pack, similar to those available for Xbox controllers, according to <a href="https://www.ppe.pl/news/384532/nowe-ps5-pro-i-kontrolery-dualsense-z-pozadana-funkcja-zdradzamy-szczegoly.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a new report</a> by the German gaming outlet PPE.pl.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-is-reportedly-set-to-release-an-updated-ps5-dualsense-controller-with-a-removable-battery/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">spotted by VGC</a>, PPE.pl is reporting that this PS5 controller--reportedly known internally as the DualSense V3--is slated to arrive this November with a removable battery pack. Specifics were sparse, but according to PPE.pl's source--someone named Graczdari, who correctly predicted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-soaring-to-ps5/1100-6534995/" data-ref-id="1100-6534995">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024's PS5 reveal</a> and uncovered the boxed version of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-surprise-launches-today-on-game-pass/1100-6530669/" data-ref-id="1100-6530669">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a>--it seems the DualSense V3 will allow you to replace the battery pack if necessary, instead of you having to buy a whole new controller whenever it dies for good.</p>

<p>What if the <strong>Zelda</strong> series starred the Grim Reaper? What if it starred a pig? These are questions we all ask on a daily basis, right? Well, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/spindle">Spindle</a> is here to answer them.</p>
<p>This upcoming pixel art action adventure is set to arrive on the Switch eShop on <strong>13th October</strong>, and it looks really rather sweet. It boasts all the hallmarks of the Nintendo series that has so clearly served as a touchstone — puzzley dungeons, elemental bosses, a beach filled with nasty crabs — but with some added swine-based sweetness. What's not to like?</p>
<p>It's not all fun and games, mind you. Spindle dev Wobble Ghost doesn't use the ol' Grim Reaper lightly, and the story promises to navigate big themes like death, grief, and healing in your own way.</p>
<p>Here's a little more information on the game itself and a handful of screenshots from publisher Deck13:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Spindle</strong></em> invites you to go on a lovingly hand-crafted journey that’s inspired by the games of our childhood, packed with <strong>charming characters and beautiful environments</strong>. With your scythe sharp and your wits even sharper, explore <strong>twisting dungeons filled with cunning foes and clever riddles</strong> as you unravel the mystery bit by bit. The deeper you go, the more the shadows seem to watch… ready to find out what’s <em>really</em> waiting in the dark?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>October is a particularly busy month for game releases, but this looks like it could fit the bill if you're after something sweet and sincere.</p>
<p><em>What do you make of Spindle? Let us know in the comments.</em></p></section></article><div><p>Jim came to Nintendo Life in 2022 and, despite his insistence that The Minish Cap is the best Zelda game and his unwavering love for the Star Wars prequels (yes, really), he has continued to write news and features on the site ever since.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/authors/JimNorman"><span></span> Author Profile</a></li><li><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jimnormann.bsky.social"><span></span> Bluesky</a></li><li><a onclick="return replyTo('JimNorman');" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/#"> Reply</a></li></ul>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/avalanche-studios-layoffs-uk-closure</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/just-cause-developer-avalanche-studios-hit-by-layoffs-uk-location-to-close.1312465/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Just Cause&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Mad Max&nbsp;</em>developer Avalanche Studios has announced that it will be laying off some of its employees, and that it intends to close down its UK location.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/studio-update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news update</a> on its official website, Avalanche says these layoffs are happening in order to "best ensure Avalanche Studios Group's long-term success", blaming "current challenges to [its] business and the industry".</p>

<p>The developer's UK location, which is based in Liverpool, will be closed, and staff reductions will also be happening at its Malmo and Stockholm offices, although Avalanche stops short of revealing exactly how many employees will be losing their jobs, or which departments the layoffs will hit hardest.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avalanche-studios-layoffs-just-cause-4.jpg?itok=U8UnXseI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avalanche-studios-layoffs-just-cause-4.jpg?itok=071uBIfE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Avalanche Studios is best known for the&nbsp;<em>Just Cause&nbsp;</em>series.</figcaption></figure><p>The studio closes by saying that its "immediate focus" is helping those who are losing their jobs, and that it remains "deeply committed to providing amazing games" to its "passionate player communities".</p>

<p>News of Avalanche Studios' layoffs and UK studio closure comes after reports that&nbsp;<em>Contraband</em>, the game the studio was working on for Xbox Game Studios, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/contraband-canceled-report-avalanche-studios" rel="nofollow">was canceled</a> as part of a wider wave of layoffs and cancellations at Microsoft.</p>

<p>That wave also hit the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">Rare's&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">Everwild</a>&nbsp;</em>and The Initiative's <i>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</i>reboot, with the latter's cancellation also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">resulting in the demise of the studio</a>.</p>

<p><em>Contraband</em>'s cancellation was, perhaps, not particularly surprising; the game was announced all the way back in 2021, and between then and its eventual shutdown, both Avalanche and Xbox were very quiet indeed about the project.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avalanche-studios-layoffs-mad-max.jpg?itok=ZkQaRj4r 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avalanche-studios-layoffs-mad-max.jpg?itok=JvS4RFVY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You may also know Avalanche's name from<em>&nbsp;Mad Max</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>It's important to note that Avalanche Studios is entirely distinct as an entity from Avalanche Software, the developer that worked on the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-sales-30m" rel="nofollow">phenomenally successful</a> wizarding RPG&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>for Warner Bros.</p>

<p>As far as we know, Avalanche Software isn't being hit by layoffs, although given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warner-bros-financials-2024-revenue-falls" rel="nofollow">dire time</a> Warner Bros. has been having in the gaming space recently, news of layoffs or closures wouldn't come as a surprise. Stay tuned for more on all things industry-related.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/just-cause-3-the-kotaku-review-1745359451"><em>Just Cause</em></a> and <em>Mad Max</em> developer Avalanche Studios is closing up a studio in the United Kingdom and is laying off an undisclosed number of employees due to “current challenges to our business and the industry.”</p> <p>On September 30, <a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/studio-update">Avalanche Studios Group posted a short update</a> on the company’s official site announcing that its UK development studio in Liverpool is being closed and that all employees will be “impacted.” Avalanche also confirmed in the same statement that layoffs are planned for its Swedish studios located in Malmö and Stockholm. The news of layoffs and a studio closure comes about two months after Avalanche and Xbox announced that the upcoming game <em>Contraband</em> was canceled.</p> <p>Here’s Avalanche’s full statement as posted online:</p> <blockquote><p>In light of current challenges to our business and the industry, we have thoroughly reviewed how to best ensure Avalanche Studios Group’s long-term success. This review has led us to the difficult conclusion that we must make changes to our staffing and locations. As a result, we are proposing to close our Liverpool studio, and to initiate a collective consultation process, as required by UK law. This will impact all Avalanchers in Liverpool. The changes will also impact our other studio locations in Malmö and Stockholm, where we will reduce our workforce and restructure the teams to address our games’ needs.</p> <p>Our immediate focus is to offer full support to all Avalanchers during this challenging time. Despite these changes, we remain deeply committed to providing amazing games to our passionate player communities.</p></blockquote> <p><em>Contraband</em> was first announced back in 2021 and was going to be published by Xbox and developed primarily by Avalanche’s studio in Liverpool. However, four years later, we had heard very little about the game and its status. <a href="https://kotaku.com/just-cause-makers-xbox-exclusive-contraband-canceled-amid-recent-cuts-2000616371">In August 2025</a>, Xbox and Avalanche announced what most people expected: Development on <em>Contraband</em> was being halted as the studio “evaluated” the future of the game and its plans moving forward. And while the game isn’t mentioned directly in the statement above, it appears those involved with the evaluation have settled on layoffs.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/candy-crush-ai-king-microsoft-layoffs-xbox-farm-saga-1851786283">This is just one</a> of <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-industry-layoffs-how-many-2024-unity-twitch-1851155818">many, many, many layoffs</a> to <a href="https://kotaku.com/latest-round-of-mass-layoffs-at-xbox-begin-with-200-job-1851785492">happen in the video game industry</a> over the last few years as it becomes more expensive to develop bigger games and harder than ever to get people to play them, as titles like <a href="https://kotaku.com/old-games-2023-playtime-data-fortnite-roblox-minecraft-1851382474"><em>Fortnite, GTA Online, Call of Duty, </em>and <em>Roblox</em></a> dominate the charts. <a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-netease-game-director-layoffs-season-2-1851765290">And even if your game is a big hit</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/oblivion-remastered-virtuos-layoffs-cyberpunk-patch-1851786435">that doesn’t mean you’re safe.</a></p>

The game is a follow-up to Ghost of Tsushima, though this title has a standalone story.</p><p dir="ltr">Ghost of Yotei will unlock at basically midnight local time October 2 in each player's country. This means that parts of the US can begin Atsu's tale of revenge late tomorrow, October 1. For instance, people on the West Coast will see Ghost of Yotei unlock at 9 PM PT tomorrow, which equates to 12 AM ET October 2 for residents of the East Coast.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Carin, the survival mountain climbing game set to release on November 4, has been delayed to Q1 2026. The game was <a href="https://gameinformer.com/sgf-2024/2024/06/07/cairn-is-a-new-climbing-adventure-survival-game-from-the-developers-behind">first revealed</a> during Summer Game Fest 2024.&nbsp;</p><p>Developed by The Game Bakers, the creators of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/furi/b/playstation4/archive/2016/07/14/a-stylish-fight-with-frustration.aspx">Furi </a>and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/haven/haven-review-love-conquers-some">Haven</a>, Cairn centers on protagonist Aava embarking on an expedition to climb the perilous Mount Kami. The game features realistic climbing mechanics and physics, as players must carefully manage their tools and resources (like food and water) to gradually work their way towards the summit.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fZiy36vcB5Q"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fZiy36vcB5Q" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The Game Bakers says that although Cairn is content complete, it needs a few more months to focus on optimization, debugging, and overall polish. “We have been running a lot of playtests, and the feedback from players is that we have something truly special with Cairn. We also see all the improvements we can still do to make the experience unforgettable. After 5 years of work, it makes no sense to rush it, we want to be proud of the game we launch,” explained creative director Emeric Thoa.</p><p>Although Cairn has no new release date, the game’s well-received <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1588550/Cairn/">Steam demo</a> will be updated on October 13, which will allow players to see the “ghosts” of other players climbing alongside them. Players can race against these specters, or follow them to find hidden paths, but this feature will only be available for a limited time. A new trailer shows off this update below.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ko_d5JyQNKM"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ko_d5JyQNKM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>When Cairn launches next year, it will be available on PlayStation 5 and PC.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/09/30/survival-mountain-climbing-game-cairn-delayed-to-2026]]></content:encoded>
