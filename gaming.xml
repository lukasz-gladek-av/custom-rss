            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-will-overhaul-stealth-mechanics-but-still-include-insta-kill-assassination-option<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is set to overhaul stealth mechanics for both its dual protagonists, but will also include an option to allow insta-kill assassinations on all enemies.</p>
<p>That's because stronger enemies can completely deny assassination attempts, as detailed in a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news">new blog post</a> from Ubisoft. Coloured prompts over enemies will indicate either an instant kill, some damage dealt, or a complete assassination denial, though this can all be negated with a specific menu option for insta-kills.</p>
<p>"When it comes to assassinations, progress and context work in hand," said associate game director Simon Lemay-Comtois. "Invest in perks that increase your assassination damage and test things around: A strong enemy may survive a frontal assassination but may die from a sneaky air assassination."</p>

<p>Elsewhere, Lemay-Comtois noted stealth gameplay has been "ambitiously overhauled in a few key areas". Most notably, the game lacks a bird companion, unlike the most recent games.</p>
<p>Instead, both samurai Yasuke and shinobi Naoe will have a new Observe mechanic to identify targets, tag enemies, and highlight lootable stashes, which Lemay-Comtois promised is core to the game. "When in doubt, take a pause, observe the world around you, and only then should you decide what your next move should be," he said.</p>
<p>Naoe, however, will have Eagle Vision in addition to highlight enemies hidden behind walls based on sounds they make.</p>
<p>The game also includes a couple of series firsts: hiding in shadows will provide complete invisibility (living up to the game's name), and both characters are able to go prone to reduce visibility.</p>
<p>With the former especially, players will be able to destroy lanterns to create pools of darkness for protection. "Naoe is a perfectly capable Shinobi in broad day light," said Lemay-Comtois, "but the cover of darkness gives her a remarkable edge over her enemies - especially on higher difficulty settings."</p>
<p>And while prone, Naoe is also able to dodge by rolling in multiple directions. She's also the smallest Assassin to date, allowing her to hide in small spaces.</p>
<p>Much of these stealth mechanics appear to give Naoe a significant advantage (she's a shinobi after all), suggesting samurai Yasuke's gameplay will be less stealth-focused overall. However, the blog post notes he can still be stealthy with his bow and is able to blend "stealth with a more direct combat approach". Further details will be provided in a future blog post.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows was delayed until February 2025, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-necessary-to-change-narrative-of-ubisofts-inconsistency-in-quality">series boss Marc-Alexis Coté said</a> was necessary to change the "narrative" of Ubisoft's "inconsistency in quality".</p>
<p>Last week images leaked <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-leak-looks-to-show-free-battle-pass-rewards">appearing to show free battle pass rewards</a>, something not seen before in an Assassin's Creed game.</p>
<p>"All the rewards available in the Animus Hub will be entirely free, there are no paid subscriptions or paid battle pass featured in the Animus Hub, and players will have access to regular content [and] missions at no extra cost," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-responds-to-assassins-creed-shadows-leak-showing-free-battle-pass-rewards">Ubisoft later confirmed</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Marvel Games and NetEase Games have made the announcement that Hawkeye will be joining the launch roster for Marvel Rivals. So far, the roster is pretty nicely stacked and has a lot of variation for those who plan on getting stuck into the game. The release date for Marvel Rivals isn't far away, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-demanding-540p-xbox-series-s/">the game will be launching on December 6</a> with all heroes unlocked and free to play. In addition to Hawkeye's reveal, the dev team has also revealed a new map being added for Wakanda. The map is called Birnin T'Challa and is a built-up, futuristic city in the Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda.</p>

<p>To celebrate all of the announcements they've made, they've released a trailer for Hawkeye and<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=Ci9jZY11JluGVcqL&amp;v=dz_778SYulo&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Birnin T'Challa</a>, respectively, as well as a new dev diary that was released five days ago to talk about some of the decisions they've made for the upcoming hero shooter. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYSZFAZC3Kg&amp;t=22s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The dev diary</a> talks about the roadmap of the upcoming game, with the title beginning with Season 0, named "Doom's Rise." This season will be month-long, where players will get to experiment with 33 heroes and eight maps for Quick Match and Competitive modes. There will also be a Conquest map and a new Practice Range, allowing players to experiment with the superheroes before taking them into a game against other people. The Doom's Rise season is all about the chaos that is caused by Doctor Doom and his time experiments, which is also explained in the dev diary released recently.</p>
<p>Since Season 0 is so short, there will be a battle pass available, but it will have half the content of a full Seasonal Battle Pass, with the battle pass being priced accordingly for the month long season. Additionally, there is an in-game store that will have regular rotations with costumes and cosmetics inspired by the comics, MCU, and costumes that are specifically created to reflect the storyline of Marvel Rivals.</p>
<p>These costumes include the Imperial Protocol series, which has Afrofuturism roots and is representative of the empire of Wakanda. As Hawkeye is the latest character to be added to the ever-expanding roster of Marvel Rivals, he is the fourth in the story set to receive an Imperial Protocol costume, with details of the cosmetic set to be revealed sometime soon.</p>
<p>Will you be playing Marvel Rivals?</p>

            <p>I go through this life burdened by the knowledge that I will never be framed for murder on a luxurious, multiple-day train journey. Not for me the thrill of flushing out the true culprit (or culprits???) between visits to the exquisitely upholstered dining car, against the backdrop of passing mountains. The best I can hope for is getting chewed out for hogging the toilet on a crowded commuter train to Leeds.</p>
<p>If you too know this pain, this <em>anguish</em>, maybe check out <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/loco-motive">Loco Motive</a>. It's out today, and is a comedy murder mystery set aboard a 1930s express train, with three playable characters. It looks and sounds like one of the old LucasArts point-and-clickers (with the option of direct character control), featuring gorgeous animated sprites and some nicely overblown voice-acting. Possibly best of all, it's billed as an item-combining puzzler "that won't leave you head-scratching for hours". I hate scratching my head for hours! How do you think I got this hairline? Anyway, all aboard the trai(n)ler!</p>

<p>Katharine (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/egx-highlights-loco-motives-witty-murder-mystery-point-and-clicking-has-won-me-over">saw Loco Motive at EGX last October</a>, and was rather taken by it. Her preview makes mention of dowagers, geezers, "Elvis-like bouffants" and "6-foot human labradors". Puzzle scenarios might see you (spoilers!) <span tabindex="0">combining a desk fan with a rolled-up newspaper to create a wind funnel and blow over a coat stand to dislodge a set of keys</span>. "It's truly lovely stuff, and every moment just oozes with style and slick exaggeration," Katharine concluded.</p><p>There's a smooth jazz score contributed by Wildfrost and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/space-haven">Space Haven</a> composer Paul Zimmermann, and the cute option to telephone an in-game helpline for assistance with puzzles. Loco Motive is also verified for Steam Deck, and the cutaway carriage perspective certainly looks like it'll scrub up well on a handheld widescreen.</p>

They want to see the third part of the series as quickly as possible,” said Hamaguchi.</p><p>The director further explained, “We really are putting all our efforts into getting the third game out as quickly as we can.

So place your bets on when we’ll get our hands on the RPG. I’m thinking 2027. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth isn't getting any major story DLC akin to Remake's Intergrade expansion, according to game director Naoki Hamaguchi.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/gaming/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-wont-34152228" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with The Daily Star</a>, Hamaguchi gently denied fan hopes of an intermediary chapter between Rebirth and the next game. Final Fantasy 7: Remake received such a chapter with "Intermission," which included a new story featuring Yuffie.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We definitely do hear the desire from fans, the voices out there that want that kind of thing," he said. "I understand it completely, but I think, from my perspective, what the fans really want to see the most is not necessarily DLC. They want to see the third part of the series as quickly as possible."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Hamaguchi's assessment is probably correct, this might be a let-down for fans who were expecting more. Rumors of a Rebirth DLC have been bubbling both due to Remake's existing DLC, as well as a <a href="https://noisypixel.net/square-enix-considering-further-expansions-of-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-queens-blood/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prior comment from Hamaguchi</a> about wanting to make "further expansions" to addictive minigame Queen's Blood.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While that remark could have meant anything from minor updates to a standalone game, many took it to mean Queen's Blood DLC was in the cards. Hamaguchi's remarks today don't seem to totally refute that, as he appears to be specifically referring to a full-blown, character-driven, story DLC here. But it's also not looking hopeful.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, it sounds like Square Enix is full speed ahead on the third part of Final Fantasy 7's trilogy of a remake. The first two games, Remake and Rebirth, were four years apart, and Rebirth just released this year. That means we likely have a bit of a wait ahead of us, with Square Enix <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-hoping-to-release-final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogys-finale-by-2027">suggesting it hoped to release the finale by 2027</a>. That gives us plenty of time to play all the way through Rebirth, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review">we gave a 9/10</a> and which is a nominee for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2024-complete-list-of-nominees-goty">Game of the Year at The Game Awards in December</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/avowed-the-final-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">We continue to be more impressed with Obsidian’s fantasy RPG every time we play it.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Even after a positive preview for Avowed this Summer, I found myself wondering if it was a fluke. Maybe it was just a fun mission. Maybe Obsidian won’t be able to keep my interest as more quests are discovered. Maybe it was just a nice day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nope. Avowed is just a lot of fun. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Coming fresh off of trying out Dragon Age: The Veilguard, I was so happy when I discovered just how evil I could be to people I met along the way right from the start of Avowed – something Veilguard just didn’t fulfill. From the start I had one NPC dropping f-bombs because I was going to leave her in prison. A short while later a duo would try to intimidate me on a bridge – only to meet a swift demise. I wasn’t in the mood for their nonsense. I just wanted to be evil. And while I could have handled it the nice way, sometimes being evil is just more fun.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Avowed - Gamescom 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not just the fact that you have more nuance with every conversation. It’s empowering to craft the kind of hero or villain you want to be. Sure, Obsidian has a story to tell, but I feel more in control when deciding how these scenarios play out. The character customization options will allow you to craft the face of the character you’ll build, and while you don’t see it all that often, you can make someone perfectly lovely, or someone that looks like they came straight out of that creepy claymation episode of Adventures of Mark Twain.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You can make someone perfectly lovely, or someone that looks like they came straight out of that creepy claymation episode of Adventures of Mark Twain.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Even the vendors have unique banter. I had the chance to meet Valtur, the ex-husband of another nearby vendor Dagherda and the two would talk badly about each other after their failed marriage. Another vendor had a past relationship with my companion Kai and warned him not to cross her again. These little beats do a lot to make the world feel like it has a history that you’ll uncover more of that as you adventure. I love these dangling threads that are teased. Hopefully, I’ll get to tug on some of them and see how deep each story goes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On the combat front, I also immediately noticed improvements, especially in the sound department. Obsidian clearly spent a lot of time working on the audio and combat flow, and it’s immediately noticeable. The sound spikes are so satisfying to hear when you’ve stunned an opponent and can execute a flurry of blows or bullets. Or when using stealth, and you’re able to execute your prey with an ethereal blade. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And one addition we got to see for the first time was the ability to use third-person or first-person combat. Both feel great, and while I personally opted for the first-person perspective most of the time, third-person is looking and feeling good too. The only slight gripe I have is that the movement can have a bit of that floaty Obsidian style to it in third person, but that doesn’t affect combat all that much.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And while I’m discussing minor complaints (knowing full well that Obsidian still has a few months of polish time left), I did feel that your companion Kai was a bit too hand-holdy with his tips at times. There were a few moments when I was simply scavenging for loot and found him whispering tips about a puzzle in my ear. I know Obsidian is trying to help out players, but it takes away from that feeling of accomplishment you get when solving the mystery for yourself.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Upgrading from a bow and arrow to an Arquebus felt awesome.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But to get back to the positives, loot was also a highlight, even early on. Upgrading from a bow and arrow to an Arquebus felt awesome. The tradeoff with the rifle is that it has a long reload time, but once you’ve upgraded your abilities with it you’ll unlock faster reloads and more damage – and the ragdoll physics add to the fun factor as well.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Yet again, though, my time with Avowed felt all too short. I left wishing that Obisidian had let us have more time to play, but that’s a good sign! And so far, everything seems to be coming together in what I can best describe as a really fun RPG. But more importantly, it feels like an RPG where I’m in control of my own destiny, and while the decisions I’m making will have consequences, I love knowing that I get to be the one directing the orchestra, so to speak. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In both of my hands-on sessions with Avowed, I’ve only been able to see the Dawnshore section of the map and not much more. I do hope there’s plenty of content here, but I’d really like to see more, given how close the February release date is now. When I asked Obsidian about this, they promised several biomes would be explorable, and that will no doubt add a lot to the visual diversity of the world. I just wish we could get a peek at it beyond the footage from the very first gameplay reveal from many months ago.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">No spoilers on the story here, but the one narrative hook that is set up early on is a mission which takes you to The Voice. This voice leads you through the map and is clearly an entity you’ll hear from again during your adventures. When given the chance to help it or refuse to make a deal, I decided against siding with a blue light as I’ve learned nothing good ever comes from a deal with an all-powerful entity. But I will be curious to see how that plays out in the end. The Voice did not seem happy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s really the best you can hope for from previews of an RPG like this. You get just enough to leave you wanting more. And Avowed certainly accomplished just that. I want to power up my companion Kai to see what other attacks he can do. I want to discover the coveted weapons the design team told us about during the pre-hands-on presentation. I want to kill more people and betray my friends. And Avowed is empowering me to do exactly that.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Carefully choosing your Skills can change the tide of battle! </p><p>Abilities are tied to a unit’s class or race and have various effects such as increasing their stats, pushing enemies off the map, decreasing damage sustained, strengthening Gadgets, increasing the range of attacks, and much, much more. Take your time and enjoy searching for just the right combination of Abilities to take on battles with ease!</p><p>However, there’s a limit to how many you can learn, so sometimes it may be necessary to forget previously-learned Skills and Abilities.

Here is a look at some of the unique classes that appear in the game:</p><p><strong>Striker</strong></p><p>Frontline fighters with high physical defense that use spears. Possess the unique ability to increase their attack power by moving, making them a great choice for a mobile fighter. Have high physical defense, but low magical defense, so be careful!</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Phantom-Brave-The-Lost-Hero_2024_11-21-24_037.png"></a></figure><p><strong>Wizard</strong></p><p>Has a broader AOE range than the similar magic class, the Witch, so they can attack more enemies from the backlines. Just like the Witch, they have low physical defense and are not very mobile, but if you account for that, they are a class you can rely on to take care of multiple foes.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Phantom-Brave-The-Lost-Hero_2024_11-21-24_038.png"></a></figure><p><strong>Healer</strong></p><p>Not only does this class possess healing abilities, but they also increase the defense of all allies in range, so they can fulfill their role simply by being deployed as a backline healer. Necessary for the Heal Facility, so having at least one will make your adventure easier.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Phantom-Brave-The-Lost-Hero_2024_11-21-24_039.png"></a></figure><p><strong>Engineer</strong></p><p>A unique class that allows you to use Gadget-related abilities such as building up more Mana. Their real value is revealed when there are Gadgets on the map. Deploy them with Apricot to witness their true power!</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Phantom-Brave-The-Lost-Hero_2024_11-21-24_040.png"></a></figure><p><strong>Old Man</strong></p><p>Can use any close-range weapon well and is a powerful frontline fighter. Though he has some peculiar abilities, his high attack and defense make him very useful in battle. However, he will be Removed after only 2 turns, so he is best used when you need a burst of power.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Phantom-Brave-The-Lost-Hero_2024_11-21-24_041.png"></a></figure><p><strong>Granny</strong></p><p>The most powerful backline humanoid magic class. Has high INT and magical defense, which affects magic casting, and high RES, which affects healing. Can also obtain abilities that increase the AOE and range of Skills. However, like the Old Man, she will be Removed after only two turns, so your timing is very important.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Phantom-Brave-The-Lost-Hero_2024_11-21-24_042.png"></a></figure><p><strong>Sailor</strong></p><p>A peculiar mid-range unit that doesn’t have any special abilities or specialities, but instead has the most turns before being Removed. Their abilities make them the target of attacks, so they’re useful for shielding weaker allies. Train this class to get many abilities such as an ability to increase their Remove turns, get more EXP, decrease SP usage, and other unique skills. Maybe it would be worthwhile to raise one as a training exercise!?</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Phantom-Brave-The-Lost-Hero_2024_11-21-24_043.png"></a></figure><p><strong>Goat Fighter</strong></p><p>An exceptional warrior of the Goat tribe with the ability to blow back their enemies. Their attack power increases as they move, and their other abilities increase with additional Goat tribe units on the map, making them an easy class to power up. However, they are extremely weak to magic, so be careful!</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Phantom-Brave-The-Lost-Hero_2024_11-21-24_044.png"></a></figure><p><strong>Mer Guard</strong></p><p>A Mer tribe warrior with strong defenses who can protect their allies. Can reliably protect allies with their Mer tribe characteristics of being immune to status ailments and having high magic defense. Abilities increase with other Mer tribe units on the map.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Phantom-Brave-The-Lost-Hero_2024_11-21-24_045.png"></a></figure><p><strong>Owl Gunner</strong></p><p>An Owl tribe class that uses guns and has high JUMP power. Abilities increase with other Owl tribe units on the map. Can toy with enemies by taking potshots at them from high vantage points while avoiding damage.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Phantom-Brave-The-Lost-Hero_2024_11-21-24_046.png"></a></figure></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He believes it so strongly, he’s willing to put his career on the line for it. “If he doesn’t get nominated this year, I’ll quit acting,” Brolin says. “It was a better movie than the first one. When I watched it, it felt like my brain was broken open. It’s masterful, and Denis is one of our master filmmakers.”</p><p>Not only is his career in jeopardy, but so, as Brolin sees it, is the integrity of the Academy Awards. “If the Academy Awards have any meaning whatsoever, they’ll recognize him,” Brolin said. While the stakes of Brolin’s current Oscar wager are higher, his delivery of it is much tamer than that in a video he posted a few years ago when Villeneuve failed to receive a directing nomination for the first <em>Dune</em>, even though the film  received ten. In that video, posted to his <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/tv/CZuP5dsl8Xt/?igsh=MXRqbmRmaGNibTZyZw==&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/CZuP5dsl8Xt/?igsh=MXRqbmRmaGNibTZyZw==" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">personal Instagram page</a></span>, Brolin was very close to calling the entire award stupid.</p><p>“I don’t know how you get 10 nominations and then the guy who has done the impossible with that book doesn’t get nominated. It makes you realize that it’s all amazing and then it’s all fucking totally dumb.”</p><p>This year’s Oscar nominations are set to be revealed on January 17. According to Brolin’s IMDB, he has two films in production, <em>Weapon</em> and <em>The Running Man</em>, and will more than likely appear in the third <em>Dune </em>film. So, either the Academy gets it right, or else we riot.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I loved making an older version of my <em>Inquisition </em>hero the first time I played through <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-best-companions-lucanis-taash-neve-1851688830&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-best-companions-lucanis-taash-neve-1851688830"><em>The Veilguard</em></a></span>, but the game doesn’t offer the option to import your Inquisitor into new playthroughs like it does with new hero Rook. As a result, you have to once again dive into each customization option for the Inquisitor and fiddle with the sliders until you get them looking just right, and while I enjoyed doing so the first time around, the prospect repeatedly killed my momentum when I thought about starting a second playthrough. However, fans have now found a workaround that allows you to easily import your Inquisitor from another save file and it’s pretty easy to do, if also a little convoluted.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

If you’re starting a new playthrough of <em>The Veilguard </em>and want to import your Inquisitor, the first step you’ll need to do in the character creator is skip over importing altogether. Tab over to the Finalize section of the character creator and open up the Past Adventures menu. This is the one that lets you customize your Inquisitor and a few of their past choices. Once here, open the Edit Inquisitor menu and go to the Appearance tab. From here, customize any option, literally anything. It can be a slight change in their head shape, their hair color, height, or whatever. The point here is to make the game recognize that there is an edited version of The Inquisitor in the character creator associated with this new save file, which adds a new option on the screen of presets, signified by a pair of bronze scissors. Your screen should look like this:</p><figure id="" data-id="672138d3b140ce12ede8de50d0e09c33" data-recommend-id="image://672138d3b140ce12ede8de50d0e09c33" data-format="jpg" data-width="1330" data-height="745" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of the Dragon Age: The Veilguard customization screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An image of the Dragon Age: The Veilguard customization screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="672138d3b140ce12ede8de50d0e09c33" data-recommend-id="image://672138d3b140ce12ede8de50d0e09c33" data-format="jpg" data-width="1330" data-height="745" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of the Dragon Age: The Veilguard customization screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Now tab over to Finalize and go back to the screen to customize Rook. Tab over to the Lineage screen, and it’s here that you’ll import your Rook. Doing this will allow you to customize your hero again, but also, if you do the above steps before importing, you’ll be able to import your Inquisitor by clicking on the scissors icon on their customization screen. It’s a weird workaround to the lack of a proper, built-in option, and I wouldn’t be surprised if BioWare patched in a way to do this without all the convoluted menu navigation, as it’s clear the functionality is there. Luckily, once you’ve imported your Inquisitor, they’ll look the way you want through the entire game now that BioWare’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/author/kennethshepard?startIndex=20#:~:text=Dragon%20Age%3A%20The%20Veilguard%E2%80%99s%20First%20Patch%20Will%20Fix%20One%20Of%20The%20Game%E2%80%99s%20Biggest%20Problems&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/author/kennethshepard?startIndex=20#:~:text=Dragon%20Age%3A%20The%20Veilguard%E2%80%99s%20First%20Patch%20Will%20Fix%20One%20Of%20The%20Game%E2%80%99s%20Biggest%20Problems">squashed a bug</a></span> that made them revert to one of the default faces during the game’s finale.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you’ve pre-ordered STALKER 2 or bought a higher edition, you’ll have learned that you’re able to unlock a series of unique weapons and outfits as you explore the game. However, it’s not immediately available where to find pre-order items in STALKER 2, which can leave you feeling confused.</p>



<p>In this guide, I’ll help you figure out where to get your pre-order bonus in STALKER 2.</p>



<p>Read on!</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-pre-order-items-in-stalker-2">How To Get Pre-Order Items in STALKER 2</h2>



<p>If you’re trying to figure out where to find your pre-order items in STALKER 2, you’ll need to follow a particular quest that’ll take you all over The Zone.</p>



<p>It’s called Seek, And You Shall Find, and it’s started after you complete ‘A Needle in a Haystack’ in Zalissya, the first major settlement you find in the Lesser Zone. The quest you need will be started once you’ve picked up a flash drive left in your stash by a mysterious individual.</p>



<p>Alternatively, you can track down the white, single-storey building and find the PDA jammed between two beds to kickstart the quest.</p>



<p>Once you’ve activated Seek, And You Shall Find, you’ll notice that a string of stash locations have been added to the map on your PDA. If you head to each location, you’ll be rewarded with an exclusive weapon or outfit – these are the pre-order items in STALKER 2.</p>



<p>They’re also what you’ll receive for buying the Ultimate or Deluxe editions of the game.</p>



<p>There’s at least one Journalist Stash in each area of the map, and almost all of them require a little snooping to find. Perhaps you’ll need to find your way around a locked door or up onto a building, but they’re all relatively accessible and with a little common sense, you’ll have them tracked down in no time.</p>



<p>It’s not immediately obvious, but that’s where to get your pre-order bonus in STALKER 2. It takes a little work and a lot of walking, but as you’ll naturally explore The Zone on your travels, you can work passively to tick them off as and when you get near them.</p>



<p>That’s where to find pre-order items in STALKER 2 – happy hunting! Stop by the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a> if you want to chat about the game.</p>

It has been republished here for the first time in November 2024.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Over 5 years ago, Harmonix developers were brainstorming about all the great ways that people interact with music and wondering how we might transform those interactions into authentic gameplay experiences. Dancing, with its visceral connection to rhythm, was the most potent and promising new idea. We knew that some day the time and tech would be right for us to make a fully immersive, authentic dance game. The opportunity to offer non-dancers the same type of approachable experience that exposed millions of non-musicians to the joy of rock music was a huge incentive to make this dream a reality. Serendipity struck when Microsoft showed Kinect to Harmonix, providing us with the perfect opportunity to develop an authentic dance game for a population fascinated with dancing shows and itching to get off the couch and join in.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For the dev team, this was the perfect opportunity to break from the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rock Band</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> paradigm and craft a new universe of characters and venues. We were confident that the controller-free, body tracking, and fully immersive capabilities of Kinect made it the right technology for our game. Further, the opportunity to work with choreographers and dancers on a daily basis injected a new energy into an experienced and seasoned team. However, like any team working on a new IP, we made mistakes along the way, many of which were important learning experiences for us. The following is a selection of our most notable successes and missteps.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Image via Game Developer Magazine, January 2011.</span></span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What went right">What went right</h2><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="1. Keeping it real">1. Keeping it real</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dance Central</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s design started with a lofty aim—to create a game that will teach players real dance moves. This goal served as a compass during early prototyping, leading the team toward designs that gave prominence to dancing above all else. We utilized the instantly recognizable choreography from Soulja Boy’s “Crank Dat” as a litmus test for potential mechanics, throwing out a number of pose matching and gem hitting prototypes when they didn’t stand up to the challenge of communicating moves like the “Lean n’ Rock” or the “Supaman.” After a few months and several iterations, we settled on our move names and flashcards approach, which handily communicated the entirety of “Crank Dat.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Although we had identified core gameplay mechanics that would teach real dance, we were still unsure of the makeup of our development team. In working on the Rock Band series, we’ve always considered our staff’s intimate knowledge of rock music a vital element of the franchise. Our developers’ experience touring, playing, and writing for their bands imbues </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rock Band</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> with an authenticity that we believe sets it apart from other music games. In order to inject the same type of authenticity into a dance game, we felt we had to assemble a team with a love for hip-hop, pop, and, most of all, dance.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At the dawn of the development of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dance Central</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, we held companywide tryouts to determine who would mocap the first prototype routine. We asked each prospective choreographer to both dance the routine to “Crank Dat” and develop a routine of his or her own design. While most Harmonix developers ran away screaming, a handful of Harmonix artists proved to be outstanding dancers and were promptly sent to mocap the first routines. This choreography proved essential during prototyping, but we quickly realized it would be critical to add professional dancers to the staff, both to create original professional-level choreography for the game and to teach the rest of the team how to dance.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We recruited local choreographers, eventually hiring Marcos Aguirre and Francisca “Frenchy” Hernandez as our internal choreography team. Marcos and Frenchy occupied various roles during development: creating choreography for game levels, holding dance classes for the team, and consulting on everything from voice over to song list. Their knowledge and excitement were a huge boost for the team. Through the team-wide dance classes, our choreographers imparted vital lessons about dance instruction, while exposing the team to the music, language, and culture of hip-hop dance.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As we tasked our choreographers with developing the first routines for the game, we refrained from imposing gameplay-driven choreographic restrictions so we could better understand what made up an authentic routine. This somewhat open approach was risky, but led to a refined focus on the game’s core mission, as we shaped our mechanics around actual dances rather than limiting or shoehorning routines into a rigid structure.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="2. Break it down!">2. Break it down!</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Given the complexity of the choreographed routines, it became clear that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dance Central</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> would require an in-depth learning mode where players could spend hours learning more complicated combinations. We set out to create an experience that was not only effective at delivering instruction, but also fun to play. We knew that if it weren’t fun, no one would play it, and therefore no one would learn.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our first step in designing what is now known as “Break it Down” was to observe Marcos and Frenchy. Their weekly dance lessons provided insight into how people master dance moves and routines. By observing their natural method of instruction, we narrowed the possibility space for BiD’s design, quickly discarding less fruitful ideas. We recognized that our play structure should emulate their teaching style, building on established elements such as the use of “recaps,” “slow-downs” (allowing the player to choose to slow down the action to give them a better look at the current move), and “verb barks” (shorts bursts of VO that step players through new moves, such as “Cross! Back! Step! Together!”). These elements formed the foundation of the shipping version of BiD and were critical to its success.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The same cross-discipline team responsible for developing BiD was also responsible for developing all other key gameplay features. This could have been an unmanageable amount of work, but we constructed a development process to mitigate the impact of the numerous iterations BiD required. Instead of continuous iteration, the development team worked with our internal playtesting department in a leapfrog fashion. A few key BiD features would be implemented, and while awaiting playtest feedback, the team would switch to development on something unrelated to BiD. Once playtest results came back, the team would refocus on BiD, with iteration driven by the playtest results. Other new non-BiD features, implemented in the meantime, were then sent to playtest. This alternating cycle continued throughout development.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We’re very satisfied with the final design of Break it Down. Its dynamic and detailed instruction methodology is unique to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dance Central</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and is a critical component of the overall experience we wanted to construct. While there is plenty of room for improvement, the mode’s variable pacing successfully pairs game-like motivation with effective teaching methods. This would not have been possible without the inspiration provided by the choreographers paired with an effective process of playtest-driven iteration.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Image via Game Developer Magazine, January 2011.</span></span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="3. Adapting workspaces and tools for Kinect">3. Adapting workspaces and tools for Kinect</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kinect doesn’t just enable new ways of playing games, it also demands new approaches to making games. At the onset of development, it was immediately clear that our existing workspaces lacked the physical space for developers to easily play and test the game. After reorganizing our office layout, we were able to give everyone on the team the room they needed to stand up, get down, and move around.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Next, we realized that it was difficult for coders, designers, and artists to maintain an efficient workflow if they frequently needed to stand up, wait for their skeleton to be tracked, and then sit back down at their workstation. Our first solution was decidedly low-tech: Because Kinect is also capable of tracking skeletons for non-human dummies, we constructed makeshift mannequins to stand in for real human developers. Our UI coder even went as far as building a functional mannequin with a movable right arm for testing our “swipe” shell gesture (it became affectionately known as “Swipey”).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Of course, a mannequin can’t perform a dance routine, so testing efficiency remained an issue for many on the team. To remedy this, we made an important investment in a recording and playback system for Kinect’s skeletal data. We developed a custom solution within our internal engine, making it easy for anyone on the team to record, play, loop, and analyze clips of skeletal data. We used our graphics engine to create debug visualizations, using geometric shapes and color. Because each recording was stored within our standard object files, it was straightforward to organize the hundreds of recordings into a reasonable database-like structure by annotating each clip with metadata.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our recording tools proved invaluable for coders, artists, and designers working on any system reliant on skeletal data, including our dance detection, shell navigation, and freestyle “visualizer.”</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="4. Hitting a moving skeleton">4. Hitting a moving skeleton</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As a Kinect launch title, we were faced with the challenge of building a game for a completely new input device while that device itself was still in development. The challenges were similar to developing for a new console, but in some ways the process was even more fluid as the Kinect software platform evolved alongside the hardware.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Given </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dance Central</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s reliance on dance detection, Kinect’s skeleton tracking was the key technology we needed to harness. Preliminary versions of the tracking pipeline were less precise and reliable than the final shipping system. As we designed our user interface and dance choreography, we uncovered gestures and poses that were difficult for the early tracking to reliably detect. It was impossible for us to predict exactly how robust tracking would be by launch, and there was some anxiety as to whether we would need to simplify or remove moves and gestures that were undetectable.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rather than putting development off while the tracking improved, we accepted the situation and tried, whenever possible, to handle noisy skeletal data and cases of skeleton “crumpling” gracefully. We also began investing in sophisticated in-game detection technology that could better handle the possibility of imperfect tracking. The payoff was a more consistently playable and fun game throughout development. Even as the Kinect skeletal tracking was refined to its more robust shipping state, we realized that this wasn’t wasted work. Every Kinect game needs to handle cases where skeletal data isn’t reliable (e.g. if the player drifts out of the sensor’s field of view). Dealing with the design ramifications of noisy and unreliable data early on helped us better understand the capabilities of the technology and mitigate risk.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Early on, Microsoft provided us with detailed resource costs for using Kinect, including the CPU, GPU, and memory costs for skeletal tracking and other features of the platform. These costs are non-trivial, but because we had plenty of advance warning, we were able to plan and budget accordingly. The Kinect platform team also provided great resources for tackling some of the technical challenges unique to Kinect, such as smoothing algorithms, image processing, and latency reduction.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="5. The right scope, the right moves">5. The right scope, the right moves</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Creating new IP isn’t easy, especially when your studio is well known for one type of genre-defining game. We knew that the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dance Central</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> team would need the drive to do something completely new while also quickly reaching consensus on feature scope. We looked back to the work our studio had done developing the original </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Guitar Hero</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as a reference point. At that time, Harmonix was a much smaller developer. We had to be prudent about our ambitions while remaining flexible and innovative. Our imperative for GH was first and foremost to completely nail the core fun experience. Naturally, it felt like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dance Central</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> should share that approach.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We made the decision to keep the team small, composed of key members who had proven themselves on other Harmonix titles over the years. This was no easy task, given that we were simultaneously developing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rock Band 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">! This core </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dance Central</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> group was able to break into agile sub-teams that rapidly iterated on gameplay prototypes. There was a conscious effort to focus the design on strengthening the core dance experience rather than adding breadth and complexity. Adding a character creator, in-depth single player campaign, or other ancillary feature would have detracted from achieving our core goals. Instead, we spent most of our time perfecting the dance gameplay—learning how to best handle difficulty, building a teaching mode, and making sure our flashcard and spotlight HUD were conveying the right information at the right time, all in the service of keeping the dancing as fun and entertaining as possible. Our strike teams consisted of a designer, coder, artists, sound designer, QA tester, and a producer, each empowered to scope, design, and prototype the main gameplay modes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As noted earlier, we also made sure the team had a genuine interest in dancing and dance culture. That dedication shows in the final product. Having a common background, knowledge of club music, and passion for dancing meant we were able to approach all design choices knowing that they were grounded in the world of dance. By “speaking the same language,” we moved rapidly through iteration, since we didn’t suffer from off-the-mark decisions. We felt validated in our approach when we showed the game to professional dancers who were impressed with the authenticity of both the dancing and approach to teaching.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The combination of a small, powerful team, tasked with the goal of implementing a core feature set unhindered by feature bloat enabled us to execute a sophisticated game based on Microsoft’s brand new motion tracking tech in just 12 months.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Image via Game Developer Magazine, January 2011.</span></span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What went wrong">What went wrong</h2><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="1. Moving from “good” to “flawless” detection">1. Moving from “good” to “flawless” detection</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our move detection system relies on Kinect’s skeletal tracking to score hundreds of unique dance moves across our 32 songs. Delivering immediate and accurate feedback to the player about how well they are dancing is at the heart of our game. As a result, we knew that the quality of our detection would make or break the experience. We also knew it would be one of our biggest technical challenges.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Eager to start, we began prototyping our move detection with modest expectations in terms of how well it would work. It didn’t take us long to develop reasonably good detection. While our prototype wasn’t at shipping quality, it worked well enough to facilitate gameplay and choreography testing while our engineering team continued to research better methods.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unfortunately, getting from reasonably good to shipping-quality move detection proved much harder than our initial efforts led us to believe. Our two subsequent approaches demonstrated incremental improvements over our early prototype, but were ultimately deemed unacceptable and scrapped. We had learned a lot from our efforts, but we were running out of time. With only a few months left, we settled on what we believed was a solid technical solution.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To prove that this system was capable, we focused on authoring and tuning detection for one example song with the goal of getting it all the way to shipping-quality. The positive outcome was that the detection worked well and we finally had a system we were confident would do our dance moves justice. That said, we had an experience that remained unpolished until the final throes of development. This made it more challenging to evaluate our overall progress and led to other production woes as we closed in on GM.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="2. Behind the beat">2. Behind the beat</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After we got detection we were happy with for one of our songs, we began the process of applying that method to the entire title. It was immediately clear that we had greatly underestimated how much time it would take to author, tune, and validate this new detection for each song. With 31 more songs to go and rapidly approaching deadlines, this miscalculation created an arduous three-week “detection crunch” at the end of the project. This “detection crunch” bled over into a time when we were expecting to be focused on bug fixing. It was an immense challenge for the design team to revisit all the material in the game and to painstakingly prepare every routine for review and testing while we integrated other last minute additions like voice-over.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Furthermore, as each song was tuned, our QA team had to learn, master, and continually repeat demanding expert-level choreography so they could confirm the detection was working as intended. Dancing for hours a day for several weeks, our testers became physically and mentally exhausted. In order to acquire all the necessary test data, we enlisted dozens of additional staff from Harmonix to learn and perform routines. As our deadline loomed, it took a Herculean effort from our design, QA, and playtesting teams, with an assist from other studio volunteers over the final stretch, to make it to shipping quality detection for all 32 of our routines.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Image via Game Developer Magazine, January 2011.</span></span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="3. Getting low">3. Getting low</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dance Central</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s choreography covers a substantial range of difficulty, from simple two-steps to challenging top rock moves. We knew that having a broad range of choreography was necessary for the game to appeal to both novices and experts, but as the project unfolded we were unsure about the qualities that define the difficulty of a given move. We knew that delivering an accessible experience on easy would be vital to the title’s broad appeal, but throughout development, we tried and failed to establish an appropriate “low bar” numerous times.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our first attempt began with our choreographers developing a few complex routines and presenting them to the design team. The design team, a group with a range of dance skills, tried out each move and discussed which were easy, medium, and hard. Using those ratings, we derived easy and medium combinations and videotaped the choreographers performing them. We presented these videos to various playtesters and had each try to dance along, rating the difficulty of the moves and the routines. Unfortunately, our playtesters weren’t good judges of their own skill level or performance. Once the songs were integrated into the game and players were scored, we found playtesters struggling with moves they had previous rated as easy. This problem was compounded by the fact that we had already motion-captured the routines and couldn’t reshoot, given the release schedule. We were stuck with some very challenging hard routines.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We tried again, this time encouraging our choreographers to come up with a few very simple routines. This time, our easy and medium levels turned out much easier. Some of our more talented playtesters were able to pick up hard levels without much effort. We thought we had reached an acceptable easy, but then tried presenting these levels to some key high-level staff who struggled, unable to perform the majority of the moves. With important members of the Harmonix brain trust unable to comment on the mechanics of the game, we knew we had yet to find universally accessible choreography.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With a few months to go, we finally figured out how to use staff members with minimal dance skills to our advantage. We asked our choreographers to generate a number of very easy moves and set up a dance class to teach these moves to the self-described “bad dancers” at Harmonix. The choreographers went through each move, asking the novices to follow along as the designers watched and noted which moves they picked up quickly. Using this information, we crafted four new easy songs, which make up the first tier of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dance Central</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Although we succeeded in making these first songs very approachable, the difficulty ramp across all songs is not as smooth as we would have liked.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="4. Brand new routine—underestimating the new process">4. Brand new routine—underestimating the new process</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For many years, the process of licensing and integrating songs into our music games has been a well-oiled machine. The turnaround time from the moment a song is licensed to when it’s playable and bug-free in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rock Band</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is relatively quick and well-understood internally. For </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dance Central</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, we initially thought we knew which production practices would work and which new processes would be needed. We quickly found out how easily it was to derail an unproven process and how complicated and dependent all the steps of bringing a song to completion were.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unlike </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rock Band</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s process of licensing, stem prep, authoring, and testing, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dance Central</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s process became licensing, choreographing and vetting, song editing, difficulty creation, mocap shooting and cleanup, animation integration, clip authoring, filter tuning, testing, and a handful of other steps along the way. Our two-to-three week-long processes became a two-to-three month-long process. This new process was much more fragile than we initially thought. Early missteps, however small, would ripple through the months-long pipeline. A single delay in song licensing or a mocap dancer being out sick for a day could end up putting an on-disc song at risk of being cut. With this high wire act performed by a small team with finite deadlines, we had an extreme production balancing act on our hands. Our producers became very adept at shifting schedules to keep things on track.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was also easy to underestimate the physical demands of making a dance game. Both our choreographers and our QA testers were constantly being pushed to their physical limits in order to get their jobs done and stay on schedule. This physical burden on the testing and development teams was something we had never considered when developing previous games.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="5. It’s getting late; let's add VO and narrative!">5. It’s getting late; let's add VO and narrative!</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nearly all of Harmonix’s games over the past decade have placed a heavy focus on creating a deep connection between the player and the music. Elements that distract from this have always been given less attention; we’ve devoted little focus to developing complex narratives or fleshing out character backgrounds. Only one of our games, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>antiGrav</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, featured characters that spoke, and while </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Guitar</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hero 1</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> had selectable prefab characters, they never spoke, allowing the game to hint at a narrative context rather than inhabit a developed story. The Rock Band series has a very loose “rise to fame” narrative backbone focused on player-created band members, who start as unknowns and finish as superstars. However, all of this is presented in a lightweight fashion: characters don’t speak and are essentially blank slates onto which players can project their own personality.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dance Central</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the decision was made early on to create a world inhabited by an ensemble cast of unique characters. As with our previous rock-focused games, we would keep things simple; any narrative would be loosely implied and supported by a lightweight text-based player ranking system. Our characters would have unique personalities, but these would be communicated through their dance styles, body language, and fashion sense. They would not speak.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Quite late in development it became clear that the decision to mute our characters had been the wrong one. We reached a point where the animated mocap sequences that bookend each song were fleshed out, and featured our characters doing crazy dance moves and strutting their stuff. The moves looked killer! However, with no voice, our characters were coming across as lifeless puppets. So we made the decision to add character VO to the game. We felt that this would bring our characters to life in ways that the visual cues and animation had not. In doing this, we underestimated both the risks and amount of work involved, in large part due to our inexperience in this area of development.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We kickstarted the process of giving each of our characters a voice and immediately encountered a slew of execution hindrances further compounded by our tight deadlines. Our staff writer was able to flesh out characters and turn around quality dialog quickly, but was not afforded the luxury of time to iterate. We located a company to secure and record VO talent, but due to time constraints our choice of available actors was limited and our opportunity for pickup recordings and line tweaks was almost non-existent. We had to roll new code in to support lip synch animation, and as a result our already strapped animation department now had more work thrown onto the pile. Then there was localization to deal with... the list of complications went on and on. The mad scramble that ensued to resolve these issues and meet our already aggressive deadline added stress and distractions to an already taxed team.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the end, some of the characters came out fun and relatable and others missed the mark completely. We’ve learned that creating fully-fledged characters is not an undertaking that should be taken lightly or added late to the process; the risks in doing so cannot be underestimated.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Image via Game Developer Magazine, January 2011.</span></span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Get ready to get down">Get ready to get down</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It wasn’t until </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dance Central</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s reveal at E3 that we truly understood how our decisions would pay off. It was an amazing moment to see people engage with our game for the first time, cast off their inhibitions and realize that anyone could step up and shake it. We always knew that this title would push the Kinect technology to its limits and we’re incredibly proud to have made a game that is getting people up off their couches, moving around and feeling good. In true Harmonix style, we took on risky work in an unfamiliar space with a short amount of time, and delivered a game that fits perfectly within the Harmonix universe.</span></p><div data-testid="content-paragraph"><p><span data-testid="content-text">Lastly, a sincere and heartfelt thank you to Microsoft and the teams there that worked closely with us, all of who stepped up and delivered resources and advice throughout development that kept us on track and on schedule. Beyond that, we thank them for creating Kinect itself, through which we’re bringing new and authentic experiences to gamers and non-gamers, dancers and non-dancers!</span></p></div><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Ryan Challinor on UI/Nav">Ryan Challinor on UI/Nav</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When developing a Kinect title, you also need to create a way to navigate menus using gestural input. Microsoft hadn’t yet released any UI libraries or guidelines, so despite the fact that none of our team members had any expertise in this field, we set out to design a solution from scratch.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our approach to working in this unfamiliar and evolving field was to iterate quickly through rapid prototyping. This allowed us to fail quickly, identify what didn’t work, and eventually whittle down to what did. We formed a team to focus on the UI that met twice a week. The principal workers in this team were a programmer and a UI artist; the remainder of this team included the project director, producer, lead programmer, lead designer, and other senior members of the project. Generally these meetings had about 8 attendees total.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Here’s how we structured the team meetings: We’d begin by taking a look at the latest prototype, noting its deficiencies and limitations, and brainstorming ways to improve it. If someone had an idea, they would have to sell it to the rest of the team. Eventually, we’d reach a consensus and leave with a list of action items. Those action items alone determined the subsequent work for the programmer and UI artist. With this method we were able to allow a large group of individuals to have creative input while removing dependencies or changes in direction for the principal workers in between meetings.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As we ran through many prototypes, we learned some important lessons about full body gestural input. One major hurdle that separated this type of input from, say, a touchscreen, was the lack of an obvious way to signal engagement/disengagement. With an iPhone, if you want to press a button, flick between pages, or scroll a list, you can just touch your finger to the screen. When navigating a UI with Kinect, it’s essentially like your finger is always on the screen. Kinect doesn’t detect whether your hands are open or closed, so we couldn’t determine engagement that way. We tried using the player’s hand position in the depth axis and arm extension to determine engagement, and while it seemed like it would be an intuitive way to interact with this sort of UI, in practice it was unsatisfying and strange.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We decided to ditch using the depth axis, electing to use only the hand’s horizontal and vertical position to navigate. We prototyped a UI using this concept: a vertical list of buttons where a specific button was highlighted based on your hand height, and that highlighted button could be slid across the screen in order to select it. After the prototype concept was initially dismissed because it didn’t feel right, our UI artist had an idea for a treatment and created a video in Maya to mock up how he envisioned us using this navigation paradigm. He altered the look and animation of these buttons, while still retaining the same underlying user interaction. This added aesthetic polish elucidated the concept to the team, and the shipping version of our UI matches that mockup video very closely.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Following the launch of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth (which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-gets-nominated-in-the-game-of-the-year-section-at-tga-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nominated</a> for Game of the Year at The Game Awards), Square Enix is now entirely focused on the third part of the FFVII remake trilogy. We already <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-no-dlc-open-world-minigame-details/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">know</a> there won't be any DLCs for Rebirth to speed up the arrival of the final installment, but what can we expect in that game? Game Director Naoki Hamaguchi talked a bit about his plans in an interview with <a href="https://www.vg247.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-mini-games-naoki-hamaguchi-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VG247</a>, stating that the goal is to add some sort of different twist to make it a new and exciting experience.</p>
<p><em>I play a lot of games, a lot of open world games, and something I feel whilst playing a lot of these games is that you've got the core mechanics - or their fighting systems - and most of the content you'll encounter, most of the places you can go, most of what you'll be doing, can get repetitive. These games just use the same mechanics. There are no real changes, there’s nothing new to experience around the different regions of these worlds.</em></p>
<p><em>Obviously, there’s a great battle system in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth - and there’s a lot of fun to be had in fighting the various different monsters in each region - but I wanted it to feel like a breath of fresh air when you entered each different region. That you feel like there’s something new and exciting to do when you enter a new area. That you can experience something different with the mechanics. That’s why we wanted to put so many different mini-games in, and I feel we really managed to achieve our goal with that. It’s simply a breath of fresh air in an open world (or ‘open field’, as we call it for Rebirth).</em></p>
<p><em>So, are we going to continue with this same balance going forward? Have we reached perfection? I think if we did just do the same thing again for the third game in the series, then it wouldn’t really be very new or exciting anymore. I want to add a different twist, rearrange things slightly for the next game, and have a slightly different look to things. We don’t just want to make more of the same, we want to make new and exciting experiences.</em></p>
<p>There's no telling yet when the next entry of the Final Fantasy VII remake trilogy will be released, but it will be at least three years. In the meantime, Rebirth is likely to be released on PC.</p>

Overthrown is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">city building game</a> made by and for people who can't work out whether they love or despise city building games. In this curious concoction from developers Brimstone and publishers Maximum Entertainment, you are a chirpy anime monarch equipped with a magic crown that confers the ability to seize entire buildings and throw them away because aaaararargahragrhagh, I am sick of this dang sawmill. I am sick of perfecting the infrastructure. I am sick of stockpiling food for the winter. I am sick of my hard-working peasants and their happiness levels. I am going to pick everything up and hurl it into the sky.

<p>
The crown doesn't just give you superhuman strength. It also lets you sprint so fast that you can run on water. Combine your superhuman speed with your superhuman strength, and you have the means to accelerate the generic business of, say, turning trees into lumber. All you have to do is heft your sawmill over your head and run through the woods, screaming in exhilaration and despair as an entire forest ecosystem disappears into the building's whirling blades.
</p>
<p>

Every action in Overthrown appears to be conducted in the same spirit of nihilistic frenzy. Crops are harvested using spin-attacks and ground-pounds. Land is cultivated by using your shovel like a pogo stick. One way of summarising it is that your character is secretly the protagonist of a third-person action game, ported into a city builder by accident. They don't have time for all this construction and strategy! They've got places to be! Not sure what places, exactly, but still, get me out of here! 
</p><p>
The only problem with that framing is that the actual combat side of Overthrown looks pretty leaden and uninspired, but you don't necessarily have to fight the mutants and outlaws who raid your town. You can just pick up the mutant lair and place it next to the outlaw camp, then watch them murder each other.
</p>
<p>
The last twist in the tale here is that Overthrown is a co-op game, with room for up to six players (there's a moment of throwback joy in one trailer where it looks like they're advertising six-way splitscreen, but don't be fooled - it's online co-op only). Your friends all have magic crowns of their own and as such, are to be regarded with deep suspicion. They will throw your buildings away! Better throw their buildings away first. 
</p>
<p>
All told, Overthrown feels like a great fit for the kind of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/simcity">SimCity</a> player who's always itching to push the Godzilla button. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1133500/Overthrown/">It's out in early access this year</a>.
