            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-%E2%80%93-us-retailer-documents-shed-light-on-nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-plans.1148157/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-plans/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Retailers are expecting that they will run out of pre-order units for the Nintendo Switch 2 on day 1, despite Nintendo allegedly accumulating a large quantity for launch.</p>



<p>That’s according to internal emails and documents provided to Insider Gaming from a large US retailer, who are anticipating they will sell out of the Switch 2 on the same day they open up the pre-orders due to a limited unit allocation from Nintendo.</p>



<p>According to the documents, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 is scheduled to release in June</a>, a release month that has already been a widely rumoured and was a highly talked about by developers at this year’s GDC.</p>



<p>However, the documents do add a little confusion as to when the pre-orders go live, especially following the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-open-april-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Buy Canada “leak” </a>earlier this week that revealed they’d go live on April 2nd.</p>



<p>According to the documents from the US retailer, pre-orders are set to go live on April 9th, one week after the Nintendo Switch 2 direct. The documents include a messaging strategy following the direct to include “Pre-Order Coming Soon” messaging and a Countdown Clock that will end on April 9, with an exact time to be confirmed by Nintendo on April 2.</p>



<p>The documents also included details on a exclusive collectible coin for those who pre-order the console.</p>



<p>Whether or not Best Buy Canada’s “leak” was a mistake or not is unclear, but the company did promptly remove the information after it started circulating online. In any case though, pre-order’s are almost certainly going to live within a week of the direct.</p>



<p>Will you be buying the Nintendo Switch 2? Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

In a new interview, former PlayStation executive Shuhei Yoshida said he thinks NieR: Automata "revived" the Japanese game industry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://av.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/series/rt/2001799.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AVWatch</a> (as translated by <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1905573888693764488" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genki_JPN</a>), Yoshida said the Japanese games industry was struggling after chasing overseas trends in the PlayStation 3 era. He said he thought director Yoko Taro made NieR: Automata without thinking whether or not it would sell overseas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"From there, it became clear that Japanese creators were making 'Japanese things' and those things were selling overseas," Yoshida said. "Everyone realized that with NieR."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It was just a matter of saying 'it's okay to do it like that,' but 'we have to do it like that,'" Yoshida continued. "So the direction of Japanese creators became 'let's stop imitating overseas countries anymore,' 'if we create things with our own culture and that we understand, they will understand it overseas.'"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think the Japanese game industry was revived after NieR so much so that I would say it was before NieR and after NieR," Yoshida said. "To put it simply, I think NieR: Automata was the title that made people realize 'let's make something Japanese.'"</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">NieR: Automata has been, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nier-series-director-producer-and-composer-start-new-project-it-might-be-nier-it-might-not-be-nier">by all accounts</a>, a success for publisher Square Enix and the creative team behind the game, including Yoko Taro. It's spawned <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/nier-automata-ver11a">an anime adaptation</a> and a flurry of cameos for popular protagonist 2B, in everything from Fall Guys to Soulcalibur.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The future of the series <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sounds-like-well-eventually-get-a-nier-sequel-but-dont-hold-your-breath">seems a bit unclear</a>, as of this writing. While the mobile game NieR: Reincarnation <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nier-3-has-been-in-front-of-us-all-along-per-series-creators-tease">may well have been the NieR 3 fans were waiting for</a>, it was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nier-mobile-game-shuts-down-in-april">also shut down last April</a>. The creative team has worked on a handful of other projects too, like the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yoko-taro-card-rpg-voice-of-cards-switch-october">card-driven RPG Voice of Cards</a>, but NieR fans are still waiting for the next premium game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless, Yoshida saw a shifting of the tides with NieR: Automata. Given how popular the game is today, I'm inclined to agree. Hopefully we see more from NieR soon, but now, as we're roughly eight years removed from its original 2017 launch date, it's a nice recognition of Automata's already-tangible legacy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Among the news is confirmation that its launch roster might be a little smaller than you'd expect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In several Q&amp;As following a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_juWbTw4hc" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent video update</a>, both with <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2416952692" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fighting game content creator Sajam</a> and in the 2XKO Discord (via <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2xko-will-have-a-smaller-number-than-you-would-expect-when-it-comes-to-champions-at-launch-but-theres-a-good-reason-why" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VG247</a>), Riot confirmed there will be 10 playable champions — characters — at launch. According to game director Shaun Rivera, it sounds like the lower number could help get 2XKO in players' hands faster.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I know it seems like a low number. I know. Trust me, y'know, we hear it," Rivera said in Sajam's stream. "Honestly, we'd rather just get the game out to y'all to play ASAP, instead of keeping it in the oven until we have some number higher of champions."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rivera went on to note that, with systems like the different Fuses and Solo/Duo play, there are "a lot of ways" to play the characters on the roster. Plus, this won't be a static game post-launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"On top of that too, we're a live service game," Rivera said. "So [the] champion train is gonna start once we're out the door and in your guys' hands, so we're gonna start releasing those champions. We'd rather get it to you and do that, instead of just hold it for longer."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As executive producer Tom Cannon pointed out on the stream, these characters have also seen some changes throughout development. He referenced Jinx, who just got a gameplay showcase in yesterday's video update: "Go back to the very first announce trailer, which had Jinx in it, and you can see how much effort our creative department and the whole team has put into continuing to make the game as good as it can be. And then when it gets to that point, that's when we'll release it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, it's a notably smaller launch roster than most fighting games. For reference, Street Fighter 6 launched with 18 characters, and fellow tag fighter Dragon Ball FighterZ arrived with 24 at launch. On the smaller side, Granblue Fantasy Versus' original launch had 11 characters, and the arcade version of Guilty Gear Xrd had 13.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">League of Legends 2XKO launch roster of playable characters confirmed so far:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Ahri</li><li>Ekko</li><li>Yasuo</li><li>Darius</li><li>Illaoi</li><li>Braum</li><li>Jinx</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Katarina was also seen in some footage at one point, but has <a href="https://x.com/2XKOintel/status/1814798398828257793" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">been cut from the launch roster</a>. So there are three champions left to reveal before launch, from League of Legends' titanic <a href="https://wiki.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/List_of_champions" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">170 champion</a> lineup (as of January 2025).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it's a surprisingly low number, 2XKO has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/riots-2xko-is-the-tag-fighter-i-didnt-know-i-wanted">also impressed many players</a> in its public showings.

		<p>Back in February during Sony’s State of Play <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/12/mindseye-revealed-and-it-looks-pretty-darn-fantastic/">MindsEye was revealed</a>, with the game being in development by Build A Rocket Boy and published by IOI Partners. Today, more exciting news has surfaced as the release date for MindsEye has been confirmed and you will not have to wait long. On June 10th, MindsEye will be available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S with pre-orders being available right now.</p>

<p><em>“We can’t wait for players to immerse themselves in our tightly crafted game, MindsEye, with a</em><br>
<em>thought-provoking story where technology and ambition collide, and the inevitable consequences</em><br>
<em>unravel.”</em> said Leslie Benzies, Game Director of MindsEye.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>We last wrote about immersive sim sequel <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/system-shock">System Shock</a> 3 back in 2020, when then-developers Otherside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-take-over-system-shock-3">sold the franchise to megapublisher Tencent</a>. Development of the series later passed to remaster specialists Nightdive Studios, who’ve already overhauled the first game and are currently working on a remaster of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/system-shock-2">System Shock 2</a> for release in June.</p>
<p>Now, Nightdive have popped up with news that the System Shock 3 project survives, in some form, and that we could get clarification as to its status “potentially within a year”. Don’t call it a comeback, do call it a sign of life.</p><!--more-->
<p>“The situation around System Shock 3 is very complicated,” Nightdive’s director of business development Larry Kuperman hedged at GDC this week, in comments published by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nightdive-offers-hopeful-update-on-system-shock-3s-future/">VGC</a>. </p>
<p>Can we expect a proper update anytime soon? “Not as yet, not as yet,” Kuperman went on. “I don’t know when it’s going to clarify, but it could potentially be within a year. It could be, or it could take longer. That said, what I can say is that we have visions of what we can do within what we control.</p>
<p>“You’re going to see a remaster of System Shock 2,” he added. “I’ve been asked twice earlier today why we didn’t do a remake, and I said, ‘are you somehow under the impression that because we do a remaster that we won’t be able to do a remake in the future?’ That might be something that I can either confirm or deny. But there’s going to be content coming out.”</p>
<p>So there’s your bonus headline here: Nightdive might do a System Shock 2 remake after the remaster. Asked about the future of the series beyond retreads of the existing games, Kuperman said: “We’ll see what happens. I mean, there’s stuff that we can do within the first and the second.” Some expansions then?</p>
<p>It’s all very… non-enlightening. But I’m happy with any sign that System Shock has a future beyond hi-fiving the classics, and Nightdive seem like they could hack a threequel. In our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/system-shock-review">review of their System Shock remake</a>, Jeremy Peel called it “a breathtakingly beautiful and astonishingly faithful remake that proves the enduring power of Looking Glass design.”</p>
<p>Jeremy’s also got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-system-shock-2-made-stephen-kick-and-nightdive-studios%E2%80%9D">an interview with Nightdive</a> detailing how the studio got their hands on the license, beginning with a phone chat with an insurance company and ending with Nightdive’s acquisition by Atari.</p>
<p>As for Otherside – the studio co-founded by original System Shock devs Paul Neurath and Warren Spector - they’re currently working on a new immersive sim, Thick As Thieves.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Developer Pearl Abyss has announced that it is ending support for Black Desert Online on last-gen consoles.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.console.playblackdesert.com/News/Notice/Detail?boardNo=19140&amp;countryType=en-US&amp;boardType=0&amp;searchType=&amp;searchText=%C2%A4tPage=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">video going over</a> the plans, the studio revealed that the game’s native update for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S will launch on June 26, 2025. At that point, the game will “shift to an exclusive PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S service”. This will result in support for the game on the Xbox One and PlayStation 4—both of which received the game in 2019—officially coming to an end.</p>



<p>“Gameplay on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One will no longer be available after the porting update on June 26,” said Brian Choi, Black Desert console’s live service manager.</p>



<p>He continued to assure players that all game data will be saved and stored. Account information as well as all entitlements to Black Desert Online will be accessible when players decide to make the jump to the current-gen console version of the game.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>“We understand that this news may be disappointing to many of you,” Choi said. “Black Desert has been consistently updated to provide a better experience for adventurers. However, as we mentioned in our previous video, despite the ongoing efforts to optimize and update content for older generation consoles, we have reached the point where hardware limitations make it increasingly difficult to deliver the latest content smoothly.”</p>



<p>When the update is released, it will be available at no additional cost for players who are making the jump to the current-gen systems.</p>

that 23% of the cheaters were removed before they played their first match.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the new changes is the updated UI for Season 3. Activision says that a large portion of player-reported incidents are inaccurate and often console players. The report suggests that some of the inaccuracy might come from kills by players who used in-game intel like a Recon Scout perk or live ping. So, Season 3 will give players more detail on the KillCams to allow them to see if their opponent was using various game elements at the time of the kill.</p><p dir="ltr">Details in the KillCam widget will include:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">List of attackers who dealt damage with their username, weapon, damage, and hits</li><li dir="ltr">Affected by Live Ping: If the enemy had you pinged via line-of-sight</li><li dir="ltr">Affected by UAV: If the enemy had you pinged on the minimap via UAV, UAV Tower, or</li><li dir="ltr">Advanced UAV</li><li dir="ltr">Affected by unsuppressed weapon: When firing your weapon revealed your location on</li><li dir="ltr">the minimap to nearby enemies</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Season 3 will work to further improve the Ranked Play experience, which has previously been a hotspot for cheaters. The team will introduce a new system shortly after the launch of Season 3 that will help counter the impact a banned cheater had on the Ranked Play system with retroactive SR adjustments.</p><p dir="ltr">These actions include:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">When a Ranked Play cheater is banned, anyone they've recently defeated in Ranked Play will receive a SR Refund for those matches (to start, we will examine the last two weeks of matches but will continue to monitor if this timing needs to be adjusted)</li><li dir="ltr">Players who we detect playing with cheaters may have SR for those wins taken away</li></ul><p dir="ltr">A leaderboard scrub will also be performed before the end of Season 2 to remove any cheaters who gained SR illegitimately.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4467268-bo6-wz-season-03-returntoverdansk-002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467268" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4467268-bo6-wz-season-03-returntoverdansk-002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467268"></a><figcaption>Verdansk returns with improved graphics and lighting</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4467268-bo6-wz-season-03-returntoverdansk-002.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Additionally, Season 3 is bringing updates to the team's aimbot detections and the machine-learning system that analyzes game replays to identify suspicious gameplay for manual enforcement.</p><p dir="ltr">Changes are also coming to the account linking process in Season 3. Any account that links to a new platform may be required to complete a new security challenge to verify they are in control of the account. Failure to complete the challenge will block gameplay on that platform.</p><p dir="ltr">Activision also warned players against actions that could get them in trouble. This includes intentionally "teaming" to work with other squads to either grief other teams or account boost, as this is against the Call of Duty Code of Conduct and Security and Enforcement Policy. Activision recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-issues-an-extreme-warning-to-cheaters/1100-6530183/">warned players about account buying and selling</a>, as any account that has been knowingly sold will be permanently banned.</p><p dir="ltr">Lastly, players can expect several new layers to Call of Duty's anti-cheat efforts with Season 3, but to avoid giving away all the details too early, Activision says it will release an updated report on these new anti-cheat efforts closer to the Season 3 Reloaded update.</p><p dir="ltr">The publisher has recently hyped up the return of Warzone's Verdansk map, such as releasing an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzones-og-map-verdansk-returns-very-soon-see-a-new-trailer-now/1100-6529994/">OG Verdansk trailer</a> and bringing back nostalgic weapons and operators. Hopefully, these new anti-cheat efforts will be enough to hold the cheaters back and not ruin all the nostalgic fun.</p><p dir="ltr">For more news, make sure to check out the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-season-3-adds-iconic-mp-map-new-zombies-plus-jay-and-silent-bob/2900-6380/#1">highlights for Season 3 of Black Ops 6</a>, which showcase the new Shattered Veil Zombies map, several multiplayer maps, and Jay and Silent Bob operator bundles. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-warzone-season-3-roadmap-highlights-verdansk-event-omnimovement-changes-and-bots/2900-6375/">Warzone's Season 3 content is showcased here</a>, including the classic features and vehicles returning with Verdansk.</p>

                <p>What happens when you die in InZoi? It's a question that was somewhat explained by Krafton prior to the release of its life sim game. While there are up to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inzoi-has-16-different-types-of-death-including-shocking-and-unexpected-ones/1100-6530241/" data-ref-id="1100-6530241">16 ways to die in InZoi</a>, there are a limited number of options for what comes after death, including becoming a ghost and navigating the afterlife. Before you make your decision on whether to contend with the afterlife or simply reload an earlier save, we've got all you need to know on how it works.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#The_afterlife">The afterlife</a></li><li><a href="#How_to_die_in_InZoi">How to die in InZoi</a><ul><li><a href="#Types_of_InZoi_death">Types of InZoi death</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 id="The_afterlife">The afterlife</h2><p>When your Zoi dies, you'll be given the option to go on to the afterlife or reload an earlier save. The latter is self-explanatory, but what exactly is the afterlife?</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4467133-died.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467133" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4467133-died.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467133"></a><figcaption>The death tooltip</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4467133-died.jpg"></figure><p>Depending on your Zoi's Karma score at the time of death, you may be able to pass on peacefully, or you may be forced to roam the city as a ghost until your Karma score improves. While Krafton hasn't fully implemented the ghost system at the early access release date, we do know how it works thanks to the in-game tooltips that appear.</p><p>If you've been living a life of crime, maybe you decided to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-rob-an-atm-in-inzoi/1100-6530448/" data-ref-id="1100-6530448">rob an ATM</a> or two, maybe you interacted negatively with other Zois, or maybe you've been forced to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-out-of-jail-in-inzoi/1100-6530449/" data-ref-id="1100-6530449">get out of jail</a> more than once, then your Karma score won't be good. If this is the case, when you turn into a ghost you'll need to commit good deeds to raise your Karma score to "good" in order to peacefully pass on.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4467136-ghost.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467136" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4467136-ghost.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467136"></a><figcaption>Nyx the cat will guide you through the afterlife.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4467136-ghost.jpg"></figure><p>If there are too many ghosts in your city, you will find that it's difficult to create other Zois to move in. Other citizens will also be creeped out because, well, you're a ghost. While the ghost system isn't yet active in-game, it's unclear which good deeds will raise your Karma as a ghost. We're hoping there will be actions exclusive to ghosts, but that hasn't been confirmed yet. Ghosts are due to be added to the game around August 2025.</p><p>You'll also be given the option to go back in time. This way, you can save your Zoi from death before it's too late.</p><h2 id="How_to_die_in_InZoi">How to die in InZoi</h2><p>In our case, we were deliberately trying to murder our Zoi by starving him to death, just to see how this system works. It took three full in-game days of no food and approximately six "12 hours left" warnings before he finally passed away, so if your Zoi does die, it seems like you'll have gone well out of your way to make it happen depending on the manner of their dying. It's difficult to kill off a Zoi, at least through starvation or exhaustion, though it's a bit easier to be electrocuted while you try to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-rob-an-atm-in-inzoi/1100-6530448/" data-ref-id="1100-6530448">rob an ATM in InZoi</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4467138-starvation.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467138" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4467138-starvation.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467138"></a><figcaption>You'll be warned before your Zoi dies.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4467138-starvation.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Types_of_InZoi_death">Types of InZoi death</h3><p>While the developer says there are plentiful ways to die, including car accidents, even when running headfirst into traffic we didn't suffer so much as a scratch. Here are all of the ways we've discovered to die in InZoi so far:</p><ul><li>Starvation - Not eating for an extended period of time</li><li>Exhaustion - Not sleeping for an extended period of time</li><li>Pollution - Repeated exposure to high levels of pollution for a long time</li><li>Disease - If a Zoi gets a disease and remains untreated</li><li>Car Accident - When in a vehicle and experiencing a high-speed collision with another car</li><li>Loneliness - No social interaction or recognition</li><li>Slipping - Wet surfaces are a hazard</li><li>Electric Shock - Breaking into an ATM or repairing broken electronics can result in electrocution</li><li>Burning - Sims fans will be familiar with their characters dying in a fire</li><li>Embarrassment - While we haven't seen this ourselves yet, Krafton has mentioned Zois can actually die of embarrassment.</li><li>Old Age - The natural way</li></ul><p>Krafton has stated it will not add murder to the game, as it doesn't agree with it. However, it has said that if one Zoi accidentally starts a fire, and another Zoi is near that fire, they're likely to pass away. Make of that what you will.</p>

<p>The game was originally revealed as part of the Everywhere project from Benzies' studio Build A Rocket Boy; then in October last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-studio-to-publish-former-rockstar-and-gta-producers-mysterious-blockbuster-mindseye">Hitman developer IO Interactive announced it would be publishing MindsEye</a>.</p>
<p>Now it has a firm release date: 10th June 2025, across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. And there's a new story trailer to go with it too.</p>

<p>The trailer for the action-adventure thriller introduces the near-future desert metropolis of Redrock City, as well as the eccentric tech boss Marco Silva eager to change the course of human evolution.</p>
<p>"We can’t wait for players to immerse themselves in our tightly crafted game, MindsEye, with a thought-provoking story where technology and ambition collide, and the inevitable consequences unravel," said Benzies.</p>
<p>Adam Whiting, assistant game director at Build A Rocket Boy, told Eurogamer the team isn't worried about a June release clashing with the traditional E3 and Summer Game Fest period. "It maybe allows us to actually talk to players, engage with players around that time in a meaningful way," he said. "We're just very excited for players to finally get the chance to play."</p>
<p>Further, Whiting confirmed that the developer is still working on Everywhere. "MindsEye is a standalone game, but it is kind of connected," he said. "You can access it through Everywhere as a platform, but mostly we're really focused on MindsEye."</p>
<p>Everywhere was first revealed at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> in 2022, though its purpose confused players and rumours swirled around cryptocurrency and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/nfts">NFTs</a>. Benzies flatly denied this to Eurogamer during a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-producers-not-crypto-project-everywhere-is-part-episodic-blockbuster-part-roblox-rival">preview of the project in March 2023</a>.</p>
<p>It is, essentially, a platform for user-generated content, akin to Roblox, with MindsEye as a primary example from the developer itself of what can be achieved. More recently, MindsEye has taken centre stage with Everywhere humming away in the background.</p>
<p>MindsEye will be available as a standalone game for £54.99 / $59,99 / €59.99.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/layoffs-hit-gta-producers-everywhere-studio">company was hit by layoffs in early 2024</a>, a month after completing a fresh $110m funding round from investor NetEase.</p>
<p>Whiting noted to Eurogamer the industry's rapid expansion during the Covid-19 pandemic, which was followed by global layoffs. "We're seeing a lot of that stuff happening in the industry right now and it makes me sad because the games industry is full of so many very talented, very lovely people," he said. "But it's this period of the ebbs and flows, the peaks and troughs, and maybe it's in a bit of a trough now, but I'm sure it'll peak again soon."</p>
<p>He also noted that NetEase's recent, apparent pullback from video games hasn't affected the studio negatively. "Certainly, there's nothing that's let us to make any compromises or anything like that," he said.</p>
<p>"You know Leslie, he's a visionary, and he doesn't want to compromise on that vision for anything at all."</p>

I think the idea of a chill, cosy, and/or “Zen” factory <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a> is among the most pernicious to ever dribble from a game developer’s earhole, but I can’t deny how... soothing it can be to look down on a world of symmetrically nested conveyor belts. At least till your iron smelting district backs up. Modulus seems zouper-douper Zen. It also has a pleasing consistency: in this factory game, you shape and manufacture pieces for buildings which, as far as I can tell from the devlog below, can then be used to manufacture pieces for other buildings.

These building parts aren’t generic, liquid resources that magically add up into an airport or similar, once you’ve met the requirements. You can trace them within the architecture of the resulting construction. Rather than growing them from a given recipe, you’ll also sculpt these building parts from clumps of smaller cubes. You can venture inside each production facility to rotate, colour, stamp and trim these cubes to satisfaction, a mechanic that reminds me distantly of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/industries-of-titan">Industries of Titan</a>, but without the accumulating e-waste.
</p>
<p>
Yes, this is quite nice. It helps that the world you’re building factories in is a blend of pearly iPod paving stones and verdant plastic greenery. Very calming. Nicely... lacking in things besides factories.
</p>
<p>
“There are no timers, no enemies—just you and your factory,” adds the Steam page. “Relax and find your flow as you build at your own pace. Watch your factory expand, with monumental buildings emerging to meet the ever growing demand from The Grand Neural Network.” That last part sounds a little ominous. Still, I’m sure “ever growing demand” won’t cause any difficulties as long as the resources available to me are also “ever growing”. Incidentally, are there any animals in this world? Any people? Ah, no matter.
</p>
<p>
There’s a demo for Modulus in the works for 3rd April. It will encompass an estimated two hours of playtime, though it’s fundamentally “only limited in factory floor size.” It’ll also have an objective-free "Zen" mode and a tutorial. I guess I could have waited till the demo launch to write this up, but it’s a slow news day – it was either this or write about some <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> nonsense. Besides, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2779120/Modulus/">you can sign up for the Modulus playtest right now on Steam</a>.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/baby-steps-first-hands-on-preview-youve-got-to-fall-before-you-walk</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/baby-steps-first-hands-on-preview-you%E2%80%99ve-got-to-fall-before-you-walk.1148055/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/baby-steps-first-hands-on-preview-youve-got-to-fall-before-you-walk<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Five minutes. It only took me five minutes of my hour-long demo to become beguiled by the world of Baby Steps and see the promise of what developers Gabe Cuzzillo, Maxi Boch, and Bennett Foddy have in store for us. Baby Steps takes the simple premise of a guy on the couch, Nate, needing to find his way home after being transported into another world. It all starts straightforward enough: you wake up in a new world and need to put one foot in front of the other by lifting Nate's feet and thighs in an almost rhythmic way to make him walk, and if that sounds complicated, well, that is just the tip of the iceberg. During my preview, I climbed natural steps made of rock, walked across narrow beams of wood, and climbed the remains of a destroyed carousel from a circus, each challenging my grasp on the controls. Every location brought new challenges or obstacles and a new way I had to think about progressing over or past them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Walking in a game sounds so simple, but the complicated part and most significant challenge in Baby Steps is perfecting how to control the protagonist. Walking in 99% of games is as simple as holding up on an analog stick or pressing the assigned key on a keyboard. However, in Baby Steps, walking is anything but simple because while the left analog stick still directs movement, you control Nate's legs with the bumpers and triggers. Like QWOP, this took some time to get used to, leading to not an insignificant amount of flops, falls, and setbacks. But in Baby Steps, those setbacks are all just part of your journey and Nate's story of learning to put one foot in front of the other as he traverses landscapes decorated with natural and unnatural slopes, steps, mountains, and other obstacles to test your prowess with controlling him. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Baby Steps is shaping up to be the largest world yet from the team that brought us QWOP, Ape Out, and Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy. During my sessions, they remarked that I was the fourth person that day to play, and each of us had taken different paths as we explored. Although there is a great joke about it, Baby Steps follows in the footsteps of some other recent open-world games but goes even further. There are no directions to guide Nate on his journey, no map, no markers, no radar – nothing. You only have your intuition to guide you. Maybe you will spot a sign offering a reward if a lost cup is found and returned, perhaps you'll see the remains of a circus, or possibly something glowing hanging from a tree hanging off the edge of a nearby mountain. All of these and more are Baby Steps’s ways of telling you to go somewhere, and it works remarkably well; not once did I find myself lost in this vast open world or feel like I didn't know where to go, what to do, or how to overcome an obstacle. The biggest challenge is not in finding the path somewhere, but in the execution of moving Nate properly so he can maneuver around narrow ledges, finding spots to increase your height to reach the next foothold or surface you can stand on, and it's all done without the use of yellow paint. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yellow paint isn't as immersion-breaking for me as it apparently is for some. When chatting with the team about it, they spoke about how, while useful, it's a tool for developers to tell players the right way to get from point A to B. However, Baby Steps doesn't use it because there is no "right" way to walk up a slippery hill or climb a rock with precarious footholds. Whatever way you end up accomplishing it, that is the right way. Now, some ways will be easier than others for sure, but even that mileage will vary based on your experience and determination. The team expects some players to see a path that looks too difficult and take the easier route early on, and then, after they have become more familiar with the controls and Nate's capabilities, return and try that tougher route. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The biggest challenge is not in finding the path somewhere, but in the execution of moving Nate properly...</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also benefits to taking some of these more demanding routes or exploring the perceivably more challenging areas. Hidden little treats and bonuses are sprinkled throughout. The remains of that circus carousel I mentioned earlier actually had a funny little hat at the very top, and my reward for reaching the top was Nate wearing it as I explored the world. The catch is that these rewards aren't permanent, as I soon found my hat at the bottom of an outcropping of rocks after I tumbled while wearing it. The development team fully expects players to create their own challenges, such as, “Can I beat this game without losing this hat?” This may not sound like too tough a challenge, but it only takes one wrong step while climbing up a mountain or across a thin walkway to fall and watch your hat hurtle to the very bottom. Hats also aren't the only thing to collect. I won't spoil the details of that cup I previously mentioned, as it's a fun treat for some fans, but it gave me a good idea of the type of humor and extra challenges that Baby Steps has in store for its players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of humor, the few cutscenes I did manage to find by reaching various locations had me cackling with laughter during my preview. These cutscenes have a sort of absurd humor that stuck with me; the closest thing I could compare them to would be some of the off-the-wall humor you might see in an episode of Looney Tunes. Nate isn't the only person in this new world, but he seems to be the most awkward. Granted, the NPCs I met weren't exactly normal, either. From what I've seen so far, Nate's personality is a blend between that stereotypical child still living with their parents past the point that many would consider healthy and someone who would rather face hardships than interact with someone they aren't comfortable with. This trait becomes evident from the beginning of the game when he meets the first of what I hope are many recurring NPCs. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The sound design and music also have interesting quirks to them; hearing the collisions, impacts, and sound of Nate as he slams face or body first into the world around him evokes that feeling you get when watching a show, and someone gets kicked in their groin or stubs their toe. Now, there is no health bar to keep track of, and from what I could tell, Nate can't die, regardless of whether I fell off a two-foot or 20-foot rock, which will make it a bit more approachable for those who might worry about dying in a game like this. Accompanying the sounds of Nate colliding with the environment are sounds of nature, birds squawking, insects chirping, frogs croaking, and various animals coming together to create a discordant yet harmonic soundtrack to explore to. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I don't know what the future will look like for Baby Steps. It has a lot going for it at first glance, with what I consider is the studio’s most approachable entry. Many others have combined the various elements and mechanics to different degrees. Plenty of open-world games now pride themselves on removing markers from maps, encouraging players to live in and interact with the world; physics-based games have been around for even longer in various forms, either ragdolling characters or using it to affect the world around your character. However, something about Baby Steps's combination of these elements and their unique control scheme makes me believe it could be special. The team's approach to just turning players loose in a strange world full of obstacles, challenges, and secrets isn't necessarily new, but the way it combines them feels fresh enough to not only reach their dedicated fan base but also reach a new audience and welcome them to their unique style. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p>When Nintendo <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/its-official-take-a-first-look-at-the-switch-2/">finally officially revealed the Switch 2</a> in January, one of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/all-the-things-nintendo-didnt-tell-us-about-the-switch-2/">our major unanswered questions</a> concerned whether games designed for the original Switch would see some form of visual or performance enhancement when running on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/nintendo-confirms-switch-2-will-play-original-switch-games/">the backward-compatible Switch 2</a>. Now, Nintendo-watchers are pointing to a fleeting mention of "Switch 2 Edition games" as a major hint that such enhancements are in the works for at least some original Switch games.</p>
<p>The completely new reference to "Switch 2 Edition games" comes from <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/virtual-game-cards/">a Nintendo webpage</a> discussing <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/nintendos-new-system-for-sharing-digital-switch-games-explained/">yesterday's newly announced Virtual Game Cards</a> digital lending feature. In the fine print at the bottom of that page, Nintendo notes that "Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive games <em>and Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games</em> can only be loaded on a Nintendo Switch 2 system [emphasis added]."</p>
<p>The specific wording differentiating these "Switch 2 Edition" games from "Switch 2 exclusives" suggests a new category of game that is compatible with the original Switch but able to run with enhancements on the Switch 2. But it's currently unclear what Switch games will get "Switch 2 Edition" releases or how much developer work (if any) will be needed to create those new versions.</p>
<h2>We’ve seen this before</h2>
<p>Nintendo is no stranger to the idea of single game releases that work differently across different hardware. Back in the days of the Game Boy Color, developers could create <a href="https://www.retrorgb.com/graphics-modes-in-game-boy-black-cartridges-compared.html">special "Dual Mode" cartridges</a> that ran in full color on the newer handheld or in regular grayscale on the original Game Boy. Late-era Game Boy cartridges could also be coded with special enhancements that <a href="https://www.giantbomb.com/super-game-boy-enhancement/3015-4804/games/">activated when played on a TV via the Super Game Boy adapter</a>—Taito even memorably used this feature to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=TRALiaCidP4">include a complete SNES edition of <em>Space Invaders</em> on a Game Boy cartridge</a>.</p>

            <p>Krafton has patched out a bug in its early access release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/inzoi">InZoi</a>, which allowed players to run over children with a car and kill them.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/inZOI/comments/1jldd0w/i_dont_think_that_krafton_realizes_that_you_can/">post on the InZoi subreddit</a> titled "I don't think that Krafton realises that you can run over children in inZOI" had started making the rounds. Attached to this post was a clip from the game, showing a player hitting a child with the front of their car.</p>
<p>Once the car hit the child, the child was then launched ragdolling across the ground in front of them, with the impact ultimately killing them.</p>
<p>While the developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-like-inzoi-has-16-different-types-of-deaths-so-watch-out-for-slippery-bathroom-floors">previously confirmed characters in InZoi could die from getting hit by a car</a>, with game director Hyungjun 'Kjun' Kim warning players they "might want to be careful" near the road, it was never said that children would also be subjected to this death.</p>
<p>Krafton has now addressed this bug. In a statement shared with Eurogamer, a Krafton spokesperson said:</p>
<p>"This issue was caused by an unintended bug that has been resolved in the latest patch. These depictions are highly inappropriate and do not reflect the intent and values of inZOI. We understand the seriousness of this matter and age-appropriate content and we are strengthening our internal review processes to prevent similar incidents in the future."</p>

<p>Our Matt has been playing InZoi, and while he appreciated its "expansive customisation" and "richly detailed worlds", he was a touch disappointed with Krafton's life-sim game.</p>
<p>"The trouble is, it's all so <em>soulless </em>– its flashiness failing to mask a lack of personality. Where The Sims feels tuned for maximum chaos and carnage (sometimes exhaustingly so), InZoi barely mustered a single memorable event in the six hours I played. I milled about its empty streets, trudged around its handful of notable landmarks, sang a song in a park, and unsuccessfully tried to strike up a friendship with strangers before returning home," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-25-years-of-the-sims-could-inzoi-be-about-to-steal-its-crown">Eurogamer's InZoi impressions feature</a>.</p>
<p>"By the time I'd tired of redecorating and had clicked on everything in my apartment at least twice, I was genuinely wondering how I was going to fill the rest of my virtual day as InZoi's clock – glacially slow even on its fastest setting - ticked on by."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-let-you-connect-directly-to-a-switch-1-its-claimed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Nintendo Direct event to reveal all of the features of the Nintendo Switch 2 takes place on April 2, but that doesn’t mean rumors aren’t going to stop spreading before then. In a new claim by a known leaker, the Nintendo Switch 2 will have a unique feature that connects to the current-gen Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://youtu.be/l2QbjzzdVj8?si=TzuZlQutPSLgmFJk&amp;t=546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">eXtas1s</a>, the Nintendo Switch 2’s mysterious “C” button will have multiple functions. One specific function, however, is that it will let you connect the new system to an original Nintendo Switch. This will reportedly allow players to use the Switch 1 as a controller or screen for Switch 2 games.</p>



<h6 id="h-podcast-ubisoft-and-tencent-have-a-deal-gta-6-release-questions-and-an-exclusive-game-announcement">PODCAST: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/podcast-ubisoft-and-tencent-have-a-deal-gta-6-release-questions-and-an-exclusive-game-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft And Tencent Have A Deal, GTA 6 Release Questions, and An Exclusive Game Announcement</a></h6>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="BOOM ☄️ XBOX + STEAM : ÚLTIMA Hora 🥵 SWITCH 2 Botón C: ASÍ FUNCIONA 🤔 JUEGOS de PS5 en NINTENDO" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l2QbjzzdVj8?start=546&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>“I don’t know if it’s the only function, or it will have more,” eXtas1s said via translation. </p>



<p>He then went on to give an example of how this would work based on what his sources explained to him. Using Mario Kart 9 as an example, the Switch 2 user will be able to hit the “C” button and connect to the Switch 1, letting it then be used as another controller for the game. That would also allow, in this example, for Mario Kart 9 to be played on the Switch 1 screen to avoid split-screen play.</p>



<p>It’s unclear what—or how many—games this feature would work with.</p>



<p>As with all rumors, please take this with a grain of salt unless Insider Gaming can independently verify the information or it is confirmed by Nintendo itself.</p>



<p>What do you think of this possible feature for the “C” button on the Nintendo Switch 2 allowing you to connect to an original Switch?
