The Switch 2 will have a faster-performing eShop channel “even when displaying a large number of games,” Takuhiro Dohta, Nintendo’s senior director for entertainment planning and development, said in an <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fask-the-developer-vol-16-nintendo-switch-2-part-4%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Ask the Developer</em> interview</a>.</p><p>Dohta said the Switch 2’s eShop speed improvements are “thanks to the system’s performance capabilities,” which, of course, is a significant jump from the original system’s aging software that increasingly struggled in both menu and games over the years. “We believe the act of finding the game you want to play is itself part of the game system experience,” Dohta said.</p><p>Additionally, the eShop will have a new “Game Finds for You” feature that, as explained by producer for entertainment planning and development Kouichi Kawamoto, will let you “quickly see screenshots and watch introduction videos” for various games so you don’t have to “search every nook and cranny” of the store.</p><p>Nintendo has the chance to nail the next generation of the digital games experience if it can make the eShop more intuitive and easier to navigate. Add on the Virtual Game Card feature that lets you share your digital games locally with others for a limited time, and things feel even better.

For the most part, anything to do with the Nintendo Switch 2 won't have much to do with anyone in this neck of the woods, but its inaugural Direct did have some goodies for us PC players too. Like, for example, the fact that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deltarune">Deltarune</a> Chapters 3 and 4 now have a release date, June 5th (which also happens to be when the Switch 2 comes out but that's neither here nor there). Mind, this is almost a good seven years after the first chapter dropped, and almost four since Chapter 2 was released, so it's been a long time coming.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
That release date reveal came with a little teaser trailer that kicked things off with a person in a not at all annoying dog costume (that honestly looks pretty damn comfortable) before showing off a few, brief clips from the third and fourth chapters. It looks like everyone's favourite font-themed Skeleton will be back once again, alongside some new mechanics during battle, one of which appears to be manoeuvring your analogue sticks to protect yourself from… squiggles?

<p>
There's a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/guitar-hero">Guitar Hero</a>-esque bit too, and a couple of teases of scenes explicitly from Chapters 3 and 4 (there's tiny bits of the first two in the trailer) that seem a bit mysterious as well. Not much to go off of all in, but when has Toby Fox and co ever given away the goose that easily?
</p>
<p>
I can't offer you any more details than that, because there aren't any, though there is apparently a <a href="https://deltarune.com/newsletter/">newsletter</a> coming with some details sometime today that might be worth keeping an eye on.
</p>
<p>
As a reminder, Chapters 3 and 4 will be paid unlike the first two, and they won't be the end of Deltarune either. There's plans for a total of seven, so we'll have to wait and see about those last three.

This hasn’t changed from Switch to Switch 2. I also wanted to create an experience that as many players as possible could enjoy, rather than an experience made specially for those who prefer high-performance hardware.”</p><p>Dohta says Nintendo’s plan is that the Switch 2 name will “communicate simply” to customers that if you want a Switch, well, the Switch 2 is the newest and best version.</p><p>“We really struggled because there were so many different ideas,” admitted Dohta. But in the end, after lots of back and forth, we all agreed that it should be Nintendo Switch 2 after all.”</p><hr><p><em>You’re reading part of </em>Kotaku’s <em>ongoing coverage of the Switch 2 Nintendo Direct. </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-specs-1851773502?_gl=1*lqzwhi*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MzU5ODc5My4yODEuMS4xNzQzNjA5MDcwLjU0LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-specs-1851773502?_gl=1*lqzwhi*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MzU5ODc5My4yODEuMS4xNzQzNjA5MDcwLjU0LjAuMA.." target="_blank"><em>Check our roundup</em></a></span><em> for more news from the showcase </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-mk9-open-world-trailer-launch-1851774200&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-mk9-open-world-trailer-launch-1851774200" target="_blank"><em>including launch games</em></a></span><em>, </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-specs-1851773502&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-specs-1851773502" target="_blank"><em>pricing information, release date, pre-order information</em></a></span><em>, and </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-c-button-voice-game-chat-camera-video-1851774209&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-c-button-voice-game-chat-camera-video-1851774209" target="_blank"><em>what that mysterious C button Nintendo keeps teasing actually does</em></a></span><em>.</em></p><p><em>We’ll be continuing to update stories with news and analysis throughout the day as Nintendo pulls back the curtain on its most anticipated console launch ever.

As a result it will also be Nintendo’s most expensive digital release at $80. Maybe that’s to push more people toward the $500 Switch 2 bundle that includes a digital version of the game, a price tag within spitting distance of the company’s most expensive inflation-adjusted console release ever: the original NES.</p><p><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is $70 digital, suggesting the baseline price for all Switch 2 premium games has gone up at least $10 this generation. Plus there’s the apparent $10 price hike for all physical versions of Switch 2 games, even though some might only be game-key cards, meaning they just let you download the full version of the game rather than containing it themselves. It’s effectively a digital experience at a potentially 15 percent higher cost to the consumer.</p><p>And then there are the accessories. Joy-Con controllers are $10 more this console cycle. So are the Switch 2 Pro controllers. The camera, a big part of today’s pitch for the new hardware, is sold separately for $50. Switch owners’ current memory cards aren’t compatible with the new hardware and will need to be upgraded too. While some Switch 2 upgrades for existing games are free, others for <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>will be locked behind paid Switch Online subscriptions, which you also need to have to pre-order the Switch 2 to begin with.

Nintendo abandoning the graphics arms race led to better games but also a more economical gaming experience overall that more people could be a part of. <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> on the $200 Switch Lite lowered the barrier to much needed self-care during the pandemic for everyone. </p><p> “Not worrying about the price of games is how we end up closing the doors of the hobby and later the profession to an entire class, and one that further harms diversity efforts,” wrote <em>But Why Tho?</em> EIC Kate Sánchez‬ <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/ohmymithrandir.bsky.social/post/3lltn6mbyz22z&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/ohmymithrandir.bsky.social/post/3lltn6mbyz22z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Bluesky</a></span>. “I have worked with game dev students at wealthy and poorer schools and the path for all of them starts with when they knew games was a career path which often translates to when they began having access. Affordability is important and if you can’t see that I don’t know what to say.” </p><p>In addition to concerns about limiting diversity and economic gatekeeping, others have pointed out that Nintendo’s premium pricing strategy is being deployed at the exact same time that many in the video game industry are worried about stalled growth and losing ground to forever-game time sinks like <em>Minecraft </em>and<em> Grand Theft Auto Online </em>as well as endless scrolling time pits like TikTok and YouTube. Nintendo might be able to make the math work in its favor, but that doesn’t mean everyone else on the platform will benefit.</p><p>In addition to the Switch 2 Nintendo Direct, April 2 is also when <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/us/politics/trump-tariffs-nato-allies.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/us/politics/trump-tariffs-nato-allies.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trump plans to announce a slew of new tariffs</a></span> on foreign goods.

Bloomberg correspondent Takashi Mochizuki suggested Nintendo’s philosophy around its gaming business is shifting as well, in part due to increased ambitions and more shareholder scrutiny. </p><p>“The company now has the largest pool of investors ever, with its shares <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/nintendo-switch-2-set-for-gaming-s-biggest-ever-launch-even-at-400-plus&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/nintendo-switch-2-set-for-gaming-s-biggest-ever-launch-even-at-400-plus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">soaring to new heights</a></span> on anticipation about the new console,” he wrote. “Its recent crop of hires also comes from top-tier institutions and might expect a somewhat more cautious approach than the buccaneering spirit of the early era of video game development.” These new prices might not just reflect a pricier gaming landscape overall, but also a different Nintendo. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/motorsport-games-stock-falls-below-1-as-questions-mount/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Motorsport Games is officially a penny stock. At 9:50am ET, the company’s stock was trading at less than $1 on the NASDAQ. The stock has sense rebounded back above $1 as of publishing, but it remains in flux. </p>



<p>The stock has fallen over 7% over the last five days. Looking back a bit further, it has fallen by nearly 20% since the company reported its 2024 fourth quarter earnings on March 21. </p>



<p>Reasons for the stocks falling are multiple. Not only is the United States market a volatile place right now, but Motorsport Games has seen its value drop over the last couple of years. The company has lost both its Indy Car and NASCAR licenses, and currently only develops one game: Le Mans Ultimate. </p>



<p>It’s worth mentioning that the game has sold more than 100,000 copies since it released in early access in February 2024. However, the company itself is still losing millions of dollars per quarter, reporting a fourth quarter loss of $2.9 million. This comes despite the company increasing its revenue for 2024 by 25.7% ($8.7 million) compared to 2023 ($6.9 million).</p>



<p>Motorsport Games also has, as of February 28, 2025, $1.2 million in cash and cash equivalents on hand. With the limited amount of funds, the company said in its <a href="https://ir.motorsportgames.com/news-releases/news-release-details/motorsport-games-reports-fourth-quarter-full-year-2024-financial" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent earnings report</a> that it didn’t believe it had “sufficient cash on hand to fund its operations over the next year”.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming understands that the company has continued to have multiple discussions regarding either a complete buyout or, at the very least, the selling of more assets. Those talks, however, have not resulted in any known finalized deal as of publishing.</p>



<p>What do you think of Motorsport Games’ stock continuing to fall? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

                <p>Nintendo has officially revealed the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a>, which launches on June 5 and carries a $450 price tag. That makes it a fairly hefty investment--and if you plan to lug the handheld console around with you, it's a good idea to pair it with a carrying case.

There's also an <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/accessories/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">All-In One Carrying Case</a> large enough to accommodate multiple accessories, giving you two ways to transport your console.

Inside are a variety of dividers to keep everything organized, while a mesh net in the lid lets you pack cables and smaller gear.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-mario-kart-building-sets-get-nice-discounts-at-amazon/1100-6528603/">Lego Mario Kart Building Sets Get Nice Discounts At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pac-man-fans-can-preorder-shadow-labyrinth-secret-edition-for-only-60/1100-6528469/">Pac-Man Fans Can Preorder Shadow Labyrinth Secret Edition For Only $60</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-the-two-towers-4k-steelbook-edition-is-up-for-preorder/1100-6527748/">Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers 4K Steelbook Edition Is Up For Preorder</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-sci-fi-and-fantasy-spring-book-sale-save-big-on-popular-box-sets/1100-6527091/">Amazon Sci-Fi And Fantasy Spring Book Sale - Save Big On Popular Box Sets</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-bond-sean-connery-4k-steelbook-collection-is-up-for-preorder/1100-6530389/">James Bond Sean Connery 4K Steelbook Collection Is Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-skywalker-saga-4k-box-set-featured-in-amazons-spring-sale/1100-6530379/">Star Wars Skywalker Saga 4K Box Set Featured In Amazon's Spring Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-ultimate-2-controller-gets-nice-discount-a-month-after-its-release/1100-6529695/">8BitDo Ultimate 2 Controller Gets Nice Discount A Month After Its Release</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-4k-blu-rays-box-sets-in-amazons-b2g1-free-big-spring-sale/1100-6530318/">Best 4K Blu-Rays &amp; Box Sets In Amazon's B2G1 Free Big Spring Sale</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/nintendo-switch-2-direct-price<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We learned more about the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/successor/en-us/index.html?srsltid=AfmBOooAog79S-rWiMt9rJr71jSbhAStD7XtpVi7gpGegypesn8sCQIt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> today, in an hour-long <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrTVeYm4iIM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Direct</a> that featured a lot of hardware specs, a lot of games, and notably no information about the console's price. That information came later, in the form of a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250402229347/en/Nintendo-Switch-2-Launches-June-5-at-%24449.99-Bringing-New-Forms-of-Game-Communication-to-Life" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press release</a> that has a lot of folks wondering if this whole thing is worth it. Chris and Riley also wonder that, so we're here to talk about it.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Hello, Chris! What did you think of the Switch 2 Direct?</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>$450.</p><p>Sorry, but that's all I'm thinking. On some level I understand the price, like Trump is throwing a wrench in the basic functioning of global commerce...today. But that isn't what this feels like; it feels calculated to inflict the most amount of pain they can get away with. They didn't even announce it on the stream!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Yeah, not mentioning it on the stream felt very weird to me. I've seen folks speculate that, given everything, maybe the price was up in the air when they were filming the Direct, and I'm sure it will... continue to be up in the air as the value of the US dollar fluctuates, a statement that makes me feel like a total nerd to say.</p><p>You said as we were watching that this feels like Steam Deck money, and I wondered what you meant by that?</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>I know it's an apples to oranges comparison--the Steam Deck has a tiny market share next to the Switch and they're just radically different when it comes to ease of use. You're not giving a Steam Deck to a child unless they're strange. But $450 does feels like the upper limit cost of something you give a child, and if you're charging me Real Console money for this then I kinda expect to be treated like an adult.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>The Switch has always felt like a thing for kids to me, but I have to admit that's because I am not a Nintendo guy, so stuff like <em>Zelda</em>'s big serious story being delivered to me by a cartoon bird has always been a hurdle I struggle to jump. Do you think the Switch itself struggles with that, like the Direct itself is obviously geared toward adults, because they're the ones ultimately<strong> </strong><em>buying</em>&nbsp;the console, but that's not the hands it's ultimately going to end up in? <em>Hitman</em> being a <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/nintendo-switch-2-launch-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launch day</a> game is, like, very much not aimed toward kids, haha. And an $80 <em>Mario Kart</em> is... well, I don't even know!</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Mario Kart World – Nintendo Direct | Nintendo Switch 2" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3pE23YTYEZM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>Chris: </strong>80 DOLLARS! FOR MARIO KART.</p><p>I think it's worse in the EU, like the same but in euros for digital and an additional 10 for physical. It definitely feels like they're doing it to upsell the <em>Mario Kart</em> bundle.&nbsp;</p><p>It feels like Nintendo has a captured audience here and they know it. <em>Mario Kart</em> is the system seller. They're hedging against the very strange economic circumstances, but this entire thing feels like a test to see how much people will tolerate, and I think that sticker shock is real on this. This will do well regardless, but I'm skeptical that this will have the same momentum as the Switch, maybe nothing could.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Yeah, I mean I get that there are certainly factors here outside of Nintendo's control. But like... the "<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-will-be-a-paid-tour-of-your-new-nintendo-switch-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Welcome Tour</a>" being a paid game definitely feels a little like a squeeze compared to, say, how <em>Astro's Playroom</em> was free.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>Right, that should just be something they give you. That's charging you for a tutorial for a system you've paid for.</p><p>Also I have seen some people say that games have been "underpriced" for a while and point to SNES prices being basically the same for some games, but those were also real cartridges and costs were different. I'm sure Nintendo would love every game being 80 bucks again, though.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>It seems notable to me that we're having a whole chat about the costs, when I feel like we--or at least I--am generally of the mind that my job as a games journalist isn't to tell people what their money is worth, a stance our past boss Stephen drilled into me. Do you think that speaks to, like, something unique about this situation, or more to just the general financial anxiety I think everyone is feeling these days given everything? Maybe part of that is because the price wasn't in the Direct, which feels notable: You have a whole presser trying to sell me a thing, but don't tell me how much you intend to sell me the thing for.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>Sorry to go on price alone for so long, we live in weird times. I hate talking in those terms!</p><p>Nice things: <em>Mario Kart</em> as an open world game feels neat, and getting FromSoft to make Legally Distinct Bloodborne is one of the funniest moves I've seen in a very long time. That goes in the hater hall of fame.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Duskbloods – Nintendo Direct | Nintendo Switch 2" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/niKHDEKQ7xA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Yeah, that is fun! Beyond <em>Mario Kart</em> there didn't feel like any standout launch day games to me, which felt like part of the selling point of the first Switch.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I think they think <em>Mario Kart</em> is enough, and given how it sells that's not unfounded. I think everyone was assuming that something else was going to drop, but it doesn't feel like it's anything particularly urgent aside from "Your games now don't run like garbage."</p><p>I do wanna talk about some of the hardware. The camera and mic features are funny, but historically Nintendo has been very cautious about anything that could be seen as a potential risk to children. They seem to be handling <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Td4YTxpU_Eg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">parental controls</a> well on that too.&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Td4YTxpU_Eg" target="_blank"></a></p><div><figure><p><iframe title="GameChat – Nintendo Direct | Nintendo Switch 2" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fVjRBTy5irI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Yeah, I thought that was interesting! I'm intrigued by how they showed, like, feed from your camera can end up as sort of your avatar in some games; that seems sort of fun. That said, I cannot imagine personally buying a whole camera just to do that, but I bet lots of people will have lots of fun with it.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>At least they're having fun with accessories.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>And I guess now we know what the "C" button is for!</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> The mouse stuff is also fun. <em>Drag X Drive</em> feels like a cool showcase for it in the style of <em>ARMS</em>. And Being able to use <em><a href="https://aftermath.site/civilization-vii-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Civ</a></em> on the go like that is a system seller for a specific kind of person.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Drag x Drive – Nintendo Direct | Nintendo Switch 2" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hku89o38-hQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Haha, indeed. I mean overall, hardware-wise, I like what we saw? Despite there being no mention of <a href="https://aftermath.site/but-i-like-to-slide-the-joy-con" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joy-Con</a> drift, which continues to plague me on my admittedly under-used but much-abused Switch.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I mean, I guess? I don't know what's in there. I sorta do. But not really! Are they using hall effect or TMS sticks in there yet or am I going to have to open up my controllers again down the line?</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>I guess I can understand not wanting to highlight one of your first console's flaws in your new console showcase.</p><p>To me, then, maybe this all sort of goes back to, how necessary is this? But then of course that makes me think, well how necessary was the PS5 and Xbox Series X? What is technological progress anyway? What is it we expect from something like this?</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I think a bunch of people are going to wait, everyone is broke right now and the economy might implode soon. Knowing the future is impossible. It'll sell well enough and some people will day one this, maybe I will as a writeoff, but I worry about where this is going, where everything is going.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-pre-orders-will-prioritise-players-with-the-most-switch-playtime" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-order situation</a> is also sort of bonkers, which will surely make day one buying it harder, though also feels designed to maybe prevent scalpers and bots from buying them all up?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> That part feels like some cult leader stuff. "You must be this much of a real gamer to preorder a Switch 2." </p><p>Honestly, for something that has been in the works for so long, it all felt kind of rushed.&nbsp;Halfway through the stream it started breaking down, a big hiccough, and it felt like an on-the-nose metaphor. The wheels are falling off a little everywhere, even at Nintendo.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Yeah, it really... doesn't feel like the time to be excited about a new console, though that was also true of the Xbox and PlayStation. If I had a dollar for every time I had to write "it feels weird to be excited about this right now," I'd have a lot of dollars with which to fund this website.</p><p>Because I'm a bit busted inside, I do have some compassion for how the heck do you announce this thing today, the same day <a href="https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/tariffs-trump-news-04-02-25/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trump is due to announce</a> more about whatever he thinks tariffs are.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>For what seems like the 50th time.</p><p>That's kinda the thing. I have probably the most amount of sympathy for Nintendo I will ever have when it comes to pricing and still left the Direct feeling confused and mildly annoyed.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> If I had to make far more meaning out of this than it deserves, maybe what this whole weird thing highlights is the... lie of consumerism, and how interconnected everything really is? There's a vision of Nintendo that is, like, this brightly-colored world divorced from reality, but what we're getting instead is, like, look how this is a multinational corporation hugely affected by global politics and hardware tariffs. Reality sort of crashing through the wall like the Kool-Aid Man.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Like I said, this just makes me want to buy a Steam Deck.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-steam-deck-is-out-of-beta" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nathan</a> would be <a href="https://aftermath.site/valve-said-not-to-huff-a-steam-deck-so-i-huffed-two" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">proud</a>!</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/dungeon-synth-ambient-magic-fantasy-tolkein-medieval"><h3>I Found A New Age Of Magic At A Dungeon Synth Show In Queens</h3></a><p>Dungeon synth isn't a return to an imagined past, but a vibrant vision of the future.</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The long-awaited successor to the Switch will be available on June 5th for $449.99. It will be available for preorder in the US from select retailers starting on April 9th, as both a standalone console or bundled with <em><em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634632/mario-kart-nintendo-switch-2-trailer">Mario Kart World</a></em></em> for $499.99.</p><p>As predicted, the Switch 2 features a larger 7.9-inch LCD display, with support for 1080p resolution and HDR, 256GB of built-in storage, and up to 6.5 hours of battery life. The Joy-Cons are bigger, too, and now magnetically attach to the console instead of relying on a pair of sliding rails to snap into place. They also offer mouse-like functionality with select games, and the right Joy-Con sports a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/24107678">“C” button</a>, which can be used for in-game chat features, screensharing, and other actions.</p><div><p>As for games, the Switch 2 will launch with <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634632/mario-kart-nintendo-switch-2-trailer">Mario Kart World</a>,</em> along with third-party games like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/623660/split-fiction-review-hazelight-studios-it-takes-two">Split Fiction</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/20/23881536/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-update-2-0">Cyberpunk 2077</a></em>. The console <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24284745/switch-2-backward-compatibility-nintendo-online-preservation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will also be backward-compatible</a> with original Switch games and support enhanced versions of select titles, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641365/nintendo-zelda-botw-totk-switch-2-edition-announced"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the</em> <em>Wild</em> and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>.</p></div><p>Below, we’ve rounded up all the preorder information you need if you want to be one of the first to get your hands on it. We’ll be updating this post regularly as more information becomes available, so bookmark this page if you’re keen on learning more ahead of the launch.</p><div><p id="qNz1cS"><h2>How to preorder via Nintendo</h2></p></div><p>The only confirmed retailer as of now is the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Fhow-to-buy%2F" rel="sponsored">My Nintendo Store</a>, which comes with a string of eligibility requirements — one of which requires you to register your interest in advance of April 9th. To do so, you’ll need to sign in with your Nintendo account and choose which console configuration you prefer (and which accessories). Then, you’ll receive an invitation email when it’s time to buy it, assuming you’ve satisfied several other conditions.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->450</span></p><div><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 offers a 7.9-inch display with 1080p resolution and HDR support. It also features improved processing power and larger Joy-Con controllers, which magnetically attach to the sides of the console.</p></div></div><p>As of right now, the reservation process is limited to Nintendo account holders in the US and Canada who are at least 18 years old. Invitations will be valid for 72 hours and will be “prioritized on a first-come, first-served basis,” according to Nintendo; you’ll also need to have purchased a Nintendo Switch Online membership for a minimum of 12 months and have logged 50 hours of gameplay on the original Switch as of April 2nd, 2025, to be eligible. What’s more, you must have opted in to <em>share</em> gameplay data with Nintendo (you can see if you’ve done so <a href="https://accounts.nintendo.com/privacy">in the privacy section</a> when logged into your account).</p><p>Once invitations have been sent to account holders who have met these criteria, Nintendo says it will send invitations to “remaining eligible registrants” on a first-come, first-served basis. Unsurprisingly, the invitations will be nontransferable and sent to the email address you used while registering your interest with Nintendo. Console and accessory purchases will be limited to one per eligible account, at least during the initial invitation period, with the first batch of invitations going out on May 8th.</p><p>Additional invitations will follow periodically, though Nintendo hasn’t specified details beyond that.</p><div><p id="how-to-preorder-elsewhere"><h2>How to preorder elsewhere</h2></p></div><p>As mentioned above, Nintendo is the only retailer thus far that has provided any insight into how preorders will work when they open on April 9th. That said, you can already sign up at <a rel="sponsored" href="https://howl.link/jjuweufjmbxay">Best Buy</a> and <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fconsoles-hardware%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-2%2F20019700.html" rel="sponsored">GameStop</a> to receive notifications about the upcoming console and games. Presumingly, this will also include preorder details once they’re available.</p><p>Like with previous launches, we anticipate that Amazon, <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Fnintendo-switch-games-video%2F-%2FN-p86ax%3Ftype%3Dproducts" rel="sponsored">Target</a>, and Walmart will all have limited stock of the console, as well. But despite Nintendo “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/606817/nintendo-switch-2-production-demand-q-a">taking risks</a>” to ensure it can meet demands, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/638668/you-might-have-a-hard-time-getting-a-switch-2">reports indicate</a> that US retailers might not have enough Switch 2 consoles to meet preorder demands. With any luck, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/641559/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-gameplay-requirements">Nintendo’s stringent reservation requirements</a> will thwart any potential scalpers.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It's called Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD, and it's coming to the console at launch on June 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Bravely series of RPGs was begun as a spin-off of sorts of Final Fantasy back in the 3DS era, with Bravely Default: Flying Fairy being the first in the series. The games feature a unique battle mechanic where players can either opt to "Default" or defend, and store energy to then "Brave" and make multiple moves in a single turn.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Bravely Default making a return is a big deal, as both Bravely Default and Bravely Second, its direct sequel, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bravely-default-3ds-games-shutting-down-online-features-soon">had their online city-building features shut down</a> in 2023. This version appears to bring back the online features in some fashion, alongside "upgraded features and enhancements" and a number of new minigames. The exact nature of these upgrades is still up in the air, so we'll have to wait to find out exactly how much is different.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Switch already has one Bravely game, Bravely Default 2 (not to be confused with the aforementioned Bravely Second), which came out in 2022 and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bravely-default-2-review">which we gave an 8/10</a>, calling it "a long, familiar JRPG journey with excellent customizable combat and beautiful backdrops that pass the time as you work through its extended stretches of grinding."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on everything announced at the Nintendo Direct today <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-everything-announced">right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

It’s far from a release date and could absolutely be pushed, but for now, it’s the most promising update for Hollow Knight: Silksong we’ve gotten in years.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Originally confirmed for just Nintendo Switch and PC, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-trailer"><u>Xbox (and Game Pass)</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-confirmed-for-ps4-and-ps5"><u>PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5</u></a> versions being added later, Team Cherry has been slowly ramping up the conversation around Silksong after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-expect-hollow-knight-silksong-news-at-e3-2021"><u>going quiet for a long time</u></a>. It was announced a whopping six years ago almost to the day, and outside of the occasional pop-up, it has laid dormant since. The studio behind the Hollow Knight follow-up did promise that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-release-window-next-12-months"><u>launch would soon arrive back in 2022</u></a>, but as the months came and went, hope began to dwindle that Hollow Knight: Silksong would ever arrive - until recently.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Team Cherry kicked off 2025 with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-dev-fuels-nintendo-switch-2-direct-fever-with-a-picture-of-a-chocolate-cake">a mysterious tease related to a chocolate cake recipe</a>, leading desperate fans to hope that a re-reveal would arrive in April. Of course, we now know that, somehow, the riddle-solving Hollow Knight fans were right to expect a reveal alongside the Switch 2 Direct. Although today’s 2025 release window promise offered little in terms of actually showing what the game has to offer, it’s at least something to mark on your calendars.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Time will tell if Team Cherry will finally be able to nail down a Hollow Knight: Silksong release date before the year is out. In the meantime, you can see everything else announced during today’s Nintendo Switch 2 Direct <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-everything-announced"><u>here</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

Over on the official Nintendo store, the company is implementing some pre-order measures to ensure bona fide Switch players are getting their pre-orders.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/how-to-buy/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">My Nintendo Store</a>, those with a Nintendo Account can register their interest in pre-ordering a Nintendo Switch 2 system and "select accessories" from the Nintendo Store. Those who express interest will then get an invitation email once their turn in line comes up, valid for 72 hours. The catch? You'll need to have put in some time on your old Switch, and been a Switch Online member.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Invitation emails will be prioritized on a first-come, first-served basis to registrants who have purchased a Nintendo Switch Online membership with a minimum of 12 months of paid membership and a minimum of 50 total gameplay hours, as of April 2, 2025," according to the fine print on the site.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo also notes that invitations are "non-transferable" and will be sent to email addresses associated with the Nintendo Account that registers interest. For the system and each accessory, there will also be a one-per-account limit during the invitation period. Currently on the site, you can express interest in either a base Nintendo Switch 2 system, or the one bundled with Mario Kart World.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Orders will be shipped after purchase, and the approximate shipping date will be provided when ordering. Nintendo also specifies: "Please note that release-day delivery is not guaranteed due to processing and shipment times."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While not said outright by Nintendo, all of these measures seem dedicated towards ensuring that someone buying a Switch 2 through this process is someone who wants to purchase and play a Switch 2 for themselves, rather than flip it online.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Direct: Nintendo Switch 2 Console Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Scalping has been a frequent problem for new releases of sought-after products.

It's vampire-themed, but somehow it's not Bloodborne 2. It's called The Duskbloods, and it's coming in 2026.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Direct: Nintendo Switch 2 - The Dusk Bloods</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The trailer opens with a man slumped on a chair, asleep or perhaps dead. A woman's hand reaches up to his dangling one from the floor, while a woman's voiceover says, "I give you my blood. I give you my life. Turn a wheel, and transport him to a night of moonlight, to humanity's very dusk." As she withdraws her hand, she leaves a symbol carved on the back of his.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The rest of the trailer showcases a dark, gothic world: chapels, railroads, towering buildings, dim lighting, cemetaries, bats, enormous statues, and a host of very FromSoftware enemies. At one point, a character flies around with a jetpack. There's a big, creepy moon. We see melodramatic swords, guns, and other weapons used as well as magic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your character, the guy in the opening, appears to be a vampire, as there's a moment where he bites into the neck of an enemy and absolutely menaces it. It also looks like you'll be able to play in co-op in some form, as we see another person summoned alongside the player and seemingly about to fight with them. FromSoftware itself took to social media to announce that Duskbloods is a "PvPvE-focused multiplayer action title."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">We are pleased to announce "The Duskbloods" - a PvPvEfocused multiplayer action title for the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2. Release is currently planned for 2026. We hope you look forward to it. <a href="https://t.co/aAVXeuDrVI" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/aAVXeuDrVI</a></p>— FROMSOFTWARE (@fromsoftware_pr) <a href="https://twitter.com/fromsoftware_pr/status/1907442980665143744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 2, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Essentially, this looks like the Bloodborne sequel everyone's been asking for, but it's not named Bloodborne. That's likely because Bloodborne is owned by Sony, which hasn't seemed interested in doing any kind of follow-up to the game despite high fan demand. The Duskbloods appears to be FromSoftware's answer to that fan demand, and Nintendo Switch 2 players get the benefit of it. And it looks like FromSoftware is going all-in on Switch 2 support, as it's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nintendo-switc-2">also bringing Elden Ring to the platform</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We gave Bloodborne itself <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/24/bloodborne-review">a 9.1/10 at launch</a>, saying it "delivers an exhausting and exhilerating journey into the depths of madness."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on everything announced at the Nintendo Direct today <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-everything-announced">right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <p>
EA Sports has offered some scant clarification as to whether or not its EA Sports FC and Madden NFL games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">announced today as coming to the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, will be fully-fledged annual entries such as FC 26, or more limited 'Legacy'-style versions. The Switch 2 versions, EA says, will aim for parity "as much as the hardware allows."
</p>
<p>
"We're excited to bring two of our most beloved franchises - EA SPORTS FC and Madden NFL - to Nintendo's Switch 2, giving fans even more ways to play the sports they love, anytime and anywhere," opened EA's statement, provided to Eurogamer. "Both experiences are being built specifically for the new handheld platform, grounded in what fans enjoy from our franchises across platforms. We look forward to sharing more soon."
</p>
<p>
The developer-publisher also added a few other points of slight clarification, in response to hypothetical questions. For the question of whether or not there would be feature and/or visual parity with current-generation consoles such as the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, the response was:

<p>
"We'll share more details on the Madden NFL and FC experiences for Switch 2 at a later date, but our goal is always to deliver a consistent player experience across platforms as much as the hardware allows." 
</p>
<p>
It was also non-committal on questions about crossplay - more to share "at a later date" - as well as whether entries named FC 26 and Madden NFL 26 will feature on the consoles at all, whether other EA Sports games will come to the platforms, and really any other details, too. To the hypothetical question of whether these Switch 2 versions are different SKUs to current and upcoming EA Sports games, the response was that the Madden NFL and FC "experiences" are "designed for the Switch 2."
</p>
<p>
"We're excited to bring two of our most beloved franchises, EA SPORTS FC and Madden NFL, to Nintendo's new handheld platform, Switch 2. It's a great opportunity to reach even more fans - especially younger players - with the sports they love," EA also added.
</p>
<p>
In previous years, EA Sports has released "Legacy Edition" games for handheld consoles like the original Switch, with heavily stripped-back features and simply updated team rosters and stats for each new, full-priced entry. Last year, for FC 25 on the Switch, there was a more significant version however, which has led to hopes EA Sports will continue to provide versions closer to those on the other current-gen consoles.
</p>
<p>
As for how to interpret those responses, well, in brief: it looks like we probably won't get full feature parity, and the games may even launch under different names to the PS5, Xbox, and PC versions, but at least a more substantial entry than the Legacy years gone by isn't off the table (yet).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-duskbloods-fromsoftware-nintendo-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>developer FromSoftware has announced&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods</em>, a multiplayer-focused Switch 2-exclusive PvPvE game with more than a hint of the creator's other franchises about it.</p>

<p><em>The Duskbloods&nbsp;</em>was revealed as part of today's Nintendo Direct presentation, alongside the likes of Switch 2 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">launch lineup game&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">Mario Kart World</a>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2" rel="nofollow">3D platformer&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a>, which is coming in July.</p>

<p>The debut trailer for the game looks suitably&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne</em>-esque, with a lot of Victorian-era architecture looming over imposing-looking backstreets, although the arrival of a futuristic-looking train does throw the usual FromSoftware vibe off a little (in a good way!).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-duskbloods-switch-2-fromsoftware-moon.jpg?itok=RjvN1WrO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-duskbloods-switch-2-fromsoftware-moon.jpg?itok=pDjlOX4k 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Yup, that looks like a FromSoftware creation alright.</figcaption></figure><p>There's plenty of classic FromSoftware imagery and music in the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods</em>. Whether it's an imposing-looking cathedral with a massive stained-glass window or a horrific monster crawling towards the camera in an underground lair, it looks like you'll get your money's worth from this one.</p>

<p>While this trailer does show off some of the gameplay you can expect from&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods</em>, it's a typically elliptical FromSoftware creation, so it's not giving too much away. You'll see brief moments of gameplay rather than extended sequences.</p>

<p>Indeed, not much about the game is given away at all in its initial announcement; it'll revolve around something called "moontears", and blood appears to be a prominent theme in&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods</em>, but we'll likely learn more in the coming months.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for FromSoftware's&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>




<p><em>The Duskbloods&nbsp;</em>is one of many games coming to the Switch 2 in the next year or so; others include ports of games like&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6</em>, as well as a new&nbsp;<em>Hyrule Warriors&nbsp;</em>game and many more.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods&nbsp;</em>when it launches exclusively for Switch 2 sometime next year. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>
