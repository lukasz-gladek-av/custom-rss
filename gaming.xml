            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/one-more-multiverse-vtt-platform-announces-closure<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sad news for online tabletop gaming fans. The virtual tabletop platform <em>One More Multiverse</em> has announced that it will be closing the platform. Thankfully, it has provided users a grace period to back up any resources they have on the platform.</p>
<h2>The One More Multiverse closure announcement</h2>
<p>The closure of One More Multiverse was made public by an <a href="https://multiverse.com/letter" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official post</a> on their website. According to the post, the developers of the VTT mention how proud they are of their team, citing their ambitions for the digital tabletop platform.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We spent the past year working very hard to develop a new path forward, but after careful consideration, it’s become clear that it’s not enough to support the OMM platform. For that, we are sorry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For those unaware, One More Multiverse launched in 2020 with a development team of just five people.</p>
<p>It stood out from other VTTs mostly in its aesthetic design and accessibility. It provided players with thousands of art assets made up of retro pixel art. These assets could be used to make different scenes and scenarios, as well as character sheets, maps, notes, and story handouts.</p>
<p>As for supported systems, it was relatively niche. Compared to <a href="https://blog.roll20.net/posts/roll20-is-coming-to-discord-activities/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Roll20's</a> comprehensive support of tactical maps and the recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/alchemy-rpg-vtts-and-focus-on-roleplaying">Alchemy VTT's</a> emphasis on motion art and custom soundscapes, One More Multiverse had official support for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/humblewood-debuts-on-dd-beyond"><em>Humblewood</em></a>, <em>Blades in the Dark</em>, and <em>Yazebas</em>.</p>
<p>Luckily, there is a grace period for players who share stories on this platform. All assets and verses will be up for 90 days. The developers encourage players to download character cards, take screenshots of their verses, and save any NPCs. In addition, they will answer any other questions in a Q&amp;A on their Discord server.</p>
<p>For those who worked at One More Multiverse, the post mentions that they will not be left to fend for themselves. Employees will be provided severance, healthcare extensions, and dedicated support for job search.</p>

<p>Now that we officially have a title for the upcoming Assassin’s Creed Shadows, formerly Assassin’s Creed Red, let’s dive into the main protagonist. Yasuke, a formerly enslaved person and now renowned samurai, takes center stage in the upcoming open-world adventure. But his story could use a little time in the light, so let’s learn more about this unique character in the game’s world!</p>



<h2 id="h-who-is-yasuke-in-assassin-s-creed-shadows">Who is Yasuke in Assassin’s Creed Shadows?</h2>



<p>Yasuke, a real-life samurai, underwent a significant rewrite for the story of Assassin’s Creed Shadows. In the game, he’ll supposedly play the role of a slave traveling across the ocean via a slave ship when an unknown force suddenly attacks it. In the heat of battle, everyone, including the man’s lover, is slain in battle. Everyone except for Yasuke, who is rescued and transported to Japan. There, he learns how to become a samurai under the tutelage of the famous Nobunaga.</p>



<p>In Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Yasuke will inevitably ally with Naoe in an effort to oversee Japan’s unification. </p>

<p>Yes! You will play as both Yasuke, the samurai, and Naoe, a shinobi. Yasuke is likely to be more of a frontline fighter—a focus on combat. Alternatively, Naoe likely allows for more stealth-oriented gameplay, as in past Assassin’s Creed titles. As a shinobi—a ninja—she’ll skulk in the shadows and attack from above.</p>



<p>While indeed not the first female protagonist in the franchise—see Kassandra in Assassin’s Creed Odyssey or Eivor in Assassin’s Creed Valhalla—it will be the first time the female protagonist provided a completely different playstyle from the male counterpart. It’s also not a singular character, like in past games, just the female version of the male. Naoe is a unique character alongside Yasuke!</p>



<hr>



<p>We’re beyond excited for the release of Assassin’s Creed Shadows at Insider Gaming. In the meantime, we have other coverage you may find interesting:</p>

<p data-characters="298" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you’ve been fighting with <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/disney-dreamlight-valley-gets-a-temporary-fix-for-oswalds-3d-glasses-bug/">the 3D glasses</a> glitch in <em>Disney Dreamlight Valley</em>, which prevented you from progressing <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-unlock-oswald-in-disney-dreamlight-valley/">Oswald’s Many Dimensions</a>, then rejoice! The May 13 update has fixed this issue and, in line with player feedback since the Thrills and Frills update launched, a few more tweaks.</p> <p data-characters="354" data-current-count="354" data-injectable="false">Of course, the most important update from this <a href="https://disneydreamlightvalley.com/news/update-may-13-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">patch</a> is that buying the 3D glasses before Oswald prompts you to make the purchase longer prevents the progression of Oswald’s Many Dimensions. That’s not it for Oswald-related fixes, either, as many players were <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DreamlightValley/comments/1chvkm6/white_pants/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">having issues</a> with another request from Oswald at a previous stage of the same quest. </p> <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="680" data-injectable="true">When asked to don a pair of white pants, players realized they didn’t actually own any, and Scrooge wasn’t selling any, either. This left them unable to progress until Scrooge coughed up the goods. However, this update also changed the requirement to “light colored pants”, widening the scope of choices for players.&nbsp;</p>

  <p id="yugZzI">There’s a lot of TV to weed through in any week, and this week is no exception — something I’m sure I’ve said about plenty of packed TV weeks, but what’re you gonna do! The television giveth, and giveth, and taketh away, and giveth some more. </p>
<p id="7C2CrI">If you’d like some recommendations beyond purely new shows, we’ve got a monthly TV recommendation thread going now, with the first instance <a href="https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/2024/5/9/24150607/best-tv-watch-tonight-recommendations-streaming">having happened last week</a>. But for this week if you’re looking for something to watch, check out the bevy of options below. From the triumphant (but half-season!) return of <em>Bridgerton</em> to the wild conclusion of Apple TV Plus’ strangest show yet, there’s plenty of great shows on the docket this week. </p>
<p id="dQ6xLL">Here’s the best TV premieres and finales this week. </p>

<p id="bwwhbU">The stage is set; the stakes are high; the mutants are fighting. Magneto, at least, believes he was right. While the rest of the X-Men aren’t fully on board, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24151961/wolverine-x-men-97-adamantium-ripped-out-comics">his ending blow to Wolverine last week</a> means he might get to make a few more points. </p>

<p id="0l3i3N">Two men are trying to make 1960s South Korea a better place: Kim San (Byun Yo-han), an idealist who hopes American affluence can help the Korean people, and Uncle Samsik (<em>Parasite</em>’s Song Kang-ho), who works from the shadows as a political fixer and social chameleon. But Kim San is starting to wonder: Is Samsik the real deal, or a corrupt influence leading him down a dark path? </p>

<p id="zVTew9">Royal (Josh Brolin) is having a helluva time on his ranch, and that’s all before you get into the weird wormhole that opened up on his property and goes who knows where. At least now, in season 2, he’s starting to get a bit more of an idea — though time will tell if it helps him out with the timey-wimey mess he’s left with. </p>

<p id="jPbAJA"><strong>Genre: </strong>Surprisingly poignant family drama<br><strong>Release date: </strong>May 16<br><strong>Showrunner/creator: </strong>Chuck Lorre and Steven Molaro<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Iain Armitage, Zoe Perry, Lance Barber, and more</p>
<p id="mLceW5"><em>Young Sheldon</em>, the <em>Big Bang Theory</em> spin-off about (who else) Sheldon (but young) is coming to an end. The show has been a surprise hit, deviating away from the original’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/24137721/young-sheldon-should-watch-season-final-surprisingly-good-sitcom">more caustic sitcom style to something more heartfelt</a>. How will this show set up for <em>yet another</em> spin-off (not about Sheldon at any age)? Gotta tune in to see. </p>

<p id="SL7UF5">Black Panther founder Huey P. Newton (André Holland) is trying to escape into Cuba to avoid the FBI in a pretty elaborate plan — namely utilizing a famed Hollywood producer to make a fake movie production — that, of course, is going awry at almost every turn. </p>

The flavor text of the tweet also reads, “The abandoned and tragic who forage beneath the umbra pray for the embrace of a new master.” Considering both that the expansion may take place in a realm of Miquella’s creation, making him the domain’s master, and Messmer’s antagonistic role (as well as his posturing on a throne for the expansion’s cover art), it’s very likely the two are in conflict.</p><p>What’s currently unclear is if Messmer has already taken over as master and the “abandoned and tragic” want someone else to rule (maybe even Miquella), or if Miquella and the Land of Shadows are currently under attack from Messmer, who’s looking to become its new master.</p><p>Regardless, it wouldn’t be the first time FromSoft has been influenced by one of its own games in the development of another. <em>Shadows of the Erdtree </em>seems to be <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-erdtree-dlc-difficulty-1851293313&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-erdtree-dlc-difficulty-1851293313">borrowing a leveling feature</a></span> that is ripped straight from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sekiro-shadows-die-twice-the-kotaku-review-1833579694&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sekiro-shadows-die-twice-the-kotaku-review-1833579694"><em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em></a></span>, and many of the mechanics across the studio’s portfolio bleed into one another all the time. If it makes the game more mechanically and visually interesting, FromSoft can keep borrowing from <em>Bloodborne </em>for all I care. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/dubai-long-term-gaming-visa/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>It was recently announced that Dubai’s government is aiming to deepen its reach in the gaming industry, and to do so, it has launched the ‘Long-Term Dubai Gaming Visa’. This new initiative aims to entice industry workers – from developers to artists – to life in Dubai, with the city playing a key role in the region’s massive and ongoing investment in the gaming and esports industries.</p>



<p>It has been referenced that companies ‘specialising in digital content creation’ are being actively leant on to join this initiative.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-to-dubai">To Dubai</h2>



<p>For months, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have been pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into the esports and gaming industries. From tournaments and gaming events worth tens of millions to plans to create a thriving city focused entirely on video games and entertainment, the region is trying to establish itself as a figurehead of this lucrative, ever-growing market.</p>



<p>Recently, Dubai’s Crown Prince Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum announced the new ‘Gaming Visa’ that’s designed to help attract <strong>30,000 industry workers </strong>by 2033. It’ll be available for developers, programmers, engineers, and other industry workers and professionals who are aged at least 25 years old at the time of application. </p>



<p>It was highlighted that there isn’t a fixed tenure for the Dubai Gaming Visa, and it’ll vary depending on the individual applying. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.emirates247.com/uae/dubai-introduces-long-term-dubai-gaming-visa-2024-05-12-1.732308" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In a statement</a>, the Director General of Dubai Culture and Arts Authority, Hala Badri, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Dubai Gaming Visa embodies the vision and aspirations of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, and contributes to enhancing the emirate’s appeal as a premier destination for entrepreneurs, investors, game developers, designers, and programmers. It also attracts individuals with innovative ideas and both established and emerging companies specialising in the development and production of content, gaming applications, and artificial intelligence. This helps achieve Dubai’s cultural vision of being a global centre for culture, an incubator for creativity, and a thriving hub for talent.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Dubai’s ‘Program for Gaming 2033’ aims to turn the city and the surrounding area into a hub for developers and gaming organisations. It’s designed to boost the nation’s GDP considerably, but it’s admittedly still facing some scepticism and doubt from the wider gaming community.</p>

            <p>
Paradox Interactive has announced it's parting ways with Prison Architect 2 developer Double Eleven after nine years on the popular management series, saying it "could not find a commercial agreement that worked for both parties".
</p>
<p>
Double Eleven first became involved with Prison Architect after it was hired to port the game to consoles, and the studio took full control of the series when original developer Introversion Software <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-interactive-picks-up-the-rights-to-prison-architect">sold the rights to Paradox</a> in 2019.  Since then, it's released ten expansion packs, culminating in last year's Jungle Pack, and has led development of a fully 3D sequel, Prison Architect 2.
</p>
<p>
Prison Architect 2 was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prison-architect-gets-a-3d-sequel-in-march">unveiled in January</a> this year, promising a "greater degree of player freedom, impactful choices, and inmate simulation". It was originally due to launch in March but has since received two delays - once <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prison-architect-2-gets-two-month-delay-to-may">into May</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prison-architect-2-release-date-delayed-again-less-than-a-month-from-launch#:~:">then to September</a> - most recently to address "unexpected issues occuring too often" despite the game being "certified on all platforms".
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Prison Architect 2 has been delayed several times since its announcement in January.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiymA3jw0fQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
And Paradox has now confirmed Prison Architect 2 will mark the end of Double Eleven's time on the series. "With the sequel passing certification on all platforms," the publisher <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1257610/view/4201372129464692603?l=english">wrote in a statement</a> announcing the news, "the contract was fulfilled. However, we could not find a commercial agreement that worked for both parties moving forward and mutually agreed to part ways."
</p>
<p>
Paradox is handing the reins to <a href="https://kokku.com.br/portfolio/">Brazilian support studio Kokku</a>, which is said to have been working on Prison Architect 2 alongside Double Eleven "since the autumn of last year". A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/prisonarchitect/comments/1cr004q/a_letter_to_the_prison_architect_fans_fellow/">separate post</a> by Prison Architect game director Gaz Wright says Kokku fully took over the project in January this year, suggesting Paradox has been sitting on the news since Prison Architect 2's announcement.
</p>
<p>
Prison Architect 2's arrival follows a string of high-profile misses for Paradox - including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-chinese-room-is-developing-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">troubled development</a> of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-declares-pulp-strategy-the-lamplighters-league-a-22m-flop">commercial failure of last year's The Lamplighters' League</a>, and the disastrously premature launch of Cities: Skylines 2, which was recently forced to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-publisher-refunds-dlc-and-admits-we-let-you-down">halt all DLC plans</a> while its developer worked on addressing the "shortcomings of the game". Paradox will be wanting to avoid a similar misfire as it attempts to transition Prison Architect fans over to a sequel.
</p>
<p>
Prison Architect 2 is currently expected to launch for Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC on 3rd September this year.

<p data-characters="289" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>GeoGuessr’s</em> appeal of having you land in a random location and guessing where you are translates well into most video games, with <em>Fortnite’s</em> unofficial version testing your game knowledge while sending you down memory lane. Here’s how to find and play <em>Fortnite GeoGuessr</em>.</p> <h2 id="h-what-is-fortnite-geoguessr" data-injectable="false">What is <em>Fortnite GeoGuessr?</em></h2> <p data-characters="256" data-current-count="256" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://lostgamer.io/fortnite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Fortnite GeoGuessr</em></a> is a game much like regular <em>GeoGuessr</em> that, rather than having you guess real-world locations, has you pick where you are on the <em>Fortnite</em> map. You can choose between the game’s full history, all of a chapter, or a specific season. </p> <p data-characters="456" data-current-count="712" data-injectable="true">Once you pick your map and create a single-player or multiplayer game, your view will land in a random spot in the world. Using context clues, previous game knowledge, and map hints, you’ll look around the world before going to your <em>Fortnite GeoGuessr</em> minimap and choosing a location. Like <em>GeoGuessr</em>, you’ll score more points the closer you are to the correct location, with the maximum score being 25,000 points for a standard five-round game.</p>
 <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="353" data-injectable="false"><em>Fortnite GeoGuessr</em> also features a leaderboard for each map, allowing you to compete with other players to see who can get the most points the fastest. In other words, if you’re knowledgeable enough about your chosen <em>Fortnite</em> chapter or season to consistently get 25,000 points each time, you can compete for the top spot by improving your speed. </p> <p data-characters="228" data-current-count="581" data-injectable="false">Currently, <em>Fortnite GeoGuessr</em> only supports up to Chapter 4, Season 1, meaning you won’t find any <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/when-does-the-new-fortnite-season-come-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chapter 5 content</a> for now. While this might change in the future, you’ll have to stick to older map versions for now. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/13/24155604/square-enix-multiplatform-games-xbox-pc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Everybody’s getting bitten by the multiplatform bug; now, it’s Square Enix. In its <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/news/pdf/24q4earnings.pdf">earnings report</a> released earlier today, the publisher shared plans to increase profits, stating that it will “aggressively pursue a multiplatform strategy that includes Nintendo platforms, PlayStation, Xbox, and PCs.”</p><div><p>Right now, Square Enix’s biggest games, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23767669/final-fantasy-xvi-review-ps5"><em>Final Fantasy XVI</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24079544/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5"><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em></a>, have been restricted to the PlayStation, with PC releases for select titles including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22839361/final-fantasy-7-remake-pc-review-epic-game-store"><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em></a> following some time after console launch. However, smaller new releases, like the forthcoming <em>Visions of Mana,</em> are seeing <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/01/18/visions-of-mana-developer-direct-2024/">simultaneous release on Xbox</a>.</p></div><p>The company wrote that it hopes bringing its major franchises, including its back catalog, to more platforms will “build an environment where more customers can enjoy our titles.” It’s a policy Xbox has started to pursue, releasing its exclusives on other platforms like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/21/24078043/grounded-pentiment-nintendo-switch-release-microsoft-xbox-exclusive-games"><em>Grounded </em>and<em> Pentiment</em> on Switch</a><em> </em>and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23589879/hi-fi-rush-making-of-interview-xbox">highly praised</a> but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24152137/xbox-hi-fi-rush-tango-gameworks-matt-booty">ill-fated</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/21/24079090/hi-fi-rush-ps5-xbox-release-date"><em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> on PlayStation 5</a>.</p><p>The news that fans can expect more Square Enix titles on more platforms was coupled with additional reports that the company is undergoing a round of layoffs. According to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/square-enix-confirms-us-eu-layoffs-as-part-of-restructuring/">a report in <em>VGC</em></a>, the publisher is planning to let go of an unconfirmed number of people across its US and European businesses. <em>The Verge</em> has reached out to Square Enix for comment.</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-is-underperforming-says-industry-analyst">industry analysts have speculated</a> that Square Enix’s most recent game, <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth,</em> hasn’t been selling as well as expected. Square Enix itself has not shared sales numbers for the game, despite doing so for <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyxvi/status/1674016160306823170"><em>Final Fantasy XVI</em></a>, <a href="https://press.na.square-enix.com/FINAL-FANTASY-XV-DAY-ONE-SHIPMENT-AND-DIGITAL-SALES-EXCEED-FIVE-MILLIO"><em>Final Fantasy XV</em></a>, and <em>Rebirth</em>’s direct predecessor, <a href="https://press.na.square-enix.com/FINAL-FANTASY-VII-REMAKE-SHIPMENTS-AND-DIGITAL-SALES-SURPASS-35-MILLIO"><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em></a><em>.</em> This shift to multiplatform releases, then, might be in response to <em>Rebirth</em>’s apparently soft sales and the fact that <em>Final Fantasy XV</em>, one of the bestselling games in the franchise ever, released both on PlayStation and Xbox, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-final-fantasy-xv-has-sold-10-million-copies-worldwide">selling over 10 million copies worldwide</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s a tool that theoretically lets you turn <em>any N64 game</em> into a native PC port, the better to play and preserve N64 games — and to showcase its abilities, <a href="https://github.com/Mr-Wiseguy/Zelda64Recomp/releases">you can <em>already download Windows and Linux-native apps for The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask</em></a><em> </em>that seem to run incredibly well.</p></div><p>It almost seems too good to be true: I just double-clicked an EXE file on my Windows laptop, told the app where to find a <em>Majora’s Mask</em> ROM file, and was immediately playing a copy of the game that felt incredibly responsive to my every press on a 165Hz variable refresh rate screen, with remappable controls, adjustable resolution, and a primitive form of auto-save. </p><p>Now imagine if you could do that for any Nintendo 64 game! Wiseguy says their tool works <a href="https://github.com/Mr-Wiseguy/N64Recomp?tab=readme-ov-file#how-it-works">by statically recompiling N64 binaries into C code</a> that can then be compiled into native apps for any platform and has even gotten the dreaded <em>Superman 64</em> to work. </p><p>What’s more, Wiseguy says N64 ray tracing and texture packs are also on the way! He’s got teasers in this video:</p><p>To be clear, these recompiled N64 apps <em>do not include the game itself</em>, which is part of their charm — while <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/3/24147936/nintendo-dmca-takedown-yuzu-emulator-copies">protective Nintendo lawyers</a> might argue they encourage piracy, they do not redistribute the ROM files you’d need to actually play the copyrighted Nintendo works. </p><p>While I haven’t yet been able to recompile a random game myself with the tool (it <a href="https://github.com/Mr-Wiseguy/N64Recomp?tab=readme-ov-file#how-it-works:~:text=project%20here.-,Currently,-%2C%20the%20only%20way">currently requires</a> metadata that seemingly needs to be harvested from a game), and I can’t personally vouch for how well <em>Majora’s Mask </em>works<em> </em>after hours and hours of play, the video by YouTuber Nerrel atop this story makes it sound pretty fantastic. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Shortly after generative AI became the hottest topic in pretty much every industry, Inworld started making headlines in 2023 with its Character Engine technology that was first implemented in a series of PC games (<a href="https://wccftech.com/a-chat-with-the-modder-making-waves-with-generative-ai-in-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-mod-adds-inworld-generative-ai-for-immersive-dialogues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a>, and Grand Theft Auto V) by modder Bloc.</p>
<p>A few months later, Inworld <a href="https://wccftech.com/inworld-ai-gets-new-funding-from-lightspeed-microsoft-samsung-and-more-character-engine-to-go-open-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a new round of funding from big investors (including Microsoft, Samsung, and LG) that brought the company's total valuation to $500 million. The gaming industry's attention toward their dynamic NPCs technology was confirmed when Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-partners-with-inworld-ai-to-empower-game-creators-through-generative-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> a partnership to develop a multiplatform AI-powered toolset for game creators. Then, at the GDC 2024 event in San Francisco, California, Inworld stole the limelight with three demos created with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-presents-covert-protocol-demo-powered-by-inworld-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjoRW6yyEsA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/inworld-ai-npc-gdc-2024-hands-on-nvidia-and-ubisoft-show-a-glimpse-of-the-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubisoft</a>.</p>
<p>Following that event, I contacted Inworld to set up an interview to cover these high-profile partnerships, the future roadmap of their technology, and potential issues for studios and end users, such as costs. I talked to Nathan Yu, General Manager of Inworld's Labs, for around half an hour; you can read the whole transcript of our conversation below.</p>
<figure><p><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/inworld-xbox-narrative-graph-HD-scaled.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/inworld-xbox-narrative-graph-HD-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1440" srcset="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/inworld-xbox-narrative-graph-HD-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/inworld-xbox-narrative-graph-HD-564x317.jpg 564w, https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/inworld-xbox-narrative-graph-HD-728x410.jpg 728w, https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/inworld-xbox-narrative-graph-HD-1456x819.jpg 1456w, https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/inworld-xbox-narrative-graph-HD-1920x1080.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></a></p><figcaption>'We believe that the true transformative games are going to come from where we actually design the gameplay around the AI capabilities from the get-go.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>At GDC 2024, I <a href="https://wccftech.com/inworld-ai-blows-up-at-gdc-2024-between-ubisofts-neo-npcs-xboxs-narrative-graph-tool-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> that Inworld AI 'blew up', which was not at all an exaggeration from my point of view. You pretty much stole the show by presenting three demos made with big partners like Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Ubisoft. What was it like?</strong></p>
<p>Overall, it was incredible. Under the hood, we've been working on all three fronts with Ubisoft, NVIDIA, and Microsoft for a while now. It was great to see them all land solidly at GDC. They all push the boundaries of our technology in different areas, with Ubisoft specifically going beyond dialogue as a key theme that we've been focusing on at Inworld. How does AI play a more integral impact on core gameplay mechanics and player progression? We really started to see a lot of those nuances come out with NEO NPCs. Microsoft is obviously a huge partner working on the Narrative Graph and design tools with our Mists of Aurora demo. So that was great to see a different type of angle, not all focused on just the runtime generation, but also the design time and narrative branching tools we can have.</p>
<p>And then finally, with NVIDIA and Covert Protocol, experimenting with how modular Inworld technology can be with NVIDIA Microservices such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-omniverse-creating-life-like-ai-based-animations-stalker-2-fort-solis-aaa-games-with-raytracing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Audio2Face</a>, the Riva ASR, etc. It's all been really fantastic to see from a high level.</p>
<p><strong>How many employees do you currently have at Inworld AI? I'm guessing most of them are engineers.</strong></p>
<p>At Inworld, we've grown not just from a product perspective exponentially in the past year but in the team size as well. We're almost at 100 staff members now, most of which are engineers.</p>
<p>I lead our Labs organization, where we actually have dedicated resources both on the PM (partner management) and engineering side to support these efforts. This is early technology, right? It's not robust standard off-the-shelf technology that you can buy and run with it on your own.</p>
<p>There's a lot of co-development that Inworld actively engages in with these partners, so we're still hiring even today for these roles. But yeah, we've been preparing for it for a long time, and we'll continue to grow to meet those needs.</p>
<p><strong>What are your roadmap's key goals for 2024 and beyond?</strong></p>
<p>There's so much to unpack there. We actually did a product webinar in the town hall just a few weeks before GDC, where we touched on some of the upcoming themes that we'll be working on in 2024 and beyond. You'll see maybe three core buckets on how our product will evolve. First and foremost, and this actually aligns nicely with the three pillars at Inworld, which we call the Inworld engine, the Inworld studio, and then Inworld core. The Inworld engine is what people think of when they think of Inworld today: what powers runtime character dialogue, their cognition. We'll see a lot of evolution beyond just the dialogue itself, so taking into consideration the perception of the environment, the context of what the actual game actions are, giving Inworld characters the proactivity to take actions on their own based off of what a developer specifies and to push player progression forward. That's a key major theme we're pushing on there. Within the dialogue, you'll see a lot of continued improvements just with improved realism, naturalism, expression, dialogue controls of nuance, length, and whatnot.</p>
<p>On the studio side, we're gonna see an official launch of all of our narrative graph tools, with developers able to iterate quickly on different character and plot designs to see how stories or gameplay loops might unfold and use that either as a part of the design process or even as a part of the actual gameplay flow.</p>
<p>Finally, when it comes to the core of the technology, there's a lot of deep investments we're making in lowering costs, optimizing latency, enabling fine-tuning for all partners, not just our closed enterprise customers. That's it from a high level,</p>
<p>Internationalization is a big one that's touched on a lot, too. We have early support already for Mandarin and Korean and we will be rolling out Japanese just in the next month or two here for early access as well. By the end of the year, we're aiming to support most of the top languages.</p>
<p><strong>One of the main drawbacks of some of the implementations we've seen so far of generative AI for NPCs is that they are just surface-level. What would be really interesting and potentially game-changing is to integrate the feature at a game design level to ensure dynamic interaction with NPCs actually changes the world and plot.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, absolutely. We're just scratching the surface here today, right? But that's absolutely the vision. The analogy I like to give is - earlier, you mentioned you've been following Inworld by way of the Bannerlord mod, Skyrim mod, and GTA V mod. The latter was a bit different because we did actually structure gameplay around it.</p>
<p>But the first two, you can look at it and think, yeah, this is cool. You can chat with the characters in Skyrim and ask the guard about what happened when he took an arrow to the knee, but that's fun for maybe five minutes. It doesn't really make it a better game at the end of the day.</p>
<p>Right now, we're at this position where we realized this, and it's also kind of like a chicken and egg problem. We believe that the true transformative games are gonna come from where we actually design the gameplay around the AI capabilities from the get-go. You can't just add a mod to a game because the game design is already baked in. You're not necessarily introducing entirely new ways to engage with the player just by adding the NPC AI capabilities.</p>
<p>It's gonna be a much longer time before we see these AAA titles launch out. But there's smaller efforts where we'll start to see, such as with Ubisoft's NEO NPCs, where it goes beyond the dialogue. They have an awareness of what you're doing, and they can take action on their own.</p>
<p>Another analogy I like to give is that it's so unnatural when a character is there just almost waiting for you. Like, they stand there, but they don't do anything. They just t-pose and then when you go to talk to them and only when you talk to them, they respond to you. That's not how it should work.</p>
<p>You'll see where we're giving more lifelike behavior to the characters where they are absolutely doing things on their own. If you're not talking to them, they're gonna be like, okay, man, I gotta go, this is awkward. We're just standing here while you're thinking of what to say. There's&nbsp;a lot of teachers we're building out to support that better.</p>
<p><strong>Is your goal with Inworld AI to be a product that developers can leverage on their own without your direct help?</strong></p>
<p>That's a good question. Long term, for sure, it's gonna be an off-the-shelf tool that developers can take and customize on their own. Even today, you can.</p>
<p>I'd say there's maybe two different aspects of it. One is just a knowledge gap concern. If you were an Inworld expert and knew how to leverage all of the beta features that we unlocked, you could get very, very, very far.</p>
<p>But this technology is still early, and not many people understand the nuances around it or how to set it up the best way. That's where partner engineering solutions come in. But I do believe it's gonna be democratized a lot more where people will be able to get 90% of the way by themselves. Also, for large AAA companies with bespoke needs, we'll continue to work closely with them in a co-development fashion.</p>

It's a little bit different from the Web 3 crypto craze, where there's tangible value today, and everyone gets it.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Usually, triple-A companies wait a bit before diving into new technologies. However, it seems like they are experimenting with generative AI NPCs even at this early stage. Why do you think that is?</strong></p>
<p>Everyone sees the potential of generative AI. It's a little bit different from the Web 3 crypto craze, where there's tangible value today, and everyone gets it. Even at the large Triple A's, there's executive mandates and <a href="https://wccftech.com/generative-ai-will-allow-bigger-more-immersive-worlds-says-ea-and-developers-were-hungry-for-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general excitement</a> about how to lean into this technology and explore opportunities for collaboration and innovation there.</p>
<p>I'd say, of course, we don't see any great ship use cases today. Maybe there are a few small ones I could point to. But yeah, it's gonna be a bit of a chicken and egg. I don't think there's gonna be a ton of R&amp;D that's allocated from these studios as well. Maybe it depends on the innovation capacity and appetite. But we all know it takes such a long time to make these big games. It also differs from studio to studio.</p>
<p>But I would say there are some that are still waiting for those reference use cases to be built up by either another AAA or indie developer. But there are also others that are ready to engage today just given the confidence from what they've seen already.</p>
<p><strong>The partnership with Microsoft is peculiar because they are crafting a whole copilot-like tool based on Inworld AI for game designers, which suggests they're looking to use it themselves first and foremost.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>That would be the intention. I can't share too much there, but stay tuned to see which studios we'll be working with. The word copilot is so broad, and I don't like to use it. But of course, there are a lot of benefits we see from helping designers iterate. One key learning that we've had actually and was mentioned by the narrative writers that we work with is that it's a different type of work that's needed now. It's not AI replacing writing at all. We know it's not capable of creating good gameplay and the act of even generating a character is more of like a director type of job as opposed to a writer.</p>
<p>You're not just responsible for writing the four lines of dialogue that get integrated into the game, but you have to create a brain that's then capable of generating those four or 400 lines of dialogue in the best way. So it's very interesting. But it's both, right? We've seen a lot of productivity ideas sparked by those tools in a meaningful way already.</p>
<p><strong>Can you talk a bit about your work with partners and developers?</strong></p>
<p>Sure. Absolutely. I'd say the true magic comes again with a lot of customization and client-side logic built out on top of Inworld. Even within our tech, it's not just generative AI. We have a combination of orchestration of models, like large language models and small models, and the way you configure and optimize them is where the magic happens.</p>
<p>Covert Protocol is a great example. It's a very vertical slice technical demo. I wouldn't say we spent a whole too much time on it. It was actually a very short project that came together, but we're gonna be open-sourcing it in the next month and a half, so developers can take a look out there, and they'll see a skeleton for what they could drop on top of more compelling gameplay loops.</p>
<p><strong>To be fair, the Covert Protocol demo wasn't very impressive, as the player still needed to pick up a disguise to progress, just like you would in a HITMAN game...</strong></p>
<p>There's two things here. Again, it was a vertical slice, a tech demo. We know it's not a compelling experience end to end there. But really, we were demonstrating two things. One is how conversation can be used to evolve gameplay first and foremost. The other one is how we can allow the combination of characters, environmental awareness, and information about a player to change their interactions.</p>
<p>Diego is meant to be the stuck-up in his head, 'I'm only gonna talk to VIPs' type of person. The one mechanic unfortunately we didn't build in time for GDC was that if you tried to talk to Diego without the badge, he was actually going to cut you off after a very short period of time and no longer talk to you because you're not important and he has to work on his keynote speech.</p>
<p>But because we didn't implement that, he'll continue to entertain you and engage in some small talk, but you'll notice they're very short answers. They're not really engaging, and that is by design. But when you come back and say you're also a speaker, Diego all of a sudden goes, 'OK, this person may be important, maybe I should open up and have a conversation, learn a bit more'. That's the intent there.</p>
<p>But of course, under the hood is the fact that in order to get the room number, you've got to agitate Martin to some extent, and there's a few ways that we've hooked that up through the branches. You could either make him angry, you could get him worried about the keynote, you could get him concerned about the room delays, and those would kind of lead into the actual script sequence of him walking up to the front desk and revealing information through that.</p>
<p>But yeah, I will admit that there's definitely better flows that can be done bridging the gap between how smooth those feel. Like how nuanced interaction feels and actually pushes the player and rewards the right behaviors so that it's clearer what the player should do.</p>
<p><strong>Something else that I've been wondering is about having to use voice interactions with Inworld. Not only does this drive up costs, but often, it actually decreases immersion because the NPCs do not understand what you've said, and their own voiced responses and facial animations aren't really good enough. Would it be possible to use Inworld just text-to-text?</strong></p>
<p>At the end of the day, Inworld services are fully modular. We do provide just pure text-to-text. That's what you get out of the box with Inworld Studio, but we understand voices obviously bring life to it. ASR does bring more immersion.</p>
<p>There's a lot of ways to get around this. In NEO NPCs, Ubisoft implemented kind of like ASR confirmation which is really unique. You say your phrase, ASR captures it, and then you commit it by pressing the trigger button on the controller to the character. Obviously, that's not realistic. It breaks real time immersion, but it actually felt very natural to me as a player. Beyond that, we're exploring tools where we could think of the player as a character.</p>
<p>So the concept of the player as a character is you do not say everything yourself, but maybe you have an AI that represents you, that you control. Let's say your AI version can generate four options of responses, and then you can commit one of those to the actual chat. That can evolve over time, and if you don't like them, you can maybe customize them too. But I'm thinking more about console-based experiences where people don't really want to speak into a controller.</p>
<p>There's a lot of opportunities there. It's really up to the game designer at the end of the day to craft the experience that they're looking for. But I agree it's not just 100% real time immersion all the time. That's not necessary.</p>

It's gonna run locally, offline, on devices like consoles. It's just a matter of time.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>One of the big caveats of NPCs based on generative AI tech is monetization. As I understand it, your Character Engine currently runs on Inworld cloud servers, and there are costs attached to using your dynamic NPCs. It seems unlikely users would be willing to shoulder these costs, especially now that game prices are on the rise. How do you plan to solve this key problem?</strong></p>
<p>This monetization question is such a deep topic we can get into. For everyone, this is top of mind, along with latency guard rails and hallucinations. But from a high level, my perspective is it just needs to make sense for everyone. At the end of the day, there needs to be enough value generated for a player, a game studio, and Inworld for all of this to be viable.</p>
<p>There are pockets of use cases where this is already demonstrated to be profitable, small indie games where the entire game is based off of this AI reasoning and has driven more purchases of the game where it clearly justifies the cost as of today.</p>
<p>Moving forward, the costs are going to go down significantly; we all understand that. But even then, it's the design, right? Do you really need all secondary NPCs to be hyper-intelligent? Maybe not; maybe we use smaller models there, but for the core companion character, there is a value added.</p>
<p>So, there's a balance of how much AI is used in a game. What is a game design? How does that add value? Then, we can start to talk about different monetization structures, whether that's per usage or not. The subscription and premium feature idea is not bad, but I think it's not appropriate to just use this in broad strokes. It needs to be taken from case to case for a specific game.</p>
<p>If you look at Roblox, you've got players paying all the time for accessories and retries and whatnot. These mechanics are baked in and understood in certain pockets already. We just have to work together as a whole to determine where it makes the most sense for this AI to be used. Ads is also a whole other topic we could dive into for short term options that are very compelling as well.</p>
<p>But I'm not too concerned. I think if we give it another couple of months, the conversation will be different as soon as we see viable, profitable use cases being deployed.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think, at the end of the day, that game developers will have to bear the costs of running Inworld tech?</strong></p>
<p>I see it both ways. I do see experiences where players will be contributing to the cost directly because there's like a premium upsell there that makes sense for them. I do see other examples where it doesn't make sense. Players are purchasing a flat game cost for $59.99 or other and it'll be fully maintained just through other monetization structures, or it's already amortized over time.</p>
<p>As we get to scale for AAA titles, costs will go down so that it's no longer variable. If we've got millions of users, there's lots of techniques that can be leveraged to drive down costs there. But yeah, overall, it depends on the publisher and the developer.</p>
<p>There's this reluctance, of course, for revenue share models when your game is so large, and so there is a flat rate licensing that Inworld looks at as well to help manage compute either on a triple-A studio's cloud services or if they have the infrastructure themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think that it will be possible to run Inworld technology on local devices in the near future? Some devices, like PCs equipped with GeForce RTX hardware, already have dedicated ML hardware, and even next-generation consoles might include something of that sort.</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely. Yes. we'll definitely get there. We saw a lot of exciting announcements even at GTC for dedicated hardware in the future for AI versus rendering today.</p>
<p>There's a lot of questions, like, if we do move to on devices, will that impact graphics rendering? That becomes a nonstarter conversation for a lot of studios. But at Inworld we do support hybrid as well. Some services could run locally, some services run on cloud invention, and that can short-term optimize costs and latency. But in the future, I think we can all agree that it's going to get there. It's gonna run locally, offline, on devices like consoles. It's just a matter of time. I'm excited to see that as well.</p>
<p>On the whole cost issue, just look at the trends. Even from a pure inferencing perspective, the models today versus the models six months ago are way smaller and have way better quality. Hardware, we all know that if you compare the graphics cards of today versus two years ago, it's night and day. So, the baseline will see those driven to a fraction in the future. Even then, I think we'll be able to think a lot more about the actual monetization structures of where value is generated and how to optimize capturing that across all stakeholders involved. That's gonna be exciting.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/13/atlus-is-delisting-the-original-shin-megami-tensei-v-and-its-dlc-ahead-of-vengeances<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Atlus has announced that the original version of Shin Megami Tensei V will be delisted from the Nintendo eShop on June 13. That’s one day before the launch of its expanded definitive edition, Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance.</p>

<p>On June 13, Shin Megami Tensei V’s Digital Standard and Digital Deluxe editions and all of its DLC will be removed from the eShop. However, owners of the physical and digital versions will still be able to play and redownload this content after it’s been delisted. SMT V first launched in November 2021, and Atlus declared it the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/01/03/shin-megami-tensei-v-becomes-best-selling-entry-in-franchise-atlus-teases-new-project">best-selling game in the series</a> in January 2022.</p>

<div>
<blockquote>
<div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>The original Shin Megami Tensei V Digital Standard, Digital Deluxe, and all associated DLC will be delisted from the Nintendo eShop on June 13.</p><p>

Previously purchased physical and digital versions will remain playable and re-downloadable after this date.</p></div>
— Official ATLUS West (@Atlus_West) <a href="https://twitter.com/Atlus_West/status/1790079785214914724?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 13, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div>

<p>Atlus has not provided a reason for this move, but given the timing, it’s likely to avoid confusion with the upcoming SMTV: Vengeance, which is the same game but with quality-of-life improvements and an additional storyline that introduces new locations and demons (think of it as the Persona 5 Royal of SMT V). Vengeance will also be multi-platform, whereas the original game was a Switch exclusive, and it will run for the same price as the original Standard version, $59.99.</p>

<p>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance launches on June 14. You can read our extended preview of the game <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2024/04/30/back-with-a-vengeance">here</a>, and you can also check out our review of the original SMT V <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/shin-megami-tensei-v/shin-megami-tensei-v-review-beauty-in-an-unforgiving-world">here</a>.</p>

<p data-characters="191" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">ImperialHal reached the mountaintop with TSM in 2023, securing an Apex Legends Global Series Championship title. However, a historic five-year run with the organization is officially ending. </p> <p data-characters="322" data-current-count="322" data-injectable="false">In the Year 4 ALGS regular season split 1, TSM finished 13th place, arguably lower than most fans expected. Then, at the Year 4 Split 1Playoffs LAN event that ended on May 5, TSM finished in 17th, marking another disappointing performance. Those results played a significant role in ImperialHal deciding to make a change. </p> <p data-characters="225" data-current-count="547" data-injectable="true">“To put it as bluntly as possible, it had nothing to do with money, it had nothing to do with contracts, it had nothing to do with TSM management, ImperialHal <a href="https://twitter.com/TSM/status/1790064611577794699" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>. “It felt like there was a change needed.” </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ImperialHal-suggests-Fortnite-Feature-to-improve-Apex-Legends-viewership.jpg?resize=640%2C360" alt="" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ImperialHal-suggests-Fortnite-Feature-to-improve-Apex-Legends-viewership.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ImperialHal-suggests-Fortnite-Feature-to-improve-Apex-Legends-viewership.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ImperialHal-suggests-Fortnite-Feature-to-improve-Apex-Legends-viewership.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ImperialHal-suggests-Fortnite-Feature-to-improve-Apex-Legends-viewership.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure> <p data-characters="429" data-current-count="729" data-injectable="true">As for what’s next, ImperialHal <a href="https://x.com/ImperialHal/status/1790065961141227920" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that he will be teaming up with Zer0 and Genburten on Dark Zero in place of eSikezz, who will now be a free agent. It was also <a href="https://x.com/ImperialHal/status/1790066519432441962" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that Zer0 will be the in-game leader for the new squad. After a first-place finish in the regular season and placing second at the Year 4 Split 1Playoffs, Dark Zero will be one of the favorites in Split 2, which is scheduled to start on June 1. </p>
 <p data-characters="359" data-current-count="359" data-injectable="false">“I understand that people will be like it’s one bad LAN there’s no reason to be so sporadic and make a huge move,” ImperialHal added. “But I feel like a majority of my decisions when it came to my career like who to pick up and who to join has been pretty spot on ever since the beginning because all I want to do is win.” </p> <p data-characters="343" data-current-count="702" data-injectable="false">Imperial leaves behind a legacy that will be hard to top at TSM. With the organization, the decorated pro built up an impressive trophy cabinet, including wins at the 2019 X Games and 2019 Preseason Invitational and multiple playoff triumphs. TSM has yet to confirm who will be stepping in for ImperialHal to flank alongside Reps and Verhulst.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-mods-discussion-banned-on-official-discord<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you want to discuss&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>mods on the game's official Discord, you might have to wait a while, as mod discussion has been banned until the city-builder receives official support for the feature.</p>
<p>Per a message posted by moderator JKM in the Discord server, discussing and "encouraging the use of" mods has been banned in order to "maintain the integrity" of the gameplay experience.</p>
<p>The message goes on to say that the decision to ban mod discussion was made "to ensure that players engage with the game's core mechanics as intended", and that it includes "discussions about how to acquire, install, or use mods".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/manor-lords-mods-discussion-village-rooftops.jpg?itok=jPuQp-J_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/manor-lords-mods-discussion-village-rooftops.jpg?itok=d_di9wYz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="ac9f791a-a585-48a8-84bc-676b8b784317" loading="lazy" src="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/manor-lords-mods-discussion-village-rooftops.jpg?itok=d_di9wYz" alt="An aerial view of a village in Manor Lords" typeof="foaf:Image"></picture><figcaption>This village had better be unmodded, or so help me...</figcaption></figure><p>According to the moderator, the rule against discussing mods will remain in place until mod support is added to&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords</em>, but there's "no estimated time for mod support implementation" at the moment, so that rule could last a while.</p>
<p>JKM also says that bug reports relating to&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>mods "will not be addressed" since installing mods can lead to issues that you can only resolve with a fresh reinstall.</p>
<p>That stance is backed up by&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>dev Slavic Magic, who <a href="https://twitter.com/LordsManor/status/1789984971471372338" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said on X</a> (formerly Twitter) earlier today that players should feel free to experiment with mods, but that they shouldn't report bugs if mods are used.</p>
<p>It's likely that this is why the rule has been put into place, but it does seem like an odd rule given that Slavic Magic has also commented positively on at least two&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>mods: one <a href="https://twitter.com/LordsManor/status/1787140155863605267" rel="noopener" target="_blank">adding none other than Shrek</a> to the game, and the other <a href="https://twitter.com/LordsManor/status/1785056454375874608" rel="noopener" target="_blank">incorporating VR</a>.</p>

<p>Within just a day on release, the game attracted <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-price-player-count">over 100,000 Steam players</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-sales-player-count">soared past the million-sale mark</a>, a particularly impressive feat given that it's also available via PC Game Pass.</p>

            <p>Almost 14 years to the day after Rockstar’s cowboy epic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption">Red Dead Redemption</a> released on consoles, and coming up on five years after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/red-dead-redemption-2-pc-review">its sequel beat it to PC</a>, it looks like the original Red Dead might finally get a PC release.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>That’s going by a recent datamine from Dead-Eyed TwiXXer user and prolific Rockstar tracker TezFunz2, who spotted a new update to the backend of Rockstar’s launcher site released earlier today, May 13th. The updated file introduced new text strings that explicitly announce the availability of Red Dead Redemption 1 on PC - along with the game’s excellent zombie-filled expansion, Undead Nightmare.</p>
<p>“Journey across the sprawling expenses of the American West and Mexico in Red Dead Redemption, and its zombie-horror companion, Undead Nightmare, now playable on PC,” the string labelled “RDR_ProductPromotion_Intro_Body” reads.</p>
 <p>TezFunz2 pointed out that the marketing strings are the same as those used for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto 5</a>’s PC release, which took a comparatively lighting-fast year to arrive on PC after its console launch in 2013. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> similarly only waited around a year before coming to PC, making the adventures of John Marston a notable absence - as if you needed me to tell you that.</p>
<p>While hopes of a Red Dead Redemption PC port have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-red-dead-redemption-pc-port-could-still-be-on-the-cards">floated around</a> for over a decade now, fresh hope has been reignited by the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 game’s re-release on modern consoles, including the Nintendo Switch. What’s more, this weekend - May 18th - marks the 14-year anniversary of RDR1’s original release date back in 2010. Could we finally see the first Red Dead on PC that soon, after all this time?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-leaks-fiction/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Earlier today, several new Call of Duty “leaks” on upcoming installments went viral across social media, which Insider Gaming can report is complete fiction.</p>



<p>The rumors were somewhat believable in part because they originated from two Call of Duty data miners (<a href="https://twitter.com/zvis_ceral" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Visceral</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Vondyispog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VondyisPog</a>), who have previously reported <em>some</em> accurate information pertaining to the Call of Duty franchise. However, this time around, things were a little bit different with both accounts reporting on two apparent Call of Duty projects named “Anvil” and “Devilwood”—details that couldn’t have been obtained from datamining. Partly because the titles are so far out that they wouldn’t be within the files, but mostly because they are not real.</p>



<p>According to the “leaks,” Anvil was an Infinity Ward title based on Ghosts, and Devilwood was a Sledgehammer title based on Advanced Warfare. While I wouldn’t be surprised to see Infinity Ward tackle CoD 2026 and Sledgehammer 2027 (which is the current plan and, to be honest, pretty predictable), it’s understood that the details of the games are not accurate. While things can certainly change, getting codenames wrong in the first place makes me question how the information was obtained and to the extent to which it was verified.</p>



<p>After the news went viral and was published across multiple outlets, both accounts have now <a href="https://twitter.com/zvis_ceral/status/1790056232184688762" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">admitted to the information being inaccurate</a>.</p>



<p>As for what Call of Duty 2026 and 2027 hold remains unclear due to Call of Duty’s never-ending constant changes in development, but for now, let’s at least see what <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-pre-order-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this year’s Call of Duty title holds</a>.</p>

                <p>Between Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy, and the trilogy that Jackson made out of The Hobbit, J.R.R. Tolkien's best-known works have already been adapted as films. But as revealed earlier this month, there are more LOTR movies on the way. The first new live-action film, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-everything-we-know-about-the-upcoming-movies/1100-6511987/" data-ref-id="1100-6511987">The Hunt For Gollum</a>, will be directed by Andy Serkis, who will also reprise his role as Gollum. With the resurgence of the franchise on the big screen, the LOTR video games are also going to play larger role in the future.</p><p>Embracer Freemode CEO Lee Guinchard recently spoke with <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/a-new-generation-of-j-r-r-tolkien-games-is-coming-lee-guinchard-exclusive-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VentureBeat</a> about the company's plans for LOTR video games, games, and the site reported, "games are going to be made to fully explore the new universe being created, and games will be considered as hugely important in the Middle-earth entertainment of the future."</p><p>"I think Tolkien has already set the stage for Middle-earth, and all the tales and all the beginnings, the tribulations, the drama," said Guinchard. "They're all set up in a fully fleshed-out world. Marvel came from comic books, so there was a lot of work to do to make the lore for the movies. You start to visualize Middle-earth in your own way. When you see the animated films, and some of the Peter Jackson, which wasn't actually what I imagined, I was still quite happy to. It's already preset, down on paper in the written word. The interesting thing is how we go and tell the story in the future for these new media like video games and all of this new technology for how people immerse themselves in worlds. That's where I'm super interested."</p><p>Some of the developers under Guinchard's purview include Crystal Dynamics, Eidos Montreal, and Warhorse, the developer behind Kingdom Come: Deliverance. Guinchard didn't say whether any of those teams would tackle LOTR, but he indicated that the company is going to focus on its creators first.</p><p>"For this property and how we set it up for the future, we've got to acknowledge and support creators first," said Guinchard. "All I can say through all of this is you have to respect the works. We believe that gaming can be the future, of course. And I think we want to do something amazing and big over time. And really, it's important to build those relationships in order to really take this thing into the next chapter. Historically, it's just been so fragmented."</p><p>One of the most recent games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/review-roundup-for-the-lord-of-the-rings-gollum/1100-6514556/" data-ref-id="1100-6514556">Lord of the Rings: Gollum</a>, fell well-short of expectations in 2023, and also far from the AAA games of the past like Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and its sequel, Shadow of War. But Guinchard believes that the new focus on creators will keep the video game franchise healthier in the long run.</p><p>"Not everything is going to hit it out of the park," acknowledged Guinchard. "We know that. But we're really creating an ecosystem and an agile company that invites creators to create things in this world. That's the plan."</p><p>As part of a reorganization at Embracer, Guinchard will be moving over to a newly spun-off company, Middle-earth Enterprises &amp; Friends, which is just a working title and will likely be changed. Guinchard will remain in charge of the Tolkien video game franchise, which includes upcoming titles <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cozy-hobbit-game-tales-of-the-shire-releases-new-teaser/1100-6522068/" data-ref-id="1100-6522068">Tales of the Shire</a> and Amazon's new Lord of the Rings MMO. The new company will also have the gaming rights for Tomb Raider, Kingdom Come: Deliverance, Dead Island, Saints Row, and more.</p>

                <p>Like last season did, Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 2 is about to wrap up with a big ambient event in battle royale--where some big changes will happen to the map while people are playing regular matches. This event should ramp up dramatically over the course of the final 10 days of the season, which concludes early morning on May 24, before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-chapter-5-season-3-start-date/2900-5356/" data-ref-id="2900-5356">the Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 3 start date</a>.</p><p>The first stage of these changes is live now: The clouds above Mt. Olympus have turned dark, and are now constantly firing off bolts of lightning. It's not much just yet, though it's certainly ominous, but you can expect the situation to change regularly. For example: a few hours after the storm clouds appeared, <a href="https://twitter.com/FN_Assist/status/1790080003155112348" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the lightning charged up the statue enough that its eyes started glowing</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4302335-fortniteolympusisfalling.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4302335" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4302335-fortniteolympusisfalling.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4302335"><img alt="Robocop isn't intimidated by the new storm clouds around Mt.

Olympus.</figcaption></figure><p>Story-wise, this event is the result of Medusa's questline that was added to the game in the last patch. In that quest, players had to render Zeus mortal and then kill him once and for all. But, of course, you can't just expect things to be normal after you do something like that. As the event ramps up, we'll get the real conclusion to this incursion by the Greek gods, as Fortnite shows them the door and ushers in Season 3.</p><p>Speaking of which, the biggest apparent Fortnite leak of the year has been <a href="https://twitter.com/iFireMonkey/status/1781176957683573176" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the game's alleged 2024 roadmap</a>, which shows key art for Season 3 that looks very post-apocalyptic and brown, with a focus on vehicular combat--does that sound like Furiosa Season to anybody else? <a href="https://twitter.com/ImPeQu/status/1790033649582084280?t=MhSa2RzT7ELVv8pLUKuWKw&amp;s=19" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dataminers</a> have apparently been able to access the full plan for this season finale event in the game files, and it looks like <a href="https://twitter.com/ImPeQu/status/1790019998653542416" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a big sandstorm</a> is going to eventually roll through, so that points to the roadmap being accurate about Season 3.</p><p>Last season, this finale event took the form of that giant hand sticking out of the ground holding Pandora's Box, which the community had to work together to open over the course of several days--that weekend, it was common to see groups of players sitting on the box pickaxing the chains until the storm forced them to move or killed them. There's no indication thus far that there will be any sort of similar community effort involved with this season's capper.</p>

                <p>After becoming the first human to receive Neuralink's N1 implant back in January, 29-year-old quadriplegic Noland Arbaugh is reportedly playing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/old-school-runescape/">Old School Runescape</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/slay-the-spire/">Slay The Spire</a>, and a number of other popular games using the implant and signals from his brain.</p><p>"I'm beating my friends in games that, as a quadriplegic, I should not be beating them in," Arbaugh said in <a href="https://neuralink.com/blog/prime-study-progress-update-user-experience/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a recent Neuralink blog post</a>, adding, "Y'all are giving me too much, it's like a luxury overload. I haven't been able to do these things in 8 years, and now I don't know where to even start allocating my attention."</p><p>Arbaugh, who was left paralyzed from the shoulders down after a 2016 car accident, previously depended on an assistive device known as a mouth stick--a tool that allows users to operate a touchscreen when placed in the mouth, but wasn't satisfied with the device, as he needed a caregiver nearby if he wanted to use it, and using the mouth stick also carried the risk of developing side-effects like pressure sores and muscle spasms. Additionally, he couldn't speak while using the device.</p><p>"The biggest thing with comfort is that I can lie in my bed and use [the N1]," Arbaugh explained. "Any other assistive technology had to have someone else help or have me sit up. Sitting causes stress mentally and on my body which would give me pressure sores or spasms. [The implant] lets me live on my own time, not needing to have someone adjust me throughout the day."</p><p>But not everything has gone according to plan. Per Neuralink's blog post, a number of the implant's threads retracted from Arbaugh's brain in the weeks following surgery, leading to a net decrease in the number of effective electrodes. This ultimately resulted in a reduction in bits-per-second (BPS) processed by the implant, but Neuralink says the issue has been resolved.</p><p>"In response to this change, we modified the recording algorithm to be more sensitive to neural population signals, improved the techniques to translate these signals into cursor movements, and enhanced the user interface," reads the blog post, which was written by the scientists involved in Neuralink's Precise Robotically Implanted Brain-Computer Interface (PRIME) study. "These refinements produced a rapid and sustained improvement in BPS, that has now superseded Noland's initial performance."</p><p>According to Arbaugh, Neuralink's N1 brain-computer interface (BCI) has drastically improved his quality of life, without the drawbacks he experienced when using the mouth stick. According to the Neuralink blog post, he recently clocked in 69 hours of BCI use in a single week, with 34 of those hours spent on recreational activities like gaming. In addition to Runescape and Slay The Spire, Arbaugh has also been playing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-8/">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vi/">Sid Meier's Civilization 6</a>.</p><p>"I think [the implant] should give a lot of people a lot of hope for what this thing can do for them, first and foremost their gaming experience, but then that'll translate into so much more and I think that's awesome," Arbaugh said of the N1's potential for quality-of-life improvement in patients suffering paralysis.</p><p>Arbaugh recently uploaded <a href="https://twitter.com/i/broadcasts/1dRKZEmkonzxB" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">footage of himself using the N1 implant</a> on Twitter, showing followers how he uses his mind to move the cursor.

According to those in attendance, Square Enix president Takashi Kiryu delivered this news in a company-wide meeting, as first reported by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/square-enix-confirms-us-eu-layoffs-as-part-of-restructuring/"><em>VideoGamesChronicle</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Layoffs such as these were suspected following Square Enix's latest financial earnings report, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/13/square-enix-will-aggressively-pursue-multiplatform-strategy-in-company-reboot">which includes a three-year company reboot plan with an "aggressive" multiplatform release strategy</a>&nbsp;after a slide mentioned "structural reforms." You can see the slide below:&nbsp;</p>

</article><p>As you can see above, as part of Square Enix's plan to rebuild its overseas business divisions from the ground up, the company "began optimizing costs at its European and American offices via structural reforms." After more than 10,000 layoffs across game studios and publishers this year, it's easy to read between the lines – structural reforms sound a lot like "layoffs," and now&nbsp;<em>VGC&nbsp;</em>has confirmed as much.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The publication reports these layoffs will happen over the course of the next month, with those affected set to find out this week. The total number of expected layoffs is not known, but <i>VGC</i>'s sources say staff was told it will mostly affect those working in publishing, IT, and Square Enix's Collective indie games division.&nbsp;</p>

<p>U.K. employees laid off will enter into a "one-month consultancy period" in accordinace with local U.K. law, while affected U.S. staff could be out of their jobs potentially before the end of the month.&nbsp;</p>

<hr><p>These layoffs join a string of other disheartening 2024 layoffs and closures, which now total more than 10,000 in just the first five months of the year.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="272" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Crow Country’s various wings (heh) and storerooms are often locked behind keyholes of varying value: bronze, silver, and gold. The mid-game silver key has a few requirements that are sure to spoil things if you aren’t far enough along, so read on with caution.</p> <p data-characters="131" data-current-count="131" data-injectable="false">To get the silver key in <em>Crow Country</em>, you’re going to need three core items that can be found in the midsection of the game:</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="251" data-injectable="false"> <li>The <strong>Crank</strong>, accessed from the vault beyond the Crypt (code 1872)</li> <li>The <strong>Ruby</strong>, found in Haunted Manor demon painting (this requires the crank to access via the clocks)</li> <li>The <strong>Chain</strong>, accessed from the Swan Boats puzzle, which requires the ruby to be inserted into the swan head to gain control of the ride controls</li> </ul> <p data-characters="430" data-current-count="681" data-injectable="true">With these components in hand, head to the Dig Site, which can be accessed by using the bronze key on the mailbox outside the entrance. Inside, grab the gasoline tank from the corner of the room and use it to fill the tank behind the torch. Use the crank to fill the hole with water, then use the crane by attaching the chain to its gears. This will lift a resin-coated mask to the surface, which can be freed by using the torch. </p>
 <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="350" data-injectable="false">Mask in hand, head to the Witch Wood and open the entrance by slotting it into the right indentation. Inside, you’ll find a labyrinth which can be completed by whacking totems to lower barriers. This isn’t too difficult, and there’s no limit on how many times you can hit each. Be sure to watch your head for falling traps, though. </p> <figure data-current-count="650" data-injectable="true"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/crow-country-witchwood-map.jpg?resize=640%2C360" alt="" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/crow-country-witchwood-map.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/crow-country-witchwood-map.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/crow-country-witchwood-map.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/crow-country-witchwood-map.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid.</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="285" data-injectable="false">Once you’re in the middle, grab the key from the pond and get ready for a fight. The barriers will all lower, but enemies will begin to enter the maze. Exit the labyrinth by slaying foes and enjoy trying to remember where it was you needed to use this silver key in <em>Crow Country</em>.</p>

If you’re wondering what it is or how to get your hands on one, look below.</p> <h2 id="h-what-is-a-legendary-core-in-warframe" data-injectable="false">What is a Legendary Core in <em>Warframe</em>?</h2> <p data-characters="145" data-current-count="145" data-injectable="false">A Legendary Core is technically a mod in <em>Warframe </em>that will upgrade a selected mod to its maximum level without cost.

These would have different tiers and values, making them have different levels of potency when it comes to upgrading mods. The Legendary Core was the highest and most valuable tier of them.</p>
 <p data-characters="115" data-current-count="115" data-injectable="false">With the mod upgrading system being consolidated into Endo, the only things that remained were the Legendary Cores.</p> <figure data-current-count="415" data-injectable="true"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Warframe-Legendary-Core-Farming.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="How to get and farm Legendary Cores in Warframe" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Warframe-Legendary-Core-Farming.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Warframe-Legendary-Core-Farming.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Warframe-Legendary-Core-Farming.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Warframe-Legendary-Core-Farming.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">How to get a Legendary Core</h2> <p data-characters="292" data-current-count="292" data-injectable="false">To get a Legendary Core, you have to complete the daily Sortie missions or the weekly Archon Hunts. Both activities give you a chance at getting this item, but drop chances are extremely rare. <strong>You have a 0.19% chance of getting a core after completing the final mission of these mission sets.</strong></p> <p data-characters="182" data-current-count="474" data-injectable="true">A Legendary Core can also be earned for every first completion of a Legendary Rank-up test. After reaching MR 30, every rank after it will become “Legendary”, starting back at 1.</p>
 <p data-characters="168" data-current-count="168" data-injectable="false">You can also buy these from other players participating in the Trade Chat. <strong>Prices for these things tend to be around 100 to 150 Platinum</strong>.

You’ll need more if there’s a trade tax in a Clan Dojo.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">When to use a Legendary Core</h2> <p data-characters="145" data-current-count="498" data-injectable="true">To optimally use a Legendary Core, <strong>it’s best to use it on a Primed mod</strong>. Primed mods require the 40,920 Endo and 1,976,436 Credits to max out.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="271" data-current-count="271" data-injectable="false">By using a Legendary Core, you will bypass the need to spend the steep price of Endo and Credits. The Primed mod will go from Unranked to maxed out. Make sure you use it on a mod that you’ll actually use so you can use it on a build you’re looking forward to playing.</p>

            <p>The last few weeks I’ve been watching quite a few YouTube videos (thanks, Evo Japan), and noticing that adverts during videos a) seem to pop up every 30 seconds or so and b) then last for an unskippable 30 to 60 seconds. My frustration with being bombarded by YouTube ads in videos for which I pay nothing to watch - meaning that I understand the necessity for ads of some kind to support creators and pay server bills - came to mind as I read about EA’s plans to explore inserting advertising into games, which I pay up to £70 a pop to play.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-has-teams-looking-at-thoughtful-implementations-of-ads-inside-its-game-experiences">Eurogamer</a>, EA head honcho Andrew Wilson revealed during the publisher’s latest financial report that they are thinking about how to turn “many, many billions of hours spent, both playing, creating, watching and connecting” into presumably billions of dollars, which Wilson corporately euphemised as “a meaningful driver of growth for us”.</p>
<p>While Wilson said that the idea of dynamically inserting adverts into triple-A games - the topic of the question during a Q&amp;A - was “still early on that front”, he did confirm that internal teams were already exploring how to achieve “thoughtful implementations [of adverts] inside of our game experiences”.</p>
<p>“We'll be very thoughtful as we move into that,” Wilson said, as the head of a company known for being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/simcity-vs-the-people-why-apologies-arent-enough">Extremely</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefront-2-microtransactions-temporarily-disabled">Thoughtful</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-tweeted-about-single-player-games-and-even-their-own-devs-were-annoyed">Over</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-promise-to-do-better-after-their-first-sims-summit-did-not-fairly-represent-players">the</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ceo-andrew-wilson-tells-ea-staff-5-of-them-will-be-laid-off-via-empty-and-infuriating-email">Years</a>.</p>
<p>“[M]ore importantly, as we start to build community and harness the power of community beyond the bounds of our games, how do we think about advertising as a growth driver in those types of experiences?” Wilson added, adding nothing but reassurance that the idea of cramming adverts into games to drive growth would be sensitivity approached.</p>

<p>Obviously, it’s hard to look at the idea of a game you might already be paying £70 for - given the specific mention of triple-A games here, rather than free-to-play titles - with anything other than disdain and cynicism. Squeezing more money out of games that have already risen to prices that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/70-titles-are-doomed-to-go-the-way-of-the-dodo-says-saber-interactive-ceo">even other developers consider unsustainable</a> doesn’t exactly seem like the best solution to an industry already brought to its knees by corporate greed and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-do-we-stop-the-next-round-of-games-industry-mass-layoffs">knee-jerk efforts to maximise profits</a> over finding ways to support the people actually making the games with a healthy, long-term view.</p>
<p>Shoving a bunch of adverts into games certainly doesn’t benefit games as an artform, but it’s hard to imagine it’s going to make players feel especially happy about continuing to cough up already ridiculous prices, either. Maybe it’ll end up being a Netflix-like approach, where £70 gets you the game ad-free or you can instead pay £50 but have to watch a 30-second trailer for a new offensive comedy special every time you squeeze off a headshot <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/next-battlefield-game-will-have-connected-multiplayer-and-single-player-offerings-made-by-series-biggest-team-yet">in the new Battlefield</a>. Either way, I’m sure it’ll be “very thoughtful”, as per mega-corporations’ proven track record.</p>

The most important parts are those aforementioned graphics and fidelity options, with the Frame Rate Target now allowing you to choose between 30, 40, and 60 (default). As Bethesda notes, your display must be able to support 120hz if you choose 40.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/siV2gCMZKS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/siV2gCMZKS</a></p>— Bethesda Game Studios (@BethesdaStudios) <a href="https://twitter.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1790052783183286435?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 13, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>You can also choose between Visuals and Performance while trying to maintain framerate, with Performance being recommended for 60 FPS.</p><p>The update also includes a short list of other fixes, including general stability improvements, a few crash fixes, re-enabling auto ADR on Xbox Series X/S, and more. You can see the full patch notes below.</p><p>The big next-gen update released on April 25 as interest in the franchise shot up with the release of the Prime Video TV series, but it didn't come without its issues, with many <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-4-next-gen-update-riddled-with-issues">fans complaining about the technical issues on social media</a>. There was also tons of confusion surrounding if the free next-gen update would be available to those who got Fallout 4 through via PlayStation Plus Collection, although <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-makes-free-fallout-4-next-gen-update-available-to-those-who-received-the-game-via-playstation-plus-collection">Bethesda resolved that earlier this month</a>. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/04/26/fallout4-nextgenchanges-blogroll-1714156338400.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" alt="Fallout 4 just got its first patch since the big next-gen update rolled out last month." src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/04/26/fallout4-nextgenchanges-blogroll-1714156338400.jpg?width=1280&amp;fit=bounds&amp;height=720&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></a><figcaption>Fallout 4 just got its first patch since the big next-gen update rolled out last month.</figcaption></figure></output><h2><strong>Fallout 4 – Next Gen Update 2 Notes</strong></h2><p><strong>Xbox Series S|X and PlayStation 5 Display Settings: </strong>Thanks to your feedback, we’ve been able to implement the ability to control your graphic fidelity and performance.
