            <p>FIFA may not have released a licensed football game recently, but it's ready to team up with Rocket League to introduce an all-new category to its FIFA Esports World Cup.</p>
<p>In a "groundbreaking partnership", FIFAe – that's FIFA's esports arm – <a href="https://www.fifa.gg/news/fifae-introduces-national-team-competition-featuring-rocket-league">says</a> Rocket League will feature in the upcoming FIFAe World Cup, "signif[ying] a major step in FIFA's commitment to embrace the entire ecosystem and drive the global growth of football esports globally".</p>

<p>The competition invites the 16 participating nations to submit three players and one substitute, with the nations themselves selected "based on the number of representatives from each country in previous Rocket League Majors".</p>
<p>It's not clear what cash prize participants will be fighting for, but more information about the "final event" is promised at "a later stage".</p>
<p>"The FIFAe World Cup featuring Rocket League marks a new era for FIFAe, providing a groundbreaking platform for FIFA's member assocations to compete on one of the most relevant esports titles," said Christian Volk, FIFA's director of eFootball and gaming.</p>
<p>"This milestone partnership highlights our commitment to evolve our football esports ecosystem and continue to build the biggest stages for all communities to fame their game."</p> <div>

<p>ICYMI, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/2k-will-develop-the-next-fifa-game-leaker-claims">2K is rumoured to have secured the official FIFA license to develop the next FIFA game</a>.</p>
<p>That's according to unverified claims from a retailer which allege that "the partnership is confirmed, and 2K will be developing a new football game series", albeit without sharing their source.</p>
<p>Whilst not confirmed in any official capacity at all – which means we can only take this news as a hefty rumour for now – it does back up prior claims from <a href="https://x.com/Kurakasis/status/1756869003518042403">earlier this year</a> that 2K and FIFA may have been in talks for the former to succeed development of the FIFA series <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-almost-30-years-ea-is-officially-ditching-the-fifa-brand-1">after EA announced</a> it would be taking its football franchise forward without FIFA branding.</p>
<p>Not that that seems to have done EA any harm; EA's long-running football series might have jettisoned the FIFA license, but the publisher was keen to let everyone know it's doing just fine without it, announcing that this year's iteration, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-sports-fc-24-trumpets-11m-players-in-first-week-1m-more-than-fifa-23">EA Sports FC 24, reached 11.3m players in its first week of release</a>.</p>

Despite securing some investment, the studio quickly slipped into debt.

Eventually, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Second Wave</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> launched in early access on May 31.

So many things were added and developed, but we could not add anything to put into the live version. In the end, we grabbed what we could and did as much testing as we could.

We managed to get it done by the end of May," said Tamura.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We couldn’t pay for JIRA anymore, so we switched to tracking bugs on our Notion site. During this time, our 20 members tested, developed and tested, every single day. We did everything we could.

Issues where characters weren’t getting hit because of aiming changes, or issues where magic damage was doubling," he continued. "There were a lot of issues that wouldn’t normally go live if we were doing QA properly. But because there was no QA team, especially among our remaining 20 people, all these issues were seen and found by the players, and they were not very happy. I don’t blame them."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With nowhere else to go, development was scrapped and the studio disbanded.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/umamusume-pretty-derby-western-release<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Cygames has announced that horse girl gacha game&nbsp;<em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby&nbsp;</em>is officially making its way to the West at some point in the future.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://x.com/umamusume_eng/status/1805222758063988963" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post</a> on a newly-created X (formerly Twitter) account for the game's Western release,&nbsp;<em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby</em>'s Western launch is "on the way", although sadly, we don't have a release date or even a window for it yet.</p>
<p>As the game's official website notes, however, it will be a free-to-play game that'll launch on both iOS and Android. In Japan, the game is also available on PC, but sadly, the PC version doesn't seem to be coming West. Still, there's always <a href="https://www.bluestacks.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BlueStacks</a>, eh?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/umamusume-pretty-derby-western-release-girls.jpg?itok=DP4hYkYY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/umamusume-pretty-derby-western-release-girls.jpg?itok=9xvojQY1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby&nbsp;</em>is finally on its way to the West.</figcaption></figure><p>Along with announcing the Western release of&nbsp;<em>Pretty Derby</em>, developer and publisher Cygames has also revealed the opening movie for the game, titled "Girls' Legend U".</p>
<p>It's a 3D-rendered sequence that effectively serves as a tone-setter for&nbsp;<em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby</em>, and it's soundtracked by a very upbeat song with cutesy lyrics.</p>
<p>You can check out "Girls' Legend U" right here. It should get you hyped to play the English version of this deeply strange but rather endearing-looking gacha game.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby</em>, it's...well, it's a gacha game in which famous racehorses from history have been transformed into anime girls.</p>
<p>These horse girls compete for the chance to earn fame and fortune at Tracen Academy in Tokyo. They're based on real horses, too; horses like Special Week, Meijiro McQueen, and Cesario appear in the manga and its various spinoff media (including the game).</p>
<p>This technically isn't the first&nbsp;<em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby&nbsp;</em>announcement for the West, either. Back <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/umamusume-pretty-derby-finally-coming-west-with-party-game-for-ps4-switch-pc">in June last year</a>, Cygames announced that party game&nbsp;<em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby - Party Dash&nbsp;</em>would be coming West sometime in 2024, and in April, a new trailer announced a release date of August 30th.</p>

<p>We don't have a release window for&nbsp;<em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby&nbsp;</em>in the West yet. Stay tuned for more info on this one.</p>

			<p>Elden Ring and Bloodborne fans unite as the new Elden Ring Graceborne mod aims to make FromSoftware's 2022 hit title more menacing and wicked.</p>
<p>Created by modder 'Noctis', this Graceborne mod is heavily inspired by 2015's PlayStation&nbsp; 4 exclusive BloodBorne. According to the the modder, the project is still work-in-progress, and there are still plenty of issues with balancing, sound, weapon scaling, and more. It's also worth nothing that the mod won't work with the most recent version of Elden Ring. As such, you'll need to <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/5207?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">downgrade</a> to version 1.10 or lower. At the moment of writing, 'Noctis' isn't sure when the mod will be working again following last week's release of the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-1-12-patch-ray-tracing-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recent update</a>.</p>
<p><em>"Graceborne is a mod overhaul still in its infancy. Heavily inspired by Bloodborne, its main goal&nbsp;is to turn Elden Ring's base game into a more grim and sinister experience through multiple means", </em>the modder writes. <em>"In terms of content, the alpha adds a total of 22 armor sets, 35 weapons, 17 trick weapons and 5 firearms. Followed by gameplay additions such as gun parrying, no equip load, quicksteps when locked on, perma-night, Bloodborne-style healing, etc."</em></p>
<p>We've included the alpha release trailer of this interesting new overhaul mod below:</p>

<p>The Elden Ring Graceborne mod can be downloaded <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/5207?tab=files" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Nexusmods her</a>e. As expected, this mod is only available for the PC version.</p>
<p>Elden Ring and the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion are available worldwide now for PC and consoles. Here's what we wrote about the 2022 hit title in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-make-way-for-the-elden-lord/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch review back</a> then:</p>
<p><em>Right from the intro, it is clear that the Elden Ring's lore is incredibly deep. The game takes place in the Lands Between, lands that were once prosperous thanks to the rule of Queen Marika The Eternal and her children, the Demigods. The people of the lands were blessed by the Erdtree and the Elden Ring that was generated from it, which kept the Golden Order of the land in place. The Elden Ring itself was maintained by the balance between the different Runes it housed. The history of the Lands Between took a turn for the worse, however, when some mysterious figures stole the Death Rune and killed one of Marika's children, the Demigod Godwyn. This event brought the end of the Golden Order and turned the Lands Between into the state they are in at the start of the game. The player is only one of the Tarnished, whose goal is to recover every Great Rune and restore the Elden Ring to become the Elden Lord. The Tarnished were all blessed by the Erdtree and the Elden Ring, but now only some of them retain the benevolence of Grace, which also guides them toward their destiny.</em></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/game-uk-stop-selling-physical/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/game-denies-report-it%E2%80%99ll-stop-selling-games-and-hardware.909651/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/game-uk-stop-selling-physical/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Recently, a report surfaced claiming that GAME will cease selling physical games and hardware in the ‘stores’ it operates across the United Kingdom. For a while, GAME has been seemingly ramping down operations by issuing redundancies and zero-hour contracts, shutting down stores, and pulling back to ‘concessions’ inside Sports Direct and House of Fraser units across the nation.</p>



<p>However, following the emergence of the report, GAME’s representatives quickly rushed to set the story straight, stating that the claim is ‘categorically untrue’ and that the firm will ‘continue to support the physical gaming market’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-long-way-down">Long Way Down</h2>



<p>GAME was a shining gem of the British town centre, with everyone using the label as the go-to spot for consoles, video games, peripherals, and even advice on the latest games. Now, it’s a shadow of its former self, resigned to selling mostly toys and gadgets to an ever-shrinking customer base. Most recently, the firm stopped buying and selling used games and hardware, which for several years had been a staple of the business.</p>



<p>Then, in another downturn, it was announced that GAME was ceasing operations of its reward card-based system, which had been running for almost two decades. Along with that came the shutdown of GAME Elite, the ‘boosted’ reward card experience that offered customers several key benefits.</p>



<p>The latest claim to surface was that GAME was preparing to stop selling boxed games and brand-new hardware in-store, but this report was deleted by the company almost as soon as it appeared. It doesn’t seem like that’s too far away from becoming the reality, though.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss/status/1805230089728069783" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on X, frequent leaker @SamLeakss and @ImPeQu both showcased a UI overhaul and modes potentially coming to Rocket Racing.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://x.com/ImPeQu/status/1804416745890828711" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">original leak</a> from @ImPeQu includes an image of the new UI. It teases that “Inferno Island” may be the title for Season 2. </p>



<p>@SamLeakss reposted the accompanying image of Rocket Racing’s updated UI. This features a tidy menu and some modes that could arrive in Rocket Racing soon. </p>



<p>The leak shows off a Casual playlist, a Featured Track option, as well as a training mode. Further, @SamLeakss points out that Lockjaw appears in the image, implying it may be “coming as a customizable car in the future.”</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Rocket Racing most recently added a Neon Rush update in April 2024. It got a boost from creator-made tracks built with UEFN, and a variety of fixes. The devs <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/rocket-racing-neon-rush-light-up-the-night" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">also stated</a> that “we decided not to approach major updates as typical Seasons.”</p>



<p>@SamLeakss frequently posts about Fortnite-related content. That includes claims about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-rocket-league-getting-new-mandalorian-crossover-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Mandalorian crossover</a> with Fortnite last March.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/BeastFNCreative/status/1805175755917164876" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> today, leaker @BeastFNCreative also claimed that the new Rocket Racing season will be Inferno Island. @BeastFNCreative previously posted about UEFN getting the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-rocket-racing-editor-details-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rocket Racing editor</a>.</p>



<p>At this time, Epic Games has not confirmed any of the above claims about Inferno Island or Rocket Racing’s UI overhaul. The final UI and modes are possibly still subject to change.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/24/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>It’s best not to think about the animal welfare questions that series like Super Monkey Ball and Pokémon raise. Do these animals like being in their balls? Have they chosen to be in balls? How do they eat and…. well, you know, in the balls? OK, that last one is a wild musing of my addled mind,&nbsp;but ever since the GameCube original, Super Monkey Ball has been putting simians in spheres and people have been loving it.</p>
<p><iframe title="Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble - Adventure Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DDRM6ftrro8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble starts, as many of these games have before, with letting you choose which ape to trap in an oversized hamster ball, before setting forth across a series of nefarious courses designed to send your furry friend hurtling to their doom. Fortunately, any missteps here only result in a return to the start, rather than a visit from animal protection.</p>


<p>Banana Rumble is just as joyously happy as its forebears, and the core formula remains as tricky and teeth-gnashingly frustrating as ever, while retaining that essential ‘one-more-go’ flavour to keep you coming back. This time you’re off to Juicy Island in search of the Legendary Banana. Now, this isn’t an island populated by ladies’ leggings, and there’s a smattering of Chaos Emerald about the Legendary Banana, but you can probably forget all about this narrative as you’ll be too busy trying not to fall off things.</p>


<p>The cast here, led by the indomitable AiAi, are as adorable as ever, but there’s a batch of newcomers to keep an eye on, both in single and multiplayer modes. Alongside borrowing the Chaos Emeralds, Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble also steals Sonic’s Spin Dash, allowing your monkeys to hurtle across the screen even faster, more easily overcoming small walls and ramps. They’re definitely falling off the level even more too.</p>
<p>Adventure mode has a narrative woven into it, though the adorable cutscenes are strangely low resolution, and if you’re looking for meaningful simian drama you’re probably better off with Planet of the Apes. A young female monkey Palette is looking for her father, and the Gala Family appear – a group of treasure hunters who have some unkind, banana-related putdowns to hand out to our beloved apes – but it’s safe to say that their nefarious deeds don’t really make any difference to the banana-collecting, goal-reaching action. Still, it’s all very cute.</p>
<p>There’s a clear emphasis on enjoying Monkey Ball Banana Rush with your friends, and every mode here can be played online or locally. Four players can team up for the adventure, with optional collisions to add a little more chaos, while the multiplayer Battle modes can have up to sixteen players, with AI bots able to fill out the room if you’re playing with the local limit of four. If you’re playing online, there’s either open lobbies or a simple six-character password to connect to a friend’s custom lobby, and everything runs surprisingly seamlessly, even if the Nintendo Switch isn’t able to keep as smooth a frame rate as you’d like during this.</p>

<p>Battle mode sees Monkey Ball Banana Rush go all Fall Guys, and turns in a series of different events where you’re aiming to come first or be on the better team. There’s five game modes, made up of Race, Banana Hunt, Ba-BOOM!, Goal Rush and Robot Smash! and they’re all pretty much as chaotic as you’d expect, with sixteen monkeys flying around the screen and bashing into each other as they try to collect another banana. There’s a lot of fun to be had here, whether playing with friends or strangers on the internet, though whether there’s going to be enough long-term appeal to keep coming back is questionable.</p>
<p>There is also an in-game season pass, though you only earn points by battling random people. Working through it unlocks new cosmetics and characters to use in the different modes. It’s appealing enough to deck out your monkey in cool sneakers and a wicked pair of shades, but it doesn’t feel hugely essential, particularly when you mostly see them from behind and inside a ball. Still, it adds a new tone to proceedings, and Goal Rush, in particular, got under my skin, as you race down hill and try to capture each goal for your team, while also trying to earn extra points with bonus goals while stopping your opponents from doing the same.</p>

<p>Besides fun with friends, repeat play hinges on you wanting to come back to Adventure Mode to better your times, collect more bananas, or achieve the different challenges that you’ll find in each level. This would probably be more compelling if you were told what these missions were the first time that you arrived at each level, but they’re all centred around collecting the golden banana, or picking up a specific number of bananas, so you do have some idea of what you’re supposed to be doing. In some cases, these goals are really tight with their timings, and in turn you can push the difficulty level up for yourself as you become ever more skillful. Time Attack mode also benefits from having online leaderboards, so you can see what insane times other people have posted.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/war-thunder-challenger-explosion-art<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>War Thunder&nbsp;</em>developer Gaijin Entertainment has apologized after players spotted that the studio had used a shot of the explosion from the Challenger disaster in a piece of artwork for the free-to-play military combat sim.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/1dm7e77/what_did_gaijin_mean_by_this/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">abacs21 noticed</a> that an explosion in artwork for the game's new "Seek &amp; Destroy" expansion looked markedly similar to a shot of the Challenger spacecraft exploding.</p>
<p>Following that, Reddit user HarryTheOwlcat <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/1dm9oao/challenger_disaster_and_seek_destroy_wallpaper/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted a shot</a> of the Challenger explosion superimposed over the&nbsp;<em>War Thunder&nbsp;</em>artwork in question, and it's pretty difficult to deny the obvious similarities between the two.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/war-thunder-challenger-disaster-key-art.jpg?itok=OCyd-4EW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/war-thunder-challenger-disaster-key-art.jpg?itok=seG41pKs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The explosion in the bottom-left corner of this image was taken from a photo of the Challenger disaster.</figcaption></figure><p>In <a href="https://forum.warthunder.com/t/noticed-a-little-something/119652/22" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a thread</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>War Thunder&nbsp;</em>forums, community manager magazine2 <a href="https://forum.warthunder.com/t/noticed-a-little-something/119652/26" rel="noopener" target="_blank">admits</a> that the Challenger disaster explosion was indeed used in Seek &amp; Destroy artwork.</p>
<p>They say the shot was used "accidentally", and that it was "part of an aerial explosion reference pack" used by Gaijin's artists. As such, the "context" of the explosion being from the Challenger disaster "was lost".</p>
<p>The community manager goes on to say that the team will alter the artwork "as soon as we can" and will take measures to ensure that something like this doesn't happen again in future.</p>
<p>If you're not from the US, the historical significance of the Challenger disaster, in which seven crew members died when the Challenger shuttle exploded just 73 seconds after its liftoff, may not be as apparent to you as it would to a US citizen.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say, though, that this event is still reverberating throughout the US space industry, and <a href="https://www.space.com/18084-space-shuttle-challenger.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">specifically throughout NASA</a>. It led to the shelving of civilian spaceflight plans for over two decades and also changed other key parts of NASA policy.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/war-thunder-challenger-disaster-key-art-plane.jpg?itok=PYEz_-Wt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/war-thunder-challenger-disaster-key-art-plane.jpg?itok=h76ycZlV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>War Thunder&nbsp;</em>developer Gaijin has apologized for using a photo from the Challenger disaster in its artwork.</figcaption></figure><p>Although Gaijin says its artists mistakenly used the shot as part of a "reference pack", it's not entirely clear what a shot of a spacecraft exploding is doing in a reference pack for a military game that focuses on air, land, and sea vehicles.</p>
<p>Still, this makes a nice break from the stuff Gaijin and&nbsp;<em>War Thunder&nbsp;</em>usually get in trouble for, which is to say the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/war-thunder-forums-allegedly-leak-classified-leclerc-tank-specs">leaking of confidential military secrets</a>. It happens <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/war-thunder-player-allegedly-shared-classified-tank-specs-on-forums">far more frequently than you might think</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/days-gone-creative-director-never-say-never-about-a-sequel-after-game-director-says-exactly-that<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">Open-world</a> zombie adventure <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> might not technically feature any zombies, but at least the discourse around a potential sequel is constantly reanimating. Via <a href="https://x.com/John_Garvin/status/1805079089109467322">Xitter</a>, the original game’s creative director John Garvin has encouraged fans to "never say never" about a Days Gone 2, while reminding us that a full outline for the game had <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/04/12/days-gone-2-details-revealed-by-games-director-including-a-shared-universe-with-co-op">already been completed</a> prior to his departure from developers Bend Studio in 2020.</p>
<p>Even with the caveat of "I’m not holding my breath", Garvin’s take is an altogether more hopeful one that that of fellow Bend alumni and Days Gone game director Jeff Ross, who in May <a href="https://x.com/JakeRocket/status/1796288252200235100">tweeXed</a> a collage of popular PlayStation characters – sans his own post-apocalyptic motorcycling hero, Deacon St. John. "A lot of people still ask me if there will ever be a Days Gone sequel, so I submit this poster as evidence it will never happen", Ross wrote, along with an apparent pop at Sony Interactive execs (including Hermen Hulst, co-CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment) for never being "fans" of the game.</p>
<!--more-->
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">A lot of people still ask me if there will ever be a Days Gone sequel, so I submit this poster as evidence it will never happen. Sony higher ups like Hermen were never fans, so you won't hear about it at the PlayStation State of Play today or ever. <a href="https://t.co/9G8lPgJgVW">pic.twitter.com/9G8lPgJgVW</a></p>— Jeff Ross (@JakeRocket) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeRocket/status/1796288252200235100?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2024</a></blockquote></div> <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>Just to be clear that this isn’t a 'My dads are fighting' situation, Garvin’s tweet was not in direct response to Ross’s, and even suggested that Sony re-hire the two to work on the elusive sequel. Whether Bend would be up for that is a different matter: besides <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/days-gone-devs-are-getting-back-in-the-saddle-and-hiring-someone-with-live-service-experience">a recent job posting</a> suggesting the studio are busy trying their hands at a new live-service game, Bend have previously <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/days-gone-studio-do-not-share-former-directors-views-on-its-critical-reception">distanced themselves</a> from their former creative director after he posted a (long since deleted) tweet blaming "woke reviewers" in part for Days Gone’s lukewarm reception. I’ve never played it myself, either on console or when it came to PC in 2021, though I’ve wokishly shaken my Magic Woke Ball and it said "sequel unlikely". I’d therefore probably go with Ross as having the more realistic outlook.</p>
<p>That said, the image that Ross interpreted as a damning snub on Sony’s part is not an official promo but a <a href="https://twitter.com/Traveler_BP/status/1795173576250687805">piece of fanart</a>, seemingly made by unaffiliated PlayStation enjoyer @Traveler_BP. They’ve even made an <a href="https://twitter.com/Traveler_BP/status/1722711519060729922/photo/2">older version</a> featuring ya boi Deacon, though this should not necessarily be considered confirmation that Sony actually love Days Gone and will be greenlighting two new games and a remake any time now. I think there’s still <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/theres-a-days-gone-movie-adaptation-in-development">a film coming</a>, though?</p>

            <p>A former developer at Total War studio Creative Assembly has written <a href="https://medium.com/@julianmckinlay/total-war-rome-ii-and-creative-assembly-my-statement-ten-years-on-d964f65b0a8f">a lengthy personal account</a> of his time at the studio, in which he details development troubles on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-rome-ii">Total War: Rome 2</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-attila">Total War: Attila</a>, and alleges that these issues were exacerbated by an inflexible and counterproductive leadership structure and “chronic mismanagement,” sometimes resulting in what he calls a “toxic work environment.”</p>

<p>Julian McKinlay, who between 2009 and 2014 worked on Total War games ranging from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/napoleon-total-war">Napoleon</a> to Attila, also detailed his experience being blamed by a section of the community for Rome 2’s bug-ridden launch after appearing in a promotional video. McKinlay was blamed for misrepensenting information about the game. He makes clear he wasn't coerced into giving the interview, but answered questions based on what he understood about the then current state of Rome 2.</p>
<p>McKinlay also goes into detail on the issues he faced as a programmer, largely centred around AI, and claims that upper management either misunderstood or routinely ignored issues raised by programmers. He also alleges that leadership put the addition of marketable new features - and marketing itself - at a higher priority than giving the programmers the support and resources they needed.</p>
<p>He also alleges that the design and programming teams were at odds as regards certain features, and that upper management frequently sided with designers. “The way it looked from my point of view was that production leadership let designers do whatever they wanted, and it’s one of the main reasons that Rome II went so badly wrong,” writes McKinlay. “Designers instructed us not to improve [the AI] in certain ways, because they believed that players enjoyed being able to dominate the AI and that we shouldn’t deprive them of that.”</p>

<p>“The Total War team was very hierarchical for its size,” McKinlay writes, “and key design and management decisions were made by a small handful of individuals at the top without any real oversight from the wider development team.” Total War’s “leaders”, writes McKinlay, “seemed to resent critical feedback and treated it as unwelcome. It was common for important decisions to be already treated as final by the time they were communicated to those of us in the trenches, if they were communicated to us at all.”</p>
<p>In terms of the aforementioned Rally Point video, McKinlay was subject to ridicule and harassment after it aired. He says this culminated in death threats, although he adds that he felt he “did not have actual reason to fear for my safety.” While he says that he doesn’t believe Creative Assembly intentionally stoked these fires, he believes that “this narrative was actually quite convenient for Creative Assembly, and I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say that I became a scapegoat for the project’s failures.”</p>
<p>McKinlay eventually left the studio during the development of Attila, after friction with the design team over feedback resulted in him being “chewed out by management”, which he alleges was “clearly intended to silence [him] for the convenience of management figures who wanted to continue doing things their way no matter the consequences to anybody else”. McKinlay left soon after, feeling that he had “made enemies in the team’s leadership and that it would probably affect my chances of promotions and things like that down the line.” In McKinlay's view, he parted after "it became clear that leadership was going to keep repeating the same mistakes."</p>
<p>Towards the end of the piece, which is far more detailed and gets much further into the weeds of actual game design than is practical to summarise here, McKinlay poses the following question:</p>
<blockquote>One question to ask is, how well do these experiences represent the Creative Assembly of today? Given the recent problems faced by the studio it seems clear that studio management and creative leadership continue to be a source of major problems, but I should be clear that it’s not for me to say how similar the details of recent problems are to those that I experienced. One thing I will say is that several of the individuals responsible for the problems I’ve described in this statement either still work at the company, or did until recent layoffs, which I think says something about ongoing problems with the studio’s management culture.</blockquote>
<p>“Despite ongoing problems with the games and a number of high profile embarrassments, the series continued to be profitable,” he concludes. “This fact was used against developers like me who argued for better practices, and was often used by creative leadership as a metric to confirm the success of prior projects and decisions regardless of other ways that they might have failed.”</p>
<p>It's worth reiterating that this is one developers's perspective on an entire studio, and one that hasn’t worked there for ten years, even if the recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cancelled-shooter-hyenas-was-reportedly-segas-most-expensive-game-ever">Hyenas saga</a> could suggest that some of the issues McKinlay raises are still ongoing. McKinlay is also not entirely negative about his time there, mentioning friends at the studio still.</p>
<p>One other former employee at CA has boosted McKinlay’s account. Will Overgard, CA’s community coordinator from 2012 to 2015, has <a href="https://x.com/Will_Overgard/status/1804243223399010631">shared the post on Xitter</a>. “I still feel guilty for what happened to Julian, so give his statement a read for me,” writes Overgard. “I’m incredibly proud of what I contributed to CA…but I had a hand in destroying someone's career and that awful feeling never went away.”</p>
<p>We’ve reached out to Creative Assembly for comment.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dustborn-hands-on-preview-wordy-road-trip/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ragnar Tørnquist may not be among the most well-known game designers nowadays, but his contributions to the adventure genre cannot be overstated, as his works with games such as The Longest Journey helped the genre move forward when the point-and-click formula started dying out. After founding Red Thread Games in 2012 and releasing multiple entries in the Dreamfall Chapters, the Norwegian game designer is about to release, together with his development team Dustborn, an adventure game that tries to do things differently to present a better, rounded-up and more compelling experience.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240614130652_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>In Dustborn, players control Pax, an Anomal con-artist who has the power to weaponize language. Looking to create a new life in an alternate history America, she was hired to transport an important package to Nova Scotia, which she will have to keep safe with the help of a crew comprising a rather colorful crew with unique abilities. Despite the preview version I had the chance to try out was set a few hours into the adventure, my playtime with it made it clear how character development and interactions will be among the game's most developed features. Controlling Pax, players will have a lot of chances to interact with the other characters, develop relationships with them, and come to understand them better. These relationships are developed with a straightforward branching dialogue system that is pretty similar to similar systems seen in other adventure games.</p>
<p>When not interacting with other characters, players will explore a variety of closed-off, linear locations in Dustborn, controlling Pax from a third-person camera view as she searches for clues and objects to help her solve whatever conundrum she and her crew encounter. Much like in dialogues, players can make different choices that will shape the outcome of select scenarios, opting, for example, to ask for the help of a certain character instead of another. In the preview scenario, set in a service station in the middle of a desert, Pax can ask either Theo or Sai, a girl afflicted with vitiligo, to open a door by lock-picking it or using brute force, respectively. These types of interactions were everywhere in the preview version, and they helped immensely in getting to know and care for the crew, although writing did not feel particularly inspired. It does its job reasonably well, no doubt about it, but it's not really a standout feature.</p>
<p>Where Dustborn seems like it will deliver is the adventuring gameplay. The game makes it really easy to discover new elements needed to proceed through the story, and while most of the interactions are not particularly innovative, they are varied enough, and some are objectively cool, like the one where Pax has to guide Sai with her voice to help her drop a massive tire in a specific location to burn it down. Later on, to make other examples, Pax will have to distract a service robot to steal a bottle of whiskey to create a Molotov cocktail and throw a few of them in a more action-oriented sequence at a gang of bikers. All this, coupled with the dominant comic book aesthetics, which can be appreciated even more by the ability to control the camera at pretty much every time and alternate 90s setting, gives Dustborn a peculiar feel.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240614134730_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Sadly, it's in the more action-oriented sequences that Dustborn falters. Fighting enemies in the game is, simply put, not that fun. Moving and attacking feel terribly unresponsive, the animations are stiff, and the mechanics rather basic, as Pax can essentially only unleash simple short-range and long-range attacks, which don't feel impactful at all. The special power that allows Pax to weaponize words essentially gives her a chance to push enemies away, force some of them to attack their companions and force other conditions which did not feel particularly inspired in the preview version. Combination attacks performed by multiple characters are also in, and they look nice enough, although I never felt the need while fighting enemies to do anything more than swing Pax's unique bat around and dodge the occasional attack.</p>
<p>Having had the chance to experience less than two hours of the game, I cannot say if Dustborn's best features will be enough to make up for its weaknesses. While the setting, story, characters, and varied gameplay sequences have potential, and the adventure game mechanics feel solid enough despite not being particularly inspired, the action-oriented sequences and the combat system felt clunky and not particularly fun to play. With more surprises waiting for Pax and her crew on the road, however, Dustborn may prove to be a much better game than what it felt like in my limited time with it when it launches on August 20th on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Xbox One.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/valorant-console-preview-one-tap-b-plant-no-cap<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the wake of eSports becoming a growing mine of financial prosperity and career opportunities, it makes sense that console players tend to be on the outside looking in. A keyboard being the optimal solution, its use in a console player base for games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege"><em>Rainbow Six: Siege</em></a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/call-of-duty-warzone"><em>Call of Duty</em></a> is met with derision, and some would say rightfully so. Regardless, Riot Games has decided to give console players some fun, with their Xbox and PlayStation-dedicated version of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/valorant"><em>VALORANT</em></a> recently released in beta.</p>
<p>This is the breakout FPS from <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/league-of-legends"><em>League of Legends</em></a> developers Riot Games, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/counter-strike-global-offensive"><em>Counter Strike</em></a>-like which became a smash hit in 2020, during the COVID-19 lockdown. <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-summer-game-fest-2024-announcement">Announced during Summer Games Fest</a> that Riot would be bringing the PC shooter to consoles this year, the month-long beta kicked off shortly after the announcement. With a few of the game's standout maps available in rotation for matchmaking right now, Riot has made sure to plant its feet in the sand in regards to what this console version offers.</p>
<p>There may be a pretense of confusion when it comes to what <em>VALORANT </em>on console is, especially in comparison to the PC counterpart. As someone who has put an almost unhealthy (and almost completely unnecessary) amount of time into the Xbox 360 version of<em> Counter Strike: Global Operative</em>, one could see a necessity to give console players some of their own catered fun. Already, it seems like Riot feels the same way.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valorant-players-are-already-getting-banned-for-using-mouse-and-keyboard-on-console/1100-6524323/">banning users who use a keyboard and mouse in console lobbies</a>, to providing a keybind to allow players to walk without making noise, <em>VALORANT </em>is providing controller players with as much accommodation in their space, which is great! There’s obviously still a massive discrepancy in skill ceiling between console and PC, but then, that’s not the point, is it? It’s neither a humbling, nor a one-up, they co-exist, and for that, I’m personally grateful for the work put in.</p>
<p>It also helps that the pacing is breakneck, with <em>VALORANT</em>’s “Swiftplay” having matches take less than 20 minutes at a time, even when rounds are stretched out to their maximum. While a full-on Competitive mode with ELO rankings hasn’t been introduced in the beta yet, there’s a taste in the “Unrated” mode, which gives you a feel for the 24-round based mode, and what it offers, which is longer matches, and more focused play.</p>
<p>Still, none of this was really prevalent when playing on my own. At first, I didn’t have a squad to team up with, and <em>VALORANT</em>’s infamously toxic community didn’t really inspire me to ask around for new buddies, regardless of how new everyone was to this specific experience. I stuck it by myself for a while and found myself contending with how much dead air can linger in the moment-to-moment.</p>

<p>It’s a <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a> </em>thing. When there’s complete silence, it’s meant to be offset by callouts, team talk, strategic divulgence, maybe even banter, and when you’re solo, <em>VALORANT </em>isn’t communicative like <em>Counter Strike</em> - hell, even <em>Siege</em>. I understand this may be more of a personal qualm than most of the other issues present, but it should be stated how much of a vacuum is present in a singular space.</p>
<p>All of this is to say it’s immediately remediated when you have at least one more friend playing alongside you. Suddenly the energy is frantic, alive, decisions weighted further amongst thought and actual presence. When you or they pop off in a match, it’s not to the sounds of silence, or maybe even nodding approval, but the squad in awe of your work, and it’s nice.</p>
<p>Honestly, there’s not much else to say in regards to <em>VALORANT</em>’s qualities. Its presence in the FPS market has been felt for a while now, its hero-based mechanics and tactical opportunities are always ever-present, synchronicity readily apparent in nearly every hero pair-up - even if too many rely on what are essentially just different colors of smoke grenades - and the weapon balancing is really good.</p>

<p>The controls are as good as they can be for an ultimately PC-ortiented experience. With a keybind to walk without making sound or wrangling with dead zones and thresholds for the controller's joysticks, it means everyone has a presence for the tactical FPS genre's most basic tactic, which is sound play. Sensitivity and its other parameters come down to personal preference, and the game's movement mechanics feel fresh and incredibly accessible to anyone playing.</p>
<p>The main issue of <em>VALORANT </em>on console right now is the UI, which is subject to sluggish and intrusive issues at the time of writing. At the start of every round, there’s a combat report that shows damage given and taken during the prior round, and it takes up a fair amount of the screen, with no way to remove it until the round begins. It’s not so much of a deal breaker, but I found optimal gadget placement a pain in the ass sometimes, trying to line things up when there’s an opaque slab on the right of the screen.</p>
<p>Still, that isn’t enough to put even a Gekko-sized blot on how well-optimized <em>VALORANT </em>on consoles appears to be. Catered to the crowd, and clearly focused on removing a damaging ego when comparing the two platforms, these are the same game yet entirely removed from each other, which is an achievement. When <em>Counter Strike: Global Operative</em> released on Xbox 360, there was a small hope to have them co-exist and progress together.</p>
<p>A noble cause, but one ultimately driven to fail when you’re emulating THE PC game.</p>

<h2><em>VALORANT </em>Console Preview | Final Verdict</h2>
<p>As it stands, <em>VALORANT</em>’s console offering is shaping up to be a refined experience for those who simply want to pick up the controller and have fun. It’s an ultimately more casual dilution of its eSports-toting, toxic-breeding, rage-inducing PC counterparts, but in this space, something else can grow.</p>
<p>Whether or not Riot can lay claim to what prospers is another thing entirely.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Riven Review - Islands of Adventure]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/riven-review-islands-of-adventure</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/riven-review-islands-of-adventure.909612/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/riven-review-islands-of-adventure<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With the success of 2020’s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/review/realmyst-masterpiece-edition-pc-review"><em>Myst</em></a> remake, it was only a matter of time before its sequel, <em>Riven</em>, saw a similar treatment. Thus, we have four years later, the newly updated version of <em>Riven</em> that promises to be more than just a flashy graphics upgrade.</p>
<p>As I outlined in my original <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/riven-preview-everything-old-is-new-again">preview for <em>Riven</em></a>, there have been some subtle changes here and there – although from my personal perspective as someone who never played the original, I would be going in fresh regardless. That said, for those well-versed in the series, it’s something to keep in mind going in.</p>
<p>The way <em>Riven</em> begins is loaded with a mystery of sorts. You’re immediately faced with a man named Atrus, who gives you some sort of important book. After that you’re whisked away, stuffed in a jail, have had your book stolen by an indecipherable stranger, before being let loose on the rockery of some island.</p>
<p>From there the story becomes embedded in the environment around you, and it’s from the beginning and through exploration and puzzle solving that the main goal becomes clear: free Atrus’ wife Catherine, and capture Gehn, the one who imprisoned her.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riven_01.jpg?itok=2mcS4cxr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riven_01.jpg?itok=TXldY-27 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The premise is simple enough, and a lot of the surrounding flavor text is uncovered in things like your journal, as well as the observation of each unique environment.</p>
<p><em>Riven</em> takes place on a series of islands, the Age of Riven, that you’ll need to traverse in order to get to the final conclusion. Each one is fairly unique in that you’re never really encountering the same place twice. From the gold dome topped island you wake up on, to a jungle island, and even a prison, the variety of location is a place <em>Riven</em> excels at.</p>
<p>I found a good chunk of my play time was spent just admiring each environment. Because that’s what you do in <em>Riven</em>, you’re encouraged to explore everything to avoid missing out on some important detail you might need later on in your explorations.</p>
<p>The 3D, fully rendered environments are lovingly detailed, from cliffsides, sand, rocks, metal material, foliage, and water, it’s clear there was a lot of love in the transition to a modern version of <em>Riven</em>.</p>
<p>Along each island, you’ll come in contact with puzzles of different varieties. There’s going to be trial and error to get through doors, across bridges, and solving smaller puzzles using symbols found in places like a village.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riven-02.jpg?itok=HmShwlrY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riven-02.jpg?itok=oN30F6R6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Gameplay is simple, involving pointing and clicking (even on controller), and moving things like levers, pressing buttons, and other objects. There’s even a few options to take in-game screenshots that go to your journal, as well as a one-button easy-access satchel to store inventory.</p>
<p>It’s all very detail-oriented, and there are even some aspects that don’t always lead to anything meaningful and that’s okay. One thing in particular that I found enjoyable was being able to move to the next island without completing everything as I went.</p>
<p>That element of freedom gives<em> Riven </em>a zen-like feeling. When you’re not looking around for artifacts and puzzles related to them, the lack of urgency in the game world creates a quiet beauty and plenty of immersion, even if there are a few people hidden around.</p>
<p>The puzzles themselves do offer a lot of critical thinking, and there were a lot of times when I was playing through <em>Riven</em> that I felt like I was second-guessing myself. Being able to roam around back and forth is certainly helpful, and ultimately, I felt that some of the trickier puzzles did instill a sense of accomplishment.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riven-03.jpg?itok=3gkBPCa7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riven-03.jpg?itok=jYYYWJKo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>There’s not really any set difficulty level in <em>Riven</em> – it’s as hard as you make it on yourself really – but paying attention is a big part of it. The majority of these puzzles stem from smaller ones that must be solved first, along with gathering clues from out in the world. That said, it can get frustrating when some of them feel like there are not enough hints on what to do, and the lack of direction doesn't always make sense leading to a lot of aimless wandering back and forth.</p>
<p>As I said, I never played the original <em>Riven</em>, or <em>Myst</em> for that matter, so despite all that, I did find it interesting trying to wrap my head around all the little lore pieces scattered around to discover.</p>
<p>A lot of it is visual, like little windows you peek through to see some historical depictions and other times, there are books you can read with more direct information.</p>
<p>The element of choice also comes to <em>Riven</em> in a big way. Certain choices, without going into direct spoilers, can produce different outcomes. So much so that <em>Riven</em> does in fact have bad endings you can end up in if you make what might be considered to be the wrong decision.</p>
<p><em>Riven</em>’s status as a remake lends itself to its solid performance. Cyan’s choice to develop on Unreal Engine 5 is here in full force with smooth performance without sacrificing visual fidelity – not that there’s a ton going on to really push the game, but it’s a solid experience regardless.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riven-04.jpg?itok=SeVOxBRV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riven-04.jpg?itok=Kp4SrQ02 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>Riven</em>'s music is pleasant enough, and I was glad to see some voice acting for the minimal character interaction that does exist. The characters, such as Gehn and finding out his story was one of the major draws for me during my playthrough.</p>
<p>Overall, this new version of <em>Riven</em> is plenty appealing, even if you’re just looking for a low-stakes puzzle game to chip away at. The point-and-click gameplay, along with the lack of any real information dumps or dialogue makes it approachable in a way that was unexpected to me.</p>
<p>While some of the puzzles are challenging and not always clear, I think the overall presentation, and being to explore the detailed environments without any real learning curve, shows that <em>Riven</em> can be enjoyed by anyone, even if they haven’t played the original version or even the previous game <em>Myst</em>.</p>
<p>Having dipped my toes into the world of <em>Riven</em>, I now want to go back and experience the beginnings for myself. Then after that, maybe revisit <em>Riven</em> for a different perspective. Riven feels like a game with a good amount of replay value, and I’m plenty keen to put that to the test.</p>

Sometimes I play to jumpstart my brain in the morning, sometimes to unwind during my lunch break, sometimes to fill some time in the evening. Usually, I choose the fifty-stage-long Expert difficulty, and see how far I can make it without using a continue. There’s rarely an explicit goal here—I’m just hanging out in one of the best games ever made.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196790" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why Everybody Hates This Dragon's Dogma 2 NPC" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="142" data-playlist="196790,192610,196001" data-current="196790"><div><p>Why Everybody Hates This Dragon's Dogma 2 NPC</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196790/196790_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196790/196790_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196790/196790_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196790/196790_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22347.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Super Monkey Ball</em> is so good that not returning to it habitually feels like doing it a disservice. The game feels perfect, looks perfect, and is astonishingly easy to pick up and play: spend five seconds with it and you’ll understand quite literally everything about its design. You’re a guy in a ball; there’s a goal at the end of a floating obstacle course; a timer is ticking down. Use the control stick to move. That’s <em>it</em>. Every pixel of what’s onscreen, from the level geometry to the character animations to the HUD, is designed with an elegant, utilitarian exactitude, relaying a constant stream of complex information to players while keeping their focus squarely on the center of the frame.</p><p>This is crucial, because <em>Super Monkey Ball</em> demands undivided, unbending attention. It is a <em>molecular </em>video game. The movement—which occupies more or less the entirety of the game’s mechanical space—is so precise that an errant two-millimeter nudge of the control stick can instantly change (or ruin) your approach to any given obstacle. In my twenty years with <em>Super Monkey Ball</em>, no run has felt remotely similar. Stages I’ve navigated hundreds of times constantly present new, unexpected, exciting challenges. In any other game, this would be impressive. In a game with exactly one verb, it’s a marvel.</p><figure id="" data-id="329e907f1af70622c29fd89ed6cb33b7" data-recommend-id="image://329e907f1af70622c29fd89ed6cb33b7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A sky view of a cog-themed level." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A sky view of a cog-themed level." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="329e907f1af70622c29fd89ed6cb33b7" data-recommend-id="image://329e907f1af70622c29fd89ed6cb33b7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A sky view of a cog-themed level." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s also a hard act to follow. Not long after the 2002 release of <em>Super Monkey Ball 2</em>—a great game, though hurt somewhat by its occasional prioritization of mazes and puzzles over brass-tacks platforming—the wheels began falling off. Save for a couple small blips on the radar (here’s to you, 2006’s <em>Super Monkey Ball: Banana Splitz</em>), the series has spent the majority of its lifespan in a steady state of decline, each entry drifting further away from the rigor and creativity of the GameCube duology. I was almost ready to leave it for dead after 2021’s <em>Super Monkey Ball</em>: <em>Banana Mania</em>, a remake of the first two games that tampered with their physics, flattened their structure, removed multiplayer modes, and introduced a slew of control and camera issues.</p><p>Now, practically out of nowhere, into our laps falls <em>Banana Rumble</em>, the first non-remake series entry<em>&nbsp;</em>since 2012. I booted up my review copy with tempered expectations. I’d been burned many times before. Recently, even. Imagine my relief when it wound up being the best <em>Super Monkey Ball</em> game in over twenty years.</p><h2 id="h559908"><a id=""></a><strong>The Meat</strong></h2><p>In almost every way that matters, <em>Banana Rumble</em> goes back to the drawing board. No more jumping, no more minigame bloat, no more micromanaging the camera. Motion controls are available, but they’re off by default, their toggle squirreled away in a labyrinthine options menu.</p><p>The mere presence of a labyrinthine options menu should be encouraging to anyone who was frustrated by <em>Banana Mania</em>’s sparse customizability. Rest easy, veteran ballers: <em>Banana Rumble</em> allows for adjustments to, among other things, input display, automatic camera speed, manual camera speed, stick dead zones for both character and camera control, stage tilt severity, and stage tilt speed. (I tested those latter two, and they don’t seem to have any bearing on physics.) If you’re hankering for a more traditional setup, do what I did and disable the manual camera entirely while cranking automatic tracking up to the max. Congratulations, you’re playing <em>Monkey Ball </em>just like mama used to make.</p><figure id="" data-id="e9fd6669ecedde2052be5b0b8c00f8bd" data-recommend-id="image://e9fd6669ecedde2052be5b0b8c00f8bd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lots of monkeys in balls, undermining the tone of this review entirely." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Lots of monkeys in balls, undermining the tone of this review entirely." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e9fd6669ecedde2052be5b0b8c00f8bd" data-recommend-id="image://e9fd6669ecedde2052be5b0b8c00f8bd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lots of monkeys in balls, undermining the tone of this review entirely." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Even out of the box, a good chunk of this game is mama’s <em>Monkey Ball</em>, albeit with some significant adjustments to the formula—mostly for better, occasionally for worse. The creamy nougat center is Adventure Mode: 200 miniature platforming gauntlets, none longer than sixty seconds. These are evenly split into twenty worlds, the first ten of which comprise the story, the remaining ten of which are for “the real heads.” (As is series tradition, the story here is hopelessly dumb and I spent the entire game wishing it would go away. We’re back, baby!)</p><p><em>Super Monkey Ball</em> lives and dies by the strength of its level design. At its very best, each individual stage pushes you toward some new, minute understanding of the game’s physics, brutally ramping up difficulty in tandem. At its worst, you get something like <em>Super Monkey Ball 3D</em>, where every course is a flat, dinky, Denny’s kids’ menu maze that doesn’t teach you anything about anything, let alone itself. <em>Banana Rumble</em>, thankfully, falls into the former camp the vast majority of the time. A handful of stages are designed as brainteasers first and raw execution checks second, but even then, there’s an almost total lack of homogeneity. Levels feel distinct and, for the first time in I can’t remember how long, genuinely difficult. <em>Banana Rumble</em> actually<em> cares </em>about how you play it; it wants you to fastidiously consider every curve, edge, and gap in its geometry.</p><p>There’s one key addition to the game’s movement that fundamentally alters this relationship: the spin dash, a clear nod to Sonic the Hedgehog’s iconic maneuver of the same name. In <em>Sonic</em>, spin dashes let players effectively build momentum from a total standstill, the speed of their snap forward dependant on how many times a button is pressed in rapid succession. Prior to <em>Banana Rumble</em>’s release, I assumed its spin dash would function identically, and was worried. Much of <em>Super Monkey Ball</em>’s tension arises from the various ways it asks players to negotiate slopes, and the ability to quickly reverse course with a burst movement option would, if not negate that tension, diminish it considerably.</p><figure id="" data-id="a8f94c039aae6d57f823d40fba716c6e" data-recommend-id="image://a8f94c039aae6d57f823d40fba716c6e" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Monkeys in balls flying through a circle with numbers appearing all over." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Monkeys in balls flying through a circle with numbers appearing all over." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a8f94c039aae6d57f823d40fba716c6e" data-recommend-id="image://a8f94c039aae6d57f823d40fba716c6e" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Monkeys in balls flying through a circle with numbers appearing all over." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Luckily, the good folks at Sega were two steps ahead of me. The spin dash in <em>Banana Rumble</em> is a momentum extender, not a momentum generator. Try using it while stopped and it won’t send you anywhere. You need to be moving, and once you’ve built a bit of speed, you can use the spin dash to move way farther. A beautiful little nesting doll of commitments.</p><p>I’m still not sure this series really needs anything more than its fundamental control scheme. The purist in me wants to deride the spin dash, regardless of its implementation—why complicate something so pristine? But maybe I’m approaching this the wrong way. Maybe it isn’t a question of what <em>Super Monkey Ball</em> needs, but of what <em>Super Monkey Ball</em> wants. <em>Super Monkey Ball</em> needs a ball, a level and a timer like we need food, water and shelter. But what it <em>wants</em> is <em>momentum</em>. It wants you to delicately chain multiple precise inputs into seamless, buttery propulsion, and it wants you to invest in that propulsion. No time to renege; roll (yup) with it and see what happens. The spin dash aligns with this ethos perfectly. If this were the first <em>Super Monkey Ball</em> game, I’d probably want it to show up in all the future ones, too.</p><p>And it’s not like <em>Banana Rumble</em> doesn’t make good on the spin dash’s promise. Many levels are explicitly designed around it, and many more are subtly designed around it. Once I began using the dash more liberally, slingshotting simians through the air just to see where they’d end up, the game revealed its hand. There are shortcuts tucked into every nook and cranny of <em>Banana Rumble</em> if you know where to look. Working out alternate solutions to courses has always been one of the most rewarding challenges of <em>Super Monkey Ball</em>, and here we have a game built for it from the ground up. At times, these shortcuts can feel cheap, but for every level trivialized by the spin dash there are ten more that demand stringent, high-stakes applications of it.</p><figure id="" data-id="a05d1432ca348d8e2cec7f36f52c8af9" data-recommend-id="image://a05d1432ca348d8e2cec7f36f52c8af9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Four-player screenscreen Monkeyballing." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Four-player screenscreen Monkeyballing." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a05d1432ca348d8e2cec7f36f52c8af9" data-recommend-id="image://a05d1432ca348d8e2cec7f36f52c8af9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Four-player screenscreen Monkeyballing." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Rounding out <em>Banana Rumble</em>’s core modes are a number of multiplayer games, only a couple of which resemble past series staples. Gone are the likes of Monkey Golf, Monkey Bowling, Monkey Billiards, and—sigh—Monkey Target. Monkey Race (rebranded here as just “Race”) returns, alongside a few others that all scan as attempts to court the <em>Fall Guys </em>platformer-as-battle-royale audience. None of them are especially captivating, though I guess they automatically outclass <em>Fall Guys</em> by virtue of not making you feel like you’re swimming laps through a tar pit. I respect that these minigames all preserve and iterate upon <em>Banana Rumble</em>’s core movement (including the spin dash) instead of adopting entirely new control schemes (the standard in past <em>Super Monkey Ball</em>s), but they all come out the other end feeling a bit samey. Race, the most barebones, is also the best, for precisely that reason.</p><p>The real jewel here is multiplayer Adventure Mode, making a triumphant return (with online functionality to boot) after a decades-long absence. This was always one of the better showcases for the series’ versatility: put multiple people in the same course side-by-side and their approaches to it will almost immediately diverge in a thousand tiny ways. Skill makes a difference, sure, but personal expression moreso. With enough players, it’s a conversation.</p><h2 id="h559909"><a id=""></a><strong>The Potatoes</strong></h2><p>The original <em>Super Monkey Ball</em> is an arcade game. This is true both literally (the game first released as a cabinet several months before it landed on the GameCube) and structurally. Its progression systems demand knowledge of how its levels work not only individually, but together: avoiding a game over on higher difficulties means devising meticulous strategies that maximize both efficiency and banana accumulation (100 bananas grant an extra life, and the game has, for my money, one of the greatest 1-up sound effects in the medium). For instance, certain levels can be skipped with warp goals, but doing so may put your banana counter at a deficit—something you’ll regret when you’re teetering on the precipice of a wire-thin path with ten seconds on the clock and zero lives to spare. These competing tensions cultivate a holistic understanding of the game. Conquering it means conquering all of it.</p><p>2024’s <em>Banana Rumble</em> is not an arcade game, because arcade games don’t really get made anymore, and as with every <em>Super Monkey Ball</em> that’s not an arcade game, it works overtime to reshape and justify its design outside of an arcade framework. There are no game overs, because there are no lives. There are no high scores, because stages are played in isolation instead of as a group (with the exception of time attack mode, which I love, but it doesn’t do much to make the stages feel like they’re actually operating in concert). But the game still has bananas, and it still keeps track of your best times.</p><figure id="" data-id="51169ce534ad74a1cfbc947eccb636b1" data-recommend-id="image://51169ce534ad74a1cfbc947eccb636b1" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Finally a proper screenshot showing our ball as it appears in-game." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Finally a proper screenshot showing our ball as it appears in-game." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="51169ce534ad74a1cfbc947eccb636b1" data-recommend-id="image://51169ce534ad74a1cfbc947eccb636b1" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Finally a proper screenshot showing our ball as it appears in-game." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It solves this in two ways, the first of which is pretty crafty. Each level now has three sub-challenges (which the game dubs “missions”): a par time, a par banana count, and a single “golden banana” placed in a particularly tricky location. Depending on which one you tackle, your approach to the level will fundamentally change, in ways that <em>almost</em> recall the sensation of routing classic <em>Super Monkey Ball</em> difficulties. It’s somewhat disappointing that the game needs to prescribe these challenges in lieu of letting them emerge organically; on the other hand, it also means that each level effectively has three smaller levels folded into it, and I was consistently surprised and impressed by how much they required me to alter my gameplan.</p><p>The second solution is a bit clunkier. Instead of a traditional scoring system,<em> Banana Rumble </em>awards points based on story and mission completion. These points are primarily used as currency in an in-game cosmetics shop, where you can play dress-up with your characters, purchase new frames for photo mode, and just generally accomplish fuck all. This is, bluntly, meaningless, and I can’t help but feel ambivalent about the fact that most of the game’s progression terminates here, in something almost completely dislodged from the skills and knowledge it asks you to build elsewhere. <em>Banana Rumble</em> dangles the carrot and then reveals that it’s actually cotton candy; the last thing a game this lean needs is empty calories.</p><figure id="" data-id="6618fc3c5a26852ba0d2efc9fbdd0a15" data-recommend-id="image://6618fc3c5a26852ba0d2efc9fbdd0a15" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The sadly inevitable clothing customization screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The sadly inevitable clothing customization screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6618fc3c5a26852ba0d2efc9fbdd0a15" data-recommend-id="image://6618fc3c5a26852ba0d2efc9fbdd0a15" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The sadly inevitable clothing customization screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>We’ve established what <em>Super Monkey Ball</em> needs; we’ve established what <em>Super Monkey Ball</em> wants; now, finally, we arrive at the million dollar question. What do <em>I</em> want? On some level, I know I just want the first <em>Super Monkey Ball</em>. I want elegantly paced arcade modes and intrinsically meaningful scoring systems and an unvarnished, elemental control scheme. I <em>don’t</em> want partitioned stages or games-as-a-service-adjacent cosmetics shops or a dozen different characters with unique stat spreads.</p><p>But these are all trees; what about the forest? What precisely about <em>Super Monkey Ball</em> makes me return to it day after day, year after year? The answer is embarrassingly simple: it’s a fun video game. What I really want when I play <em>Super Monkey Ball</em> is to play a fun goddamn video game. And what better choice? <em>Super Monkey Ball</em> is the stripped down essence of fun video games. It lets you do one thing, and that thing is fun, to the greatest extent that any one thing in a video game could be.</p><p><em>Banana Rumble</em> is fun. I love playing it. I thought I was mostly <em>done</em> playing it until, about 300 words into this review, something unexpected happened: I got The Itch. I’d beaten all the levels, but I wanted to beat them again. I wanted to take a crack at the missions, which I’d largely dismissed as frivolous on my first run. I wanted to go for some records in time attack, especially pre-release, when the sparse competition would all but guarantee me a spot in the top 5. (As of right now, 6:03 a.m. on June 23rd, 2024, I have <em>Giant Bomb</em>’s Dan Ryckert beaten by two seconds on the world 1 leaderboards. Dan, if you’re reading this: your move.) The game <em>works</em>, in all the ways I expect it to. Maybe not in all the ways I want it to, but so what? <em>Banana Rumble</em> doesn’t need to be perfect. It just needs to be good. And for <em>Super Monkey Ball</em>, “perfect” and “good” are very nearly the same thing.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On January 28, 1986, one of the biggest disasters in NASA history occurred when the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded 73 seconds into its flight. All seven crew members on board were killed in the first fatal in-flight accident in US spacecraft history. Now, 38 years later, the Challenger tragedy has been used in promotional art for military combat game War Thunder.</p>



<p>It was <a href="https://forum.warthunder.com/t/noticed-a-little-something/119652" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first spotted by players</a> who compared the explosion in the art to that of the Challenger. What stood out is the distinct look of the shape of the smoke and debris when it happened. It featured smoking debris falling from the sky along with an angled “cloud” that’s easily recognizable to those who’ve seen the footage or images. </p>



<p>Many assumed it was an AI-generated image that was used for the key art for the game. However, it appears that it was done manually.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Developer Gaijin Entertainment acknowledged that the explosion in the image was, in fact, that of the Challenger explosion. The game’s community manager magazine2 says it was part of a “aerial explosion reference pack”.</p>



<p>“Hey guys, we have accidentally used the explosion from the Challenger disaster in one of our key art images,” they said. “Please accept our sincere apologies for this, the picture was part of an aerial explosion reference pack used by our artists and the context was lost.</p>



<p>“We’ll be altering this artwork as soon as we can and will take measures to ensure that this doesn’t repeat again in the future.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Gaijin Entertainment for comment on how an oversight like this was allowed to happen. A response has yet to be received as of publishing.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-mods-have-begun-and-yes-most-make-it-easier<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a> DLC <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> is just a few days old but, predictably, mods for the expansion have already started coming in.</p><p>Most of the mods targeting Shadow of the Erdtree on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring?tab=popular+%2830+days%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nexus Mods</a> right now make the expansion easier. That’s no surprise, given the reaction so far. As IGN has reported, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree-down-to-mixed-on-steam-as-players-complain-about-the-difficulty-and-performance">Steam user reviews currently have a ‘mixed’ rating after a flood of complaints about the rock hard bosses as well as PC performance issues</a>.</p><p>Belger’s ‘<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/5247" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Easy Shadow of the Erdtree</a>’ mod, for example, decreases all enemy damage in the DLC by around 25%. “Many players complain about enemies in SOTE dealing too much damage,” Belger said in the mod description, “so if that’s your case, you can try this mod that lowers it significantly.”</p><p>Belger added that their mod can also be used by players to learn boss patterns without dying so often. They can then uninstall the mod and take on Shadow of the Erdtree’s rock hard bosses “the way FromSoftware intended.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree DLC Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Elsewhere, existing mods for the base game were updated to work with Shadow of the Erdtree. For example, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/138" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CheezeOfAstora’s mod</a> lets players recover runes immediately upon death, so there’s no need to go to the exact spot of death to recover the runes. This is “not an easy mode,” CheezeOfAstora insisted. Syyyke’s ‘<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/5216" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">All in One Cheat Version</a>’ very much is an easy mode, however.</p><p>Older Elden Ring mods that make the game easier are also seeing renewed interest now Shadow of the Erdtree is out in the wild, including <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/5178" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GreyEnigma’s effort</a> that reduces grinding by giving you various helpful items. And here’s a useful mod: byDelamain’s ‘<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/5181" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DLC Ready Save File</a>’ lets players skip <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/How_to_Prepare_for_the_Shadow_of_the_Erdtree_DLC">Shadow of the Erdtree's boss kill requirements</a>.</p><p>Elden Ring modders, then, are stepping in to help with what many are saying is the hardest experience FromSoftware has ever created. Ahead of Shadow of the Erdtree’s release, director Hidetaka Miyazaki signaled the DLC would significantly test players’ abilities. "The new challenges for the player are going to be the boss encounters as well as the different kinds of threats that the world will impose on people," Miyazaki told <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/elden-ring-creator-hidetaka-miyazaki-talks-shadow-of-the-erdtree-new-weapons-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>CNET</u></a>. Some of these bosses are aimed at players who've completed most of the base Elden Ring, meaning FromSoftware has "kind of really pushed the envelope in terms of what we think can be withstood by the player," he added.</p><p>If you don’t want to go down the mod route, we believe <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/psa-shadow-of-the-erdtrees-scadutree-blessings-are-the-answer-to-elden-ring-dlcs-difficulty"><u>Shadow of the Erdtree's Scadutree Blessings are the answer to the Elden Ring DLC's difficulty</u></a> (Scadutree Blessing bolsters the recipient's abilities to deal and negate damage). You can check our guide to <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Shadow_of_the_Erdtree_Scadutree_Fragment_Locations"><u>track down every last Scadutree Fragment</u></a>.</p><p>Shadow of the Erdtree has certainly enjoyed critical acclaim, and has become the highest-rated video game expansion of all-time after overtaking Witcher 3 DLC Blood and Wine on Metacritic. IGN’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review"><u>Shadow of the Erdtree review</u></a> returned a 10/10. We said: “Like the base game did before it, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree raises the bar for single-player DLC expansions. It takes everything that made the base game such a landmark RPG, condenses it into a relatively compact 20-25 hour campaign, and provides fantastic new challenges for heavily invested fans to chew on.”</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-showrunners-confirm-robert-house-for-season-2.909594/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-showrunners-confirm-robert-house-for-season-2<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Many of our lead characters are Vegas-bound."</h2></div><section><p>Prime Video’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/tv/fallout-the-series">Fallout TV show</a> ended with a clear nod to a much-loved Fallout video game, but there are still many questions left unanswered by Season 1. One thing we do know now is that a major character from the games — and who only makes a brief appearance in Season 1 — will play a part in Season 2.</p><p><em><strong>Warning:</strong></em><em> Spoilers for Fallout Season 1 follow.</em></p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/fallout-season-1-finale-explainer-1236044450/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, showrunners Graham Wagner and Geneva Robertson-Dworet confirmed Robert House “will be involved” in Season 2. Fallout video game fans know Robert House as Mr. House, one of the main characters in Obsidian’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout New Vegas</a>. In that game, Mr. House runs New Vegas as a brain plugged into a supercomputer that has extended his existence from the pre-war era into the post-war era.</p><p>Robert House makes a cameo appearance in the Fallout TV show during a pre-war scene in which the then RobCo Industries boss plots with Vault-Tec management and the heads of other companies to not only survive the inevitable nuclear apocalypse, but maybe even trigger it.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Fallout TV Show Video Game Easter Eggs – Companies</h3></div></output><p>“Many of our lead characters are Vegas-bound,” Wagner said. “Las Vegas in the world of Fallout is Robert House’s town. Robert House will be involved in Season 2.”</p><p>Season 1 ends with a Power Armor-clad Overseer Hank stomping towards New Vegas, with The Ghoul and Lucy MacLean in hot pursuit. Wagner’s tease suggests newly knighted Brotherhood of Steel member Maximus will also end up in New Vegas. All roads, then, lead to a post-apocalyptic showdown on what's left of The Strip.</p><p>The question is, what form will Robert House take in Season 2? Will the TV show follow New Vegas’ lead and have the character star as a 200-year-old consciousness kept alive by machines? Or will the showrunners come up with some other way to have Robert House knocking about Vegas during this point in the Fallout timeline? After all, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-did-moldaver-survive-for-over-200-years-in-fallout-fans-have-theories">the mystery of how New California Republic chief Moldaver survived for over 200 years</a> remains unresolved.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/24/screenshot-2024-06-24-121514-1719227754798.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Robert House as he appears briefly in Fallout Season 1. Image credit: Prime Video.</figcaption></figure></output><p>As the showrunners have said before, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/with-fallout-season-2-confirmed-we-know-at-least-one-iconic-monster-will-make-its-debut">they would have loved to have squeezed Fallout’s iconic Deathclaw into Season 1</a>, but couldn’t manage it due to having to establish the world. But deathclaws are also confirmed for Season 2, and like so much of Fallout Season 1, they won’t be CGI.</p><p>“To be honest, the deathclaw is an element we were troubled by not finding the right space for it in season one, and we very deliberately wanted to box ourselves in,” Wagner admitted. “And sometimes, as writers, you do that. You set yourself a challenge and you just say, ‘Well, now we got to.</p><p>“So, that actually has helped us a lot because we’re already developing ways, iterating ways to actually get the deathclaw up on its feet. Make it the most cool and impactful thing and it actually has given us the runway so we’re not just delivering a script and saying, ‘Oh, God, there’s a deathclaw.’ It’s like, ‘We know there is a deathclaw, so get ready.; These things take a lot of iterating, a lot of time to do it and to do it right versus just having it be a CG squiggle running across the screen.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I like taking side trips and just exploring something that was mentioned in passing and making a thing out of it.</p></div><p>The final tease comes from Walton Goggins, who expertly plays Ghoul/Cooper. He suggested the Ghoul will once again get side-tracked in Season 2, as he did while dragging Lucy around the wasteland in Season 1.</p><p>“There are mysteries from Season 1, there are things that seem benign but may carry weight in Season 2, and things that are worth dedicating an episode to that seem outside of the overall trajectory of this experience. I like taking side trips and just exploring something that was mentioned in passing and making a thing out of it. And I know Graham and Geneva and Jonah [Nolan] are down for that too. So we’ll see what happens.”</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/whats-the-snake-oil-salesmans-mysterious-serum-in-the-fallout-tv-show-fans-have-theories"><u>Fans have plenty of theories about the Snake Oil Salesman’s mysterious serum</u></a>, for example.

<p>Fortnite is arguably the best game for collaborations, bringing characters, worlds, and much more from many franchises to this battle royale title. The next Fortnite collaboration is with Pirates of the Caribbean, bringing skins, emotes, and more from Disney’s sea-faring franchise. Reliable leakers such as <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1804393861994647818" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HYPEX</a> and <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1804381938213372193" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ShiinaBR</a> have posted nonstop about this collaboration since Saturday, June 22, and we finally have a release date. Learn more details below.&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-me-hearties">Me Hearties</h2>



<p>On June 22, we were treated to a surprise from reliable Fortnite leakers HYPEX and ShiinaBR. They detailed the features of the Fortnite x Pirates of the Caribbean collaboration, leaking details such as the <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1804383340985790912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1804383340985790912%7Ctwgr%5Ee72c79a55e47e49eb864580f59a1430cdc9482e0%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurogamer.net%2Ffortnites-pirates-of-the-caribbean-crossover-launches-next-month" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">loading screen</a>, a mini pass, the Jack Sparrow skin and much more. </p>



<p>To everyone’s surprise, Epic made the Pirates of the Caribbean mini-pass go live on the Fortnite Item Shop soon after these tweets without any prior announcements. Unsurprisingly, the mini-pass listing was promptly removed from the store. However, many players had already purchased it in the meantime, adding to the excitement and anticipation.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Pirates of the Caribbean mini-pass, titled Cursed Sailed Pass, was unexpectedly offered to the players before its intended release date. The players who managed to buy the pass in that time unlocked the Jack Sparrow skin. </p>



<p>However, they couldn’t progress further in the past. The official Fortnite Status account had to clarify the situation, stating that the players who bought the pass before the intended release date can only use the Jack Sparrow skin until it officially arrives. Interestingly, the Fortnite Status account also confirmed that the planned release date for the Cursed Sails Pass is July 19, 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>For players who purchased the Cursed Sails Pass ahead of its intended release on July 19, please note you are currently unable to progress the Pass until the start of the event, but will retain your Jack Sparrow outfit in the meantime.</p><p>If you wish to instead refund this purchase… <a href="https://t.co/i3FdtuNSLW">pic.twitter.com/i3FdtuNSLW</a></p></div>— Fortnite Status (@FortniteStatus) <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteStatus/status/1804535483571007684?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 22, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>According to the leaks, the Cursed Sails Pass is set to include a treasure trove of in-game items. These include Jack’s Sword pickaxe, Jack’s Compass back bling, a Cursed variation of the Jack Sparrow Skin, Jar of Dirt emote, Sparrow Run emote, Pirate’s Grin emoticon, a banner icon, and 4 level tokens. Each item is designed to bring a touch of Pirates of the Caribbean magic to your Fortnite experience.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you aren’t happy about the waiting time for the Pass to go live and wish to refund your purchase and return the Jack Sparrow skin, you can contact the <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">player support team</a>. In other Fortnite news, their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-new-reload-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Reload game mode</a> just went live recently, and their esports tournaments will no longer be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-esports-tournaments-will-not-be-region-locked-anymore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">region-locked</a>.&nbsp;</p>

Inspired by Chinese lion dances, it turns out that this boss is actually two dudes in a coat masquerading as a monster and not some horrible abomination dreamt up by its creators. It's just like all those kids in Saturday-morning cartoons pretending to be adults when they hid themselves under a trenchcoat and combined their height to sneak past concert security.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO8vEHspEdE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dO8vEHspEdE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As discovered by YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@bonfirevn" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BonfireVN</a> (via <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elden-ring-dlcs-fearsome-dancing-lion-boss-is-just-two-big-dudes-in-a-suit-124451502.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Endgadget</a>), Divine Beast Dancing Lion is comprised of one person in the front who attacks while pantomiming as a monster, while another crouched enemy in the rear controls the body. This is pretty accurate to how real-life Chinese lion dancers perform, and From Software went so far as to animate both of the deadly dancers beneath the costume. It turns out that not everything has to be a grotesque monster after all.

        <p>"This reporting is categorically not true," a spokesperson told us</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>GAME has denied reports that it will stop selling physical games.</p>
<p>Earlier today, <a href="https://www.gfinityesports.com/news/game-ending-in-store-video-game-sales/">Gfinity</a> reported that the UK retailer was planning to only sell physical games and hardware via pre-orders online, to be collected in-store or delivered to consumers.</p>
<p>"This reporting is categorically not true," a spokesperson told <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em>. "GAME continues to support the physical gaming market, offering a wide-range of physical games, hardware, software, accessories, and digital gift cards, in store and online."</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the UK games retailer <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/game-drops-xbox-all-access-and-reward-scheme">dropped its reward scheme and Xbox All Access</a>. In January, GAME began <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/uk-chain-game-to-exit-pre-owned-business">phasing out trade-ins and the sale of pre-owned games</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/game-we-will-be-the-last-man-standing-in-physical-video-games">Speaking with <em>GamesIndustry.biz </em>last June</a>, managing director Nick Arran said the retailer "will be the last man standing selling physical games."</p>
<p>"We see our place in the market as proving that there is a place for physical, whether that be the collector's editions, which we see as the vinyl of games, or the gifter who doesn't want to wrap up a download code for Christmas."</p>

			<p>A new Bioshock Unreal Engine 5 fan concept video has been released, featuring Bioshock-themed environment art within Epic's game engine.</p>
<p>We've covered quite a bit of Unreal Engine 5 videos since the engine's release back in 2022, but we wanted to share this one as well as it comes from a former art designer on Microsoft's Halo Infinite, and the more recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/immortals-of-aveum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Immortals of Aveum</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-aeternum-qa-amazon-confirms-amd-fsr-hdr-support-and-keyboard-mouse-option-for-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon's New World</a> - &nbsp;<a href="https://www.artstation.com/kalebnek" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kaleb Nekumanesh</a>. As said, this nearly five-minute-long fan concept was created using Unreal Engine 5 using Megascans as well as custom models, materials, decals, and marketplace assets. It's an impressive video that shows what a modern-day Bioshock could like look. Check it out below, and tell us what you think below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Bioshock Themed Ambience - Unreal Engine 5 Environment Art" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_5P-mniYghI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As an artist, Nekumanesh worked on various high-profile games, including Halo Infinite (Level Design and Gameplay Design), New World (Terrain and POI Artist), and Immortals of Aveum.</p>
<p>2007's Bioshock is being considered as one of the best games ever created. Some consider Bioshock 2 to be the better shooting game, but many would agree that the original Bioshock has the better story, atmosphere, and characters. As most of you will know, Bioshock creator Ken Levine is currently<a href="https://wccftech.com/judas-is-finally-unveiled-by-bioshock-creator-ken-levine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> working on Judas</a>, which will have resemblances with Bioshock when it comes to weaponry and powers.</p>
<p>As for the Bioshock series - back in 2019, 2K <a href="https://wccftech.com/cloud-chamber-taking-care-of-the-next-bioshock-game-2k-reveals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finally confirmed</a> that a new entry in the franchise is in the works at developer Cloud Chamber. 2K President David Ismailer said, <em>"As we continue growing our product portfolio, we remain inspired by opportunities to invest further in our valuable IP, great people and their collective, long-term potential. BioShock is one of the most beloved, critically praised and highest-rated franchises of the last console generation. We can’t wait to see where its powerful narrative and iconic, first-person shooter gameplay head in the future with our new studio team at Cloud Chamber leading the charge."</em></p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24184636/diablo-4-season-5-ptr-quest-line-infernal-hordes</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/you-might-need-to-unlock-a-new-difficulty-level-to-get-the-most-from-diablo-4%E2%80%99s-season-5.909552/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24184636/diablo-4-season-5-ptr-quest-line-infernal-hordes<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="SxoxHP">Blizzard <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-gb/diablo4/24111472/the-diablo-iv-season-5-ptr-what-you-need-to-know">has given a fairly comprehensive picture</a> of what to expect from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24157377/diablo-4-season-4-loot-reborn-impressions"><em>Diablo 4</em></a>’s fifth season in advance of a weeklong test on the game’s Public Test Realm (PTR).</p>
<p id="oE28Dm">The as-yet-untitled season 5, which begins on Aug. 6, will offer a new quest line that sounds as if it will lead into <em>Vessel of Hatred</em>, <em>Diablo 4</em>’s first full expansion, which launches on Oct. 8. The main new feature will be a new wave-based gameplay mode, the Infernal Hordes, culminating in an endgame boss battle with multiple variations. The Unique item tier is getting an overhaul to make it more impactful, and new combos of weapon type and character class are being opened up.</p>
<p id="5tUIkU">There’s a slightly higher bar to clear to access the quest line and the Infernal Hordes this time. Previous seasons have required the player to complete <em>Diablo 4</em>’s campaign on one character to start the seasonal quest line. For season 5, you’ll need to enter the World Tier 3 difficulty to start the quest line. This means completing the campaign, reaching at least level 48, and then beating the Cathedral of Light “capstone” dungeon on World Tier 2. Most of the game’s dedicated players will have done all this a long time ago, but newer players brought in by the recent Game Pass launch or the excellent fourth season might want to go tick it off now.</p>
<p id="QEAbwx">Unlike the game’s first three seasons, however, which introduced new gameplay concepts for the length of the season only, it seems Blizzard is intent on making permanent additions and changes to <em>Diablo 4</em> with season 5, as it did with season 4. The new quest line will be available on both Seasonal and Eternal realms, and will remain on the Eternal Realm after the end of season 5. Blizzard’s description of season 5’s storyline — “enemies are cut-down, alliances shift, and unlikely friends emerge from the shadows” — sounds as if it might be setting the scene for <em>Vessel of Hatred</em>, a suspicion further supported by the quest’s permanent nature.</p>
<p id="vBphh7">Infernal Hordes are unlocked at the end of the storyline and are intended to be a permanent new endgame activity to site alongside the Pit of Artificers dungeon introduced in season 4. In this mode, players enter Hell itself to defeat 90-second waves of enemies and collect Burning Aether to spend on loot and other rewards at the end of the run. In between each wave, players will choose from three Infernal Offers, which add gameplay modifiers to increase the difficulty and reward of each run.</p>
<p id="FcC5uo">Survive the Infernal Hordes and you will battle three of the five members of the Fell Council, corrupted priests from <em>Diablo 2</em> who have become champions of Mephisto, the Lord of Hatred (and the main antagonist of <em>Vessel of Hatred</em>).</p>
<div id="9KD2np"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D-LVOWgIuo0?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="eGYSgo">There are a ton of further changes, quality-of-life updates, and balance fixes to delve into in the full <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-gb/diablo4/24111472/the-diablo-iv-season-5-ptr-what-you-need-to-know#Notes">patch notes</a> for the season 5 PTR and in the developers’ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-LVOWgIuo0">campfire chat</a> stream. Highlights include: an overhaul of Unique items intended to make them more powerful, and to encourage players to change their character builds around them; the ultra-rare Uber Uniques now become Mythic Uniques, with their own item color and even drop sound; and new weapon types have been opened up for some classes, with Necromancers able to use maces and axes, Sorcerers able to use one-handed swords and maces, and Druids getting some new options, too.</p>
<p id="EQpWQ1">The PTR is available for PC players using Blizzard’s Battle.net launcher only, and the season 5 test runs for a week from tomorrow, Tuesday June 25. Season 5 begins on Aug. 6, and runs for a briefer-than-usual two months until season 6 begins alongside the launch of <em>Vessel of Hatred</em> on Oct. 8.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/predatory-tactics-in-gaming-are-worse-than-you-think<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When we think of predatory tactics in gaming, we often imagine deceptive UX designs, intrusive ads, or aggressive microtransactions. However, there are more insidious tactics that are rarely discussed, mainly because a lot of resources are spent hiding them to avoid backlash or even legal issues.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As a player, have you ever felt like some games are intentionally making you lose or win? That there is an invisible hand manipulating the odds against you? That the game keeps holding you back despite investing money to progress faster? That you’re playing with different rules than others? While you might just be paranoid or unlucky, you could also be right.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I want to shed light on a tactic that involves collecting data as you play, feeding this data into complex algorithms and models that then alter the rules of your game under the hood to optimize spending opportunities. This tactic is known by terms like ‘dynamic balancing,’ ‘personalization,’ ‘segmentation,’ and ‘targeting.’ Although these concepts are not new, the extent to which they impact modern games might surprise you. And it is often obfuscated behind manipulated randomness so that players don’t realize how much they are being conned.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/mmo-dev-fined-record-breaking-dollar9-million-fee-for-misleading-players-over-microtransactions/">In the beginning of this year, Nexon was fined $9 million for manipulating the odds of their loot boxes to optimize spending opportunities.</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> In live-service games, manipulating randomness as Nexon did is </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>not</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> an exception; it’s the norm. Many if not most studios operating live games do it to varying degrees (allegedly sometimes with good intentions, not all studios or F2P games are predatory) and a $9 million fine is nothing when your game’s lifetime revenue exceeds 5 billions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In essence, a live game is a software with thousands of variables, such as the difficulty of a level, the odds in loot boxes, or the price of an offer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When you play online, every single interaction can be tracked, such as how much money you spend, how long your play sessions are, or how good you are at the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This data is analyzed and processed through various algorithms that can then change the variables in your game on the fly, putting you in situations where you’re more likely to spend. For instance, if you are progressing faster than the game wants you to, it might subtly become harder or reduce the chances of getting certain rewards. If you’re a big spender, the game might increase the price of offers you see. And this happens way more often than you think.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It constantly adapts to your playing and spending behavior to keep you in what it considers the sweet spot of challenge and frustration. And it doesn’t care if it’s unfair, discriminatory, or predatory.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now, you might think, "If this were true, players would compare their game states and complain." This is where manipulated randomness comes into play, making it very difficult for the average player to notice or prove. When you can’t get that one random loot or win a level because the right gems don't appear, how can you prove the odds are skewed instead of you just being unlucky?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">TL;DR:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you’re playing a live service game, especially on mobile or a free-to-play game, there's a good chance that:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Winning or losing has little to do with your skill or luck; the outcome is decided before you even press the play button.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The randomness is manipulated. In match-3 games, for example, the gems may seem pre-generated or random, while in reality algorithms carefully choose the next gems to appear after each interaction to guarantee a near-loss or near-win situation when you run out of moves.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The disclosed odds are fake.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Spending money can backfire on you and actually make your game harder. A classic example is </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/activision-patents-reveal-sbmm-systems-potentially-used-in-modern-warfare-1296757/">SBMM matchmaking</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in pvp games: if you spend money to make your character more powerful, you may initially face weaker opponents to feel empowered, but over time you'll be matched against players who have also spent a lot and are equally or more powerful than you.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These games are designed to keep you in the frustration zone forever, regardless of how much money you spend. You can never truly "win" the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Dynamic balancing also means that every player faces different difficulties and different sets of rules, which is the opposite of traditional games or sports where everyone plays by the same rules, or at least the rules are transparent for everyone.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And this also reflected in the structure and roles of teams that operate live games, where it’s not uncommon to have more data scientists, data analysts, product managers, monetization managers, even psychologists to analyze players and refine these algorithms than creative people who produce the actual content of the game. And don’t get me wrong, data and monetization professions are needed for a functioning business, but when the creative people become a tiny percentage of the whole team (or decision owners), this shapes the game in a very different direction.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="How Do I Define ‘Predatory’?">How Do I Define ‘Predatory’?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A common mistake is to blame the tools rather than the intention behind their use. Loot boxes, for example, aren’t inherently predatory; they can add an exciting and rewarding surprise element when balanced with noble intentions. Even dynamic balancing or manipulated randomness can enhance player experience. In some card games, the odds of opening a pack are manipulated in favor of the player, such as slightly increasing the chance of getting a legendary card every time you don’t get one. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>[Insert overwatch1lootbox image next to this paragraph]</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So the intention matters most. When designing a battle pass, a designer must answer questions like "How much faster should a premium player progress compared to a F2P player?" and "How long should it take for a player to finish the battle pass?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I’ve seen designers balance it fairly, like by requiring 30 minutes of daily play to complete the free track or $5 to unlock the premium pass. But, I’ve also seen designers create an illusion of achievability by giving lots of free progress early on but then locking the juicy prize behind a $50 paywall or a ridiculous amount of grind, which is designed to frustrate 98% of players and milk the 2% whales.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="It Has Nuances">It Has Nuances</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And it's up to players and studios to define where their red line is. 3 examples to illustrate that point:</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Loot Boxes Odds">Loot Boxes Odds</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Loot boxes can have transparent, honest odds. But in more pernicious games, the odds change under the hood based on your game state. For example, you might have better odds after spending money or returning from a period of inactivity. Loot boxes can even have disclosed but fake odds, with collectables locked behind hidden conditions. You might spend thousands of $ trying to get a specific reward, without realizing that this collectible has in fact a 0% chance to drop, because it has a hidden condition that will only include it in the loot table 2 weeks from now (to prevent players from collecting everything Day 1).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Laws that force developers to disclose the odds can be easily circumvented by generalizing the type of rewards. If it says ‘2% chances to get a rare card’, it could indeed give you a rare card with 2% chances, simply not the one it doesn’t want you to get.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And remember that any variable can be personalized, for example by skewing odds for whales while keeping them true for 98% of players, it muddies the water if players try to pull the numbers.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="BOTs in Multiplayer Games">BOTs in Multiplayer Games</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Adding BOTs can ensure a smooth onboarding experience in multiplayer games, but it can also be used perniciously. In Moba ‘coop vs AI’, it’s clear that you’re battling BOTs for the sake of practicing. In many other games, like battle royale, weak BOTs are disguised as real players to trick you into thinking that you’re crushing it. It can go further, by making these fake-players difficult to beat unless you spend money, or even masquerading them as your Facebook friend on a leaderboard to create fake rivalry. If you’ve ever wondered why your auntie Nadine was top of the leaderboard at 4 AM on that old facebook game, it’s because it wasn’t her.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Charging Players Different Prices">Charging Players Different Prices</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Live games offer personalized deals, and as a rule of thumb, the more money you spend, the more expensive these offers get. Where it becomes even more shady is when these deals offer the same reward value, but for very different prices, sometimes by a large magnitude. Player A who is a non spender will get a ‘deal’ to buy a unique skin for 5$, while Player B, who is a whale will get a ‘deal’ to buy the same unique skin for 20$.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another developer stated:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>‘Well, we ended up with a model that basically targeted members of the Saudi royal family and charged them 100x what regular players would pay for the same microtransaction, and it worked..’</span></span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Shall we do it?">Shall we do it?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As a studio or developer, I believe it’s crucial to define your red lines, as less ethical people will always try to leave the morals out of the equation, ultimately worsening the game quality and the studio culture.</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Does it hurt the player experience for the sake of making more money?</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Is the information transparent?</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Is the information dishonest?</span></p></div></li><li></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Is it targeting vulnerable people?</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Put simply, as a developer, I ask myself "Would I be OK with it if this was done to me?".</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unfortunately, for a lot of decision owners, the "Shall we do it?" often turns into "How can we hide it better?"</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Dynamic Balancing">Dynamic Balancing</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To understand why dynamic balancing is such a powerful monetization tool and why studios invest heavily in fine-tuning it, we first need to examine how typical F2P games generate revenue.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In F2P games, players engage with various systems where they make progress over time. Occasionally, a spike in difficulty slows this progression. To overcome these obstacles, players can either grind or pay to reduce the challenge, effectively buying time. This intentional difficulty spike, known as the "pinch," is designed to frustrate players just enough to encourage them to spend money, but not so much that they quit the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To maximize revenue, there are two main challenges to address.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The first challenge is ensuring the balance between difficulty and player progress is just right. Various factors, such as skill, experience, playstyle, and the amount of money already invested, can influence this balance. If the game is too easy for them, Player A, who has a lot of experience and has already invested money to become more efficient, may not feel the need to spend money. If it's too hard, Player B, who is inexperienced and a non-spender may become overly frustrated and quit.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">F2P games do not let players choose their own difficulty levels because this would undermine the game's monetization strategy. Instead, they dynamically adjust the difficulty based on data collected from players, ensuring each player remains in the optimal zone of frustration and challenge. The game creates the illusion that players are in control, while in reality, much of the experience is predetermined.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a RPG, Player A might receive worse loot than player B.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">In a match-3 game, Player A might see less objective gem than player B</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">In a shooter, Player A might have slightly smaller hitboxes than player B</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The key is to always keep these changes as discreet as possible, often using manipulated randomness.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The second challenge is related to the concept of "spending depth"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Only a small percentage of players are willing to pay. It's much easier to extract money from these spenders than to convince non-spenders to start paying.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you're a player willing to spend $10,000 on a game, the game needs to give you reasons to spend more even after you've already invested $5,000.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In games with linear progression, spending $100 on resources boosts your progress, putting you ahead of the difficulty curve and reducing your need to spend for a long time, and it isn't efficient when targeting high-spenders.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This can be addressed through exponential progression or… dynamic balancing. For example, if a player spends $100, the game lets them enjoy their power-spike for a while, but it soon adjusts the difficulty to match their new progression level.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Again, adaptive difficulty and manipulated randomness have been used in games for a long time and are not always bad. The experience can become more enjoyable when it subtly becomes easier after repeated failures, or when you’re matched against opponents with similar skill levels.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But in F2P live games, it’s often predatory for a combination of reasons:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Making money has priority over the player experience.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Lack of Transparency: Players are unaware that many game variables are adjusted on the fly and differ from other players' experiences.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Players cannot opt out of these adjustments.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Many live games feature social elements like tournaments. It's as if regular players unknowingly compete and spend money to play against opponents with an aimbot.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Players' spending can backfire. It’s as if, when playing Monopoly, spending $5 to guarantee a six on a dice roll would result in the game subtly increasing property prices to maintain the challenge.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With live games increasingly borrowing predatory tactics from casinos, we can even imagine&nbsp; that content creators could be sponsored to play games with manipulated odds, showcasing shiny rewards and ‘insane luck’&nbsp; to encourage their communities to spend money.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What Can We Do About It?">What Can We Do About It?</h2><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="As a player">As a player</h3><div data-component="basic-list"><ol data-testid="basic-list-ordered"><li><div data-testid="content-paragraph"><p><span data-testid="content-text">Be aware: Understand that randomness in games is often manipulated and personalized. Investing money might not give you as much of an advantage as you think, and be aware that your game experience can differ significantly from other players.</span></p></div></li><li><div data-testid="content-paragraph"><p><span data-testid="content-text">If a game studio you once cherished starts using more predatory tactics, don't expect it to revert to its previous ethical standards. The developers who opposed such tactics have left or lost their influence. If a studio backtracks due to backlash, they may often just try to hide their tactics better.</span></p></div></li><li><div data-testid="content-paragraph"><p><span data-testid="content-text">Support ethical studios: Choose to support game studios that align with your values</span></p></div></li><li></li></ol></div><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="As a developer">As a developer</h3><div data-component="basic-list"><ol data-testid="basic-list-ordered"><li><div data-testid="content-paragraph"><p><span data-testid="content-text">Advocate for transparency: Transparency is crucial for healthy studios and games.

If a tactic conflicts with your values, it is fair to openly challenge it.</span></p></div></li></ol></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But ultimately, I believe this can only be solved through creating and enforcing legislation.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Legislative Solutions">Legislative Solutions</h4><div data-component="basic-list"><ol data-testid="basic-list-ordered"><li><div data-testid="content-paragraph"><p><span data-testid="content-text">More user control over data: Ensure players have more control over the data collected while playing. Currently, opting out of data collection usually refers to personal data like country or name, not the data related to your playing and spending behaviors used for dynamic balancing.</span></p></div></li><li><div data-testid="content-paragraph"><p><span data-testid="content-text">Enforce full transparency: Many tactics are predatory because they are purposely obfuscated. Just as casinos must disclose their machine algorithms to third parties, large live games could be subject to similar transparency.</span></p></div></li><li><div data-testid="content-paragraph"><p><span data-testid="content-text">Licensing for game studios: Implement licensing for larger game studios to operate live games, with the possibility of revoking licenses if they breach contracts.</span></p></div></li><li><div data-testid="content-paragraph"><p><span data-testid="content-text">Spending limits: Many predatory practices target "whales" who spend thousands of dollars monthly. Implementing spending limits as China did could also be a solution.</span></p></div></li><li><div data-testid="content-paragraph"><p><span data-testid="content-text">Increase fines: Increase penalties for unethical practices. A 9 million fine isn't doing much when the game generated </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>5 billions.</span></span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Mandatory offline modes: Require standard game states or offline modes.</span></p></div></li></ol></div><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Closing words"><span>Closing words</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Many modern live games are not just gambling machines disguised as video games, they are often rigged on top of it, not so different from carnival games that set you up to lose.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">My intent here is not to blame specific games or studios, but to highlight the root of predatory tactics to help players recognize them and encourage developers to speak out. While some developers might not mind working for studios that use these tactics—especially given the high pay and benefits that often go with them— when you’re driven by passion, it's not great to work on a project knowing it’s meant to trick children or seniors into spending money, it's not great to see talented colleagues leave or stop caring because their ethics no longer align with studio practices. It's not great to pour years of your life into crafting art, code, design only to see your craft being torn apart by players because of how greedy the monetization is.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I talked with community managers who burned out because they had to defend predatory tactics they were not responsible for. And I see the hypocrisy of studios that like to brag about how inclusive they are,&nbsp; while simultaneously using the most unethical ways to milk their players. It's almost as if ethics matter as long as they don’t make you lose money.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And I wish, we developers would challenge these practices more often in our studios or in the industry. If an artist or a writer produces something controversial, a lot of colleagues rightfully feel they should speak against it. But when someone in charge of the monetization decides it’s okay to scam elderly or children, surprisingly, very few people dare to speak against them, often because there is no room for debates, or because the other developers might not even be aware of how predatory their own game can be.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A quick glance at this year’s GDC conference, the largest event for developers, reveals how little we address this issue. Among hundreds of sessions and a whole advocacy category, I found a</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/dark-patterns-shining-a-light-on-unlawful-game-design/900015"> single session that explicitly focuses on unethical tactics.</a></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I believe it deserves more attention, games-as-a-service become the norm, and these tactics generate billions. These billions are re-invested in ads or user acquisition and makes it harder for more ethical studios to gain visibility and stand out. And the way studios monetize their players is not only reflected in the lower quality of the games, but also the studio brand, culture, values and the talents who decide to join or stay.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So for once instead of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNjI03CGkb4&amp;t=39s">‘leaving the morality for the end’</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, let’s please ‘</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GiLZ2YoHSc&amp;t=44m">slow down on the greed</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">’</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Do you want to know how </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="http://puzzmo.com/">Puzzmo</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> co-creator Zach Gage prototyped his latest project? We thought you might. Earlier this month, we sat down with the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>TypeShift</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Knotwords</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> designer to learn more about his new bitesized newspaper puzzler, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pile-up Poker</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (PUP).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During our chat, Gage explained how the project changed dramatically throughout production–bouncing back from a brief cancellation to become one of the most popular offerings on Hearst's burgeoning puzzle platform.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We also glimpsed four work-in-progress versions of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pile-up Poker</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that provide a clear look at how the project became waylaid before being reshaped into something much more approachable.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Gage has kindly granted us permission to share images of those early incarnations, along with his annotations, to help you understand why the title was scrapped and subsequently reforged, eventually becoming the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="http://puzzmo.com/game/pile-up-poker">experimental card-based conundrum you see today</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="PUP–v0 (Feb 23)"><span>PUP–v0 (Feb 23)</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This was the earliest playable version of the game. Gage notes that with this initial prototype, his goal was to "get a digital version [out] as fast as possible and to focus more on aiding playability than adding constraints."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"In this version we could place cards anywhere on the grid. When we tested this, pretended there were rules around placement instead of implementing them with code," he adds. "This made it quicker to program and preserved more flexibility for us to make and try rule changes in our heads (without needing code changes)."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Below are the rules of this first iteration:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You may move up to four cards per turn Cards may be moved to the top most empty row, or any row already containing cards</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You may not move cards to multiple rows at the same time</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Each turn you may only move up to n-1 cards, where n is the number you moved last turn. So if I moved three cards on turn one, I could only move up to two on turn two</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Once you "stand" your moves are reset back to four and you are dealt the next hand up</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The goal here, according to Gage, was to try and make the best 12 poker hands (based on horizontal, vertical, and diagonal matches). The joker was a wild-card that counted as the best card for each different hand it featured in. The card peeking out of the back of the draw pile was the last card players would draw.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="PUP–v1 (March 6)">PUP–v1 (March 6)</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At this stage, the Puzzmo team were enjoying PUP-0 so focused on improving playability by including "more legible card-art, implementing a multiplier based on how many hands you've made, and showing the hand information next to each scored hand."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You can see a lot of design ideas from this version made their way into the final version of the game. If you're really eagle-eyed you might notice that the suit-art and cards we used in this version are pulled right out of Flipflop Solitaire," adds Gage.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"These prior iterations of the game were very technical to play and good strategy involves using the cards you discard to line things up vertically, since the cards shift left to fill gaps."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="PUP–v2 (March 15)">PUP–v2 (March 15)</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A big change in this version saw Gage experiment with the idea of a "discard to the void" move that players could deploy while also shifting cards up the board.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We had three true discards for the whole game, and using them counted as a move (for both the number of moves we'd get next turn, and the number of moves we had this turn)," continues Gage.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The goal with this idea was to make the end-rounds of the game feel less railroad-y. We were finding that the final two turns of the game had almost no decision-points. Adding in the optional discard, if players preserved it to the end, really opens up the end-game."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Puzzmo team also continued to add visual polish with PUP–v2, using outlines to clarify where you could place cards. The yellow bars denote 'bonus hands,' which are randomized each game and worth 2x the value of all other hands.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="PUP–v3 (April 2)">PUP–v3 (April 2)</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Gage says PUP-v3 is where things began to get a "little weird and/or unhinged." A big change saw the team try moving discarded cards to the back of the draw-deck instead of the void.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Instead of deleting cards, we're passing them to ourselves later," explains Gage. "This enables a ton of really interesting strategies around the discard move and creates a very interesting and dynamic end-game. Suddenly we had to balance our current row, the spots we can move cards to, and the 1-4 cards we've discarded against each-other.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Ultimately, this version of the game is the most technical and the most interesting, but it felt to me like too much work to play, and even worse, too much work to explain."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The complexity seen in PUP–v3 drove Gage to (briefly) cancel the project. It was, of course, pulled back from the brink after the Puzzmo team offered a few choice pointers that helped Gage reshape </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pile-up Poker</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> into something altogether more fluid.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For more on what happened next, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-pile-up-poker-survived-cancellation-to-become-a-puzzmo-hit">read our full interview with Gage</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <p>I have recently moved to an area that’s surrounded by forest, or at least, by swathes of greenery that feel like forests when you’re far enough inside them, even if they don’t meet whatever quantifiable definition is currently in vogue. My dreams are ablaze with scenes of sunlight percolating through shifting layers of beech and oak, with visions of dirt paths winding through bramble. Now, here comes <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/engraving">Engraving</a> to transform all those dreams into nightmares. </p>

<p>In this occult first-person mystery-horror, you explore a forest that is also a graveyard and, moreover, stuffed to the crannies with ancient curses and restless spectres, some of them distressingly though not entirely arachnid in derivation. Your chief means of overcoming these hazards is your ability to draw maps. The trouble is, when you sleep all of your maps become obsolete. Catch the trailer down the page there, poking its mishappen visage out of the undergrowth like a skeleton spiderman that wants to eat your ankles.</p>

<span data-position="1"></span></p><p>The work of Raffaele Picca, who is also working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pvkk-from-the-dome-keeper-devs-is-papers-please-but-you-get-a-huge-planetary-defence-cannon">that game about the giant planetary defence cannon</a>, Engraving (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2616650/Engraving/">Steam link here</a>) casts you as Silas, “a man once motivated by greed, now entangled in an intricate web of ancient curses and haunting spirits.” Play consists of stomping through distinct named regions, including a few catacombs, in order to learn about the spectres that inhabit this clearly far from National Trust-endorsed stretch of woodland. As you go, you can sketch portions of the forest on paper, but beware, Silas needs to sleep occasionally, and every time he does, the forest changes shape.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s got some procgen, and I’m aware that a lot of people are tired of procgen, but the ambience seems promising. While Silas seemingly lacks for a weapon or other way of defending himself, Picca’s tweets suggest he can portal into a parallel dimension, the Nether, to avoid certain nasties, with the strong caveat that the Nether harbours a few nasties of its own.</p>
<p>Featured by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/engraving">Screenshot Saturday Mondays</a> back in February, but discovered by me only today, Engraving has the makings of a cool conceptual horror game. I don’t find it quite as alarming as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silkbulb-tests-demo-is-a-fun-quiz-game-as-long-as-you-ignore-the-noises-and-dont-look-behind-you%E2%80%9D">Silkbulb Test</a> but I find it creepier than what I’ve played of Still Wakes The Deep, though admittedly I’ve only played about 30 minutes of that. This feels like a good moment to dust off Adam Smith’s (RPS in peace) old <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/videogame-maps">paean to videogame cartography</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-sports-fc-24-and-gta-5-top-european-charts-in-tough-may-european-monthly-charts<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>11.6 million PC and console games were sold across European markets in May. Compared with the same five week period in 2023, that's a drop of nearly 17%.</p>
<p>This is GSD figures, which tracks all digital game sales from most major publishers (Nintendo data is absent), and physical game sales in all major European markets.</p>
<p>The main reason for the drop is that last year we had the release of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, which was a major hit. To put it into context, Zelda alone sold more copies in May 2023 than the entire Top Ten sold in May 2024. Last year also saw the release of Hogwarts Legacy on PS4 and Xbox One, which was also a strong performer.</p>
<p>The No.1 selling game in May this year was EA Sports FC 24, followed by Grand Theft Auto 5. F1 2024 races in at No.3, which launches a good two weeks earlier this year. However, the Codemasters game has got off to a slow start, with launch sales down 35% over last year's game.</p>
<p>The PC release of Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut sends the PlayStation game up to No.4. Meanwhile, Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door comes in at No.5. Nintendo does not share digital sales with the charts, so the game may have charted higher in reality.</p>
<p>Looking at similar games, the new Paper Mario's sales are down 8% compared with the opening two weeks of last year's Super Mario RPG, and 8.5% lower than 2020's Paper Mario: The Origami King.</p>
<p>Finally, Star Wars-related pricing activity had sent Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order back into the Top Ten.</p>
<p><strong>Console sales fall sharply on tough Switch comparisons</strong></p>
<p>Across the tracked markets, 311,000 games consoles were sold in May 2023, which is a drop of 40% over the same period the year before.</p>
<p>All console platforms saw a big drop, with Nintendo Switch suffering the biggest fall. Again, this is because last May saw the release of Zelda and a special Zelda edition of the OLED Switch model.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, accessory sales fell 25% for the same five-week period, once again led by the DualSense controller (which actually saw sales rise year-on-year).</p>

			<p>As Drive to Survive has reignited interest in racing’s premiere category and made superstars of everyone from drivers to strategists in the last five years, it’s the on-track action that remains at the centre of every F1 calendar. Luckily, while Max Verstappen still keeps on winning this year, it’s been far from last year’s processional exhibition, and video game fans won’t feel like they’re living in a complete fantasy world when beating him to the top step of the podium in the latest of EA and Codemasters’ yearly F1 titles.</p>
<p><iframe title="F1 24 Season 1 - Charles Leclerc Challenge Career" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vtyu2UC2Duo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>EA Sports F1 24 continues the push for further realism, and alongside the expected tweaks and buffs there are some wholly changed or renewed systems that make this the best rendition of digital F1 racing we’ve ever had.</p>


<p>Driver Career mode gives you the choice between taking a created player of your own to the top of the podium, stepping into the shoes of your favourite driver, or creating an unlikely storyline where Logan Sargeant becomes World Champion. If you really wanted to.</p>
<p>Overall, Codemasters has made some big improvements to the Driver Career, making it feel all the more like you’re crafting your own storyline. You now work towards upgrading your driver’s stats, and you’re given a steady stream of objectives to incrementally move you towards taking P1. I was disappointed by the limited create-a-player options, with pre-set builds to choose form, but I understand that it’s likely to improve the parity between the real-world drivers and your racer.</p>

<p>There’s further inclusions, such as secret driver meetings where other teams court your interest, that really feel true to the behind-the-scenes action that are constantly whispered about in the paddock. Fundamentally, everything just feels a bit more more in depth, while staying true to the sport and its surrounding circus.</p>

<p>You can also run a complete two-player Driver Career, and we spent a lot of time in this mode, going head-to-head while also building our own path through the career. Sometimes load times can feel a little lengthy here while both players are working their way through menus, but the on-track action is rock solid and responsive. The biggest downside? There are few things more sobering though than the fact your son now beats you at an F1 racing game – I’d argue that he has too much time on his hands to practice.</p>
<p>While Driver Career has taken a step forward, there are few meaningful changes to My Team mode, though for many, creating your own team will be enough. You still control a driver alongside their team, but many of the most interesting new additions to the Driver Career mode haven’t been brought across, such as the secret meetings between drivers or the driver rivalries – in fairness, you’re basically playing as Lance and Lawrence Stroll bundled into one in this mode. While you can haggle with sponsors, and control a few more elements behind the scenes, it leaves My Team feeling like a missed opportunity, and I can see plenty of players choosing the main Driver Career over it.</p>

<p>To keep players coming back beyond their own stardom, Codemasters has added an episodic Challenge Career, where you’re given a series of missions to complete, with a set of cosmetic rewards to deck your driver out with. The first of these saw Max Verstappen choosing a small selection of his favourite race tracks and tasked you with finishing them in the highest position.</p>
<p>Each challenge hangs around for a week, before moving onto the next episode. It’s a great bite-sized mode, which doesn’t ask too much of your time, and it allows you to build your racer’s wardrobe – even if the most recent one is a horrible purple outfit that I’ll never, ever use.</p>
<p>While we can argue all day about horrible colour schemes, the visuals are sharper and distinctly more impressive than last year’s outing. The driver facial models are now incredibly lifelike, and various tracks look closer than ever to their real-world equivalent. Spa Francochamps in particular has seen a big improvement in visual fidelity, and it’s far more vibrant and realistic than last year’s overly dull rendition.</p>

<p>We’ve encountered a few bugs during our time with F1 24, including some penalties not being handed out for making changes to your engine during or after qualifying, and a few AI hiccups where an entire field of cars failed to put on wet tyres for the start of a race despite it absolutely chucking it down. Neither of these were disastrous – the second one obviously helped us out – but hopefully the few rough edges can be shaved off by an update.</p>
<p>At release, there were several vocal complaints about this year’s handling model, particularly if you used a steering wheel, and Codemasters has steadily tried to respond to these, with the most recent patch attempting to further address player’s difficulties.</p>
<p>The initial handling model felt good with a controller, but as we’ve leaned into playing more with our Thrustmaster wheel, the latest update feels more consistent and responsive than before. If it doesn’t quite feel right to you out of the box, there are various settings that you can tweak to personalise it to your liking, but for my personal taste, it’s just as accurate and enjoyable as it was last year.</p>
