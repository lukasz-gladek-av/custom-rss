            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a-is-a-fantastic-return-to-mega-form.1324639/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>After shaking up the Pokémon formula with <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</em>, its successor, <em>Legends: Z-A</em>, pushes things even further — and it’s a very welcome change of pace.</p><p>With <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22898939/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Arceus</em></a>, Nintendo and Game Freak demonstrated how much more vibrant, weird, and exciting the monster catching series could become with a few key changes to the classic formula. <em>Arceus</em>’ historical story and open-ish world made the <em>Pokémon</em> universe feel like a bigger, wilder place, just as the revamped battling and catching mechanics turned the familiar process of filling out your pokédex into a completely different kind of experience.</p><p>After years of the mainline <em>Pokémon </em>titles feeling like slight variations of one another, <em>Arceus </em>was a breath of air so invigorating that it was easy to imagine it becoming a new blueprint for the series. That initially seemed to be the plan with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23462858/pokemon-violet-scarlet-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Pokémon Scarlet </em>/<em> Violet</em></a><em>.</em> But those truly open-world adventures were plagued by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/679031/pokemon-violet-scarlet-switch-2-update-hands-on">innumerable technical issues</a>, and their uneven plotlines are best described as undercooked.</p><p>There was such a vast gap in quality between <em>Arceus </em>and <em>Scarlet </em>/ <em>Violet </em>that it was hard to tell where the franchise was going. But with its dramatically revamped battles and more immersive world, <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> (which I played on the Switch 2) is a fantastic return to form. And it’s one that feels like another example of how the <em>Legends</em> games’ experimental features could become the new standard as the series marches into the future.</p><p>Whereas <em>Arceus</em> transported you to the distant past when humans were first learning how to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/18/23123756/pokemon-hisuian-snow-arceus">coexist with pokémon in the vast Hisui region</a>,<em> Z-A </em>picks up in the present shortly after the events of <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-x-y-the-kotaku-review-1444323788"><em>Pokémon X </em>/ <em>Y</em></a> and takes place entirely in the Kalos region’s capital. Longtime residents of Lumiose City remember how their home was nearly destroyed by a nihilistic maniac hell-bent on wiping out humanity and pokémon alike in order to make the world a more “beautiful” place. But as a tourist visiting Lumiose — a walkable metropolis inspired by Paris — for the very first time, all your character really knows about the city is that it is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/27/24083767/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2025-launch-date">in the process of being built back stronger than ever</a>.</p><p>Overseen and financed by the Quasartico company, Lumiose’s ambitious redevelopment plan aims to turn the city into a place where humans and pokémon can live peacefully alongside one another. Lumiose is flush with newly built housing for people, and the city’s Wild Zones — sectioned-off areas filled with naturally occurring features — are spaces where wild pokémon can thrive. But as smoothly as the redevelopment plan has been going for the most part, there is also a growing concern about the rising number of dangerous Mega-Evolved pokémon that have begun appearing in Lumiose without explanation, and your character eventually joins a squad intent on solving that mystery.</p><p>Part of what made <em>Arceus </em>feel so pleasantly different from other <em>Pokémon </em>titles was the way it drastically reworked familiar gameplay elements as reflections of its historical setting. You could still battle wild pokémon and other trainers in turn-based matches, but the game also put a unique emphasis on stealthily catching monsters without needing to engage them in fights. Tonally, <em>Arceus </em>was also darker and more foreboding than previous <em>Pokémon </em>entries, which made sense for a game where untamed alpha pokémon would frequently try <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738353/new-pokemon-legends-arceus-trailer-hisuian-zorua-zoroark-nintendo-switch">to maul you on sight</a>.</p><p>Similarly,<em> Z-A </em>frames the Rogue Mega Evolution phenomenon as one of the major reasons why your character has to be cautious as they roam around Lumiose. But almost all of the pokémon you encounter in the Wild Zones (and a few other places) are capable of knocking your character out with just a few hits. Once again, you have the ability to sneak through tall grass and bushes to hurl pokéballs at unsuspecting pokémon. Stealth catching often works like a charm when it comes to the game’s lower-level monsters you meet early on, but when it comes to alphas, you usually have to send a partner into battle.</p><p><em>Z-A</em>’s wildly reworked battling mechanics are by far the biggest change. In place of the traditional turn-based system, fights now take place in real time with attacks being assigned to the Switch’s four face buttons and recharging on specific timers. At first, even simple battles can feel chaotic because of how many things there are to keep track of. You have to tell your pokémon which attacks to use, understand that attack’s range, and keep your human character moving in order to guide your monsters across the battlefield. If you use items from your satchel, you also have to be mindful of the cooldown timer before you can open the bag again.</p><p>The system took me a while to get used to because the mainline <em>Pokémon </em>games have always been about making measured, calculated moves. But once I got a feel for the way my Tepig could fire off an Ember attack and quickly follow it up with a Tackle, I could start to see how <em>Z-A </em>wants you to battle in a (slightly twitchy) kind of flow state.</p><p>Strategy is still important here — understanding your monster’s type advantages / disadvantages and its strongest stats can be the deciding factors in fights. But <em>Z-A </em>feels like a game that was designed with the idea of embracing the chaos that would result from groups of magical animals attacking each other with elemental superpowers. A well-timed Flame Wheel / Rollout one-two punch became a go-to combo once my Tepig became a Pignite. But there were more than a couple of instances where that aggressive approach to fighting stronger opponents left my Pignite in danger of getting hit before I could tell him to run out of the way.</p><p>Battling becomes even trickier once the game properly introduces Mega Evolution — a returning mechanic from the <em>X </em>/<em> Y </em>era that temporarily changes certain pokémon’s physical form and boosts their stats. In <em>X </em>/<em> Y</em>, you could only Mega Evolve one pokémon per battle, and the transformation would revert back if your chosen monster fainted before the match was completed. <em>Z-A </em>switches things up considerably by introducing a gauge that charges up with energy before you can trigger Mega Evolution by pressing the right joystick. As long as the gauge is full, you can Mega Evolve your pokémon (if they’re a species capable of doing it) as many times as you want, which is handy when you’re facing off against the Rogue Mega Evolved pokémon that function as some of <em>Z-A</em>’s boss battles.</p><p>The game eases you into its battles by making them a key part of how the story progresses. By day, Lumiose is a glamorous urban hub where people and their pokémon partners spend time relaxing at cafes, browsing museums, and shopping at boutiques. But at night, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637256/pokemon-legends-z-a-trailer-day-night-cycle">random sections of the city are transformed into battle zones</a> where ambitious trainers participate in the Z-A Royale, a riff on the traditional gyms.</p><p>At the beginning of every night cycle, a Battle Zone lights up in red and becomes filled with trainers of various ranks who you have to defeat in order to collect a designated number of points. And once you’ve got enough points, you unlock a special, slightly more difficult battle that determines whether you move up a rank. In previous <em>Pokémon </em>games, it could be easy to blow through gym battles because of how leaders and their associated trainers all used the same types of monsters. But many of the Z-A Royale’s participants use more eclectic teams of pokémon, which requires more thinking on the fly. The Z-A Royale is also a fantastic showcase of what kinds of people live in Lumiose — there are socialites, waiters, and overworked delivery workers who all want a taste of glory.</p><p>Lumiose’s expansiveness feels like a big step forward after recent <em>Pokémon </em>games for the Switch. I spent hours wandering around listening to / reading people’s conversations, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/784264/pokemon-legends-z-a-hands-on-fashion-nintendo-switch-2">building an expansive wardrobe</a>, and appreciating the horn-heavy, accordion-accented smooth jazz soundtrack. The city could use a bit more visual detail, but it’s a substantial improvement; <em>Scarlet </em>/ <em>Violet</em>’s towns felt more like lifeless dioramas, and <em>Arceus </em>simply didn’t have all that many places where you could vibe for the hell of it.</p><p>There are also welcome quality-of-life tweaks. For instance, <em>Z-A </em>introduces a character whose entire job is to keep track of pokéballs that you’ve lost and return them to you. Little details like that feel like the game’s way of keeping resource gathering grind to a minimum so that you can focus on more interesting things. Other tweaks make your pokémon feel more like a partner. Rather than trees that you need the Cut move to get past, Lumiose is filled with rubble, tree stumps, and piles of sludge that you can only clear by summoning a pokémon and making it use moves that make sense. I got into the habit of using my Emboar’s Rock Smash to pulverize piles of cracked stones, but I was surprised to learn that the move wouldn’t work on stones located higher up off the ground just out of my monster’s reach.</p><p>Clever little details like that kept surprising me as I got deeper into <em>Z-A</em> and really began to feel a kind of immersion this series has never quite been able to achieve before. Dialogue is still written out in text rather than being voiced over, but when your character does a parkour move to climb up a building, you can hear them audibly exerting themselves. There is something very cool about seeing your pokémon conjure a wave just to wash away garbage or a lightning bolt to recharge a broken elevator. Meanwhile, the battles pull you from the sidelines and put you in the midst of the chaos.</p><p>Though <em>Z-A </em>and <em>Arceus </em>share a similar experimental energy, the new game is more polished and robust. <em>Z-A </em>is launching with <a href="https://legends.pokemon.com/en-us/news/z-a-battle-club">an online battling mode</a>, there has already been an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pokemon/777169/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-nmega-raichu">announcement about a DLC expansion</a>, and on the technical side <em>Z-A </em>feels much more like what you would expect from a flagship game meant to help usher in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">a new generation of hardware</a>.</p><p>While I enjoyed playing <em>Z-A </em>on the Switch 2, I can’t speak to how the game runs on the original Switch. That’s important <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/679031/pokemon-violet-scarlet-switch-2-update-hands-on">given how improved <em>Scarlet </em>/ <em>Violet </em>were from Nintendo’s previous hardware</a>, and that kind of performance gap here could be a deal-breaker for people who haven’t upgraded. But <em>Z-A </em>makes a strong showing as the Switch 2’s first major <em>Pokémon </em>debut, illustrating how this series is at its best when it gets experimental. And hopefully some of this good energy gets channeled into the next generation of <em>Pokémon </em>games.</p><p><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </em>releases for the Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 on October 16th.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTE="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Charles Pulliam-Moore</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/798848/pokemon-legends-za-review-nintendo-switch-2]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s been three years since the last Pokémon games, <em>Scarlet</em> and <em>Violet</em>. For the average player that might be a refreshing break, but for the hardcore fans that’s practically a lifetime. Does <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> deliver after all that waiting, or is it more of a stop-gap entry that feels overshadowed by how long overdue it is? According to early reviews it’s just good enough to reward fans’ patience, even if it’s not the mold-shattering standout in the<em> Pokémon</em> series some have been hoping for.</p> <p><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> is currently hovering around 81 on <em><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/pokemon-legends-z-a/">Metacritic</a></em> with 40 reviews currently published. That’s a few points below 2022’s<em> Pokémon Legends: Arceus</em> but a healthy bump up from the performance-issue-riddled <em>Scarlet</em> and <em>Violet</em>. Most reviewers of the newest entry said it runs well on Switch 2 with no real graphical hitches and a solid 60fps performance throughout the game, though <em>VGC</em> reported that it still feels like the sequel is being held back by being developed on last-gen hardware as well.</p>

 <p>In terms of gameplay, <em>Z-A</em> trades <em>Arceus</em>‘ watercolor-esque wilderness for an urban labyrinth of streets, skyscrapers, and small public parks. Some reviewers found it visually boring, even if there are plenty of activities to keep the city of Lumiose feeling lively and entertaining. <em>Nintendo Life</em> was not impressed with the setting, calling the new urban playground “lifeless” and restrictive-feeling. What most early reviews seem to agree on is that<em> Z-A</em>‘s Mega Evolutions, overhauled raids, and real-time hybrid combat subverts the standard flow of a <em>Pokémon</em> game in fun and interesting ways, making the battles a standout for the series.</p> <p>It’s worth noting that this is still just a small sample of the initial critical feedback for <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>. Reviewers apparently only received code five days before today’s review embargo, and restrictions prohibit them from talking about certain parts of the game. It also doesn’t seem like anyone’s had an opportunity to test it on Switch 1 yet either, the platform that most fans will be playing it on. <em>Kotaku</em> will have its own coverage starting on the October 16 release date, but in the meantime here’s what else early reviews are saying about the newest Pokémon game.</p> <h2><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-review"><em>IGN</em></a></h2> <blockquote><p>Man, I was going to try and hold back a bit on this review-in-progress since I still have plenty to see before my final review, but I’m just so genuinely excited about what Game Freak has done here. I liked <em>Arceus</em> a fair amount and thought it showed promise, but have been broadly disappointed with the slow backslide I saw from the studio in its move to console game development, and worried the quality dip was a new trend for 3D Pokémon games that we’d never escape. <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>, at least across the first two-dozen hours, is putting a lot of my fears to rest. It’s not revolutionary by any stretch, but it’s really good! I’m having fun, I’m excited to keep playing, I feel rewarded for exploring every corner, the story’s got my attention, and I’m not distracted by my Pokémon falling through the floor while they battle or everything crashing when I try to climb a ladder. If the rest of my adventure holds up (and the Switch 1 performance isn’t a disaster), we could finally have a 3D game worthy of the Pokémon franchise on our hands. It’d be about dang time. — Rebekah Valentine (review-in-progress)</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-review">Eurogamer</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>Like the last three main series games before it,<em> Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> comes with hefty caveats. It gets repetitive after a while. It’s still visually limited, despite the huge improvements on the last pair. It’s still missing dungeons, deep mysteries, a sense of big challenge to build up to, prepare for and overcome. But then it has charm in spades, from [its] humour right through to its soundtrack (a smooth, jazzy, wistful, accordion-based treat). There’s even an <em>homage</em> to a dungeon, that feels if nothing else like a fantastic proof of concept for one day bringing them back in 3D. — Chris Tapsell</p></blockquote> <h2><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/pokemon/pokemon-legends-z-a-review/"><em>Gamesradar</em></a></h2> <blockquote><p>Crucially, living and breathing city life for an entire RPG means the return to Kalos feels like a true slice of life in the Pokemon world that you’re a part of. That dream sold to us by the Pokemon anime? It’s right here, clearer than it ever has been in the actual games, and it’s impossible not to get caught up in the joy of that as you wake up and leave your new residence of Hotel Z in a morning, wild Fletchling and Pidgey flying past and perching gently on streetlights as you run down the streets with your Pokemon by your side. The lack of regional adventure may not be to everyone’s taste, but if you’ve ever fantasized about living in the Pokemon world like I have, there’s a lot to love here. — Catherine Lewis</p></blockquote> <h2><a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/review/18695-pokemon-legends-z-a-review"><em>RPG Site</em></a></h2> <blockquote> <p data-handler="v1">Where <em>Arceus</em> de-emphasized trainer battles and towns in lieu of exploring a Sinnoh region before wider settlements had been established,<em> Z-A</em> consolidates the entirety of its experience within the urban setting of Kalos’ Lumiose City. While an increasing number of Wild Zones dot Lumiose’s landmarks, by far the star of the show is trainer battles, primarily within the <em>Z-A</em> Royale; a tournament held every night in a rotating district, as trainers compete to raise their rank in pursuit of the promise of their wish being granted. — James Galizio</p> </blockquote> <figure></figure> <h2><em><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Nintendo Life</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>While I was wandering around the cobbles of Lumiose, I realized it all felt very compact. The city is essentially one big open zone, with a fair amount of verticality. But that means I’d run through and explored the entire place within about five hours. Sure, more Wild Zones unlock as you progress, bringing more Pokémon to catch. But it left very few surprises for the entire game.</p> <p>I also wish it looked better, too. Lumiose has a few lovely sights here and there, but on the whole, <em>Legends: Z-A</em> appears lifeless. <em>Arceus</em> wasn’t a graphical showcase, but that watercolor-style aesthetic gave it a really unique feel. <em>New Pokémon Snap</em> looks so much better and more vibrant than this. If clothes can swish around and hair flow through the wind, why can’t we have windows that aren’t just flat textures or shadows that don’t look like bleeding ink blotches on the floor? It’s a little better docked, but not much. — Alana Hagues</p></blockquote> <h2><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/pokemon-legends-z-a-review/"><em>VGC</em></a></h2> <blockquote><p>The<em> Pokémon Legends</em> series feels like it’s settling old scores.&nbsp;<em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</em>&nbsp;allowed Game Freak to tell the epic story of <em>Arceus</em> (and finally have him easily catchable worldwide in a game), while also serving as a pseudo-remake/tribute to Generation 4 for those who didn’t love BDSP.</p> <p><em>Pokémon Legends Z-A</em> is a game that understands its audience and feels like a love letter to both players who grew up with X &amp; Y and those who’ve been here the whole time. Lumoise City is finally as grand as Game Freak tried to make it with the limited power of the 3DS, and Zygarde not only earns plenty of focus, but<em> Z-A</em> will likely propel it from total obscurity to a fan favorite. — Jordan Middler</p></blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The head of Assassin’s Creed has reportedly left Ubisoft after the launch of the company’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-new-company-officially-launches-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new subsidiary with Tencent</a>.</p>



<p>According to reports, franchise vice president and executive producer Marc-Alexis Côté is no longer with the company. The news was broken to the company via an internal email. </p>



<p>Per <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-franchise-boss-departs-ubisoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the memo sent</a> to staff and first reported by IGN, Vantage Studios’ co-CEOs Christophe Derennes and Charlie Guillemot said that Côté was offered a leadership role within the company, but he declined the opportunity. It was a decision that the studio leads say they were “disappointed” by. They added that Côté had “<strong>his own expectations and priorities related to Vantage Studios’ creation and future.”</strong></p>



<p>In a statement provided to Insider Gaming, an Ubisoft spokesperson said,<strong> “Following the organizational restructuring announced in March 2025,&nbsp;Marc-Alexis Côté&nbsp;has chosen to pursue a new path elsewhere outside of Ubisoft. While we are saddened to see him go, we’re confident that our talented teams will carry forward the strong foundation he helped build.</strong></p>

<p><strong>“We are deeply grateful for the impact Marc-Alexis has had over the years, particularly in shaping the Assassin’s Creed brand into what it is today. His leadership, creativity, and dedication have left a lasting mark on our teams and our players. We thank him sincerely for his many contributions and wish him continued success in all his future endeavors.”</strong></p>



<p>Côté&nbsp;first <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcalexis/details/experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">joined Ubisoft in 2005</a> as a software engineer. Over the last 20 years, he had moved up through the company as a lead programmer, level designer, game director, and executive producer. Games produced under his watch include Assassin’s Creed III, Assassin’s Creed Syndicate, and Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, among others. </p>



<p>Since 2022, Côté&nbsp;has been responsible for the “overall strategy for the Assassin’s Creed franchise”. </p>

Don't forget that Pokémon Legends: Z-A drops on Thursday too, and I've got all the preorder links you'll need above and below. There's a song in that somewhere? Let's get into it:</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Cheapest at Amazon: Pokémon TCG</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kicking off with the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aXV21m?object_uuid=682b7621-e317-454a-b32c-f09eeaef2973&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Evolution Elite Trainer Box</a>, we know $92.65 isn't MSRP and Amazon should be selling it as such, but this is how it is in Pokémania 2025 for now.

Of course, the TMNT bundle comes with a few goodies including 9 play boosters, foil alt art promo card, 30 land cards and some tidy accessories.</p><p id="pokmon-legends-l-a-preorders"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon Legends: L-A Preorders">Pokémon Legends: L-A Preorders</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's nearly time trainers!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">What next for Sucker Punch now <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yotei</a> is out the door? The Sony-owned studio has yet to say, but based on comments from the boss of the company, it will remain a single-project studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sucker-punch-will-remain-a-single-project-studio-after-ghost-of-yotei-boss-suggests/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VGC</a>, Sucker Punch co-founder and studio head, Brian Fleming, said the studio will decide its next project once the multiplayer add-on Ghost of Yotei: Legends comes out in 2026. But, he suggested, don’t expect a flurry of games from the relatively lean developer — it’s one project at a time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The truth is that whatever we do next, whether it’s continuing Ghost or going back to Sly, the decision is really more limited by, again, our cherishing of focus and time to iterate, which means that we really can only do one thing at a time,” he said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“If we were good at juggling four projects, yeah, we’d have a remaster, and let’s go do one of those, and one of those, and do some fan request, that would be really popular… But we only get to do one thing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So it kind of has to be your best idea, right? And that’s really clarifying. It’s not like there aren’t 15 good ideas. But you only get to do one. And by the way, you only get to do one about every five years. So that choice is really important. I mean, that is choosing your college and your major every five years.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sucker Punch has plenty to draw from in its back catalog. As Fleming mentioned, one of its classic franchises is Sly Cooper, which fans have called to return in some form. And what about the inFamous series? Would a remaster then a sequel prove successful? And then there’s the prospect of another Ghost game, following Tsushima and Yotei. Everyone loves a trilogy, after all.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best PS5 Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait to find out, check out IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-review">Ghost of Yotei review</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">It took less than one week for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6"><u>Battlefield 6</u></a> players to start making Portal lobbies for XP farming – and some believe EA has already caught on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans were quick to call out the progression system in last week’s new FPS entry as a bit of a slog. Although most are walking away from each multiplayer match happy with the package Battlefield Studios has crafted, even some of the most enthusiastic fans believe leveling up takes too long, with an unrewarding weapon unlock system and arduous challenges dampening the experience even further.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The general unlock process in Battlefield 6 is too slow.</p><p>I understand wanting to make it challenging for players to get the best stuff, but I'm dreading how long it's going to take to bring just a few guns up to a decent level for attachments etc, and I'm an engaged player.…</p></div>— Westie (@MrProWestie) <a href="https://twitter.com/MrProWestie/status/1977628190337110471?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 13, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">“Do they really think players have that much time and energy to grind endlessly just to get the rewards we’re supposed to earn naturally?” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o3jwbb/dice_what_are_you_thiking_weapon_and_character/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>one player asked</u></a> in a Reddit post. “It’s exhausting.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just days removed from launch, plenty of players already feel the grind is too much to put up with – especially for casual fans – but that’s where Portal comes in. The do-it-yourself mode, which was first introduced in 2021’s Battlefield 2042, allows players to create nearly any match or mode they can dream of. The right build can even allow Portal users to earn experience as if they are playing a standard multiplayer match, so, naturally, it took just days for XP farm servers to crop up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Content creators like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rFuu5QZPwI" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Arekkz Gaming</u></a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/4t5Df2dvxC0?si=YkpqCptbOl2dsogJ&amp;t=877" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>TheCadWoman</u></a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/mclOIKZ7BOU?si=MDUyyH_mlD_PLN0_&amp;t=434" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>WhosImmortal</u></a>, who are just a few of the many spreading the word, recommend specific Portal lobbies to level up fast. Most relevant lobbies are populated with bots but stick close enough to standard Battlefield 6 modes so as not to alter the rate of gained XP. Players are often then instructed to use double XP tokens (if they have any) and kill AI/bot enemies near objectives to efficiently farm XP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A desire to boost through demanding progression systems has existed long before Battlefield 6, so XP farm servers in Portal were quickly populated full of impatient fans. Some suspect that EA, though, is just as quick.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As more XP farm lobbies fill the Portal community browser, players are finding themselves met with a “Global Game Quota Exceeded” message with little explanation. It’s led fans to believe EA and BF Studios have begun cracking down on suspicious lobbies in order to keep boosters from exploiting Battlefield 6 and its Portal toolkit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The error is certainly keeping some XP farmers from continuing to reap the rewards they desire, but it’s unclear if these messages are the result of direct action to pour cold water on farming. Portal players have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o4eyj9/the_global_portal_quota_needs_to_be_upsized/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>reported receiving the message</u></a> regardless of their lobby hosting intentions. Some haven’t even been able to start hosting servers at all, suggesting Battlefield 6 Portal servers may simply be struggling <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-gets-off-to-huge-start-on-steam-with-over-740000-concurrent-players-just-hours-after-launch">in the wake of massive player numbers from last week’s launch</a>. There’s also been no word from EA or BF Studios regarding any moves to stamp out XP farming.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s unclear why exactly the Global Game Quote Exceeded message is popping up around the user-generated community tab, but that doesn’t mean the popularity of XP farming isn’t playing a role. The widespread criticism of Battlefield 6’s progression system has led to an overflow of servers for players looking to unlock content as quickly as possible. Some dedicated Portal creators suspect this large number of individual lobbies isn’t exactly helping unclog the Battlefield 6 online experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 launched October 10 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S, then promptly rocketed its way to become <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-gets-off-to-huge-start-on-steam-with-over-740000-concurrent-players-just-hours-after-launch"><u>the most successful Steam launch for the long-running EA franchise ever</u></a>, reaching a peak of more than 740,000 concurrent users.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait to see how EA and BF Studios might address XP farming and progression in Battlefield 6, be sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-launched-just-hours-ago-and-players-have-already-recreated-call-of-duty-map-shipment-in-portal">how some Portal players used their power to recreate Call of Duty’s Shipment</a>.

<p>Developer Sam Eng actually pulled a fast one and released Skate Story's Steam Next Fest demo a bit early. It debuted at the tail end of last week, jumping the big queue of cool things each Next Fest has become. Despite my British sense of etiquette, I'll forgive him, because he did at least <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1263240/view/501711331410315348?l=english">pair it with some big news</a>. Skate Story will release on December 8th, 2025.</p>
<p>On that day, you'll be able to take in nine chapters of the answer to the following question: 'What if Tony Hawk's soul was sent to a realm of nightmare surrealism, and was also a bit peckish?' On this day, you can give the first chapter a whirl in the demo, which I've just kickflipped through in about 35 minutes.</p><p>As far as I can tell, it's the same demo Brendan, no doubt using his mysterious skateboarding magicks, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-skate-story-demo-has-me-yearning-for-its-knee-shattering-flow-state">managed to get his hands on back in 2024</a>. Curse you, Caldwell, one day we'll see your cupboard of evil tricks flung open, no doubt to reveal a bit of paper which reads 'I just asked the dev, and they said there you go'.</p>
<p>Anyway, I've given it a go and it's just as cool as ol' Brendo said. I particularly enjoyed dispelling the smiling block's manhole guffs, and the section which sees your skater glide through space to kickflip at a celestial body. The soundtrack being more akin to Disco Elsyium's chill Sea Power symphony than the usual pop punk performances blasting in skating games will take a bit of getting used to. If you're interested in finding out more about the artist behind it, Blood Cultures, there's a bit of chat with them in the Steam post I linked earlier.</p>
<p>"Skate Story is based on a true story," Eng wrote in that same post. "Yes, that’s right folks. Sure, it’s slightly dramatized for effect, but it’s all totally 100% true. Of course, names and places have been altered as well, for the privacy of those involved. For example, it was not originally a Frog who ran the bagel shop, and the Skater actually had to get a lawyer before signing the Devil’s Contract."</p>
<p>Cool. Skate Story's demo's on its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1263240/Skate_Story/">Steam page</a>, where you can also wishlist it ahead of that December release.</p>

              <p>Battle royales are a dime a dozen. Probably cheaper. While the premise of every-player-for-themselves and winner-take-all makes for a good multiplayer game, it’s hard to find a battle royale game that offers a unique spin on those fundamental premises. But <i>Final Sentence</i> sure as hell seems like it might’ve found a distinctive enough concept to set itself apart: Gather a bunch of players in a room and have them type as fast as they can, with every typo leading to potential elimination.</p> <p>Developed by Button Mash, <i>Final Sentence</i>’s premise and setup doesn’t get any simpler: Put your butt in the chair and copy the text in front of you as accurately and quickly as possible. For every three typos you make, a masked man in a trench coat will load a bullet into a revolver, spin the cylinder, and fire it at you. If you’re lucky, you can continue playing. If not, well. You’re dead. The more times you trigger a spin of the cylinder, the more bullets your masked executioner loads into the gun.</p>

  <p>There’s a demo available on Steam as a part of <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-free-demos-next-fest-painkiller-reanimal-steam-2000634620">Next Fest</a> if the premise appeals to you. Having played a few matches myself, I can say it’s quite fun! I tend to push multiple keys at once when typing fast, so I’ve had my share of eliminations.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-free-demos-next-fest-painkiller-reanimal-steam-2000634620">10 Of The Best Demos To Check out In October’s Steam Next Fest</a></p> <p>The game is expected to arrive in Q4 of 2025, so if you fancy yourself a pretty adept touch typist, keep this one on your radar. Maybe you’ll get to prove to the world just how speedy and accurate you are on a keyboard, while the bodies of those who couldn’t match your prowess pile up around you.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a> has revealed the dates for next year's Summer Game Fest event, as well as a change of venue.</p>
<p>The event will take place in the first weekend of June, beginning with the Live Kickoff showcase on 5th June.</p>
<p>This showcase will take place in-person at the Dolby Theatre in LA, which has been used for multiple gaming events in the past. The event will also be streamed online, for those not able to make it.</p>

<p>Of course, it's too far in advance to say what will be shown at the event, but expect the latest game announcements across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>Before that, there's The Game Awards, which this year will take place on 11th December at the Peacock Theatre in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Nominees are yet to be announced, but will be revealed in mid-November. Judging by popular sentiment, the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, and Death Stranding 2 appear to be frontrunners for the biggest awards.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Just weeks after Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-new-subsidiary-far-cry-rainbow-six-assassins-creed-vantage-studios/">unveiled its new subsidiary with Tencent to be Vantage Studios</a>, which will house the Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six franchises, and be co-led by Charlie Guillemot (son of Yves Guillemot, chief executive officer at Ubisoft) and Christophe Derennes, the current head of the Assassin's Creed series, Marc-Alexis Côté has left Ubisoft.</p>



<p>This news was first reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-franchise-boss-departs-ubisoft">IGN</a>, which reports that staff were alerted to Côté's departure today through an internal email that also included details regarding "<em>the need for Vantage Studios' leadership team to be aligned with its core goals</em>." The report adds that Côté was offered a role within Vantage Studios, but declined to take it.</p>



<p>The report also included a statement attributed to a Ubisoft spokesperson (which Ubisoft also sent to Wccftech, confirming Côté's departure), which reads, "<em>Following the organizational restructuring announced in March 2025, Marc-Alexis Côté</em> <em>has chosen to pursue a new path elsewhere outside of Ubisoft. While we are saddened to see him go, we're confident that our talented teams will carry forward the strong foundation he helped build</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>We are deeply grateful for the impact Marc-Alexis Côté</em> <em>has had over the years, particularly in shaping the Assassin's Creed brand into what it is today. His leadership, creativity, and dedication have left a lasting mark on our teams and our players. We thank him sincerely for his many contributions and wish him continued success in all his future endeavours.</em>"</p>



<p>Marc-Alexis Côté had been with Ubisoft for 20 years and first began working on the Assassin's Creed franchise in 2009. Since then, he's been a part of the series every step of the way, from the conceptual beginnings of each title to its execution. He's worked on the series as a level designer, game director, creative director, and since March 2022, he's overseen the development of the entire franchise. </p>



<p>Wccftech has reached out to Ubisoft for further clarification on the nature of the roles Marc-Alexis Côté was offered, and if he would have been able to be in a similar position at the head of the Assassin's Creed franchise, had he accepted. We'll update this story if/when we hear back.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed Boss Marc-Alexis Côté Reportedly Leaves Ubisoft After Two Decades]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-boss-leaves-ubisoft-report</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassins-creed-boss-marc-alexis-c%C3%B4t%C3%A9-reportedly-leaves-ubisoft-after-two-decades.1324540/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>franchise boss&nbsp;Marc-Alexis Côté has departed Ubisoft after more than two decades with the company, having most recently overseen the development and launch of&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>.</p>

<p>According to a statement given to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-franchise-boss-departs-ubisoft" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">IGN</a>&nbsp;by Ubisoft itself,&nbsp;Côté, who is affectionately known as "Mac" inside Ubisoft thanks to his initials, has "chosen to pursue a new path elsewhere outside of Ubisoft".</p>

<p>His decision follows the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-creative-houses-q1-financials" rel="nofollow">setup of a brand new company</a>, Vantage Studios, to handle some of Ubisoft's most profitable IP, including&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed</em>. The company is headed up by&nbsp;Christophe Derennes and Charlie Guillemot, leading to <a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-tencent-subsidiary-ceo-charlie-guillemot" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">accusations of nepotism</a>&nbsp;since the latter is the son of Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-boss-leaves-ubisoft-shadows.jpg?itok=lf-cTdm7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-boss-leaves-ubisoft-shadows.jpg?itok=_ESENhZF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>boss&nbsp;Marc-Alexis Côté has left Ubisoft after over 20 years.</figcaption></figure><p>Per IGN, in an internal Ubisoft memo, Derennes told staff that he was "disappointed" by Côté's departure and that Côté "had his own expectations and priorities related to Vantage Studios' creation and future".</p>

<p>That's not much to go on, but it sounds as though Côté may have butted heads with Derennes and Guillemot over the direction of either Vantage Studios as an entity or&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>as a franchise (or perhaps both). It's hard to say.</p>

<p>Côté has worked on the&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>franchise since 2010's&nbsp;<em>Brotherhood</em>, where he served as lead level designer. He worked as&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed 3</em>'s director, going on to become the creative director for titles like&nbsp;<em>Syndicate&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Odyssey</em>.</p>

<p>His departure comes at a busy time for the&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>franchise, with a major story DLC launching for&nbsp;<em>Shadows&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-review-more-of-same-not-in-good-way" rel="nofollow">just last month</a>&nbsp;and a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-mirage-valley-of-memory-update" rel="nofollow">big free update on the way</a> for the Baghdad-set&nbsp;<em>Mirage&nbsp;</em>in November.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen what effect&nbsp;Côté's departure will have on the&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>franchise and on Ubisoft as a whole. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Pathologic 3 Release Date Revealed for January]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathologic-3-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pathologic-3-release-date-revealed-for-january.1324537/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HypeTrain Digital and Ice-Pick Lodge have announced the release date for upcoming immersive sim-style horror adventure&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3</em>, and it's due out early next year.</p>

<p>As revealed in a brand new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3</em>, which was first announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathologic-3-announced-2025" rel="nofollow">back in October last year</a>, will be arriving on PC on January 9th. The two studios say the new release date is "nailed down, screwed in, wrapped in commitments, and...isn't moving".</p>

<p>If you're looking to check out&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3&nbsp;</em>before it launches, then there's also a new demo you can try out right now as part of the latest Steam Next Fest. This demo is distinct from the free&nbsp;<em>Quarantine&nbsp;</em>prologue section that was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathologic-3-quarantine-release-date" rel="nofollow">released at the beginning of the year</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pathologic-3-release-date-corpses.jpg?itok=bLj2Asw0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pathologic-3-release-date-corpses.jpg?itok=gqqD35cV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pathologic 3</em>&nbsp;brings more of the series' trademark weirdness in January.</figcaption></figure><p>As Ice-Pick Lodge tells it, the new demo is different to&nbsp;<em>Quarantine&nbsp;</em>"in every way"; rather than being a standalone prologue experience, the demo represents "a slice from the beginning of the full game", and therefore has a "different story" to&nbsp;<em>Quarantine</em>, as well as covering "different events".</p>

<p>The new demo should take you about an hour or two to complete, and it supports various languages including English, Russian, and Brazilian Portuguese. If you're at all interested in the game, give it a download, as Ice-Pick Lodge says this will help more Next Fest visitors see what they're offering.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3</em>, it's the third game in the idiosyncratic&nbsp;<em>Pathologic&nbsp;</em>series, which melds the freeform approach of immersive sims with a strong investigative focus and a warped, surreal atmosphere.</p>

<p>This latest entry <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathologic-2-bachelors-scenario-announced" rel="nofollow">began life as an expansion</a> for&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 2&nbsp;</em>before being spun out into its own standalone game last year.&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 2&nbsp;</em>itself serves as a sort of junction between reboot, remake, and sequel for the original&nbsp;<em>Pathologic</em>, so&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3</em>'s origins feel curiously appropriate for the series.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3&nbsp;</em>when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3199650/Pathologic_3/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> on January 9th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[GEEKOM Ryzen 7 Gaming Mini PC Was Pricier Than a Mac Mini, Now It’s Cheaper and at Its Lowest Price Yet (32GB RAM, 1TB SSD)]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/geekom-ryzen-7-mini-pc-was-pricier-than-a-mac-mini-now-its-cheaper-and-at-its-lowest-price-yet-32gb-ram-1tb-ssd-2000634644</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’ve cruised on past Amazon’s Prime Big Deals Days. If you missed out on Amazon’s huge Fall savings event that stretched from October 7 to October 8, we have good news. You don’t have to wait for Black Friday to start saving some cash again. There are some great deals active right now across Amazon despite the Prime event having ended. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4332/">Like right now, you can snag this mini PC for 33% off. The Geekom Mini PC AX8 Max has dropped down from $749 to just $499 for a limited time</a>. That discount ends up saving your a solid $250.</p>
<p>Taking a peak at this mini PC’s specs, we’re looking at an AMD Ryzen 7 capable of up to 4.9GHz alongside an AMD Radeon 780M graphics card. It’s got 32GB of RAM and a 1TB M.2 2280 PCIe Gen4 NVMe SSD. If that’s not enough to store all your files, videos, and games, the SSD slot is expandable up to 4TB.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4332/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This mini PC can run in three different modes depending on your needs in a given moment. Normal mode is just that. This default is balanced for versatile performance, great for when using office applications or video and photo editing software. Quiet mode can be set when you want to reduce power consumption and noise. Good for late night studying or light office work. Then we have performance mode. This pushes the hardware to its limits to optimize for AAA gaming.</p>
<h2>Why Go Mini?</h2>
<p>A mini PC offers a nice in between option for anyone who can’t decide between a laptop or tower PC. It’s compact in size as not to take up a ton of desk space. It can be a great option for anyone trying to keep a clear desk or optimize the space they’re working with. You don’t have to give up an entire shelf or your foot space under the desk for a solid piece of hardware.</p>



<p>Mini PCs also work great as a secondary computer or multimedia player. Sure, most TVs manufactured today already come with smart features built-in and apps like Hulu or Netflix available to download, but there is still value in choosing a mini PC for your home theater over your TV’s factory UI. For one, they are a full-on Windows computer so they support a much wider array of video formats. This is great setting up a PLEX server or for playing videos you have locally that have been acquired by perfectly legal means.</p>
<p>Similarly, a mini PC makes for an excellent retro gaming machine. ROMs for older gaming consoles need hardly any processing power and a mini PC can be set up to run them all, or at least, all of the ones you have acquired by perfectly legal means.</p>

              <p><em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> will reach its first birthday at the end of October, giving cause for everyone to look back at the last year and wonder at how it <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-update-shinedust-trade-token-1851786369">still</a></em><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-update-shinedust-trade-token-1851786369"> hasn’t managed to figure out a workable version of trading</a>. However, with an update due to arrive in time for the anniversary, there are about to be some slight improvements to trades, as well as a new ability to give away spare cards to your friends.</p> <p>Of course, this being&nbsp;<em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>, it can’t just be a nice simple feature that lets you toss a bunch of dupes to your buddy who’s trying to fill in gaps in their collection. Come the new update, you’ll be allowed to receive one card a day, and only up to 4-diamond rarity (as in, no better than a basic ex). Woooooo. We can hand each other our bulk in the slowest way possible. Bizarrely, this new feature is being called “Share,” although there’s no sharing involved: You don’t get to keep the card after you hand it over—it’s what we humans call “giving.”</p>

 <p>Slightly better is an improvement to the <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-tokens-broken-feature-1851753735">continuously dreadful trading in&nbsp;<em>Pocket</em></a>. So determined is The Pokémon Company that no third-party money should be able to change hands when organizing trading that it’s ensured it’s all wildly slow and frustrating to use, and until now has only been available for low-rarity cards. The best you can trade right now are the 1-star cards, or what the real-world sets would call Illustration Rares. But after the next update, trading will include 2-star cards (Special Illustration Rares), and 1- and 2-shiny star cards (Shiny Pokémon). Sadly, 3-star cards (the animated Immersive cards) and crown-marked cards (Golds) still won’t be available to trade, and neither will the damn Promos.</p>

  <p>A couple of other tweaks are coming. Wonder Picks will now start to deliberately include cards that are missing from your collection (although they’ll still make you beg, with a one-in-five chance of actually getting the card you want). It’s also going to slightly simplify Flair, by which you add special twinkly effects to your cards, and no longer require you to spend shinedust to apply them—given shinedust is now required for trading, that surely ensured no one was ever bothering with Flair anymore, likely prompting the change.</p>

 <p>And that’s it. It’s a pretty paltry range of improvements for a game that <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-premium-pass-ui-features-1851705873">still hasn’t addressed some of its most egregious faults almost a year later</a>. Of the 10 issues I listed last year as being most in need of fixing, a somewhat demoralizing 10 of them remain exactly the same. Instead, with the botched addition of trading, the list of issues has only grown far longer.</p>

 <p>For what it’s worth, the best solution for trading I’ve found so far is a mobile app called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mi.poketrade">PokeHub</a>. It lets you create shareable lists of cards you’re after, and look through others, arranging trades and sharing in-game details with strangers. And it works really well—while you’re still stuck with&nbsp;<em>Pocket</em>‘s abysmal one-trade-at-a-time system, people on the app want super-fast exchanges, so you can swap out a bunch of cards at a fair pace. And no, no money changes hands at all.</p> <p>It would remain far better if&nbsp;<em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> just implemented a similar system itself, given it would keep players within its walls and doesn’t involve any elements that would be frowned upon by the developers. It’s bewildering that it hasn’t already happened, and speaks to a situation in which TPCi seems more scared of <em>Pocket</em> than proud of it. It’s certainly bringing in enough cash to fund any improvements/castles they could wish for, but instead everything is so tentative and cautionary, and ultimately reeks of <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-gacha-loot-box-gambling-1851690838">gacha greed</a> instead of player happiness.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon content is ramping up ahead of the huge 30th anniversary of the franchise next year, with new titles and spin-off games announced, along with a host of leaked content that creates a huge roadmap.</p>



<p>Huge leaks in the Pokémon community are nothing new, but the latest batch has seemingly outlined the next half a decade for fans, covering big secrets all the way up until the 11th Generation.</p>



<p>We’ve got a detailed breakdown of all the confirmed Pokémon titles set to release on the horizon, followed by the content said to be in the works, with a full roadmap.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-confirmed-pokemon-game-amp-dlc-in-roadmap">Every Confirmed Pokémon Game &amp; DLC in Roadmap</h2>



<figure><figcaption>More to come. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>







<p>Already confirmed and available to pre-order, Mega Dimension is post-game DLC for Pokémon Legends: Z-A, with Hoopa playing an integral role. From the few reveals we’ve had so far, we know that we’re getting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension-dlc-announced-featuring-two-mega-raichus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two forms of Mega Raichu</a> in the first step of Pokémon the roadmap.</p>



<p>The release window for Mega Dimension has not been announced yet, but it’s likely to either come before the end of 2025 or early in 2026, with other big releases lined up for later in the year.</p>



<h3 id="h-pokopia">Pokopia</h3>



<p>Pokopia is the first confirmed Pokémon title for 2026, with the new spin-off title putting players in control of a Ditto that has assumed a human form. This farm-life sim is a new venture for the franchise, with big comparisons to Animal Crossing.</p>



<p>A release window has not been revealed for Pokopia, though we’ll likely hear confirmation at the big 30th anniversary Pokémon Day, with Pokopia taking a slot earlier in the year before the expected release of Gen 10 in the latter half (more on that later).</p>



<h3 id="h-pokemon-champions">Pokémon Champions</h3>



<p>Pokémon Champions is set to make a big change to the competitive scene of the franchise, which, moving forward, will not be played on the latest instalment of games and instead come in the free-to-play title.</p>



<p>Again, a release window has not been confirmed for Pokémon Champions, but the Pokémon World Championships 2026 VGC section will be played on the title, so it will need to launch early enough in the year for players to get used to it and for any issues to be ironed out.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-leaked-pokemon-games-amp-dlc-in-roadmap">All Leaked Pokémon Games &amp; DLC in Roadmap</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A big twist. Image via Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-pokopia-dlc">Pokopia DLC</h3>



<p>In the latest round of huge leaks for the franchise, DLC for Pokopia <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1977791170093687087" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">was mentioned</a>. No details have been shared on this, nor do we know the release window, but it seems likely that any Pokopia DLC will land before the launch of Gen 10.</p>



<p>Pokopia DLC looks set to be the first big piece of leaked content on the Pokémon roadmap, though there is plenty more to come.</p>



<h3 id="h-pokemon-wind-amp-waves-gen-10">Pokémon Wind &amp; Waves: Gen 10</h3>



<p>Gen 10 in 2026 is all but guaranteed, with Pokémon celebrating a 30th anniversary next year, though it’s still yet to be fully revealed. Similarly to specific release dates for announced titles, expect news to come in February’s birthday bonanza.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-wind-waves-gen-10-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Huge leaks have emerged</a> though, detailing everything from the game’s location to new mechanics, along with big new features that will be elaborated on in future generations of the game. Though a release window is uncertain, expect it to land at the back end of 2026.</p>



<h3 id="h-pokemon-wind-amp-waves-dlc">Pokémon Wind &amp; Waves DLC</h3>



<p>Pokémon has moved away from the previous model of enhanced games or third titles in a generation with extra content to a DLC approach, witnessed in Sword and Shield, then replicated in Scarlet and Violet, and, of course, there’s the Mega Dimension DLC for Legends: Z-A.</p>



<p>In Gen 9, the first part of DLC came almost a year after the launch, with the second part a few months later. It remains to be seen whether a similar approach will be taken in Gen 10, or whether the DLCs will be spaced out more. Expect these to come in 2027.</p>







<p>Reportedly scheduled for either 2027 or 2028, per the leaks, the third game in the Pokémon Legends series will see players return to Galar, the Gen 8 region, travelling 1,000 years in the past. This would be the second major time-reverse in the Legends series, following on from Legends: Arceus.</p>



<p>Again, the release window isn’t set in stone, though it likely depends on where other titles land. The original Legends game released in the first-quarter of the year, while Legends: Z-A releases in Q4. The big difference, however, is Arceus arrived the same year as Scarlet &amp; Violet.</p>



<h3 id="h-pokemon-seed-multi-region-mmo">Pokémon Seed: Multi-Region MMO</h3>



<p>With a reported 2028 or 2029 release window, Pokémon’s big MMO project, said to be internally codenamed as Seed, could be the biggest advancement of the franchise yet by connecting various regions of the Pokémon world together and encorporating MMO themes—which are initially said to be introduced in Gen 10.</p>



<p>The huge connected region is said to incorporate all of the Pokémon regions set in Japan, which are Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, and Sinnoh, alongside Kitakami, which featured in Scarlet &amp; Violet DLC.</p>



<p>A similar approach could then be taken for the European-based regions of Galar, Kalos, and Paldea, though that’s just a theory for now.</p>



<h3 id="h-pokemon-gen-11">Pokémon Gen 11</h3>



<p>Said to be arriving in 2030, which would fit perfectly into the four-year cycle Pokémon has settled into in the modern era between generations, Pokémon Gen 11 is the next big step for the franchise—and it doesn’t seem that far away.</p>



<p>At this early stage, no major details are known about what Gen 11 of the Pokémon franchise could entail, particularly given the huge advancements that are seemingly being planned for the years to come.</p>

                <p>Gearbox Software CEO Randy Pitchford has declared, "We suck" following the launch of the studio's latest game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/borderlands-4-review-too-much-of-an-overcorrection/1900-6418405/" data-ref-id="1900-6418405">Borderlands 4</a>. Why does he believe that? In an interview with <a href="https://www.bbc.com/audio/play/p0m7sd7y" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">BBC Radio 5 Live</a>, Pitchford said Gearbox's mission is "to entertain the world," and the company is only currently reaching a small piece of the pie.</p><p>"There are billions of people in the world. We got a lot of work to do. We're gonna cross probably <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-will-push-franchise-beyond-100-million-sales-gearbox-ceo-says/1100-6534199/" data-ref-id="1100-6534199">100 million units sold</a>, with Borderlands 4, of the franchise. That's awesome compared to a lot of things. But it kinda sucks if your goal is to entertain the world. So I feel like we're just getting started," he said, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-chief-randy-pitchford-says-if-more-developers-better-understood-why-gamers-love-making-decisions-about-loot-wed-have-good-competitors" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as reported by IGN.</a></p><p>Pitchford said that now, in 2025, Gearbox is finally "starting to get pretty good" at making Borderlands games after nearly 20 years. "It feels like we're starting to figure it out. I feel like we've probed a lot of the end points. But I don't think we're anywhere near the end of a journey," he said.</p><p>The latest data reveals that more than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-will-push-franchise-beyond-100-million-sales-gearbox-ceo-says/1100-6534199/" data-ref-id="1100-6534199">94 million copies of Borderlands games have been sold</a>, so Borderlands 4 would have to hit 6 million to push the franchise past 100 million.</p><p>Borderlands 3 sold more than 23 million copies and is 2K's fastest-selling game ever. The top-selling game of all time for 2K is Borderlands 2, which has achieved sales of more than 30 million units. No sales data for Borderlands 4 has been announced as of yet.</p><p>Also in the BBC interview, Pitchford said other studios in the looter-shooter space have failed to compete with Borderlands on a level that he expected them to by this point.</p><p>"If other game designers that were trying to get in on the action, so to speak, understood that, we'd have more competitors, or we'd have good competitors," he said. "But we haven't so far. It's weird. The kinds of people that just want to go after it, they're not thinking about it on that level. They're just putting into motion something because of market analysis. It's not a designer's or creator's drive that's doing it. It's either a business drive or a wishing to be something that you're not kind of drive."</p><p>Pitchford said he "fully expected" after the original Borderlands came out in 2009 that "everyone would be hip to" jumping into the looter-shooter market and that there would be "lots of other games imitating and aping." But, in Pitchford's eyes, this didn't come to bear on the level he imagined.</p><p>There have indeed been many other looter-shooter games that have come to market after Borderlands, including Destiny and The Division, and each has left their own stamp on the market.</p><p>Pitchford is known for making eye-catching comments. Before this, he said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/real-fans-will-find-a-wake-to-make-it-happen-if-borderlands-4-costs-80-says-pitchford/1100-6531677/" data-ref-id="1100-6531677">"real fans" would find a way to buy Borderlands 4 if it were priced at $80</a> (which it was not). After Borderlands 4 launched, Pitchford mixed it up with fans about the game's technical issues, saying people were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/randy-pitchford-remains-defiant-about-borderlands-4-pc-issues/1100-6534798/" data-ref-id="1100-6534798">being "4K stubborn"</a> and that they <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-boss-calls-people-4k-stubborn-disputes-reports-of-performance-issues/1100-6534746/" data-ref-id="1100-6534746">should get a refund if they're not happy.</a></p>

                <p>The last big content drop for Helldivers 2 added new toys to play with and sandboxes to wreak havoc in, but with persistent player grievances about poor performance, studio Arrowhead is delaying future content updates to tackle these issues.</p><p>Speaking in a video interview for the Helldivers 2 YouTube channel, game director Mikael Eriksson admitted that after the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-major-update-introduces-new-hive-world-levels-and-fixes-the-halo-odst-gun-bug/1100-6534405/" data-ref-id="1100-6534405">Into the Unjust update</a> in September, which added terrifying new enemies and labyrinthian cave systems, the game experienced "more issues than [the studio] were comfortable with."</p><p>Eriksson said that feedback from players was "very justified," and that the team was taking the issues seriously "to make sure this sort of thing doesn't happen again."</p><p>"We have made the decision to push some of our content and feature updates a little bit into the future while we're addressing these things to make sure that we can get to a much more stable state that we can believe in," Eriksson announced.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVYKgOunbsA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fVYKgOunbsA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Some of the pain points Helldivers 2 faces can be addressed "fairly quickly," Eriksson said, particularly some of the game's prevalent technical bugs. Improving frame rates on consoles will be a trickier affair, Eriksson admitted, who noted that the studio's "top brains" were working on it.</p><p>Arrowhead has already made "big improvements," a confident Eriksson claimed, and the studio will talk more in depth about these improvements "hopefully quite soon."</p><p>In late September, Arrowhead promised <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-update-planned-for-october-with-bigger-performance-pieces-needing-more-time/1100-6534979/" data-ref-id="1100-6534979">performance-related fixes in "mid-October-ish,"</a> but the studio was working on a "bigger development plan" for the larger issues the game was facing, which included game crashes, audio bugs, and stability hiccups. Eriksson's announcement appears to be part of that plan, but it remains to be seen what concrete fixes the studio will deploy and when.</p><p>The gargantuan install size of Helldivers 2 on PC is also a big topic of discussion, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-dev-explains-why-the-game-takes-up-so-much-space-on-pc/1100-6535217/" data-ref-id="1100-6535217">Arrowhead providing an explanation</a> on why the game takes up so much space and laying out potential solutions.

The game-within-the-game takes place on a table and paper map, where you play cards to deploy tiny figures of monsters, and try to destroy your enemy’s “eye”–basically their main health pool–before they can destroy yours.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Killing Stone - Official Announcement Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-DyiW7B7jZc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Everything in the game is wonderfully physical: pens scratch and figurines rattle, and the sound design comes really close to making you feel like you’re actually touching the objects on the board. You have a limited amount of action points and space to play your various creatures in a row. Some of them are just monsters who do damage, while others have special abilities. I became very fond of the Sacrificial Lamb, a weak sheep I’d basically set up to die to trigger its ability to give me extra action points, and the Immolator, which can be placed on the enemy’s side of the board to damage them as it moves along. Your pieces also have a Reserve slot above the board you can place a piece or power into; these can buff that piece or deploy when that piece is destroyed to give you additional effects. The order you play your monsters and reserves in matters, as they can affect each other, and they also stand as a physical buffer between the enemies and your eye. The best plays are those that strategically arrange your pieces to do multiple things at once, taking care of troublesome enemies while also chaining effects or setting you up for the next turn.</p><figure><figcaption>Aftermath</figcaption></figure><p>On top of these battles is a sort of meta game, which you progress through by picking a path along a paper map. There’s a lot there: there are healing rooms and a place to swap out decks; “familiar” characters like a raven and a dog give you run-long benefits; and you can use chits to “wager” on buffs and against your opponent’s buffs. I liked the way this stuff was dressed up in the whole game’s narrative of deals and bargains with nefarious creatures, though the jargon did sometimes overwhelm me a bit. I definitely didn’t come close to mastering any of it in my time with the demo, but it hints at the ability to really craft your run once you have.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>The wager system (Question)</figcaption></figure><p>My favorite parts of <em>The Killing Stone</em> are how physical everything is, and how strong the game’s world and vibe are. I might be dreadful at the wagering for boons and buffs, but I love how the chits fall with a rattle, and how the system plays with hidden information in a similar manner to an actual game round. I lost continuously to the demo’s first nemesis, but I couldn’t get enough of its evocative design and the metallic clinking of its erector set face.</p><figure><figcaption>Look at this guy! (Aftermath)</figcaption></figure><p>There is a lot going on in <em>The Killing Stone</em>, with its various narratives and multiple mechanics, but they all tie together in a way that feels consistent. <em>Gwent</em> was always “people in this world like to play cards,” but <em>The Killing Stone</em>’s game is a piece of the full game’s narrative as much as a game and story of its own. I’m excited to spend more time with the demo and learn to overcome my fatal instinct in games like this to just click things that look exciting instead of really thinking it all through. Steam Next Fest runs through October 20.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-party-wooooooo"><h3>We’re Throwing A Party, And You’re Invited</h3></a><p>Celebrate our two-year anniversary with us!</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-assassins-creed-reconstruction-ubisoft"><h3>Everything Is Assassin’s Creed</h3></a><p>"You can look at 15-ish games at this point and watch, nearly yearly, the progression toward the world we live in today"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/100-meters-gkids-anime-movie-review"><h3>100 Meters Is A Soulful Gem About The Poetry Of Running</h3></a><p>Studio Rock’N Roll Mountain’s rotoscope take on Uoto’s track manga unearths raw truths and soulful cadence with every thunderous footfall</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/killing-stone-demo]]></content:encoded>

<p>Here at Nintendo Life, we had a perfectly pleasant time with TPC's latest. Our very own Ace Trainer Alana awarded it a 7/10 in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our review</a>, calling the new real-time combat mechanics "the best Pokémon battles have ever felt", but struggling with the whole set up of Lumiose City. Here's a snippet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A should be celebrated for its fabulous real-time combat and its largely smooth jump to the Switch 2, but in condensing things down to one single location, it loses part of the Pokémon magic that Arceus and many other entries managed to amplify.</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="vf32irwF2Do" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5f76a2vljgqx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>And yet, we are not the only outlet which has been getting reacquainted with Kalos; oh no! Reviews are rolling in across the board and there's actually a pretty wide range of opinions.</p>
<p>We've assembled the following round up to give you an idea of the critical consensus, picking out all the different view points so you can get a snapshot image of the overall reception. We should also point out that <em>all of the following are for the Switch 2 version only</em>.</p>
<p>We'll kick things off right at the top of the spectrum, with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/pokemon-legends-z-a-review/">VGC</a>'s 5/5 review billing Legends: Z-A "the best Pokémon game in many years":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In many areas, it feels like a massive departure for the series, with its new battle system and Z-A Royale structure, in particular, paying off, and once again proving that the Legends series is home to the most interesting ideas <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/companies/game-freak/" title="Companies > Game Freak [345 articles]">Game Freak</a> has.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/nintendo-switch/pokemon-legends-z-a-review">TechRadar Gaming</a> went ever so slightly lower in its 4.5/5 review, praising the how the game reinvigorates the classic formula, and packs in a cracking story and soundtrack to boot:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It finds a way to simultaneously mix things up while gripping perfectly to a few core Pokémon pillars such that the end result can feel very different yet very recognisable all at once.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Opting for a 4/5, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/pokemon/pokemon-legends-z-a-review/">GamesRadar</a> vibed with the worldbuilding and battle system, but felt the scope of Lumiose City was perhaps a little too small:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pokemon Legends: Z-A may not be the perfect open world adventure, but its slice of life vibes and brilliant battle system changes are a real delight, and I hope this isn't the last we see of its innovations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.pockettactics.com/pokemon-legends-z-a/review">Pocket Tactics</a> went for a similar 8/10, saying that the focus on battles, solid performance and overall bravery of the damn thing is enough to outweigh its shortcomings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This game might be the bravest and boldest effort from Game Freak in as long as I can remember, and the developer is successful in a lot of ways</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was a 7/10 for <a href="https://www.gfinityesports.com/article/pokemon-legends-z-a-our-review">GFinity</a>, where the outlet found Lumiose City's "claustrophobic" design to be a real tripping point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Revisiting an area in modern times in Legends felt like a good idea when I first started the game, but upon reflection, traveling back to the more ancient time in Arceus felt like a much fresher experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-review">Eurogamer</a> awarded Legends: Z-A a 3/5, describing it as "proof of concept" for a much bigger, better game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What we have is a kind of proof of concept. But the concept is <em>so good</em> that you can't help but feel a little frustrated to be teased with it.</p>
</blockquote>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch version of Pokémon Legends: Z-A is already playable on PC and Android devices via emulators like EDEN.</p>



<p>As showcased in a new video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@tabeneru">tabeneru</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases">EDEN emulator</a> can run the new entry in the popular series launching this week worldwide on PC and even Android devices rather well with the appropriate settings. </p>



<p>On PC, users don't even need a high-end system to run the game at the native 30FPS cap, as the user's system, powered by an Intel Core i5-13500 CPU and RTX 3060 Ti GPU, which is far from being the fastest system configuration, has no trouble running the game smoothly, at least in the shown segment. However, a high-end system is required to push the emulated Switch release of Pokémon Legends: Z-A past its resolution and framerate cap on PC with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44SLbqzH04M&amp;t=2s">the first mod that allows up to 4K at 60 FPS gameplay</a> shared by Youtube user FRANC225. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Although Pokémon Legends: Z-A has yet to officially release, <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-leak-online-early-builds-pokedex-more/">early copies of the game already reached the hands of players</a>, so it's not surprising to see the game already emulated on PC. However, this ability to emulate new titles may soon change. As development shifts to the Nintendo Switch 2 exclusively, it is widely expected that it will take a long time before an effective emulator for the new console becomes available on PC.</p>
