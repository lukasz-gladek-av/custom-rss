                <p>After being announced back at the beginning of the year, the free-to-play role-playing game DC Worlds Collide is officially live. The game is available on the Apple App Store and Google Play for mobile devices and PC. DC Worlds Collide has a lot to offer for DC fans, with over 10 play modes and over 70 characters from the DC pantheon.</p><p>Similar to Marvel Mystic Mayhem, DC fans can choose from over 70 fan-favorite characters and not just A-listers like Superman, but also Zatanna, Cheetah, and Jessica Cruz. The game's story draws from iconic events like Trinity War and Forever Evil, where the Crime Syndicate used Pandora's Box to open a portal to escape their dying planet and invade Earth.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehOprOX2rQ0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ehOprOX2rQ0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Coinciding with the upcoming release of James Gunn's Superman film, that version of Big Blue will be the first new character to join the roster in DC Worlds Collide. He'll be sporting his movie-inspired looks and will be available in-game starting on July 9, quickly joined by Guy Gardner, Mister Terrific, and Krypto, arriving later this summer.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4527278-dcwc-superman%28dcu%291.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4527278" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4527278-dcwc-superman%28dcu%291.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4527278"></a><figcaption>Superman features his costume from the upcoming movie.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4527278-dcwc-superman%28dcu%291.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4527287-dcwc-characterfiles_superman.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4527288-dcwc-convergence.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4527289-dcwc-elitearena.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4527290-dcwc-mainstages.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4527291-dcwc-reinforcements_batmobilegameplay.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4527294-dcwc-warworld_leaderboard.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4527296-dcwc-superman%28dcu%29characterinfo.png" data-ref-id="1300-4527287,1300-4527288,1300-4527289,1300-4527290,1300-4527291,1300-4527294,1300-4527296" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4527287-dcwc-characterfiles_superman.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4527288-dcwc-convergence.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4527289-dcwc-elitearena.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4527290-dcwc-mainstages.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4527291-dcwc-reinforcements_batmobilegameplay.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4527294-dcwc-warworld_leaderboard.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4527296-dcwc-superman%28dcu%29characterinfo.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4527287-dcwc-characterfiles_superman.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4527288-dcwc-convergence.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4527289-dcwc-elitearena.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4527290-dcwc-mainstages.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4527291-dcwc-reinforcements_batmobilegameplay.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4527294-dcwc-warworld_leaderboard.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4527296-dcwc-superman%28dcu%29characterinfo.png"></figure><p>"Players will need to strategize on elements such as character selection, traits, team positioning, order of skills, and more to effectively counter enemy skills, compositions, buffs, and weaknesses," the game's official synopsis reads. "As players progress, they can also collect Artifacts and Reinforcements to further boost their teams, uncover team synergies between characters to unlock unique buffs, as well as experiment with new combinations and interactions to take on even greater challenges."</p><p>Players can challenge six individual bosses from the Crime Syndicate in Evil Falls, face off against other players to climb the leaderboard in Warworld, and join a League to band together with other players in co-op events. Overall, DC Worlds Collide features 12 additional event types and five minigames for players to try out and earn rewards, as well as new characters, and they can even practice weapon training with Deathstroke.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Arcade Archives 2 Air Combat 22 Review - Screenshot 1 of 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157181/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>Namco's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ace_combat_7_skies_unknown_deluxe_edition">Ace Combat</a> series is one of the company's most enduring hits, and has been a solid part of its lineup for decades, selling over 20 million units in the process – yet the origins of the franchise are somewhat murky and certainly not as well known as, say, the <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/guides/best-ridge-racer-games-of-all-time-ranked-by-you">Ridge Racer</a> lineage.</p>
<p>This is somewhat ironic, as Ace Combat began life in the same fiery, amusement arcade cauldron as its car-based cousin – in fact, the very first instalment arrived in the same year that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/">Ridge Racer</a> was born: 1993. However, <strong>Air Combat</strong> was powered by Namco's System 21 polygonal arcade board, which wasn't capable of texture mapping; it would fall to its sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-air-combat-22">Air Combat 22</a>, to deliver an experience that offered more graphical impact. That's the game which is now part of Hamter's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-arcade-archives-game-on-nintendo-switch-plus-our-top-picks">Arcade Archives</a> series on Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, Air Combat 22 used Namco's more powerful System 22 hardware, the same board which made the jaw-dropping visuals of Ridge Racer possible. The end result is a fascinating (if shallow) <strong>Top Gun</strong> simulator which laid the foundations of the Ace Combat franchise.</p>
<figure><a title="Arcade Archives 2 Air Combat 22 Review - Screenshot 2 of 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157182/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Air Combat 22 puts you in the cockpit of one of three planes — the Grumman F-14 Tomcat, Sukhoi Su-27 and the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor (all of them perform exactly the same) — and presents you with three game modes: Cadet, Topgun and Dogfight.</p>
<p>The Cadet mode is playable with or without a tutorial (the latter offers two branching pathways), and guides you through the basics of aerial combat, while Topgun is a far sterner challenge, giving three potential routes to the end and a far wider selection of objectives. Dogfight, meanwhile, places you in several one-on-one duels with the aim of surviving for as long as possible.</p>
<p>Your weapons are a Vulcan machine gun (with infinite ammo) and lock-on missiles (with finite ammo). Using the latter requires you to have a solid lock on your target (the missile literally won't fire until you do), but even then, you might not score a hit, as some enemy planes are capable of releasing countermeasures.</p>
<figure><a title="Arcade Archives 2 Air Combat 22 Review - Screenshot 3 of 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157166/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Taking down enemies with the Vulcan bags you more points, but you need to get in closer to use it effectively. It's possible to accelerate and decelerate using the 'ZL' and 'ZR' buttons respectively, so you have quite a significant degree of control over your aircraft, despite this not being a 'serious' flight sim – something that would transition neatly into the console versions of Ace Combat which were spawned from this game and its 1993 forerunner.</p>
<p>Visually and sonically, Air Combat 22 certainly <em>feels</em> like a game from 1995, and arguably lacks the same impact as Ridge Racer does, even on modern eyes. Still, it runs at a smooth 60fps and controls really well, and it's certainly possible to spot the DNA of the franchise when compared to later entries. As such, fans of Ace Combat will find a lot to like here, even if it's rather basic in comparison.</p>
<p>Like Ridge Racer, Air Combat 22 is limited by the fact that it's very much designed as an arcade experience rather than a home console one, and expert players will see pretty much all there is to see in the space of a day or two. Unlike Ridge Racer, however, there's less reason to return as you don't have the appeal of shaving seconds of lap times, although there is an undeniable attraction to increasing your score and bettering your performance in the Dogfight mode.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Air Combat 22 is arguably more interesting as a historical artefact than it is as a video game, but that's not to say fans of Namco's series won't extract plenty of enjoyment from it. Like stablemate Ridge Racer, it's a very limited experience designed around short-burst 'arcade' play, but it's still entertaining enough to be worth your time and money; hopefully, it sells well enough for Bandai Namco and Hamster to bring other classic 1990s arcade titles to modern systems.</p></section>

They were nice side dishes but no grilled steak. Everyone appreciates a good potato salad or baked mac, but that’s not why they show up to the BBQ. It has been this way with Xbox for over a decade now. </p><p>There’s no shortage of great games but few are exclusive and none of them—not <em>Forza</em>, not <em>Halo</em>, not <em>Starfield</em>—have popped like the biggest exclusive blockbusters on PS5. Unable to conjure a killer app, it’s tried to buy them, starting with <em>Minecraft</em>, but the result is now that the most compelling parts of Microsoft’s portfolio are all available elsewhere.</p><p>If a family member, friend, or some stranger at GameStop asked me if they should get an Xbox, my answer would look like a spreadsheet full of if/then functions. The value proposition of Game Pass remains strong but increasingly mired in asterisks. Genre diversity abounds and there’s early console access to some of the biggest Steam hits around. There is something for everyone on Xbox if they know how, where, and when to look. My answer for whether to get a PS5 would be much simpler: <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>,<em> God of War Ragnarok</em>, <em>Spider-Man 2, </em>a dozen remasters of <em>The Last Of Us</em>. </p><p>These are not the types of games everyone buys a $500 machine for, but they are definitely the types of games a particular kind of person might buy a $500 machine for. The type of person who buys relatively few games—a yearly <em>Madden</em> update and the new <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>—but doesn’t really discriminate between genres and has no franchise loyalty. They want the big, cinematic blockbuster with a gameplay hook just meaty enough to be fun but not so complex it starts to feel like work. These are the types of games that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadgame.substack.com/p/unlocking-the-cheat-codes-to-geoff&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadgame.substack.com/p/unlocking-the-cheat-codes-to-geoff" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">often win Game of the Year at Geoff Keighley’s Game Awards</a></span>, and they just happen to be the type Sony spent the PS4 generation specializing in. </p><figure id="" data-id="23ed8e3a39523204422d2930f994124a" data-recommend-id="image://23ed8e3a39523204422d2930f994124a" data-format="png" data-width="1269" data-height="706" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Phil Spencer appears on stage at E3 2018.

It was a highlight at the 2024 Xbox summer showcase and now it’s canceled, despite Microsoft studios head Matt Booty <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-gaming-859a2221-8d0f-4721-935b-0e87638a0280.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-gaming-859a2221-8d0f-4721-935b-0e87638a0280.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">saying he was excited by what he’d played back in 2023</a></span>. A new <em>Fable</em>, first revealed before the Xbox Series X/S launched, remains a year out.</p><p>The Xbox 360 surged to prominence thanks in part to Bungie’s <em>Halo</em> and Epic Games’ <em>Gears of War</em>. Neither franchise has been the same under Microsoft’s in-house teams. That might be part of why the company keeps acquiring new ones rather than trying to build them itself. But the results have been just as uneven. “If that were the only reason for this wave of cancellations and layoffs, it would be a terrible shame, but a rational reality,” <em>Polygon</em>’s Oli Welsh <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/analysis/610779/microsoft-layoffs-perfect-dark-everwild-mismanagement&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/analysis/610779/microsoft-layoffs-perfect-dark-everwild-mismanagement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote last week</a></span>. “But the darker cloud hanging over the story is that Microsoft has—consistently and repeatedly, over decades—shown it has no aptitude for running the creative industry it just bought half of.”<br></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/latest-round-of-mass-layoffs-at-xbox-begin-with-200-job-1851785492&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/latest-round-of-mass-layoffs-at-xbox-begin-with-200-job-1851785492">A year before he began laying off thousands of staff</a></span> across Xbox’s now-sprawling empire of studios and publishers, Phil Spencer suggested Xbox’s fate was set in stone. The Xbox One generation was too disastrous to recover from.

It was a convenient time for the quality of exclusives to stop mattering. </p><p>Having watched the Switch cruise to being the second best-selling console of all time purely on the back of first-party exclusives like<em> The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em>, and <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>, I’m not convinced that the games don’t matter. When Google shut down its first-party studios in 2021, the developers there asked their boss at the time, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fairgame-ps5-heist-shooter-haven-jade-raymond-delay-1851780961&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fairgame-ps5-heist-shooter-haven-jade-raymond-delay-1851780961">Jade Raymond</a></span>, what that meant for the rest of Stadia, the company’s cloud gaming platform. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gateway/gta-v-pc-next-gen-xbox-ps5-raytracing-update-free-march-1851765673&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gateway/gta-v-pc-next-gen-xbox-ps5-raytracing-update-free-march-1851765673">According to sources present at the time</a></span>, she said something along the lines of “no gaming platform has ever succeed without strong first-party games.” If you build it, they might come. If you stop, they definitely won’t. </p><p>“I’m proud to introduce the creation of a brand new Microsoft studio, The Initiative, led by Darrell Gallagher, a visionary storyteller who has worked across some of the most iconic franchises for over 20 years,” Spencer said back at E3 2018. “This new Santa Monica studio is building a team of world-class talent to create groundbreaking new game experiences.” It was a play for GOTY blockbusters right in PlayStation’s first-party backyard. The Initiative would have “the resources, the platform, and the creative independence to take bigger risks and create  even bolder worlds.” Apparently the risks were too big and the worlds were taking too long. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/xbox-perfect-dark-halo-gears-war-fable-ps5-1851785732]]></content:encoded>

I’ve only seen it offer one unconnected track at most among the listed choices. Picking Random in an online lobby <em>before</em> the recent update always resulted in a three-lap experience. After the update went live, picking Random now incorporates the chances of getting a connecting track from your current location. We don’t know what the odds are for anything, but most people are seeing the intermission tracks a lot more often.</p><p>I’m of the mindset that the function was likely bugged before. Choosing “Random” to limit the choices down to specifically closed-lap races doesn’t sound right when you think about it. This might be a case of something being fixed at the expense of being less fun. Then again, this game gives you vague settings labeled “Connected” and “Open” so who can say how the hell any of this is meant to work. <strong>For now, your safest bet for racing some simple laps online is to select an unconnected track whenever it’s a choice.</strong> If you don’t like the track or maybe don’t even get an unconnected option, go with random and pray for the best.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-bowser-jr-wario-waluigi-koopa-shy-boo-1851785552&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-bowser-jr-wario-waluigi-koopa-shy-boo-1851785552">Here’s Every <em>Mario </em>Villain Outfit You Can Collect In <em>Mario Kart World</em></a></span></p><p>Here’s hoping that <em>Mario Kart World</em> is updated in the future to make this easier and not more difficult…again.

However, we do not have any additional information we can share at this time." Capcom's representative went on to note that there is "a particularly high volume of inquiries" about Mega Man from overseas markets without elaborating any further. </p><p>The company's latest remarks are very similar <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mega-man-hasnt-been-forgotten-capcom-insists/1100-6525220/" data-ref-id="1100-6525220">to a Mega Man update from 2024</a>, where Capcom noted that it is "considering how to create games for it on an ongoing basis." While the classic games in the series are readily available online, there's been no word about any further sequels.</p><p>In 2018, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-mega-man-live-action-movie-is-finally-official/1100-6462263/" data-ref-id="1100-6462263">a live-action Mega Man movie was in development</a> at 20th Century Fox.

			<p>The question of Game Pass profitability has been debated within the games industry ever since the debut of Microsoft's subscription service in June 2017. The way many saw it, Microsoft could use its near-endless pockets to subsidize the service for a while, but not forever. At some point, Game Pass had to become profitable on its own.</p>



<p>Over time, Microsoft has always maintained that Game Pass was indeed profitable and sustainable. In December 2019, Phil Spencer, head of the gaming division, <a href="https://wccftech.com/phil-spencer-on-xbox-game-pass-sustainability-its-doing-very-well-for-us-and-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>:</p>



<p><em>The only concern I ever see is people saying, "Is it sustainable? Can you continue this?" I'll say, Xbox Game Pass right now is doing very well for us and the people who are in it, and it's something … I think it's going to be really interesting, as Xbox launches next year, and it will be an interesting thing as people think about, "Wait a minute, I already have this library of games on this platform." We've never had a console that's launched with a library of games that people are going to have available day one.</em></p>



<p>However, between the slow growth of the subscriber base and the recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studio closures and layoffs</a>, Game Pass is once again under fire by <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-bet-wrong-horse-subscriptions-says-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">analysts</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-unsustainable-harmful-industry-arkane-founder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developers</a> alike who believe that Microsoft may have bet on the wrong horse and that ultimately, it won't be sustainable in the long run.</p>



<p>Now, Chris Dring, former GamesIndustry.biz Editor in Chief and now co-founder of The Game Business, has shared some important details on how Microsoft is allegedly calculating the profitability of the subscription service. Writing on X, he <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1941918116218638368" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>:</p>



<p><em>So costs associated with the Game Pass business is fees paid to third-parties, marketing, service costs… and by that measure, it’s profitable. What they don’t count is the lost revenue that Xbox’s first-party studios are seeing as a result of the service. I have to imagine if first-party studios received similar compensation, that profitability might not be correct. </em></p>



<p>Dring later clarified that he explicitly asked for clarification and was told that first-party costs were not included. Needless to say, that changes a lot, especially now that Xbox first-party studios include not only the likes of The Coalition, Halo Studios (formerly 343 Industries), et cetera, but also Bethesda and Activision Blizzard, two large publishers that own some of gaming's most prized intellectual properties. There's inevitably going to be some lost revenue by putting the likes of Call of Duty, Diablo, and DOOM on a subscription service like Game Pass from day one. How long Microsoft can afford to keep doing that remains to be seen.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-webster">Andrew Webster</a> <span>is an entertainment editor covering streaming, virtual worlds, and every single Pokémon video game. Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>A bigger, more powerful Switch means bigger, more intensive games that take more time and money to make. But as development costs skyrocket across the industry, Nintendo seems to have a plan to keep things in control <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">as it transitions into the Switch 2 era</a>.</p><p>In response to a question during <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/qa2506e.pdf">a recent shareholders meeting</a> about the increased costs of making games for its new console, Nintendo president Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa admitted that “recent game software development has become larger in scale and longer in duration, resulting in higher development costs. The game business has always been a high-risk business, and we recognize that rising development costs are increasing that risk.”</p><p>However, he said that Nintendo’s development teams are “currently devising various ways to maintain our traditional approach to creating games amidst the increasing scale and length of development. We believe it is important to make the necessary investments for more efficient development.”</p><div><p>“The game business has always been a high-risk business.”</p></div><div><p>The early lineup of first-party Switch 2 games has already shown Nintendo being more ambitious with its franchises on the enhanced hardware. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interview/678097/mario-kart-world-nintendo-switch-2-interview-kosuke-yabuki"><em>Mario Kart World</em> introduced an open-world structure to the long-running racing series</a>, while the upcoming <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/694183/donkey-kong-bananza-preview-switch-2"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>adds an impressive destructive element to a more traditional 3D platforming experience</a>. This has come with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/642868/nintendo-switch-2-price-console-games-accessories">increased costs for consumers</a>; <em>World</em> sells for $79.99, $10 more than most Nintendo games, while the Switch 2 itself is $449.99, a $100 jump over the Switch OLED. (In response to a question about these prices making it harder to reach younger audiences, Furukawa said that “we are closely monitoring to what degree the price of the system might become a barrier.”)</p></div><p>Of course, Nintendo is not alone, and the increased scale of game development has been disastrous for many of its competitors. Just last week <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/697125/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-2025">Microsoft’s gaming division was hit hard by layoffs and game cancellations</a>, while high-profile games like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/675923/black-panther-cancelled-cliffhanger-studios-shut-down-ea">Black Panther</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282900/sony-shutting-down-concord-firewalk-studios">Concord</a></em> were both shut down alongside their development studios. Nintendo has been one of the rare exceptions in the floundering game industry, but keeping that up will become increasingly challenging as games get bigger. Then again, Furukawa offered one concrete way of combatting this: more smaller games.</p><p>”We also believe it is possible to develop game software with shorter development periods that still offer consumers a sense of novelty,“ Furukawa said. ”We see this as one potential solution to the concern aboutrising development costs and software prices, and we will explore it from various angles within thecompany.“</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/699429/nintendo-switch-2-game-development-costs]]></content:encoded>

Sure, before that, Duke had starred in some genuinely good games in the ‘90s, like <em>Duke Nukem 3D</em>. Since then, the famous (?) character has mostly stayed dormant. (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/VIZ4v5_j6aE&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/VIZ4v5_j6aE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">He did appear in a digital pinball table in 2023</a></span>.) But he’s finally back. Not in a new game, oh no, but instead as a sad crossover character in a free-to-play game featuring tanks. </p><p>Over the weekend, <em>World of Tanks</em> announced that Duke Nukem was going to be part of the game’s latest battle pass. They did so with a reveal trailer that harkens back to<em> Duke Nukem 3D</em>. It also features John St. John voicing Duke once more, a role he’s had since 1996. But this time, John barely sounds interested in what he’s reading. It’s the same lines again. At one point, Duke Nukem shouts “Shake it, baby!” at a tank. Mr. Nukem, are you okay? </p><p>Anyway, the new Battle Pass Special: Heroes’ Paths event starts on July 10 in <em>World of Tanks</em> and runs until July 21. Actual video game icon Lara Croft <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/4vpDPWJ9iRo&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/4vpDPWJ9iRo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is also part of the new pass</a></span>. Maybe one day her new game from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tomb-raider-lara-croft-crystal-dynamics-amazon-games-1849898949&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tomb-raider-lara-croft-crystal-dynamics-amazon-games-1849898949">Amazon will actually launch</a></span>? </p><p>Neither character makes a physical appearance in the game, as <em>World of Tanks</em> is about giant tanks fighting each other. So don’t expect Duke Nukem running around killing pig cops. Instead, the devs have picked two real-world tanks and modified them to better reflect Duke and Lara. Here’s how the developers describe Duke’s tank:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>[Duke’s tank is] the <strong>TS-6</strong>,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>a Tier IX U.S. assault heavy tank. A powerhouse of destruction, this tank mirrors Duke’s “all guns blazing” approach. It boasts a custom nuclear reactor, enhanced weapon systems, and aesthetic nods to Duke’s arsenal, including laser machine guns and grenade launchers. The tank’s design draws inspiration from classic Duke Nukem weapons such as the incinerator and fire extinguisher.</p></blockquote><p>No pricing information was included in the press release I received. The Heroes’ Paths battle pass is split into two chapters. One will provide 30 stages for Lara Croft, and the other will feature 40 stages for Duke Nukem. You’ll be able to unlock various cosmetics inspired by each character and their franchises. Hopefully, one of those is a good <em>Duke Nukem</em> game.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/duke-nukem-world-of-tanks-battle-pass-lara-croft-sad-1851785719]]></content:encoded>

The publisher didn't provide specific details on the issue, but the game's removal comes shortly after severe hacking claims.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty players are pretty familiar with hacking situations in multiplayer and Warzone, but the ones seemingly plaguing the 2017 World War II shooter weren't the average variety of aimbots or wall hackers. The hacks reportedly being used in Call of Duty: WWII were RCE (Remote Code Execution) attacks, meaning players were losing control of their PCs through a security exploit. A similar attack happened to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dark-souls-servers-shutdown-after-exploit-allows-attackers-to-access-players-pc/1100-6499889/">Dark Souls 3 back in 2022</a>, which led to the entire trilogy being taken offline while the security issue was addressed.</p><p dir="ltr">Some Call of Duty players posted clips on social media to spread awareness on the hacking issue before the game was pulled, showing their PCs being hacked while playing WWII. One of the viral clips from the weekend comes from "<a href="https://x.com/wrioh75753/status/1940597447467979053" rel="nofollow ">Wrioh</a>," who shows an apparent RCE attack during a multiplayer match.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1941286795565728085" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">📢 Call of Duty: WWII<br>Call of Duty: WWII on PC Microsoft Store was brought offline while we investigate reports of an issue</p>  — Call of Duty Updates (@CODUpdates) <a href="https://twitter.com/CODUpdates/status/1941286795565728085?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 5, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">Activision didn't acknowledge these security risks with the game, and it instead made a <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1941286795565728085" rel="nofollow ">Twitter post</a> on July 4 to simply announce Call of Duty: WWII was brought offline on PC while it investigates reports of "an issue."

            <p>Fans eager to hear more about the next <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider game</a> are still being kept rather in the dark, with Lara Croft popping up in a number of other game collaborations instead of her own standalone adventure.</p>
<p>Since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a> wrapped back in 2018, Lara has appeared in the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-animated-tomb-raider-series-is-returning-for-season-2-and-laras-teaming-up-with-an-old-pal">Netflix's animated series</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.brawlhalla.com/news/lara-croft-joins-brawlhalla-patch-3-57">Brawlhalla</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-dutys-lara-croft-mixes-classic-and-reboot-tomb-raider-designs">Call of Duty</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raiders-lara-croft-coming-to-dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lara-croft-coming-to-in-magic-the-gathering-as-a-mechanically-unique-card">Magic the Gathering</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lara-croft-tumbles-into-fall-guys-with-tomb-raider-crossover">Fall Guys</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DLFpqOJIdTN/?igsh=a3U0NHFzNDR1dW4x">Pinball FX</a>, and now even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/world-of-tanks">World of Tanks</a> as a part of a themed Battle Pass chapter. She's <a href="https://worldoftanks.eu/en/news/general-news/battle-pass-special-july-2025/">again being voiced by Keeley Hawes here</a>, in my opinion the best Lara.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lBQNNFi1AQ">new trailer for World of Tanks</a>, which you can see below, does give Tomb Raider fans like myself another look at Lara's unified design. As a reminder, the Tomb Raider team has said it will be uniting the original Tomb Raider games with the recent 'Survivor' trilogy reboots - which began in 2013 - in its next mainline game.</p>

<p>Lara's look in World of Tanks reflects this unification. Her style in the latest Tomb Raider collaboration takes most of its inspiration from the 'Classic Lara' look of old, with her tank top and braid taking pride of place, but she also has her jade necklace from the last three mainline games.</p>
<p>As well as Lara, Jonah from the Tomb Raider reboot trilogy is featured, as is - somewhat to my surprise - Amanda Evert. Amanda first cropped up in Tomb Raider Legend as a former friend turned antagonist of Lara's. Her look in World of Tanks is perhaps most different from her original design, with the goth aesthetic toned down quite significantly. Personally, I have questions about why she is there at all, given her timeline is the Legend Timeline, which is the second game timeline in the Tomb Raider series.</p>
<p>But this question aside, as a fan of Tomb Raider <em>games</em> rather than Tomb Raider collaborations, I really do wish we were being fed more than just Lara Croft in other franchises. I understand the need to keep the character relevant, but at this rate Lara is at risk of being featured more in games that aren't Tomb Raider than games that are. Truth be told, I am becoming increasingly frustrated by the comparative silence around <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crystal-dynamics-announces-next-tomb-raider-game-made-in-unreal-engine-5">the next mainline Tomb Raider game</a>.</p>

<p>In 2022, Amazon said it would provide its "full support" to Crystal Dynamics, as it works on "the biggest, most expansive" series entry to date. Then, in August last year, Amazon Games boss Christoph Hartmann said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-tomb-raider-huge-huge-task-but-things-are-going-well">development on the upcoming Tomb Raider game from Crystal Dynamics and Amazon was "going well"</a>. Since then, however, developer Crystal Dynamics <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-developer-crystal-dynamics-announces-layoffs">has been subject to layoffs</a>, and nothing more has been officially said of the next Tomb Raider entry for some time.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Embracer alluded to a AAA release on its docket, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-plans-to-release-76-different-games-in-the-next-year-despite-previous-layoffs-and-studio-closures">the company previously expected to debut in FY 25/26 but will "likely need a few more quarters to polish"</a>. Therefore, this particular game will likely release the following fiscal year. While Embracer did not specify which game under its umbrella it was talking about, I suspect it was Tomb Raider.</p>
<p>I really hope the Tomb Raider series can continue on successfully without the need to pimp Lara out to other franchises every couple of months. But right now, I am not too sure.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/lara-croft-is-popping-up-everywhere-except-in-a-new-tomb-raider-game]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Wild Sheep Studio has announced a new exploration title called Adorable Adventures, and it is a game where players play as Boris the baby boar who is looking for his family. The events take place in the aftermath of a forest fire, and Boris has to use his nose to sniff out his family across a forest, highlands, and caves where all sorts of activities await.</p>
<p><iframe title="Adorable Adventures - Announce trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/es_AnXYMiA0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The story of Adorable Adventures is told by a forest guard, who narrates the events and the things Boris does. The game is about having a good time and exploring the forest while interacting with its elements. As the game progresses, Boris will be able to interact with various wildlife, complete a herbarium, and take part in some light hearted activities. Adorable Adventures is coming to PC and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3840230/Adorable_Adventures/">can be wishlisted on Steam now.&nbsp;</a></p>

<figure><a title="Pokémon GO 9th Anniversary Artwork" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a6c5290aa667a/pokemon-go-9th-anniversary-artwork.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>Can you believe that the mobile AR game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_go">Pokémon GO</a> is nine years old? We can't; it only feels like yesterday we started taking our phones with us for 'mon-catching trips.</p>
<p>The official <a href="https://x.com/PokemonGoApp/status/1941995623567290393">GO X account</a> shared some brand new artwork to celebrate the 9th anniversary, and it seems to include a couple of hints on what we can expect to see in the coming months.</p>
<p>The artwork, from Pokémon GO's character designer Yusuke Kozaki, has a couple of small hints, but the big one is Paradox Pokémon, a new type of Pocket Monster introduced in Scarlet &amp; Violet on Switch.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2sj2iQyBTQs" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2sj2iQyBTQs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2sj2iQyBTQs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2sj2iQyBTQs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed390852xkuvtw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sj2iQyBTQs" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>These are usually past or future-versions of Pokémon, and in the artwork you can see Ancient Tusks and Iron Treads, the Ancient and Future version of Donphan.</p>

<p>A more vague teaser in the artwork comes from the character with the thumbs-up icon in front of the Metagross; some think this could be hinting at remote trading, while others think its related to emotes. It could mean nothing, of course, but it's more likely a little teaser.</p>
<p>Zygarde's 50% form could be hinting at a new event based on the 'mon — a logical conclusion given that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> seems to be focusing on Order Pokémon, and that's out this October. Mega Butterfree also features, and that Mega Evolution is yet to appear in Pokémon GO. Our guess is we'll hear more about this during the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/the-next-pokemon-presents-is-coming-in-july">Pokémon Presents later this month</a>.</p>
<p>The game has been making headlines throughout the year following <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/niantic-sells-pokemon-go-and-entire-gaming-division-for-usd3-5-billion">Niantic Spatial's decision to sell off its entire gaming division</a> to publisher Scopely — which is part of Savvy Games Group and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund — for $3.5 billion earlier this year.</p>
<p>Since then, the team behind the hugely popular AR game have stressed that the sale won't impact the game and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/pokemon-go-promises-it-wont-introduce-intrusive-ads-or-playtime-restrictions">"intrusive ads" won't be part of the experience</a>. The devs have also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/pokemon-go-doubling-amount-of-daily-remote-raids-has-nothing-to-do-with-new-owners">doubled the amount of daily remote raids</a> players can take part in, but that was reportedly in the works before the sale too.</p>
<p><em>Let us know if you're looking forward to Paradox Pokémon in GO in the comments.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Capcom has cancelled a <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-devs-talk-optimization/">lecture</a> it was meant to give at the Computer Entertainment Developers Conference 2025 event (CEDEC) in Japan on Monster Hunter Wilds PC performance and optimization amid harassment and threats made to developers from players upset with the game's performance on PC.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/capcom-cancels-lecture-about-monster-hunter-wilds-optimization-as-devs-face-threats-and-harassment/">Automaton</a>, the decision to cancel the event is likely a choice made by Capcom to protect the members of its development team who would have been in attendance, though no official reason for the cancellation has been stated. </p>



<p>The lecture was titled "<em>Making 'Monster Hunter Wilds' Run Smoothly! Everything You Need To Know About Optimization</em>," and according to its <a href="https://cedec.cesa.or.jp/2025/timetable/detail/s67ad32469773b/">description</a>, would have delved into Capcom's journey of trying to ensure that Monster Hunter Wilds would run smoothly on the wide variety of machines used by players across the globe.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>' performance on PC has been an issue since the game launched earlier this year. Capcom has made it clear that it is aware of the issues players are facing, and this talk was intended to be part of the company's ongoing work to fix the problems the game has and communicate with players who are having trouble running the game on their devices. </p>



<p>The recent<a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-2-nvidia-dlss-4-amd-fsr-4/"> Title Update 2</a> was also meant to include several fixes for PC players, though not everything was addressed, and there are still a number of bugs and optimization issues that have yet to be squashed. Capcom <a href="https://x.com/MH_Wilds/status/1941110323005857917">released a patch</a> following the Title Update 2, though several issues still persist. According to Automaton, individual members of the Monster Hunter Wilds team have been threatened by players upset over the game's PC performance, along with harassment towards the whole Monster Hunter Wilds team. </p>



<p>Capcom has also published <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/support/faq/information_info2025_0266919.html">a statement on its website</a> regarding harassment and threats to its employees, making it clear that while it takes feedback from players seriously, it will "<em>respond appropriately</em>" to threats and acts of harassment, and in severe cases, it will contact the appropriate authorities and pursue criminal proceedings.</p>

            <p>If you had been planning to play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-ww2">Call Of Duty: WW2</a> - an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> widely agreed by critics to be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-ww2-review">among the games released in 2017</a> - maybe do not do that, for the moment, because certain versions of Call Of Duty: WW2 may randomly show you pornography, send you insulting notepad messages and, at worst, fill your computer with ransomware.</p><!--more-->
<p>As written up by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-ww2-pulled-from-pc-following-reports-of-remote-code-exploit-trolling-players-with-notepad-pop-ups-pc-shutdowns-and-desktop-wallpaper-of-a-lawyer/">PCGamer</a>, Activision have taken the Xbox PC version of the World War shooter offline amid social media reports of a remote code execution exploit, or RCE - this being a vulnerability that lets a hacker meddle with a game's code from afar using the developer's own programming language.</p>
<p>WW2 players have been posting <a href="https://x.com/vxunderground/status/1940639088576811516">screens</a> and <a href="https://x.com/wrioh75753/status/1940597447467979053">footage</a> of peculiar sights and sounds during recent gunshooting expeditions. One message references lawyers <a href="https://www.msk.com/newsroom-news-2847">who were involved in an Activision lawsuit</a> against German companies selling cheat codes for Call Of Duty games. Activision have yet to confirm or deny that these disruptions are due to an RCE, <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1941286795565728085">stating only</a> that they've yanked the game's online while they address an "issue".</p>
<p>Call Of Duty: WW2 recently released on Microsoft's PC Game Pass service, so the apparent hack is precisely timed. The game is still available via Steam and Battle.net - it's unclear whether those versions are also affected, but I would probably hold off loading them up to find out.</p>
<p>Among those commenting on the situation is VX-Underground, a white hat hacker group akin to the Ghostbusters, who claim to have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vx-underground">the largest online repository of malware</a>. The group's admin Smelly has posted <a href="https://x.com/vxunderground/status/1940889734269501446">a longer speculative post</a> explaining why the Call Of Duty: WW2 hullabaloo is probably an RCE situation.</p>
<p>Smelly shares concerns that the attackers are "capable of deploying information stealer malware, a RAT (remote administration tool), or ransomware". But they conclude based on the shared videos and screens that "thankfully, it appears this attacker is primarily interested in memeing and fucking with people." What japes. </p>
<p>I'll let you know as and when Activision comments properly on any of this. In the meantime, maybe resist the call of the Western Front. Play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3659990/hatenet/">hate.net</a> instead. The bots there aren't exactly friendly, but they will not try to encrypt your computer and charge you a bucket of Bitcoin for the unlock key.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-ww2-pulled-offline-amid-hacking-claims-after-it-starts-messing-with-pcs-and-citing-random-lawyers]]></content:encoded>

You can’t hit what you can’t target, you know. <em>Silver Glasses make you immune to this status. You can cure it with Esuna/Esunaga.</em></p><p><strong>Charm</strong>: This status effect removes your ability to control a character temporarily. During this time, they may heal enemies or attack your other characters. <em>Rebuff Locket makes you immune to this status. You can cure it with Esuna/Esunaga.</em></p><p><strong>Confusion</strong>: This status effect removes your ability to control a character temporarily. While under the effect, the character may randomly attack enemies and allies. <em>Peace Ring makes you immune to this status. You can cure it with Esuna/Esunaga.</em></p><p><strong>Death</strong>: This status effect kills a character outright. Ouch. <em>The Safety Ring makes you immune to this status.</em></p><p><strong>Doom</strong>: This status effect places a counter above a character’s head. When it reaches 0, that character will die. Sucks to be them!</p><p><strong>Dread</strong>: This status effect makes it impossible to use Brave or Default. How dreadful. <em>You can cure it with Esuna/Esunaga.</em></p><p><strong>Love</strong>: This status effect causes a character to fall in love with another ally. Because of this, they will receive all of the same damage and status effects of the ally they’re in love with, as well as copy the ally’s moves. </p><p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: This status effect causes a character to be unable to use any actions for a few turns. <em>The Earthing Rod makes you immune to this status. You can cure it with Esuna/Esunaga.</em></p><p><strong>Poison</strong>: This status effect causes a character to take damage on each turn. Come on, you knew this one already. <em>The Star Pendant makes you immune to this status.

You can cure it with Esuna/Esunaga.</em></p><p><strong>Sleep</strong>: This status effect puts a character to sleep, rendering them incapable of using any actions for a few turns. How cozy! <em>Clothespin makes you immune to this status.

The chance of these debuffs vanishing increases, though not at the same rate for each status. Here are the following chances of recovering from certain statuses on your own (by “turn”, we mean <em>your character’s </em>turn, not just any turn:</p><p><strong>Charm</strong>: Charm follows the same pattern as Confuse for auto-recovery. </p><p><strong>Confuse</strong>: You have a 20-percent chance to recover from Confuse on your next turn.

If this set is anything like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards-most-expensive-surge-foils">MTG: Final Fantasy</a>, launch day stock is going to be none existent.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Where To Preorder MTG: Edge Of Eternities</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-edge-of-eternities-preorder-guide">MTG: Edge of Eternities preorders</a> are the exception to the rule in this weeks MTG deals round-up.

                <p>An exciting prospect for the Nintendo Switch 2 outside of just "Switch, but bigger and more" is that the tech under the hood should allow for some more hardware-intensive games on the platform. However, bigger and flashier games could lead to increased development costs, a concern raised in a recent <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/qa2506e.pdf" rel="nofollow ">investors call</a>. To assuage this concern, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa spoke of the ways the company is planning to keep development costs down, noting how it's considering shorter dev periods as a way to do so.</p><p dir="ltr">"Recent game software development has become larger in scale and longer in duration, resulting in higher development costs," Furukawa explained. "The game business has always been a high-risk business, and we recognize that rising development costs are increasing that risk. Our development teams are devising various ways to maintain our traditional approach to creating games amidst the increasing scale and length of development.</p>
