<p>Nintendo's latest finds itself at the top of the pile in its second week, with an extra 14,577 sales pushing it past the 50k mark. Last week's champ, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a> on PS5, has dropped down to fifth this time, leaving room for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> to retake spots on the podium.</p>
<p>All in all, it's a rather quiet one, this week (we'll see how much <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokopia</a> can shake things up next time).

<p>The hardware charts show no signs of change at the top of the standings, with Switch 2 and Switch OLED still dominating the market. There has been a noticeable drop in S1 sales this week, mind, with the standard model selling fewer than 1,000 units.</p>
<p>Not that this harms the system's SKU combination. The three S1 options combine this week for 28,426, and the PS5 models come in at 10,343.</p>

            <guid>1447180</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Remedy</strong> has delivered <a href="https://www.alanwake.com/story/alan-wake-remastered-pc-update-2026/">a new update</a> for <strong>Alan Wake Remastered</strong> on PC, and it is arguably one of the most significant updates the game has received in a long time, because this update finally adds <strong>HDR</strong> to the PC version.</p>



<p>The addition of HDR is the big highlight, but it's not the only one in terms of visuals and some much-needed quality of life updates. For speedrunners and anyone who simply loves the game and is playing it again for the umpteenth time, you can now <strong>skip the intro cutscene</strong> to get into the game faster. Not that <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-remastered-the-plot-thickens/">Alan Wake</a> is a game where you want to be skipping cutscenes (especially if you're playing it for the first time), but for veterans it's a much-welcomed addition.</p>



<p>Update version 1.33 also includes improved <strong>DLSS</strong> support, fixes an issue with FOV scaling, unlocks the framerate further so you can now play it at <strong>240FPS</strong> if you've got the right hardware, and fixed some polygonal rendering errors and depth buffer issues which, according to the patch notes, "<em>has <strong>greatly reduced the amount of visual glitches</strong></em>."</p>



<p>The update also brings some fixes for ultrawide users, improves the DX12 rendering path, and introduces some UI fixes. The star of the show though for this update is, once again, the addition of HDR, particularly because it comes from one of the video game industry's biggest HDR advocates.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>A "little" patch I worked on that alignes the experience to modern PC gaming.<br>Enjoy the light and shodow in HDR!</p><p>I'd love to hear what you think of the new alternative camera mode. <a href="https://t.co/tH7ZIEOnVr">https://t.co/tH7ZIEOnVr</a></p></div>— Filippo Tarpini (@FilippoTarpini) <a href="https://twitter.com/FilippoTarpini/status/2027029309009854636?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 26, 2026</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p><strong>Filippo Tarpini</strong> is a veteran graphics programmer who has worked in the video game industry for years and is a huge advocate for HDR implementation in video games, many of which still arrive without support for the feature.<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-hdr-gaming-interview-veteran-developer-explains-its-sad-state-and-how-hes-coming-to-its-rescue/"> </a>Wccftech spoke<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-hdr-gaming-interview-veteran-developer-explains-its-sad-state-and-how-hes-coming-to-its-rescue/"> </a>with Tarpini this past December about HDR and the state of the feature as it relates to the video game industry, and how he's trying to push for it to be adopted more broadly.</p>



<p>"<em>I believe that somehow gamers aren’t aware of the value HDR adds to the gaming experience," </em>Tarpini told Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo.<em> "Marketing pushes you to care about having the hottest GPU, but nobody is advertising HDR, given there's no single producer behind it. GPU manufacturing companies often approach game studios with proposals to implement Ray Tracing or features exclusive to their GPUs, but none of that happens for HDR. For the reasons above, developers are under the impression that HDR is a niche technology and isn’t worth the effort. As of late 2025, that stance is very outdated!</em>"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Today, we’re talking about the future of Xbox. Phil Spencer, a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21611412/microsoft-phil-spencer-interview-xbox-series-x-launch-decoder-podcast">two</a>-<a href="https://www.theverge.com/23459189/phil-spencer-microsoft-activision-call-of-duty-xbox-playstation-candy-crush-apple-fortnite-vr">time</a> <em>Decoder</em> guest who’s led Xbox for more than a decade, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/882241/microsoft-phil-spencer-xbox-leaving-retirement">retired last week</a>.</p><p>But in a shocking twist, his deputy and long-assumed successor, Sarah Bond, is also out too, and the Xbox division is now in the hands of Asha Sharma, one of Microsoft’s AI executives with no prior game industry experience. It’s a major leadership transition that suggests Microsoft wants to make serious changes to its gaming division, which owns franchises like <em>Halo</em>, <em>Call of Duty</em>, and <em>Minecraft</em>.</p><p>There is no better person to talk to about all of this than Tom Warren, a senior editor here at <em>The Verge</em> and author of the excellent <em>Notepad</em> newsletter. Tom is actually on parental leave right now, but Microsoft has a longstanding habit of disrupting his well-earned time off with major news. So, Tom was gracious enough to come on the show after he <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/883015/microsoft-xbox-new-ceo-shakeup-notepad">published a major scoop</a> about what exactly went down at Xbox this past week.</p><p>There is a lot to say about Xbox: The story of the console and Microsoft Gaming is a complicated one, with a lot of twists and turns since it made its big splash in the video game industry 25 years ago. Yet for a majority of that time, it’s been stuck in third place, behind Nintendo and PlayStation. That’s a surprising thing to say for a division of a company worth trillions of dollars that also owns some of the most celebrated gaming properties in all of entertainment.</p><div><p><em>Verge</em> subscribers, don’t forget you get exclusive access to ad-free <em>Decoder</em> wherever you get your podcasts. Head <a href="https://www.theverge.com/account/podcasts">here</a>. Not a subscriber? You can <a href="https://www.theverge.com/subscribe">sign up here</a>.</p></div><p>So Phil Spencer, who started at Microsoft in the late 1980s and took charge of Xbox in 2014, was given the job of trying to turn the division around. Since then, Spencer has tried numerous moves: the Netflix-style Game Pass subscription service; a major push into cloud gaming; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889421/microsoft-acquires-activision-blizzard-call-of-duty-warcraft-king-gaming-buy-news-reports">buying Activision Blizzard King</a>, the maker of <em>Warcraft</em> and <em>Candy Crush</em>; and many, many different iterations of Xbox hardware. As of last year, there are even plans to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/805174/halo-campaign-evolved-remake-xbox-ps5-release-date">bring <em>Halo</em> to PlayStation</a> — something game industry insiders thought was basically impossible just five years ago.</p><p>But as you’ll hear Tom explain, the game industry has been changing faster than Xbox has been able to transform itself, and almost none of Spencer’s strategies have really clicked. Xbox is still far behind Nintendo and PlayStation, and on PC, it still stands in the shadow of Valve, which runs the dominant Steam store and now makes the Steam Deck handheld. Microsoft has spent tens of billions of dollars trying to acquire its way to a stronger position against the rise of <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>Roblox</em>, mobile giants like Tencent, and a zero-sum war for attention dominated by apps like YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok. And yet the company has very little to show for all of that.</p><p>Today, Spencer’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/883159/phil-spencer-xbox-game-pass">grand vision of 100 million Game Pass subscribers</a> streaming Xbox games to whatever screen they want using the cloud still feels out of reach. But, as Tom says, it’s not lost forever — Xbox is far from dead, and there is still hope yet that new leadership can take some big swings and make something happen again.</p><p>Okay: <em>Verge</em> senior reporter Tom Warren on the future of Xbox. Here we go.</p><p><em>This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. </em></p><p><strong>Tom Warren, you’re a senior reporter at <em>The Verge</em>. You’re currently out on paternity leave, but Microsoft just brought you back.</strong></p><p>Yep. This happens every time I take a vacation or leave. Microsoft decides, “We’re going to do something massive and ruin Tom’s life.”</p><p><strong>Just punishment for all of the scoops you’ve dropped on this company over the years. So this week, as you were playing with your beautiful new baby, Microsoft initiated a major shakeup at Xbox, something we’ve seen coming for a little bit, but maybe not on this scale or this magnitude. Describe what happened at Xbox this week.</strong></p><p>Phil Spencer, the longtime CEO of Microsoft Gaming, technically, but Xbox chief is what he’s known as, is retiring, so he is leaving Microsoft. Sarah Bond, the Xbox president, is also leaving Microsoft, and then they’re actually promoting Asha Sharma, from the CoreAI side of Microsoft, to the CEO of Microsoft Gaming.</p><p>So she’s replacing Phil Spencer, essentially. So it’s big news, a big shakeup, should we say, of Xbox. I think with Phil Spencer, it’s been a long time coming, right? I think Xbox fans have expected that retirement, but perhaps not so much Sarah Bond’s leaving.</p><p><strong>And this is, I think, the shakeup, right? We knew Phil was going to retire. He’d been messaging that for some time. He’s been there for a long time. He’s a Microsoft lifer, really. Phil’s been on this show before, and we’re going to run some clips from his past interviews on <em>Decoder</em>, because I want to get your take on what happened between those interviews and now. </strong></p><p><strong>At a very high level, we knew Phil was going. Is it that everyone expected Sarah to be his successor, and that didn’t happen, and that’s the surprise here?</strong></p><p>I think there are two surprises, right? One is obviously that Sarah wasn’t named Xbox chief and that Asha is the successor, because that was a quiet surprise and a surprise higher, really. But yeah, Sarah has always been the number two. She’s always traveled with Phil and always been the face of Xbox over the past couple of years as Phil has... I’d say he’s stepped back a little bit publicly since the Activision Blizzard acquisition.</p><p>So Sarah’s become the face of Xbox during that time, and she took over the platform work, the hardware work. So whenever there was any mention of the next-gen Xbox, it was Sarah who would come out and talk about it and not Phil. So that’s a change in itself, right, because it’s usually Phil. So I think everyone just thought, “Okay, well she’s being prepped to be Phil’s replacement eventually, whether it be a couple of years, five years, whatever,” and it didn’t happen.</p><p>Behind the scenes, I know that Xbox fans had heard, and expected, that this was going to happen, that Sarah Bond would be the heir apparent. But for a good year or so, I’ve been hearing different things about Sarah Bond, different from what perhaps the public perception is of her. So to me, it wasn’t a surprise. I was not surprised to see her not named, but I think it was more of a surprise to see Asha named. That was a surprise to me.</p><p>I know Asha a little bit. I’ve spoken to her a few times, but she’s like a non-gamer. She’s very straight about that and honest about it, but not that that really matters, I don’t think, to be a CEO, really, to be honest. But to Xbox fans and that gaming segment, if they see a non-gamer, it’s like... Particularly with Xbox, I think, because Phil has instilled that over the years, so they’ve come to that expectation. So that was the surprise of it, but I don’t think Sarah Bond was a surprise to me.</p><p><strong>I want to come to Asha, the new leadership, and particularly the Microsoft AI of it all, because that seems like an important piece of the puzzle. I just want to stick with Phil and Sarah for one more second. There’s the reporting you have done about Sarah personally, and her skills as manager and potentially CEO, and then there’s Phil and the strategy he pursued for Xbox and Microsoft Gaming. </strong></p><p><strong>A huge part of that strategy is making Microsoft Gaming as big as it is, bigger than Xbox, acquiring Activision Blizzard King, and doing all the other acquisitions of the studios they’ve done. I look at this, and I say, “Well, it doesn’t matter if Sarah was the best manager or the worst manager. The strategy that she was a part of failed.”</strong></p><p><strong>I see this, and I say, “Okay, if I’m Satya Nadella,” or more importantly, “Amy Hood, the CFO of Microsoft, and we’ve done some of the biggest acquisitions in history, and certainly the biggest acquisitions in Microsoft history. None of this came to anything. We gotta reboot this whole thing.” Does that feel as important inside Microsoft as maybe Sarah wasn’t the right person?</strong></p><p>It’s a couple of things. Obviously, Microsoft Gaming has ballooned now, right, because it’s got Bethesda, and Activision Blizzard has made it bigger than ever before. And then you’ve got this tension of Microsoft: the corporate Microsoft of Satya Nadella and Amy Hood, putting the pressure on that new division to return the money that they’ve invested into this project, essentially, through profit margins.</p><p>So they’ve cranked that pressure up over the past couple of years, and it forced Phil, Sarah, and everyone under them to then respond. They’ve done these studio closures, they’ve done cuts, they’ve done price increases. They’ve tried to accelerate getting more people using export services, essentially.</p><p>That became the strategy, like, “Okay, we need to get to TVs, we need to get to mobile,” and all this stuff. And there was a lot of, I guess, trying to rush that, it felt like, and forgetting that the console was their base of building up Game Pass and their base of taking those people and perhaps moving them elsewhere, and user acquisition, growth. And it just feels like they tried to rush that, and they did the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24296420/microsoft-this-is-an-xbox-marketing-campaign-xbox-everywhere">“This is an Xbox” campaign</a>, which was just super strange. It was trying to say that the phone was an Xbox, and it was borne out of the idea that they needed to speed up profitability. They needed to get more revenue, get more growth, and improve those margins, essentially.</p><p>So when you’re trying to pin blame on whoever it is, it comes from the top. Satya and Amy are pushing these margins, and I think they’re slightly unrealistic in the context of gaming. They’re not the margins that Sony has, for example. They’ve put the pressure on. Phil, I think, has stepped away a little bit over the last couple of years, so not so laser-focused on Xbox, and then that’s allowed Sarah to have a lot of power over Xbox and accumulate marketing power and do the “This is an Xbox” campaign, in her own org.</p><p>It just hasn’t gone well. It hasn’t gone well for consoles, even if you argue that Microsoft perhaps doesn’t care about selling consoles, which maybe they don’t. I think they probably thought that they could replace them with cloud and mobile a little bit quicker.</p><p><strong>Well, so actually this is my big question. And this is, again, the reporting you have about Sarah as a manager and a leader, but then well, it’s Microsoft. All Satya and Amy care about is mobile and cloud. That’s not even the AI part of it. This is a business that runs huge cloud services in Azure and needs a new foothold in mobile. And they basically bought </strong><strong><em>Candy Crush</em></strong><strong> to get a bunch of mobile revenue, and of course, that’s what they wanted to do. </strong></p><p><strong>It feels like the decision is not so much about Phil Spencer and Sarah Bond. It’s “this whole strategy failed, and now we’re going to try a new one,” and I’m just curious if you have insight into the balance. How much is it “The strategy failed, we just need a new regime,” versus, “We need a new strategy, and Sarah specifically cannot execute a new strategy”?</strong></p><p>I don’t think they’re going to change the strategy all that much, because the strategy makes sense in a way. You want to get to mobile, you want to get to cloud, and that’s how you’re going to get more users ultimately into your system without selling enough consoles, essentially. So I don’t think the strategy is terrible, but I think the execution has been. Over the past couple of years, I think that’s been the problem predominantly, which is the execution of the strategy. The messaging publicly has been pretty bad. I think it’s more of a regime change that’s needed to bring some element of people who understand user acquisition. And I think that’s where Asha is coming in.</p><p><strong>Let’s talk about Xbox strategy as a whole, because if you’re saying it’s not changing, it’s worth taking a beat to just understand what the goal has been. And I would say that since 2017, Phil Spencer has been very clear that where he wants to get to is everyone is subscribed to Game Pass, you can play Game Pass games anywhere because they’re streaming from the cloud, and we’re going to get out of this race of console generations and exclusives. Because they essentially lost to Sony, permanently lost to Sony. There was no coming back with a new generation.</strong></p><p><strong>Did that work? I mean, I think we know now there’s executive turnover; it didn’t work. But did it ever work? Was there ever a glimmer of it working?</strong></p><p>So, going back to where it all started, this mess with Xbox essentially is the Xbox One, when they failed that sort of era. And what happened at that time is the PlayStation-</p><p><strong>This is 2013; this is over a decade ago.</strong></p><p>This is 2013, yeah. And that led up to kind of 2017 and the launch of xCloud and all that sort of stuff. But going back to that sort of era, they lost that generation, and it was a huge cost to them, because that was the generation that people started their digital libraries that weren’t on a PC. People on PlayStation have built up those libraries. They’re not willing to move away from those libraries now. They knew they’d lost that real key generation.</p><p>So the response was, “Let’s do Game Pass because that will allow people to bring their games to different devices, this whole cloud vision, mobile, et cetera.” I think that was the only kind of response they could give, and it was designed to be consumer-friendly, right? You got day one games that they published immediately, so they took a bit of a risk. It was quite a bold move, really, to do that. And still, Sony doesn’t do day one games, for example. So they took a risk.</p><p>The problem with Game Pass is that they’ve had to fuel it with content, right? They’ve done all these acquisitions, Bethesda, Activision, and there are nameless others as well. But the problem then with Game Pass is that you’re giving your games away with a subscription, but you need to scale that up, right? It needs to hit a certain number of million people that you’ve got that concurrent revenue every quarter, and you can rely on where it isn’t cannibalizing or eating into the traditional sales of those games that fuel the costs for developing those games. And frankly, it’s just getting more complicated to develop games these days, and a lot more expensive.</p><p>So they’ve had those issues with Game Pass, and ultimately, I think the strategy was to respond to try and get that growth, to try and scale up this idea of Xbox on all devices. And the way they put it was “3 billion gamers,” right? That was the launch of xCloud. And remember, xCloud, now it’s called Xbox Cloud Gaming, was originally a mobile play. So it was literally to try and get people into the idea of playing via streaming on mobile with these attachments to your phone essentially.</p><div><p><strong>It’s worth noting that they <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/671409/microsoft-xbox-mobile-store-delay-apple-epic-court-case">ran into Apple’s App Store rules</a>. They were not able to do this in a way that actually worked.</strong></p></div><p>Exactly. So they hit a bunch of regulatory hurdles. They had to launch it as a xbox.com/play in your browser, so you couldn’t get an app or anything like that. That completely knocked them back, right? Even when they were trying to playtest it, Apple was on the test flight, saying, “No, you have to change this.” They were very restricted in what they could do. So that kind of put their strategy back. Now, who do you blame for that?</p><div><p><strong>[Laughs] I think you can blame Apple in a very significant way. There are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/21/24107633/apple-streaming-super-apps-doj-lawsuit">pretty major antitrust ramifications of that </a>that Apple’s still feeling.</strong></p></div><p>Right. And then fast-forward from that point, from launching xCloud and having all those issues, to a couple of years ago, and they’re still trying to get all of that resolved, right? They still want this cloud gaming app. But they’re also now trying to get a store in there, essentially, is the idea. They’re going to have an Xbox mobile store.</p><p>So we’ve moved on from having an Xbox Cloud Gaming app to something more ambitious now: “We want to do a store, we want to sell content in there directly to people.” And there was the promise that the app is going to arrive from both Phil and Sarah, to be fair. But then Sarah <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/9/24153245/microsoft-xbox-mobile-gaming-store-july-launch">promised it was going to launch in a month in an interview</a>, and that was two years ago, I’d say, and it hasn’t happened.</p><p>A lot of that idea of going for mobile recently and trying to do this cloud store thing has just been over-promising and under-delivering, and relying on regulatory change that just hasn’t come. Or it’s come, and whether it be Google or Apple, they’ve appealed it, right? They’ve just pushed it down for so many more months.</p><p>So yeah, so they’ve had all these hurdles with this strategy, but I think ultimately, Game Pass has a problem where it fundamentally will eat into those margins of studios. And if they can’t scale it up, then they have to increase the cost of it. So again, we saw that last year, prices are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789424/xbox-game-pass-premium-essentials-ultimate-price-increase-changes">now up 50 percent for Game Pass Ultimate</a>.</p><p>They’ve been doing all these things where they respond to this strategy with a goal of either increasing the revenues or scaling it up, and it just hasn’t been going smoothly, especially — let’s be honest — over the past couple of years.</p><p><strong>When Phil Spencer was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23459189/phil-spencer-microsoft-activision-call-of-duty-xbox-playstation-candy-crush-apple-fortnite-vr">on the show in 2022</a>, I asked him about this vision that the future of Xbox is Netflix. Here’s what he had to say: </strong></p><div><blockquote><p><strong>NILAY PATEL: <em>Then there’s the other side, which is, “Man, it would be really cool if everyone just paid us $15 a month all of the time,” and the games come out and everyone’s happy. That base of revenue is recurring and is a little more stable than hits and console generations. Is that the move? That seems like where you have been building for a long time, but it’s harder to get there than maybe anyone anticipated.</em></strong></p><p>PHIL SPENCER: <em>We don’t have this vision of everybody paying us $15 a month. We think the subscription is an interesting business model for certain kinds of games and for certain customers. I really see it as diversifying how people build their library of games or how creators reach the customers they want to reach with the content that they build. It will always be part of the business, in my view. I think people buying and owning their games will be an important part of the business for years and years to come.</em></p><p><em>Free-to-play games with post-sale monetization, add-ons, and battle passes that those teams have figured out will be a significant, probably majority of the business for a decade plus. Subscription will augment that. Really, that’s the extent of it. We are not building towards a world where subscription is in any way dominant or predominant on our platform. We think for certain customers in certain markets with certain economic livelihoods, where they are managing their cash flows, subscriptions can be very valuable.</em></p></blockquote></div><p><strong>Even as Phil was saying that to me, I was thinking, “I don’t believe you, but you’ve gone all in on all of these moves to get recurring revenue.” And we were having that conversation in the context of them buying Activision, and </strong><strong><em>Candy Crush</em></strong><strong> is the most stable recurring revenue you can get. It’s endless downloadable content, it’s endless power-ups, it’s people paying money to literally play the game every day. Did you have the same reaction to them saying their goal was not to get to $15 a month from every single Xbox gamer?</strong></p><p>The interesting thing is, when was that? Was it in 2022 that you spoke to him?</p><p><strong>Yeah, it was 2022, after the Activision acquisition announcement. </strong></p><p>Yeah. So I think that year was quite pivotal internally. That was when they realized that Game Pass wasn’t going to do those numbers. They’d hit a ceiling on console, and they didn’t have the mobile growth that they were expecting. And internally at that time — I think it was 2021 or 2022 — they did a slide deck with the hardware gaming team, which leaked in the FTC trial, and it said the ambition was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/12/24067370/microsoft-xbox-playstation-switch-games-future-hardware">100 million people on Game Pass by 2030</a>.</p><p>A lot of that growth was through Series S and X. That was the desire, right? But some of it was also cloud and mobile, like a chunk of it. And obviously that’s not going to happen unless something crazy happens in the next four years, right? That growth is just not there for them at the moment. I think the last time Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/15/23570040/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-subscriber-numbers-34-million">reported the number, it was 34 million</a>.</p><p>So I think that’s the ceiling that they’re at at the moment. The messaging changed in 2022, basically from “Game Pass is our thing,” to “Well, it’s going to be 20 percent of Xbox content and services revenue. We don’t see it being much bigger than that.”</p><p><strong>And that’s when they bought Activision, right?</strong></p><p>Yes.</p><p><strong>That interview was after they’d announced the deal. It was before it closed, before regulatory approval and all that. But their thesis for buying Activision was, “We need to be a bigger player in mobile because that’s where the new gamers are, and Activision has all these mobile games. And actually, Call of Duty, which is what everyone is focused on, is the least of our concerns here. What we’re after is King, we’re after Candy Crush and all of the mobile IP that Activision has to offer us.”</strong></p><p><strong>I’m looking at it from an outsider perspective. I don’t think this has worked out. I don’t think this has played out well for them. What do you think?</strong></p><p>It’s still early days, and they’ve consumed it in a way that it’s hard to tell, right? This is the classic thing with Microsoft’s financials. Every quarter, they hide something else that’s not quite working. They’ve done Surface devices; they used to do Surface revenue. Now it’s Windows, OEM, and devices. So they bundle that stuff when it’s not quite working.</p><p>I think we’ll know if it’s not quite working when they start doing tricks like that. But at the moment it’s still too early to say. The mobile side, as I said, with the Xbox mobile store earlier, I think the King stuff would’ve definitely played heavily into that. They could have sold exclusive content in that store and not had to pay that 30 percent cut to Apple and Google and Valve, et cetera. So I think there was a vision for that to be additive to the business and the growth and everything. But yeah, I mean, the mobile stuff is still… I don’t really know their mobile strategy.</p><p><strong>Actually, Phil was clearest about this <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23459189/phil-spencer-microsoft-activision-call-of-duty-xbox-playstation-candy-crush-apple-fortnite-vr">when he was on in 2022</a>. Let’s play that clip because I’m curious to see your reaction to this in the context of the news today: </strong></p><div><blockquote><p>PHIL SPENCER: <em>In terms of the Activision opportunity — I keep saying this over and over, and it is true — it definitely starts with a view that people want to play games on every device that they have. In a funny way, the smallest screen that we play on is actually the biggest screen when you think about the install base in a phone.</em></p><p><em>Mobile is a place where if we don’t gain relevancy as a gaming brand, over time the business will become untenable.</em></p><p><em>That’s just a place where if we don’t gain relevancy as a gaming brand, over time the business will become untenable. We’re not alone in seeing this; this is true for any of us. If you’re not able to find customers on phones, or on any screen that somebody wants to play on, then you really are going to get segmented to a niche part of gaming where running a global business will become very challenging.</em></p></blockquote></div><p><strong>So I listen to that, and I think, “Well, Nintendo exists. They seem to be doing just fine without being on phones.” Sony is running what seems like a fine business in the PlayStation without running on phones. And then right next to all of this, arguably the most interesting category of gaming devices in the past five years is Steam Decks and Steam Deck-alikes, which are all running Windows games better on Linux than on Windows.</strong></p><p><strong>I’m actually kind of at a loss here. There’s this desire to put mobile games on Apple’s platforms, on Apple’s terms, and this very clear statement that if they don’t do that, over time the business will become untenable. And then the rest of the industry is not doing that at all, and they seem to be fine. How do you reconcile those ideas?</strong></p><p>Obviously, with Nintendo, they have a strong collection of IP that they can leverage, they can be exclusive, and they’re always putting out great content that people buy the hardware for. They don’t have a problem there. Microsoft’s gaming output over the last decade hasn’t been the strongest. Recently, it’s gotten a lot better, but they didn’t have the respect of the industry for their content either. They just don’t do the sort of storytelling that Sony does with PlayStation games. They don’t do that sort of content.</p><p>So they’ve had a content problem, which is why they’ve had all the acquisitions. But I think with the mobile stuff, it’s like… What Phil is essentially saying here is that we need all this content to pull eyes away from TikTok, because no one of a certain age is buying our console. And they’re worried that people my age, 30s, 40s, they’re the people that are keeping the consoles, but no one in their 20s right now is buying a console. That’s their worry. And then the next generation is not going to buy consoles.</p><p>And that’s starting to impact Sony as well. It’s not a unique thing for Microsoft. I don’t know so much about Nintendo because they are very unique, definitely with the Switch, but I think that’s Microsoft’s worry, and that’s driven this whole thing for content. We need content. We need a way to get people on mobile. We need to meet people where they are.</p><p>This whole thing of playing across different devices, on TV or Xbox Cloud Gaming. But the reality of it is that where they’re at now with Xbox Cloud Gaming — it’s their vehicle for cross-platform, no doubt — mobile is a small percentage of people who actually play on it. And originally, it launched as a mobile service. It was only mobile. That was their play.</p><p>Most people who play on Xbox Cloud Gaming are playing on an Xbox One or an Xbox Series S or X. Xbox Ones can’t play the games because they’re exclusive to Series S and X now. So I think their problem is they’re stuck with that amount of loyal customers. It’s not a problem. It’s good to have loyal customers, but they want that growth. They’ve acquired all these companies. They’re expecting to be better at mobile, better at cloud. But Apple and Google have not allowed them to do that.</p><p>We all know why they won’t open up their stores. If they did, Microsoft and Sony would completely dominate, and they wouldn’t have a store for one of the most lucrative revenue streams on the app store. So I think that the key thing is that they can’t get to mobile easily. And they’ve tried to work around it, and they’ve done Cloud Gaming and that sort of stuff, but ultimately, they do need an app in the app store like everyone else that allows you just to easily buy a game and stream it. That’s their goal. That’s what they want. They’re nearly there on Android.</p><p><strong>It is worth pointing out, we say it a lot, but it’s always worth pointing out again, the Apple Services revenue is not severance. It’s not Ted Lasso. It’s 30 percent of in-app purchases in games. </strong></p><p>It’s pretty much games.</p><p><strong>The biggest chunk of Apple’s fast-growing services revenue is in-app purchases in games. And they are never going to give that up unless literally governments of the world demand that.</strong></p><p>It’s going to be a really messy fight for them to give that up. But for some reason, Microsoft keeps thinking that they’re going to do it.</p><p><strong>[Laughs] Well, look, I mean, I get it. If you can buy King and you get Candy Crush, and then you can lawyer your way into immediate 30 percent margin growth, that’s a good play. It just seems like they couldn’t pull it off.</strong></p><p>They’ve seen that there was some regulatory pressure recently, but it’s not enough for what they want to do.</p><p><strong>We’ve talked about Phil as the CEO of Microsoft Gaming, and it’s easy and tempting to collapse that to just the Xbox. We’ve talked about how it’s important now, especially since the Activision deal is closed, that they run a bunch of mobile games too. They’re making some money on mobile, but it’s hard to know how much.</strong></p><p><strong>Right next to that is Windows gaming. And maybe now the RAMpocalypse means there won’t be gaming PCs anymore. And the idea that NVIDIA is going to sell every GP in the world to Sam Altman could mean there won’t be gaming PCs anymore. </strong></p><p><strong>But that was more than a flicker during all of this. People are buying gaming PCs, playing Windows games, and eventually buying Steam Decks. Just our own audience. Every time we covered a Steam Deck or something that looked like a Steam Deck, we could tell people really liked these things. Why did they ignore that opportunity? Because it seems like it was right there for them the entire time.</strong></p><p>God, this could be another podcast episode. They have a history of Windows failures, which is why Steam is the most popular now. I think they never really got Windows gaming and PC gaming right. I don’t think they’ve had the right expertise there. They’ve done console, their console platform’s great. But yeah, there is a big opportunity on PC, and I think that’s kind of what they’re seeing right now.</p><p>Now it’s like reality is hitting that mobile and cloud isn’t ready for them to get that growth. So now they’re like, “Okay, PC.” The next-gen Xbox is a PC. It’s going to be a PC. It virtually is now. It’s running a custom version of Windows, very stripped down. No start menu in sight.</p><p>But the next one, their bet is that they can essentially convince PC OEMs to build Xboxes, which then boot up into their own interface. Then they can say, “Subscribe to Game Pass, buy our games in the store.” But is the reality that those people are just going to buy them and just use Steam? That’s their problem. And this is the very big question of the next-gen exports, whatever Asha does with the work that’s going on at the moment, and what this next strategy is going to be. Because yeah, that’s kind of a big question.</p><p><strong>Let’s talk about that. So the new head of Xbox is Asha Sharma, CEO of Microsoft Gaming. She does not appear to have any gaming background. I mean, she’s out there posting on social media like, “What game should I play?”</strong></p><p><strong>She’s making overtures to this audience. But before this, she led core AI at Microsoft. She was a VP of Product at Meta. She was COO of Instacart. She’s got a corporate operator background. She’s been at the big companies. She’s run big projects. She’s faced the pressure, she’s handled it, but she’s not a gamer. And Phil, very famously, is a gamer. </strong></p><p><strong>I would point out that Nintendo is not run by gamers. Sony is not run by gamers. They’re arguably more successful. Maybe this is actually the thing. You need distance from this audience. What do you think she’s going to do with this strategy now?</strong></p><p>I still think that they will pursue Xbox Anywhere, but not in the sort of over-promising and under-delivering scenario I hope, because that was just a mess. And I do think she’s kind of signaled in her memo a return to Xbox. We don’t really know exactly what that means because, let’s be honest, what does Xbox mean at the moment?</p><p><strong>[Laughs] Also, Phil’s been there the entire time. How do you return to the thing the guy who is leaving made?</strong></p><p>Yeah, but I think she’s kind of signaling that the console’s going to be a little bit more of a priority than perhaps it has been over the last couple of years. But who knows? We have to see when she talks more broadly about that.</p><p>I know the reaction to her, in particular, has been questions around AI, right? Because she’s been at CoreAI at Microsoft for a couple of years. I don’t necessarily get the impression that she’s coming into AI everything at Microsoft Gaming. They’re just naturally going to do that anyway because it’s Microsoft, and Microsoft is heavily invested in AI. So I think there’s no question that’s going to happen there anyway.</p><p>But in her background, if you actually look at CoreAI, she was more about platform scaling there with the Foundry business at CoreAI. And that’s kind of what she did at Instacart as well, platform scaling and then user acquisition at Meta. So I think if you look into what she’s actually done and what she has expertise in, it’s exactly what Xbox kind of needs.</p><p>They need someone who can get teams executing and get that user acquisition, the platform scaling, the stuff that they need to build and get ready to actually see this vision through. The Xbox everywhere vision, I don’t think it’s terrible, but it’s just trying to execute on certain parts of it. They’ve been really sloppy with it and just a little bit too early.</p><p>So I don’t think the strategy is going to change dramatically, but the next-gen console, the PC stuff, and where they try and push that way is going to be the cover for the strategy they originally wanted to do. But yeah, I don’t think she’s like some AI plant. I just don’t get that impression.</p><p><strong>Let me ask you this big question. You’ve done a lot of reporting over the last year and a half about this new console, it being a PC, this strategy, and whether or not it’s organized or disorganized. I think what I’m hearing you say is she’s going to execute it, right? There are execution problems here. Maybe the company did not trust Sarah Bond to execute the strategy after Phil left. Maybe we need to reset it all. </strong></p><p><strong>And so, Asha is just going to execute that well. That’s one approach. We can see if that’s what she actually wants to do. Then there’s what I hear a lot of people saying, especially gamers who are prone to hyperbole, that her job is to just shut it down.</strong></p><p>Yeah, I’ve seen that.</p><p><strong>Just bring this to an end because Activision didn’t work. Bethesda didn’t work. All Satya Nadella cares about is replacing all of us with AI agents that are using Excel or whatever he cares about. Microsoft just wants to wash its hands of this business, and she’s just going to trim it down to sell it to, I don’t know, whoever wants to buy it. Do you think that’s true? Is there a risk there?</strong></p><p>A few years ago, Nadella thought about spinning off the Xbox division, right? But instead, Phil convinced him to do all these acquisitions and do the Activision deal. So he invested, obviously, heavily. That’s Microsoft’s biggest acquisition.</p><p>I don’t think shareholders are going to like them just writing off Activision Blizzard. I can’t see them running it into the ground. And I think some of the people that have been coming up with this theory, and o<a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/xbox-co-founder-thinks-microsoft-will-sunset-xbox">ne of them is obviously an Xbox co-founder</a>, which is interesting. I think the theory is rooted in the idea that Nadella doesn’t want hardware, which, notoriously, Windows Phone-</p><p><strong>You talk about writing off an acquisition</strong>.</p><p>[Laughs] Don’t get me started.</p><p><strong>Nadella came in as the new CEO, and his first job was to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/8/8910999/microsoft-job-cuts-2015-nokia-write-off">write down the Nokia deal</a> and get rid of it. And so you’re like, maybe he can just do it again.</strong></p><p>[Laughs] Yeah, maybe. But this time, he was there when the Activision deal went down. But yeah, I can’t see them running the console into the ground. I think there is a realization over the past couple of years, the reaction to them putting games on PlayStation and Switch, and them really devaluing the console and their core, that this is their only remaining consumer brand that’s successful. And all right, we can’t really call it successful right now, perhaps. I don’t know. It’s in a weird spot, but it’s still a respected brand, a known brand across the world.</p><p>Whereas Windows is in a weird spot. Surface is pretty much spanned towards commercial, really. And yeah, this is the last one. If they mess this up, then they don’t have those inroads to consumer, which also punishes them in AI as well. So I think there’s a realization of that. I just can’t see that they would completely exit out of the base of what’s known as Xbox. And I think if they were going to do that, Asha’s not the person for that. I think the person to do that would be Matt Booty. You’d promote him and then just focus on shipping games and selling-</p><p><strong>He’s the content officer.</strong></p><p>Yeah, so I think you’d do that if you’re Nadella, and that’s what you truly wanted. You just wanted to do content and just be a third-party publisher, which is what everyone kind of thinks Xbox is going to do.</p><p><strong>You just keep collecting your 30 percent of Candy Crush revenue, and you just don’t talk about it at earnings reports. And it’ll be fine. </strong></p><p>Yeah. <em>Candy Crush</em> and <em>Minecraft</em> just make money.</p><p><strong>Right. You can just print that money, keep those things going, not talk about it, and hope no one notices, and then spend your time trying to increase Copilot options with consumer, or whatever you think you’re gonna do. But it sounds to me like you’re saying we should watch out for actual moves to make Xbox more relevant.</strong></p><p>That seems to be what Asha’s trying to signal in her memo. That whole return to Xbox is very vague, but it’s very interesting at the same time as well. I mean, if they want to keep this game pass revenue going, they can’t ignore that base, right? And it’s a nice bit of revenue.</p><p><strong>All right, Tom, I’m going to let you go back to that baby of yours. Thank you so much for jumping on and explaining all of your reporting to us. I hope Microsoft can keep things chill until you’re officially back from leave.</strong></p><p>Yeah. That would be nice.</p><p><strong>But I make no promises on behalf of Satya Nadella.</strong></p><p>No, I thought February is a good time, you know? It’s quiet.</p><p><strong>Very good. Thanks so much, Tom.</strong></p><p>All right, thank you.</p><p><em><sub>Questions or comments about this episode? Hit us up at decoder@theverge.com.

These games are widely considered the “definitive” versions of the first </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>RPGs, and still feel pretty modern by today’s standards. But like all </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games, the reason there are two versions is so you’re incentivized to trade with others, as some monsters are only catchable in one version or the other.</span></p> <p><span>Sometimes your favorite Pokémon might be trapped on one version, so it’s good to know ahead of time which game has which exclusive monsters before you buy one or the other, especially if you don’t have a friend to buy the other version and trade with.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Warner Bros. Discovery Leaders recently spoke about WB Games’ biggest franchises returning in 2027 or 2028. </p>



<p>Details about Warner Bros. Games have been scarce recently, with the last update coming in January 2026, revealing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-games-held-layoffs-late-last-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoffs late last year</a> that affected executive-level employees. Now, the leaders have spoken about what’s in store, and it seems some big things are coming next year and the year after. </p>







<h2 id="h-2025-was-a-year-of-reset-for-wb-games">2025 Was a Year of Reset for WB Games</h2>



<p>Warner Bros Discovery lead, JB Perette, spoke about the return of WB Games’ biggest franchises during an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2026/biz/news/warner-bros-discovery-david-zaslav-hbo-sale-1236673449/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a>. Perette first spoke about last year being a “reset” for the company, as they were “distracted” with pursuing “too many IPs with too broad a set of studios.” 2026 will feature two releases from WB Games: LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight and the upcoming Game of Thrones-inspired mobile game, Dragon Fire. </p>



<h2 id="h-real-fruits-coming-in-2027-28-is-wb-games-teasing-hogwarts-legacy-sequel-release-window">‘Real Fruits’ Coming in 2027-28, Is WB Games Teasing Hogwarts Legacy Sequel Release Window?</h2>



<p>However, Perette stated that fans should look forward to 2027-28, as that’s when the “real fruits will start coming”. The Warner Bros. Discovery lead teased that WB Games will “return” to some of their biggest franchises in the coming years. Though no specific franchises have been mentioned, players have already started speculating about upcoming titles in the Hogwarts Legacy franchise (The sequel is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-in-production-at-warner-bros-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed to be in production</a>) or the Batman Arkham series. </p>







<p>In other news, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/paramount-sues-warner-bros-over-netflix-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paramount sued</a> Warner Bros. recently over the pending sale to Netflix. Additionally, a job listing suggests that Hogwarts Legacy’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-could-feature-online-multiplayer-job-listing-suggests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sequel could feature online multiplayer</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[ICE Arrests Beloved Fighting Game Community Member Ludovic]]></title>

            <guid>1447156</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>On Tuesday February 17th, Ludovic Mbock, a staple of the Maryland and Virginia fighting game community, went into the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Baltimore field office to renew his work permit.</p><p>He did not come out.</p><p>What began as a routine administrative task, one Mbock has done for more than a decade, has warped into one of the many similar nightmares playing out across the United States. While going about their daily lives, people, regardless of their immigration status or criminal record, are being disappeared by the US government, often with no word or warning to their families and in <a href="https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/fact-sheet/ice-cbp-legal-analysis/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>contravention of the law</u></a>. Mbock was detained by the USCIS, and since then his family has retained lawyers who’ve filed habeas petitions to keep him in Baltimore. Despite that, Mbock has been moved twice; first to Louisiana, and now Georgia, where he currently remains in a detention and processing facility. His family fears he could soon be deported and, together with his FGC colleagues, are working around the clock, in the face of destabilizing grief and confusion, to bring him home.</p><p>“It just came out of nowhere,” Diane Sohna, Mbock’s sister, told Aftermath. She described getting a collect call from her brother hours after he was detained. “He said, ‘yeah, ICE got me,’” she recalled. “He gave me some numbers to call, and from there, we've been on a roll.”</p><p>One of those numbers put Sohna in contact with Nikhil “Aequeri” DeLaHaye, Mbock’s friend for over a decade and another member of the greater DMV fighting game community. With assistance from his colleagues in the FGC, DeLaHaye is coordinating a massive effort to keep aware of Mbock’s movements as he’s forced through a punitive system of human misery dressed up in the trappings of government bureaucracy. “If we don't act right now, we miss our window to do something about this,” DeLaHaye told Aftermath.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Ludovic goofing around with friends. Photo credit: Nikhil DeLaHaye.</span></figcaption></figure><p>In the wake of the Trump administration’s brutal deportation program, hundreds of thousands of people have been moved <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/us/trump-deportations-families.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>around the country or removed from it entirely within days of arrest</u></a> and often <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-08-28/l-a-teen-nabbed-on-street-by-ice-transferred-out-of-state-without-parents-knowledge?ref=aftermath.site"><u>without notifying families</u></a>. The speed with which the deportation system moves people often <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2026/01/28/ice-detaining-moving-minnesota-children-to-texas-faster-than-courts-can-respond?ref=aftermath.site"><u>outpaces a family’s attempt to mount a legal defense</u></a>. And even when they can, as Mbock’s family has done, legal orders get ignored anyway.</p><p>For years, judges have allowed immigrants to remain free on bond while their cases work their way through immigration court. New <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/24/us/immigrants-trump-detention.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>policies</u></a> from the Trump administration have effectively eliminated that standing precedent, forcing arrested individuals to be held indefinitely. To challenge these detentions, lawyers have been using what’s known as <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/habeas-corpus-explained?ref=aftermath.site"><u>habeas petitions</u></a> to get them out. According to a report in the New York Times, as the number of habeas petitions continues to rise, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/us/habeas-corpus-detainee-immigrant-trump-federal-courts.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>judges have overwhelmingly sided with immigrants</u></a>, releasing them before they can be sent beyond the reach of families. There was hope the habeas petition filed by Mbock’s lawyers would do the same.</p><p>“He was in Baltimore on the 17th and 18th,” said DeLaHaye. “We filed a habeas petition that was on the docket by 10 AM on the 19th. They had him on a flight to Louisiana at 1[PM].”</p><p>Since his arrest, Mbock has been moved to Louisiana and again to Georgia. His family said they don’t know if he’ll be moved again or where he’ll be sent. The family’s greatest fear is that he’ll be deported. He emigrated from Cameroon and could be returned there, where they say he faces danger as an openly gay man in <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/05/11/cameroon-rising-violence-against-lgbti-people?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a country that criminalizes LGBTQ+ relationships</u></a>. He could also be deported to any number of random countries as a part of the government’s “<a href="https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/fact-sheet/what-are-third-country-removals-factsheet/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>third country removals</u></a>” plan, which permits <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-administration-seeks-to-deport-kilmar-abrego-garcia-to-uganda-after-his-release-from-jail?ref=aftermath.site"><u>deportation to countries detainees aren’t from or have never lived in</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Ludovic [third from left]while volunteering at a DC WorldPride event. Photo credit: Nikhil DeLaHaye.</span></figcaption></figure><p>Mbock’s safety stateside is a concern too. In the brief but regular conversations he’s allowed to have with them, Mbock’s family said he tries to appear in good spirits but that the situation is clearly weighing on him. “He says every time, ‘I'm okay. It's okay,’” Sohna said. “But I know my brother, He's just trying to shield us from really what he's going through.”</p><p>In the first days of his incarceration, Mbock was kept at the Baltimore USCIS field office, which according to the family is little more than an office building. DeLaHaye said Mbock has described worse conditions in Louisiana and Georgia. Mbock told DeLaHaye that he was kept in chains from 10PM to 5AM on a bus with no heat as he waited for transportation from Louisiana to Georgia.</p><p>“He said it was horrendous,” DeLaHaye said. “That it was like slavery shipping them out.”</p><p>Though Trump has said those targeted for deportation are violent criminals, the facts don’t support that claim. A recent Guardian report found that over 70 percent of people who entered the deportation process for the first time last year <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/22/us-immigration-trump-administration?ref=aftermath.site"><u>had no criminal convictions</u></a>. Mbock didn’t have one either. DeLaHaye and Sohna said their friend and brother was typically reserved until you got to know him.</p><p>“He's always been on the quiet side until he knows you, then he really shows you his funky side,” Sohna said. “He loves to dance, he loves to play games. He loves to eat. He loves video games. He loves sleeping, like he's the normal happy guy.”</p><p>DeLaHaye met Mbock at a<em> Street Fighter</em> tournament, noticing each other because they were wearing the same Chun-Li shirt. “We took a picture together, and I was like, ‘Wow, that's such a cool guy. I don't know if I'm ever gonna see him again,’” DeLaHaye said. But he would. The two travelled in the same FGC circles and eventually ran into each other at different events throughout the DMV region.&nbsp;</p><p>“There's been multiple times I've been at tournaments and I haven't told people what my tournament schedule was, and I would turn around while I was in the middle of a bracket match and see Lud behind me cheering me on with a group of friends,” said DeLaHaye. “That was the type of person he was, he just took care of people and cheered up people and cheered them on.”</p><blockquote>I would turn around while I was in the middle of a bracket match and see Lud behind me cheering me on with a group of friends.</blockquote><p>Mbock’s family and community are hoping their lawyers can secure his release, and have set up <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-ludovics-legal-defense?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a GoFundMe</u></a> to pay for legal fees. They’re also reaching out to state and federal representatives and lawmakers, hoping to make them aware that USCIS has violated court orders in moving Mbock. The idea is to make as much noise as loudly as possible to put pressure on the government to return him, because at any time, he could literally vanish.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Ludovic, known for maining Chun-Li poses with a Chun-Li cosplayer at a fighting game tournament. Photo credit: Nikhil DeLaHaye.</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are numerous reports from across the country of <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/families-search-for-loved-ones-after-hundreds-taken-on-u-s-immigration-flights-disappear-from-online-locator?ref=aftermath.site"><u>families unable to find their loved ones</u></a> in the system due to inadequate communication from the government. DeLaHaye described how when Mbock was moved from Louisiana to Georgia they didn’t know about it until hours after he got there, when Mbock called them himself. Typically, USCIS is obligated to timely notify lawyers of where their clients are; not doing that costs families time as they try to muster appropriate resources. Lawyers, for example, can only operate in states where they’re licensed. Moving a client state-to-state effectively stymies efforts to get them the representation they need.</p><p>“It takes time to set everything up, get everything signed. And in that same time frame, [USCIS will] move them out of that lawyer being able to do something,” DeLaHaye said. “If people didn't have, essentially, a fleet of people behind them, you would lose track of them.”&nbsp;</p><p>It is particularly cruel that such hypervigilance is required from people at a time when they’re also grieving the disappearance of a loved one.</p><p>“My mom is in shambles,” Sohna said. “It makes me feel like I lost my brother.”</p><p>But he’s not lost yet. The GoFundMe has exceeded its original goal of $16,000 and currently sits at over $83k. With the excess, the family is hopeful that they’ll be able to afford the expense of reopening Mbock’s immigration case to eventually get him citizenship. But friends and family can do more than just send funds. DeLaHaye has also set up a Discord where people can leave encouraging messages for Mbock, and people have also done that on their own on social media.</p><p>“There's a thread ongoing right now on X with hundreds of people <a href="https://x.com/MK11Jokes/status/2024632508504011030?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>all talking about individual fantastic experiences with Lud</u></a>,” DeLaHaye said. He described going to a <em>Tekken</em> tournament in Sweden a few weeks ago where he mentioned he was friends with Mbock. “People from Lithuania knew who Ludovic was, people from Croatia, people from Denmark knew who he was,” he said. DeLaHaye said the response he’s seen from friends and colleagues&nbsp; reaffirmed his love of fighting games and the communities they inspire.&nbsp;</p><p>“I can go anywhere on the planet, bring a fight stick and bring my friends, and we have something to bond over. That's beautiful,” he said. “And not only do we bond over it, we will show up for each other in times of crisis.”</p>

<p>To be fair, the Col de Turini and Sisteron Monte stages that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3917090/view/521991484783722969?l=english">AC Rally update 0.3</a> adds in are arguably the most iconic routes in rallying, so I can understand a bit of excitement. The two new cars the update delivers, a classic 70s Lancia Fulvia and a modern Rally2 Skoda Fabia RS, are also worth a small cheer. Especially the former, with its sporty Italian curves. You know, sometimes you write some words about a car, read them back and wonder if you need to have a word with yourself.</p>
<p>Anyway, the SNOW. "Both stages will have DYNAMIC WEATHER recreating the same circumstances you might encounter in reality where it can mix from snow to tarmac and back to snow again, with DYNAMIC SNOW debuting in Rally simulations for the first time ever," Supernova shout, adding that you can stick new "SNOW TIRES" on your ride to tackle these changing conditions.</p><p>Rounding out this SNOWY update are 40 new events, as well as a range of tweaks to the likes of car physics, car sounds, and the inputs used to control cars. The latter look like particularly good news for controller users, with "gamepad steer filter options" having been added, "default steer dead zone" ditched, and Xbox wireless controller detection fixed.</p>
<p>I've been a bit too busy Crusader Kinging, Yakuza manning, and campervanning in recent months to get around to giving AC Rally the lengthy revisit I've been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assetto-corsa-rallys-first-big-update-adds-in-snow-an-ice-circuit-and-a-majestic-70s-stage-smasher">vaguely promising</a> since my wheel bug-affected <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assetto-corsa-rally-looks-the-part-as-it-heads-into-early-access-but-ive-found-its-driving-a-numb-struggle">initial foray</a> with it last year. However, I do love the Monte, so this may finally be the kick up the backside I need.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/mrbeast-editor-insider-trading-kalshi-artem-kaptur-2000674023</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Kalshi, the self-described “trade on anything” betting website, has accused Artem Kaptur, an editor for James “MrBeast” Donaldson’s YouTube channel, of insider trading and plans to fine him “5 times the initial trade size” of the $4,000 he spent betting on MrBeast-related trades. Kalshi’s </span><a href="https://news.kalshi.com/p/kalshi-trading-violation-enforcement-cases"><span>blog post</span></a><span> states that Kaptur was identified as an insider trader due to his “near-perfect trading success on markets with low odds.”</span></p> <p><span>Kalshi has been the center of several controversies for its willingness to let users bet on a variety of topics, including wagers </span><a href="https://therealnews.com/cnn-partners-kalshi-gambling-app-starvation-gaza"><span>such as</span></a><span> “Will the IPC classify Gaza as experiencing famine this year?” However, as spotted by </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2026/02/25/nx-s1-5726050/kalshi-insider-trading-enforcement-actions"><i><span>NPR</span></i></a><span>, it seems they take insider trading a little bit more seriously than people starving to death, as Kalshi just announced that they’ll be suspending the account of MrBeast’s editor for “statistically anomalous” betting practices.</span></p>

 <p><span>Artem Kaptur has responded to the allegations in a post on </span><a href="https://x.com/anokiiiiii/status/2026908606327828685"><span>X</span></a><span>, in which he states that he’ll be taking “full responsibility” for the bets placed on Kalshi’s platform. That being said, Kaptur’s post also states that Kalshi’s decision to refer the details of the case to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has been “devastating.” “I am not saying I did not deserve consequences. I am saying that watching your entire career collapse, your reputation destroyed publicly, and your name attached to the word ‘illegal’ in headlines across the internet for something that legal experts themselves are still debating is a lot to process.”</span></p> <p><span>Kaptur’s post also confirms that MrBeast’s team has parted ways with him following the allegations. In a follow-up post on X, Kaptur thanked commenters and stated that he is “going to fight this issue with the support from you all,” alongside the code for his crypto wallet address. An official spokesperson for Beast Industries </span><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/mrbeast-editor-accused-insider-trading-kalshi-1236515316/"><span>announced</span></a><span> that the company has “no tolerance” for Kaptur’s actions. “We’ve already initiated an independent investigation as part of our overall ongoing efforts to ensure the integrity of our workplace and trust with our global audiences.”</span></p>

If you haven't added this one to your library yet but have been waiting for a good time to grab it, this is your chance: Amazon's dropped its price to $29.83 (<a href="https://zdcs.link/9gXOZD?object_uuid=66921ac4-dff6-4b70-83c0-2431f8a2771a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B08QFPS48J" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">see it here</a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Considering it usually comes with a price tag of $69.99, this deal saves you 57% on the game overall.

That's not too bad at all. Plus, there's still plenty of time before Saros is released, so the timing of jumping into Returnal couldn't be better.

We're very big fans of it, regardless of price. IGN's Mitchell Saltzman said in his <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/returnal-review">review</a> back when it was initially released that the "moment-to-moment gameplay of Returnal is sublime, with a great selection of weapons that each have a wide variety of interesting possible traits, meaningful strategic decisions that can either keep a run afloat or doom it to sink, and punishingly challenging yet rewarding gunplay that is consistently exhilarating."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've decided to pick up Returnal and are curious what other deals are out there right now, you're in luck: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-launches-a-brand-new-promotional-sale-on-ps5-games-accessories-and-more">PlayStation has recently kicked off a big sale at PlayStation Direct</a>, which a few other retailers have joined in on, that features even more great game deals (and some nice <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-console-covers-get-a-limited-time-discount-in-playstation-massive-new-sale">accessory deals</a>). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's even a selection of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-ps5-games-now-30-or-less-in-playstations-massive-new-sale">PS5 games on sale for $30 or less</a> right now, if you want to see even more game deals in Returnal's discounted price range.

Umbrella Noodles’ packaging is a spoof on the red and white lettering of Nissin’s Cup Noodles, a cheeky Easter Egg for players who noticed. Real-life Japanese food company <a href="https://www.nissin.com/jp/company/chronicle/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Nissin</u></a> was founded by instant noodle inventor Momofuku Ando in 1948. After putting the world’s first instant ramen on the market in 1958, Nissin has been selling their Cup Noodles ever since 1971.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, on February 24, Resident Evil’s official X account <a href="https://x.com/BIO_OFFICIAL/status/2026206275663704333?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>posted an announcement </u></a>that Umbrella Corp. had submitted a complaint to the Raccoon City District Court, alleging that Nissin’s noodles significantly infringe upon Umbrella Corp.’s intellectual property rights regarding Umbrella Noodles. It’s worth noting that even if Umbrella Corp. were a real company, it set up shop in 1968 with an initial focus on biological weaponry, meaning that it’s unlikely it developed Umbrella Noodles before Nissin’s offering!</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">However, if there’s one thing S.T.A.R.S members can attest to, it’s that Umbrella Corp. does not give up easily. The official Japanese Resident Evil account then escalated the drama by posting a video featuring an Umbrella Corp. scientist apologizing to those who accidentally purchased “imposer” Nissin Noodles instead of Umbrella Noodles, and explaining how Nissin "copied" the recipe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As evidence, they allege that they were able to recreate Umbrella Noodles from Nissin Cup Noodles with a 99.9% success rate, simply by adding entrails and a herby, mostly basil-based sauce to Nissin’s product (although it made Umbrella employees who ate it a little itchy... probably best not to ask where those entrails are from). Sharing the video, Nissin <a href="https://x.com/cupnoodle_jp/status/2026537644201595092?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>clapped back</u></a> with, "However you look at it, you're the ones doing the copying!"</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">どうみてもパクリはそちらです。 <a href="https://t.co/7VvG8kqWQX" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/7VvG8kqWQX</a></p>— カップヌードル (@cupnoodle_jp) <a href="https://twitter.com/cupnoodle_jp/status/2026537644201595092?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 25, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Adding even more hot water to the situation, Japanese shoppertainment company Yume Group (who last week released a bizarre <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-has-a-bizarre-ultra-limited-edition-with-exercise-equipment-in-japan-and-it-sold-out-almost-instantly"><u>ultra-limited edition of Resident Evil Requiem</u></a> bundled with exercise equipment, which sold out almost instantly), launched the over-the-top Umbrella Noodles/Resident Evil Requiem ad below. A terrified Grace Ashcroft comes across the Japanese infomercial duo casually munching on and singing the praises of Umbrella Noodles (the ad notes that Umbrella Noodles are not a real product, although Resident Evil Requiem is a real game).</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— 夢グループ (@yumegroup) <a href="https://twitter.com/yumegroup/status/2026855488806068410?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 26, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Soon after, the official account for Nissin Cup Noodles reacted, <a href="https://x.com/cupnoodle_jp/status/2026884936888910080?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>sharing the ad</u></a> with a, “What the hell is this?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The fake lawsuit and sudden focus on Umbrella Noodles sparked much amusement from Japanese-speaking commenters. “No way can Umbrella beat Nissin. You think a Tyrant can stop a cheese alien?” <a href="https://x.com/occultic00581/status/2026268532091338969?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>joked</u></a> one fan, referencing the mascot that sometimes appears in Nissin Cup Noodle commercials (like <a href="https://youtu.be/dm86ootD_dA?si=93Ygax64blQTotK4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>this one</u></a> from 2001). “Umbrella Noodles are delicious, yeah? Although a huge eye’ll appear on your shoulder the day after you eat them,” <a href="https://x.com/AnyaF0705/status/2026543283720294788?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>quipped</u></a> another.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Given all this sudden focus on Umbrella Noodles, it seems likely that they will pop up in Resident Evil Requiem too. Perhaps Leon and Grace will be able to find Umbrella Noodles in Resident Evil Requiem and chow down on them as they explore the ruins of Raccoon City.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've got plenty more on Resident Evil Requiem, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-long-is-resident-evil-requiem">how long Resident Evil Requiem takes to beat</a>, and we've tracked <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-global-release-timings-revealed">Resident Evil Requiem's global release times</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Like the result of an experiment conducted in an underground Umbrella Corporation lab, Resident Evil Requiem successfully splices two separate strains of survival horror together into the one highly infectious new mutation," IGN wrote in our full <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-review">Resident Evil Requiem review</a>, which returned a 9/10 score.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="captioned-content" data-testid="featured-image"><p><span>Image via Supergiant Games</span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The evolution of subgenres in game development is a fascinating topic. What is the alchemy that makes one game a hit, and the other a mass inspiration?&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The developers who make such games certainly don't have all the answers. At the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/clair-obscur-keeps-riding-high-at-2026-dice-awards">2026 DICE Awards</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, we asked Supergiant Games' Greg Kasavin and Amir Rao (fresh off of winning the "Best Action Game" award for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/hades-ii">Hades II</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) about the experience of watching </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hades</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> become such an inspirational text for other independent developers. Not only did the game sell over a million copies, but its approach to run-based storytelling, area-based upgrades, and character design have become essential for games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1835240/Spiritfall/">Spiritfall</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1123770/Curse_of_the_Dead_Gods/">Curse of the Dead Gods</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1763250/SWORN/">Sworn</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, just to name a few. The phrase "Hades-like" is now a jumping off point for a certain subcategory in the roguelike genre.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It was really surreal for us," said Kasavin when asked about the phenomenon. "When we were making </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hades</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, we thought we were simply making a roguelike. We were playing games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dead Cells</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Slay the Spire</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and were just making a game in that genre."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/outgoing-sucker-punch-boss-hopes-studio-can-make-games-in-shorter-periods-of-time-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Outgoing Sucker Punch boss hopes studio can make games in 'shorter periods of time'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hades </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">didn't invent the roguelike genre (that would obviously be </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rogue</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rogue Legacy</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> being a major modern point of inspiration), but it offered developers a narrative framework that not only unlocked potential storytelling opportunities, but helped shape the flow and pace of general gameplay. The "home base" area that players return to between runs acts as a hub for storytelling and signifying progression, and the loop of "clear encounter, meet character, receive reward from said character, rinse and repeat" is a replicable structure that doesn't require a cast of Classical Greek gods to lean on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Did the aforementioned gods grant Supergiant Games some form of boon to make this possible? "I did not discount that as a possibility," joked Kasavin. But luckily for the rest of the game development world, you don't need an oracle to understand the path to Supergiant's success</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Gods ain't gonna help you son">Gods ain't gonna help you son</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kasavin and Rao both shared a more pertinent sentiment about the process of making </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hades </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hades II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—that they and their peers at Supergiant treated the game as being "their own spin" on an existing genre, not an effort to reinvent the medium.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rao observed that when it comes to genre definitions, that conversation took place entirely after </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hades </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">left Early Access, and that it was determined entirely by popular reception. It wasn't something that could be planned or even controlled. "That's just a part of a reception and conversation at a time where we're not part of the conversation anymore."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's almost in some respects like some of the stuff we did with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bastion</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">," said Kasavin, alluding to Supergiant's first game. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bastion</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was an isometric hack-and-slash game elevated by the voice of narrator Logan Cunningham, who provided running commentary on the player's actions while unspooling a story of a world wracked by calamity. The highly-polished gameplay was built on familiar principles, but Cunningham's voice, the sharp storytelling, and artist Jen Zee's clear perspective catapulted the game—and its makers—into history.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We thought there was kind of a niche we could carve out for ourselves, like infusing it with more narrative, making it a little bit more forgiving," Kasavin said when recalling the making of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hades</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. "It succeeded beyond our wildest expectations, to the point where we suddenly realize people are talking about it like it's this kind of subgenre."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That's how that stuff happens sometimes right? We had no clue whatsoever—we didn't think we were doing anything innovative at the time."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There was no other way we could make this game," Rao added. "We just made the decisions that felt right and natural to us."&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

Ahead of its launch, the studio is holding a "Server Slam," <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/02/24/you-can-play-two-upcoming-playstation-first-party-games-early-this-weekend">essentially an open playtest for anyone to hop into and get a feel for the game</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The slam begins in just a few hours, and ahead of it, Marathon game director Joe Ziegler has <a href="https://x.com/Ziegler_Dev/status/2026971692896338372?s=20">shared</a> 11 tips for beginners to keep in mind, as spotted by <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2026/02/26/11-marathon-server-slam-tips-from-the-game-director-himself/"><em>Forbes</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hWwXSb7dlnQ"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hWwXSb7dlnQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p><strong>Here's what they are, edited by </strong><em><strong>Game Informer </strong></em><strong>for clarity:&nbsp;</strong></p><ol><li>Gear comes and goes – don't be too precious about it, but learn to use what you go and it will serve you.</li><li>Remember to bring enough ammo and consumables to survive a couple of fights. If you don't have much, then use a sponsored kit or play as Rook [one of the game's six Runner shells designed for solo players looking to scavenge the battlefield and stay out of trouble] and focus your runs on getting gear and creds or stocking up on resources.</li><li>If you're learning, don't rush your contract objectives; playing slowly can help you avoid getting overwhelmed.</li><li>Keep your ears open. You will often hear threats before you see them.</li><li>Try to take the fight you think you can win – you don't need to fight everything. Greed and ambition can lead to a quick downfall.</li><li>Don't sleep on battery weapons – in the right hands, they are strong, but remember that if you reload with them before they're empty, you will lose the battery.</li><li>A friend who plays Triage (another Runner shell that is basically a medic for your trio) is a keeper. Be kind to them.</li><li>If you want to win a fight, use what your opponent wants against them. Patience and cunning are powerful allies.</li><li>Stray Rooks are unpredictable and can either be a blessing or a curse, depending on how you treat them.</li><li>Don't get tilted – cooler heads make smarter decisions.</li><li>If all else fails, beg for mercy in proximity chat and hope someone listens.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>I'm sure we'll all learn plenty more as we head to the Tau Ceti planet that Marathon's maps are set on, but for now, Ziegler's tips seem like a great foundation of tricks to build on.&nbsp;</p><p>The Marathon Server Slam begins today, February 26, at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET, and ends on Monday, March 2, at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher NIS America has announced <em>Disgaea Mayhem</em>, which, as the name suggests, is a spinoff of the popular <em>Disgaea </em>strategy RPG series, and it's coming to PC and consoles this summer.</p><p>As revealed via a new trailer, <em>Disgaea Mayhem </em>will land on PC, PS5, and both Switch machines sometime later this year (sorry, Xbox owners). It marries <em>Disgaea</em>'s signature silly style with more kinetic and action-foucsed gameplay.</p><p>Per the newly-released Steam page for <em>Disgaea Mayhem</em>, the game will cast you as N.A., a mercenary hired by a princess in order to help her, erm, eat as much sweet stuff as she can. It's classic off-the-wall <em>Disgaea </em>fare.</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<p><em>Disgaea Mayhem </em>will offer seven different classes for you to play as, each based on classic <em>Disgaea </em>weapons like swords, guns, and axes, and you can switch between them at any time you like.</p><p>This being <em>Disgaea</em>, you can, of course, also look forward to two series staples in <em>Mayhem</em>: absurd grind and ludicrously over-the-top damage numbers.</p><p>NIS America says the game will feature the chance to "grind levels, improve your equipment, and...make the numbers go up until you're dealing a million damage with every hit", which sounds like <em>Disgaea</em> alright.</p><p>You can take a look at the debut trailer for <em>Disgaea Mayhem</em>, which shows off what you can expect from this new spinoff's gameplay (as well as its classic art style), right here.</p>
<p>Being a spinoff, <em>Disgaea Mayhem </em>isn't part of the mainline <em>Disgaea </em>series; the latest core title to be released is still <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/disgaea-7-vows-of-virtueless" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d70f97e5-48e0-402f-bef0-abea488c70a0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">2023's seventh installment</a>, although judging by the past release cadence for the series, we shouldn't be too far off <em>Disgaea 8</em>.</p><p>In the meantime, however, you can check out <em>Disgaea Mayhem </em>when it lands on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4402250/Disgaea_Mayhem/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, PlayStation 5, and both Switch 2 and Switch this summer.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Tomorrow is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-day-30-anniversary-go-anime-cosplay-stream-2000672824"><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>’s 30th anniversary</span></a><span>, and The Pokémon Company is going all out to commemorate the big date. There’s a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-where-when-to-watch-generation-10-switch-2000671968"><span>livestream tomorrow</span></a><span> to reveal upcoming projects, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-30-anniversary-art-logos-every-pokedex-serebii-2000672767"><span>new art for all 1000+ monsters circulating social media</span></a><span>, and anniversary merchandise that includes throwbacks to the past 30 years of history. Now that we’ve seen some of that merch, y’all, I need the black-and-white Pikachu plush made to look like the little guy’s original </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-red-blue-yellow-green-review-game-boy-switch-2000671975"><span>Game Boy</span></a><span> sprite.</span></p> <p><a href="https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/2088734.html"><i><span>Game Watch</span></i></a><span> attended an anniversary event in Japan that showcased several of the upcoming merchandise collaborations, and it’s unclear at the moment how many of these are coming stateside, but we might hear more in the next day or so when Pokémon Day actually begins. Some standouts include charms and art based on every box art from the mainline games, a line of camping equipment with the original Kanto starters on them, and the previously announced Fat Pikachu plush that harkens back to the mouse’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/fat-pikachu-chunkachu-pokemon-30th-plush-2000661861"><span>original round design</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>The real winner is the pixelated Pikachu plush that carries all the distinct features the mouse had in the original games, long before it was morphed into the universal design we see today. The plush is missing the iconic yellow and red color scheme because it’s made to look like the critter’s sprite on the original Game Boy, which only displayed games in a monochrome color scheme. But it also has some features that have been phased out of the character’s design over the years, such as the colored paws and grey circle on the belly, though those elements have been retained by Raichu, its evolution. God, I shudder to think of how much that is going to cost on import and resale sites. Please come to the States, grey Pikachu. My shelf calls to you.</span></p> <p><span>You can check out </span><i><span>Game Watch</span></i><span>’s gallery to see the full line of products that were shown off, as well as some photos from the event.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Interview – Modding is coming to Rennsport, but how will it work with consoles?]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/26/interview-modding-is-coming-to-rennsport-but-how-will-it-work-with-consoles/</link>
            <guid>1447042</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Modding has been around for almost as long as video games themselves, as other curious developers, hackers and fans keenly delving into game code and assets to twist them in new directions. For racing games, the most obvious mods add cars and tracks alongside the existing roster shipped by developers, and the most active modding scenes have been built up around more sim-minded racing games on PC. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/rennsport">Rennsport</a> is about to ask “why not on console too?”</p>
<p>As part of the game’s roadmap through 2026 and beyond, Competition Company is going to open up modding to the community, releasing tools to first allow track creation and eventually cars and gameplay modding too. The distinguishing factor between this game and its rivals will be that, in addition to still allowing custom mods on PC, they also plan to bring mod distribution in-game and expose them to console players as well.</p>
<p>“I think it does a lot for making it feel more seamlessly integrated into the game,” said Senior Lead Technical Artist, Joel Szlema. “For me, it’s a difference if I upload a track and next week it might just show up on the front page as, like, the next race coming up, right? That feels more like you’re directly contributing to the game, rather than put something up that people might find, might download. So it feels very connected in the fact that it’s just directly goes into the game.”</p>
<p>That’s potentially very exciting. Rennsport already features some community-created tracks that have been licensed by Competition Company to be a part of the game – Crest da Cauras, Orchard Road Street Circuit and the upcoming Kuala Lumpur Street Circuit. However, opening up modding and track distribution more freely will hopefully open the taps for a bunch of further tracks to be introduced, and then be easily discovered and featured in the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kuala Lumpur Street Circuit | NEW TRACK" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xV0UqpasGdw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Joel presented how Rennsport’s modding tools will start off, combining Unreal Engine’s SDK with custom tools created by Competition Company, providing a rounded suite of tools to create new tracks for the game. This will initially be opened up to a small group of creators this summer, before the net is widened in a closed beta, and with a full release pencilled in for the end of 2026. After that, they will turn their attentions to modding cars and modding gameplay, though not necessarily in that order.</p>

<p>Tracks are an easier starting point for Rennsport to tackle on multiple levels, especially when bearing in mind that mods will also be coming to console. Content needs to be moderated to appear on console, there are limitations to how things can be modded, and that’s all before any kind of licensing issues with car makers and track owners wanting to protect their IP.</p>
<div id="attachment_469268"><p id="caption-attachment-469268">The Kuala Lumpur circuit is a community-created track coming to Rennsport soon, and this could just be the start</p></div>
<p>“Once the tracks are done, we will definitely look into probably gameplay next. I feel like gameplay is something that it also naturally goes into, because if you can do tracks and you can you can put a contest config on the track, then you can already do quite a lot of like different experiences, right? Because we do have some tracks that are not like closed loop tracks, so you could do something that looks like a rally stage, for example.”</p>
<p>“And with that, you could naturally, I mean, it’s kind of a stupid example, but I always bring the example of an obstacle course. You could just make a level that looks like an obstacle course, and it’s A-to-B and it’s still like whoever finishes first finishes first, but you’ve kind of created a different game modes just by making a different track with some gameplay rules.”</p>
<div id="attachment_469280"><p id="caption-attachment-469280">Placing obstacles or making A-to-B races could be the foundations for new gameplay mods.</p></div>
<p>With an eye to wider gameplay mods, Joel said, “So in theory, there’s a lot of things you can do [on console]. The only thing is that you have to [make it] safe, that nobody does, like, code injection on console to hack the console or whatever. What you can do is you can create basically like an API, or you can, for example, if you have a spawn point in game, you can build a spawn point like a modular block, you programme it, and then people can like place it in a level, right? Or they can build stuff around it. So you have to do, like, defined building blocks that people can combine to make new logic out of it.</p>
<p>“Unreal has blueprints where you can, I don’t know if you know, you can programme with nodes or you place a node, like spawn something and press something and you can connect them. And I don’t think we would be able to allow people to use that freely, but if we make our own predefined building blocks, then you could potentially do that.”</p>

<p>One of the major changes to the modding community over the past decade, is that modders are able to ask for some kind of payment, whether it’s through their own subscriptions or one-off payments. Surely that can’t mesh with Rennsport having an in-game browser on consoles, though, can it? Those would need to be free to download?</p>
<p>“No,” said co-founder and co-CEO Marco Ujhasi. “So there is a difference for the console about the certification process, if it’s paid or unpaid content, that’s true. […] The general principle is when something is created, you can decide if it’s free or if it’s paid, and there is a way on any platform. [It can be] more or less complicated and it’s like with many topics, sometimes it gets so complicated, it’s not worth it, but technically possible.</p>
<p>“So what we are doing at the moment is, first and foremost, enabling the system and make it make it a fun thing to use. Because I think this is missing a bit, that it really feels like it’s part of the game. It’s not just about bringing the content in, but also what you can do with the content. Is it part of any progression system?</p>
<p>“And for us, it’s important that it’s really part of the whole game and the monetising? Honestly speaking, this is a side thing in that. But so many creatives sitting out there and talent and so on, and they do so much great stuff while we shouldn’t help them to make it in a more appealing appealing way. Why not?”</p>

<p>There’s still a lot of aspects of modding and distribution for Competition Company to really hammer out, I feel, but the core principles of having an in-game mod browser and ways to integrate them into the wider game more seamlessly for console is really an exciting one. Alongside the general roadmap of new cars and tracks being made by the team, modding is absolutely an aspect to keep an eye on as they evolve the tools and systems over the coming years.</p>

<figure data-uuid="e1b9a45f76984"><a title="3DS Family" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e1b9a45f76984/3ds-family.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Gosh, the passage of time is a nasty one, eh? There we are just trying to enjoy our day, when all of a sudden, <em>BOOM</em>, we're reminded that today is the 15th anniversary of the 3DS.</p>
<p>Yes, the 3DS, that console which, in our minds, is still a relatively young whippersnapper, was released on this day (26th February) <em>fifteen years ago</em> in 2011.</p>
<p>It's a system that many of us here at Nintendo Life still hold dearly in our hearts, and one that we return to with a surprising frequency, even though we've got <em>two</em> newer consoles from the House of Mario at our disposal. But there's something about the software lineup that we just can't knock. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/tomodachi_life">Tomodachi Life</a>? <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/legend_of_zelda_a_link_between_worlds">A Link Between Worlds</a>? <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/animal_crossing_new_leaf">Animal Crossing: New Leaf</a>? Talk about bangers.</p><div><figure data-videoid="rsFcYrj6oHY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rsFcYrj6oHY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytrsFcYrj6oHY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rsFcYrj6oHY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rsFcYrj6oHY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f132iktngy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>843k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>But we're not here to discuss the software this time (we've got our list of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/50-best-nintendo-3ds-games-of-all-time">50 Best 3DS Games Of All Time</a> for that), we want to talk about the system itself. More specifically, we want to talk about its weird and wonderful family.</p>
<p>Because yes, while the 3DS is a system in its own right, it spawned a whole family of models to choose between. These were released every couple of years between 2011 and 2017, and included everything from bigger screens to additional control stick 'nubs'.</p>
<p>As the OG system celebrates a decade and a half since launch, we thought it'd be only right to remind you about each model's quirks before we pit them head-to-head in a poll to decide, conclusively, which one is the best (or which one is your favourite, at the very least).</p>
<p>So, here they all are, in release order.</p>
<h2>3DS</h2>
<figure data-uuid="322f2411bfd81"><a title="3DS" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/322f2411bfd81/3ds.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>First released:</strong> 26th February 2011</p>
<p>The first model really was a beauty, wasn't it? The big selling point was that autostereoscopic 3D screen, of course, but let's not forget the internal and external cameras for all of those free AR games, a particularly slippery circle pad, and the trio of Select / Home / Start buttons that never <em>really</em> felt like buttons. <em>Magical</em>.</p>
<h2>3DS XL</h2>
<figure data-uuid="fa6500028ef05"><a title="3DS XL" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fa6500028ef05/3ds-xl.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>First released:</strong> 28th July 2012</p>
<p>Do it again... but bigger. Just a year and a half after the 3DS first appeared on the market, Nintendo launched the XL model. It had all the same features as its predecessor, but with a 124mm screen, compared to the old model's 90mm.</p>
<h2>2DS</h2>
<figure data-uuid="273f5b0adf4de"><a title="2DS" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/273f5b0adf4de/2ds.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>First released</strong>: 12th October 2013</p>
<p>Another year, another 3DS. Only, this one <em>wasn't</em> 3D. Aside from being the ugliest-looking handheld Nintendo had released in a hot minute, the 2DS removed the family's trademark gimmick (and its internal stereo speakers) for a cheaper, <em>non</em>-autostereoscopic model.</p>
<p>A lot of people didn't get on with the 3D, so its removal is fair enough. The removal of the clamshell design, however, is a little harder to overlook.</p>

<h2>New Nintendo 3DS</h2>
<figure data-uuid="4738e1324284a"><a title="New Nintendo 3DS" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4738e1324284a/new-nintendo-3ds.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>First released:</strong> 25th October 2014</p>
<p>The 'New' model felt like a big step up. This boasted all the same features as the OG system, but with a bunch of fresh bells and whistles thrown in to improve the play experience. We're talking face tracking for an improved 3D effect, automatic screen brightness adjustment, longer battery life, bonus ZL/ZR buttons, a 'C-stick' nub, amiibo support... the list goes on.</p>
<p>Throw in a more powerful processor, swappable faceplates, some exclusive games, and Virtual Console titles, and Nintendo was onto a winner of an upgrade.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/3ds/related-articles:172942 @ 1772119971 -->
<h2>New Nintendo 3DS XL</h2>
<figure data-uuid="6a7e526be8b13"><a title="New Nintendo 3DS XL" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6a7e526be8b13/new-nintendo-3ds-xl.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>First released:</strong> 11th October 2014</p>
<p>Launching in the same window as the smaller 'New' option, this model packed in all of the features outlined above, but, once again, with a 124mm screen to boot.</p>
<h2>New Nintendo 2DS XL</h2>
<figure data-uuid="eff0fdb60e904"><a title="New Nintendo 2DS XL" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/eff0fdb60e904/new-nintendo-2ds-xl.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>First released:</strong> 15th June 2017</p>
<p>The final member of the 3DS family actually launched after the Switch generation was already up and running. This model supported many of the same features as its 'New XL' counterpart, but with a new home button (shifted to the left of the screen), an updated SD Card and cartridge placement at the front of the system's base, and a little cart cover, vaguely reminiscent of the Switch. Naturally, this one dropped the 3D option, too.</p>

			<li>81-100%: Highly Likely - Multiple reliable sources</li>
		</ul>
	</div>


			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, we learned that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-splinter-cell-far-cry-veteran-assassins-creed-hexe-creative-director-has-left-ubisoft/">Clint Hocking</a></strong>, the creative director on <strong>Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory</strong>, <strong>Far Cry 2,</strong> <strong>Watch Dogs: Legion</strong>, and most recently, the creative director behind the upcoming <strong>Assassin's Creed Hexe</strong>, had left <strong>Ubisoft</strong>. The newly named head of content for Assassin's Creed and former <strong>Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag</strong> creative director, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-taps-senior-assassins-creed-black-flag-devs-to-lead-assassins-creed-future/">Jean Guesdon</a></strong>, is stepping in to fill his role on the project, which, according to a reliable Ubisoft insider, is showing a lot of promise within Ubisoft.</p>



<p>So much so that it's even the project that "<em><strong>everyone</strong></em>" across the company is looking to work on "<em>because of <strong>how good it's shaping up to be</strong></em>." The insider in question who made that comment is <a href="https://x.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/2026713095071047980">Tom Henderson</a>, who noted it alongside Insider-Gaming's coverage of Hocking's departure. </p>



<p>"<em>Some folk will be wary of this change</em>," Henderson writes, "<em>but Assassin's Creed Hexe is the one project that everyone at Ubisoft wants to work on because of how good it's shaping up to be</em>."</p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Some folk will be wary of this change, but Assassin's Creed Hexe is the one project everyone at Ubisoft wants to work on because of how good it's shaping up to be.<a href="https://t.co/Tz430ZCEiW">https://t.co/Tz430ZCEiW</a></p>— Tom Henderson (@_Tom_Henderson_) <a href="https://twitter.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/2026713095071047980?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 25, 2026</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>So far, we know very little about Assassin's Creed Hexe. It was<a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-project-red-japan-project-hexe-witchcraft-infinity-hub-detail/"> announced in 2022</a> alongside a slew of upcoming titles for the series, and in the time since, all we have to go on about what to expect from the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-hexe-magic-powers-possession-fear-system/">are a few rumours</a>. Back in 2024, we heard that <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-infinity-live-servies-assassins-creed-red-hexe-in-2026/">it had been pushed into <strong>2026</strong></a>, but after Ubisoft's <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/">"<em><strong>major reset</strong></em>"</a> that was revealed last month, it could have easily been one of the projects that was pushed back further while Ubisoft works through this transition.</p>



<p>Regardless, Henderson's record when it comes to reporting on Ubisoft lends a lot of weight to his comments. Whether you're more pessimistic and figure that 'everyone' at Ubisoft wants to work on Hexe because they see it as a life raft to not get laid off during a tumultuous time for the company, or because they think it might be one of the best games Ubisoft has in the works right now, neither could be possible if it wasn't, as Henderson says, "<em>shaping up</em>" so well.</p>



<p>Hopefully, we'll hear more about Hexe soon.</p>

            <guid>1447027</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Highguard</em> is changing up its menu in what could be <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-layoffs-dead-game-awards-live-service-2000668192">a last-ditch effort</a> to gain some traction as its player count continues to dwindle. A new mode dispenses with the looting phase entirely and will just have players raiding each others’ bases back and forth, nixing the phases that bored some players back at launch.</p> <p>Here’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/4128260?updates=true&amp;emclan=103582791475413365&amp;emgid=518613785064243442">Wildlight Entertainment’s description</a> of Raid Rush which goes live later today as part of the hero shooter’s latest update:</p> <div data-block="true" data-editor="66hhr" data-offset-key="dmg9h-0-0"> <blockquote> <p><span data-offset-key="dmg9h-0-0">In Raid Rush, 2 teams of 5 players will take turns attacking and defending their bases with no pesky looting phase in between.</span></p> </blockquote> </div> <div data-block="true" data-editor="66hhr" data-offset-key="8iip3-0-0"> <blockquote> <p><span data-offset-key="8iip3-0-0">Instead, select your base and use Trader Flynn to upgrade your weapons and equipment in a round based format. After each round, you’ll switch sides between attacking and defending. Your base walls and generators will be repaired, and you’ll be rewarded some Vesper to spend at the Trader, who will have different offers after every round. And don’t worry about buying armor – everyone has the same armor, and it will escalate in rarity as the rounds progress.</span></p> </blockquote> </div> <p data-offset-key="8iip3-0-0">Raid Rush will be an interesting experiment to see if <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-the-kotaku-review-is-it-good-free-ps5-pc-5v5-3v3-update-patch-2000664646"><em>Highguard</em></a> can be more appealing to players if they don’t have to wrap their heads around all of the map exploration, looting, and capture-the-flag mechanics in the first two thirds of each match. Personally, those are my favorite parts. One of the best things about <em>Highguard</em> are its mounts and those won’t be a part of Raid Rush at all.</p>

 <p data-offset-key="8iip3-0-0">The new update will also re-balance a few items and weapons. The Revive Amulet now gives a much smaller speed boost to the process of resurrecting fallen allies, and the Vanguard, by far the most dominant rifle in the game, has had its long-range damage taken down a notch. Similarly, the Dynasty, which has some wicked recoil, will now do increased damage to make up for the unwieldiness of it.</p> <h2 data-offset-key="8iip3-0-0"><i>Highguard</i> is hanging on by a thread</h2> <p data-offset-key="8iip3-0-0">If you play <em>Highguard</em> multiple times a week like I still do, the balance changes are good ones and the new mode will be interesting to try out, even if it’s fundamentally not what I want out of the game. But most people who gave it a shot at launch aren’t playing anymore. This week’s update is another incremental update that does little to address the lack of items and heroes the game needs to in order to feel more fully featured.</p>

 <p data-offset-key="8iip3-0-0">The game’s concurrent numbers on Steam have continued to fall off a cliff. <em>Highguard</em> started February at 15,000 concurrent players daily on PC. It’s now bobbing around just 500. The game seems to be doing better on console. Mat Piscatella shared with <em>Kotaku</em> that according to the Circana Player Engagement Tracker, <em>Highguard</em> was the 34th most played game on PS5 in the U.S. for the week ending February 14 based on weekly active users.</p>

 <p data-offset-key="8iip3-0-0">Anecdotally, I’ve never waited more than a few seconds during matchmaking on console, so despite all of the grim forecasts, it certainly <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-update-roadmap-servers-discord-2000670633">doesn’t feel like a dead game on console yet</a>. I would love for <em>Highguard</em> to recover somehow because, despite its shortcomings, I’ve been having a great time playing it. But games in its predicament need tons of runway or a major momentum-shifting boost, and so far <em>Highguard</em> doesn’t have either of those.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New York Attorney General Suing Valve Over Loot Boxes]]></title>

            <guid>1447021</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>On Wednesday, New York State Attorney General Letitia James <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2026/attorney-general-james-sues-game-developer-promoting-illegal-gambling-through?ref=aftermath.site"><u>announced</u></a> that the state is suing Valve, alleging that games like <em>Counter-Strike, Team Fortress, </em>and <em>Dota </em>“enable gambling by enticing users to pay for the chance to win a rare virtual item of significant monetary value.” The state is seeking to “permanently stop Valve from promoting gambling features in its games, disgorge all ill-gotten gains, and pay fines for violating New York’s laws.”</p><p>Most forms of gambling are <a href="https://nysba.org/the-state-of-new-york-gambling/?srsltid=AfmBOorpNzVkpIq9_6-qDRHWmILeltEj5u6ON534TOb-wqpRgSnZJmRq&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>banned</u></a> in New York State outside of certain exceptions (such as, depressingly, <a href="https://gaming.ny.gov/sports-wagering?ref=aftermath.site"><u>sports betting</u></a>). The state’s <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/court-filings/new-york-v-valve-corporation-complaint-2026.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>lawsuit</u></a> alleges that “Valve has knowingly engaged in a variety of conduct that materially aids gambling activity, including creating and establishing loot boxes, maintaining systems that enable users to open loot boxes, and soliciting and inducing users to open loot boxes. Valve also has knowingly profited from gambling activity through the sale of keys and loot boxes pursuant to an agreement or understanding whereby Valve participates in the proceeds of gambling.”</p><p>The lawsuit spends a lot of time explaining exactly how loot boxes in Valve games work, highlighting their design (“The spinning display and the accompanying sound that plays when a user opens a Valve loot box are examples of gameplay experiences similar to those employed by slot machines”) and the way this presentation can encourage players to keep opening loot boxes. The AG’s office is particularly concerned about the ways this could entice young people–whom it claims make up a large portion of the user base for the games in question–to gamble, with potentially harmful results.</p><p>“Loot boxes, like other forms of gambling, can lead to addiction and result in real harm. But Valve’s loot boxes are particularly pernicious because they are popular among children and adolescents, who are lured into opening loot boxes by the prospect of winning expensive virtual items that convey status in the gaming world,” the suit reads.</p><p>The AG’s office also notes the ecosystem of creators on Twitch and YouTube who make videos devoted solely to opening Valve loot boxes, with the suit reading that “Opening loot boxes has become a subject of interest, distinct from playing Valve’s games… [S]ome well-known streamers have created videos and channels dedicated solely to opening Counter-Strike weapons cases.”</p><p>The suit details the various ways Valve makes money off of loot boxes. This includes Valve selling keys for loot boxes themselves, earning commissions on skin sales on Valve’s Steam Community Market, and by Valve designing “the Steam platform to facilitate the purchase and sale of virtual items on third-party marketplaces,” with the suit alleging that “Valve has long understood that third-party marketplaces are important to the economy of the virtual items it has created. By providing a means for users to sell their virtual items for cash, these marketplaces motivate users to purchase keys from Valve in the hopes of opening a loot box and winning a high-value item they can cash in. More loot box openings also means more virtual items will be sold, which drives transactions and Valve commissions on the Steam platform itself.”&nbsp;</p><p>The suit alleges that players also make money selling skins on Valve’s and third-party marketplaces, as well as through this delightful tidbit:</p><blockquote>Steam users also can readily convert virtual items to cash by purchasing Steam hardware and then reselling it off platform. Indeed, an OAG investigator did so, converting a Counter-Strike skin called a “Stiletto Knife” to $180 by: (a) selling the skin on the Steam Community Market for Steam Wallet funds, (b) using the Steam Wallet funds received from the sale of the skin to purchase a Steam Deck, and (c) selling the Steam Deck for $180 in cash at a store that buys and sells electronics.</blockquote><p>While the games themselves “have proven to be remarkably lucrative for Valve, even though the games have been free to play for years,” the suit reads, “Valve has managed this feat by pioneering an alternative model for monetizing its games: gambling.”</p><p>Loot boxes have long fallen out of favor in most games, with many games having previously transitioned to more transparent <a href="https://www.economicsonline.co.uk/all/the-history-of-the-battle-pass-and-its-impact-on-microtransactions.html/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>battle passes</u></a> in the last decade, following controversy such as the boxes in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-battlefront-2s-loot-box-controversy-expl/1100-6455155/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Star Wars Battlefront II</u></em></a> and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/loot-box-state-of-play-2024-another-trip-around-the-world-of-regulation?ref=aftermath.site"><u>global changes to laws</u></a> governing them. (Brazil most recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-campaign-against-predatory-in-game-practices-takes-a-step-forward-in-brazil-as-president-lula-bans-loot-boxes-targeted-at-under-18s?ref=aftermath.site"><u>banned their sale</u></a> to people under 18.) However, some games are also experimenting with them again, with <a href="https://www.crossplay.news/p/fortnite-is-adding-loot-boxes?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Fortnite</u></em></a> introducing a version of them to some in-game islands, alongside <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/in-island-transactions-restrictions-in-fortnite?ref=aftermath.site"><u>rules</u></a> governing their availability and presentation.&nbsp;</p><p>“Illegal gambling can be harmful and lead to serious addiction problems, especially for our young people,” James is quoted as saying in the suit’s press release. “Valve has made billions of dollars by letting children and adults alike illegally gamble for the chance to win valuable virtual prizes. These features are addictive, harmful, and illegal, and my office is suing to stop Valve’s illegal conduct and protect New Yorkers.”</p>
