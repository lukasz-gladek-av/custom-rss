Alongside these tweaks, the update also appears to have coincided with some compatibility fixes, including one title we've been waiting to see up and running for a while: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nierautomata_the_end_of_yorha_edition">NieR:Automata The End of YoRHa Edition</a> (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/11/25/nintendo-switch-2-version-21-0-1-has-fixed-nier-automata/">My Nintendo News</a>).</p>
<p>Square Enix and PlatinumGames' sci-fi ARPG has long been sitting in a pretty bad way on Switch 2, with many users reporting frequent crashes when trying to get it up and running on the new hardware. A glance at <a href="https://switch-software-compatibility.nintendo.com/en-GB/details/010056b015fe8000">Nintendo's compatibility information site</a> <em>before</em> today listed NieR: Automata as "Unsupported - Problems with game progression have been found", but that all seems to be in the rear-view as of system update 21.0.1.</p><div><figure data-videoid="O4v-ia_qhCE" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O4v-ia_qhCE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytO4v-ia_qhCE" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/O4v-ia_qhCE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O4v-ia_qhCE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed405204gtvurz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>As of 25th November 2025 (that's today), the game's listing has been updated as "supported" on Switch 2, with the note that "previously identified issues have been fixed".</p>
<p>It's a welcome change, because NieR: Automata <em>ruled</em> on Switch 1, and now we have the perfect excuse to dive in all over again. In <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/nierautomata-the-end-of-yorha-edition">our 9/10 review</a> of the initial Switch release, we described Automata as "a top-notch port that has clearly been produced with respect and focus, often surpassing our expectations in both visuals and performance". *<em>Sigh</em>* as if we didn't already have enough backlog games to get through before the year is up...</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/insta360-shows-no-mercy-on-x5-360-8k-action-cam-now-selling-for-less-than-basic-action-cams-2000647178</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/insta360-shows-no-mercy-on-x5-360%C2%B0-8k-action-cam-now-selling-for-less-than-basic-action-cams.1363939/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Insta360 has stolen market share from GoPro and DJI in recent years as it transformed from an upstart challenger into the definitive action camera brand that content creators and adventure people reach for first. It’s been the combination of innovative <strong>360-degree capture, AI-powered editing and useful features</strong> like the invisible selfie stick effect that positioned Insta360 as the company pushing boundaries while established competitors iterated incrementally.</p>
<p>The X5 launched in April as its feature-packed flagship model justifying the premium positioning, but this Black Friday brings the first significant discount: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5767/">At $464, down from $549, this 8K 360-degree camera has hit a record-low price</a> on Amazon and delivers everything that made Insta360 the action camera leader.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5767/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>8K Resolution That Captures Everything</h2>
<p>The dual 1/1.28-inch sensors work together to <strong>capture 8K resolution at 30fps across the full 360-degree field of view</strong> for footage that has incredible detail and survives aggressive cropping and reframing in post with ease. This resolution counts because 360-degree cameras need excess capture area so you can choose your framing after the fact rather than commit to an angle at the time of recording. These larger sensors also improve on low-light performance, color accuracy, and dynamic range compared to the smaller sensors on competing action cameras and turn out footage that looks professional.</p>



<p>This game-changing, t<strong>riple AI chip design distributes processing across specialized silicon for real-time noise reduction, image processing, and AI-assisted features</strong> – all operating concurrently without thermal throttling or performance compromise. But this architecture really lets you fly when shooting in tough low-light conditions that leave competitors’ cameras producing unusable grainy footage, delivering clean video even during those golden hours, indoor scenes, or nighttime adventures. Advanced features such as auto subject-tracking, horizon leveling, and smart reframing-all using AI to analyze 360-degree footage for ideal crop point suggestions that capture the action-are powered by onboard AI processing.</p>
<p>The<strong> invisible selfie stick effect is Insta360’s signature feature</strong> which creates impossible third-person perspectives that make it seem like a drone or cameraman is following you. It captures 360 degrees of everything, including the extended selfie stick, which the stitching algorithm intelligently removes from the final footage via geometric analysis and image processing. That gives you the cinematic shots you dream of: a floating camera tracking your movements in places that feel professionally filmed but are completely self-operated.</p>



<p><em>FlowState</em> stabilization combined with 360-degree Horizon Lock eliminates the need for gimbals through computational stabilization, analyzing motion and then correcting it through post-processing. Stabilization handles aggressive movements, bumps, crashes, and full camera rotations while maintaining level, smooth footage that looks professionally stabilized. The horizon lock specifically ensures the horizon line stays perfectly level regardless of how the camera tumbles or rotates during action sequences, preventing the disorienting tilted footage that ruins otherwise great action shots.</p>
<p>The replaceable lens system is a practical innovation in itself as it protects your investment by allowing quick lens swaps the moment scratches, cracks, or damage occur. Traditional action cameras require expensive repairs or an outright replacement when lenses get damaged in crashes, drops, or impacts that inevitably occur during action sports. The <strong>X5’s lenses detach and replace in mere seconds</strong> without requiring tools, thus enabling one to take spare lenses along on extended trips or adventures where lens damage becomes likely.</p>
<p>The <strong>advanced 4-microphone array</strong> captures clearer audio by first reducing the amount of wind interference that usually ruins action camera soundtracks. It does this through several microphones placed strategically around the camera body, combined with AI processing that identifies and suppresses wind noise while preserving voice and ambient sounds.</p>
<p>At $464, the Insta360 X5 brings 8K 360-degree video, triple AI chip processing, invisible selfie stick compatibility, FlowState stabilization, replaceable lenses, and enhanced wind reduction at 15% off retail this Black Friday. Insta360 remains the market leader over GoPro and DJI not because of incremental spec bumps but rather through relentless innovation in features that actually matter to content creators.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-shaves-a-whopping-80-off-the-15-inch-dell-inspiron-3530-but-the-discount-ends-soon-2000647081</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dell-clears-out-the-2025-laptop-at-80-off-as-remaining-stock-runs-low-redragon-wireless-keyboard-and-mouse-included.1363936/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Now is a great time to upgrade your tech for less. Black Friday is just around the corner, and early deals are coming in hot. Those looking to grab a new laptop this shopping season, whether for themselves or a loved one, should consider bagging the heavily discounted 15-inch Dell Inspiron 3530 at Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5915/">This machine typically retails for around $4,000, but Amazon is offering it at a whopping 80% discount, which brings the down to just $798.</a> And as if that wasn’t enough, the retailer is also throwing in a Redragon keyboard and mouse kit for absolutely nothing. Windows 11 Pro comes pre-installed, too, so you’re saving on that front as well.</p>
<p>The only catch? This deal, at the time of writing, is only available to Prime members. Non-Prime members will still see it at its normal, not-so-friendly $4,000 tag. That said, if you’re planning to shop heavy during the main event, now is a good time to jump on a Prime membership. It lets you enjoy fast, free shipping with your purchases, access member-only deals, and unlock early discounts. The retailer offers a 30-day free trial to new users. After that, you can expect to pay around $15 a month.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5915/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Complete, Ready-to-Go Setup</h2>
<p>In a fairly minimal design, the laptop offers a 15.6-inch Full HD IPS touchscreen. 220 nits of brightness push clear, vibrant visuals, while the anti-glare coating keeps reflections at bay. Touch support makes navigation a breeze. Not in the mood to use the trackpad or drag the mouse around? Just use your fingers directly on the screen to perform tasks. Pinch for a wider view, stretch to zoom in, swipe away, scroll long documents, or maybe use the on-screen keyboard to take notes; the possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>Just above the screen is a solid 720p HD webcam that makes it easy to catch up with friends and hop on meetings without needing an external camera.</p>
<p>This machine runs on the updated 10-core Intel Core i5-1334U processor, which handles both everyday school and work tasks like a pro. The chip is paired with a massive 32GB DDR4 RAM for snappier multitasking, and a 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD for quicker boot times. You’ll be able to perform a whole bunch of tasks (researching, writing, taking video calls) simultaneously without a hint of lag, which makes the laptop ideal for creatives who need to hop through different programs at the same time. The 1TB SSD provides plenty of space to store your important data, whether it’s hundreds of photos, a ton of videos, or unusually large research papers. The capacity should be enough for most users out there, unless you’re looking to house ever-growing libraries of media files without relying on external solutions.</p>



<p>Connectivity options are plenty. You’ll enjoy a stable, wireless connection with WiFi 6 and Bluetooth, plus be able to connect a range of external peripherals using the built-in ports. Speaking of peripherals, the free kit gets you a solid Redragon laptop keyboard and mouse. The former is quite lightweight and comes with detachable keys. The mouse has a sturdy feel, and is quite comfortable to use for longer sessions.</p>
<p>Windows 11 Pro comes pre-installed, meaning you don’t have to worry about any complicated installation procedures to get started. Microsoft has loaded the operating system with a bunch of useful productivity and security features that are ideal for remote workers, business owners, creatives, and even students. Just note that Microsoft Office isn’t included, and you will need to purchase it separately later if needed.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5915/">Overall, the Dell Inspiron 15 3530 touchscreen laptop is a great option to consider for both work and play, especially at its current price. You’re saving more than $3,200 on this powerhouse.</a> Grab the deal before it’s too late.</p>

But is it going to be a turn-based RPG? We're taking this aside from the fact that Expedition 33 was received well, we received a lot of 'JRPGs are back' comments. For me, I'm thinking about what game experience fans will enjoy. That's the most important point."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In July, Naoki Yoshida, the director/producer of Final Fantasy 14 and producer of Final Fantasy 16, was asked in an interview with <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2025-07-08/final-fantasy-xvi-producer-on-the-series-future/.226405" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AnimeNewsNetwork</a> whether mainline Final Fantasy games could go back to being turn-based, in the wake of Clair Obscur's success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"With this question of turn-based versus action, it tends to isolate the gameplay to just the battle system," said Yoshida. "That doesn't take into account what kind of game the creators want to deliver to players. For example, based on a certain graphical quality we want to present to our players, or the narrative we want to deliver to our players, it relates to how we set up the game's systems around it. This includes the battle system, game design, and gameplay feel. It's not a clear-cut answer, whether it will become all turn-based, or if it's going to become more action-based.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"[I'm] not necessarily going to be on Final Fantasy 17, so we also don't want to obstruct or limit our future director or whomever will be producing the games like 17 or even 18," Yoshida continued. "We don't want to put them on a rail."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Final Fantasy Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-developers-visited-square-enixs-offices-for-a-rich-exchange-of-ideas">It later emerged that several members of the Clair Obscur team had recently visited Square Enix's offices</a> and met with some of the development leads there, including Hamaguchi and <a href="https://x.com/YoshidaBeer/status/1948371688338424076" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visions of Mana director Ryosuke Yoshida</a>. <a href="https://x.com/nhamaguc/status/1948389582665547854" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a social post</a>, Hamaguchi described it as a "creatively rich exchange of visions and ideas."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has sold <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1975924077496852782" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>five million copies in five months</u></a>, making it one of the biggest hits of the year.

              <p data-start="0" data-end="304">Music truly comes to life when you experience it with a high-quality pair of headphones. One of the best in the market today is Sony’s flagship noise-canceling model, the WH-1000XM5. Known for their exceptional sound and comfort, these headphones offer a premium listening experience that’s hard to match. Currently, they’re available at a great price as one of Amazon’s early Black Friday deals, with discount of $62 off. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5917/">Normally priced at $460, the platinum silver, black, and midnight blue versions are now reduced by 13%, bringing them down to just $398.</a></p>
<p data-start="685" data-end="1266">I must applaud Sony on what they’ve done here. When we look at the naming schemes for Sony’s competitors in the space, we find products like the Apple AirPods Max or the Samsung Galaxy Buds. These catchy, memorable names tie in neatly with their companies’ broader product lineups.</p>
<p data-start="685" data-end="1266">Then we have Sony. This brand decided to go with the WH-1000XM6. This assortment of letters and numbers give little indication they represent a pair noise-cancelling wireless headphones aside from the WH. This is less a product name and more an internal SKU number, and I find that just beautiful. These headphones don’t need some flashy name. The headphones speak for themselves.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5917/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="685" data-end="1266">Cancel Out the World Around You</h2>
<p data-start="1268" data-end="1700">A standout feature of the WH-1000XM6 is their exceptional noise-canceling capabilities. Sony has designed these headphones with advanced processors and twelve microphones that work together to detect and counteract external sounds. This advanced noise-canceling technology creates a completely immersive listening experience, allowing you to enjoy your music, podcast, or audiobook without the distractions of the outside world.</p>
<p data-start="1702" data-end="2038">The noise cancellation is especially noticeable (or maybe unnoticeable?) during phone calls. Thanks to the built-in microphones, your voice is isolated and amplified—even in noisy environments. Whether you’re in a crowded café or a busy office, the person on the other end of the call will hear you clearly, with no background noise to disrupt the conversation.</p>


<p data-start="2040" data-end="2685">In terms of comfort, the WH-1000XM6 excels. The headphones are wrapped in soft, synthetic leather, making them feel plush and comfortable against your ears, even during extended listening sessions. They’re lightweight too, which means you can wear them for hours without feeling fatigued. In fact, with an impressive 30-hour battery life, you can listen to music or take calls throughout the day without worrying about recharging. And if you do forget to charge them, don’t stress. A quick three-minute charge will give you an additional three hours of playback—enough to get you through the rest of your commute or the next leg of your journey.</p>
<p data-start="2687" data-end="3100" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Whether you’re a music lover, a podcast enthusiast, or someone who just wants to enjoy a quiet moment in a noisy world, these headphones are an excellent choice. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5917/">With the current discounts of $62 off, there’s no better time to grab a pair of the Sony WH-1000XM6 headphones and experience their next-level audio quality.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is gearing up to welcome Season 1 and all of its new content across multiplayer, Zombies, and Warzone. The Season 1 Battle Pass is the first for Black Ops 7, and Treyarch has announced sweeping changes ahead of launch.</p>



<p>Many people take exception to the live-service Battle Pass model, especially when you’ve already paid full price for a game. Some companies do it better than others, and Call of Duty passes can be hit or miss. The first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-battle-pass-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 Battle Pass</a> is nearly here, and Treyarch is making it better than ever.</p>

<p>Treyarch announced lots of new content for Black Ops 7 Season 1 on November 24. We learned about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-season-1-adds-new-weapons-and-attachments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new weapons and attachments</a>, as well as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-multiplayer-receives-8-new-modes-in-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eight new modes</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-season-1-is-getting-six-new-multiplayer-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">six new multiplayer maps</a>.</p>







<p>However, one of the bigger talking points emerged after the content was revealed. In a post on X, Treyarch unveiled various tweaks and adjustments to “Significantly improve the Battle Pass experience for all Black Ops 7 and Call of Duty: Warzone players.”</p>



<p>Here are the key updates:</p>



<ul>
<li>“Tuning adjustments” have been made regarding Battle Pass completion times. This should ensure every Black Ops 7 pass will be “more rewarding for the time you spend playing.”</li>



<li>“Earlier pages in the Black Ops 7 Battle Pass can now be completed faster with fewer tiers needed to unlock HVT content, while later pages will contain more rewards. This means players will earn high-value content sooner across all 100 tiers.”</li>



<li>Finally, Battle Pass Tokens can be earned through Daily Challenges—also available in Co-Op Campaign &amp; Endgame.</li>
</ul>



<p>The comments on the post were generally positive. But one key change wasn’t addressed that was frequently mentioned: Having the content be available <em>once </em>the pass expires. It remains to be seen if this is something Treyarch looks at for future Black Ops 7 Battle Passes.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>With Season 01 just around the corner, we’re excited to announce new changes to significantly improve the Battle Pass experience for all Black Ops 7 and Call of Duty: Warzone players, starting on Dec. 4th:</p><p> 1.

<p>Skate Story is the next game from Zarvot developer Sam Eng, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/devolver-digital">Devolver Digital</a> on publishing duties. It will retail for £18.</p>
<p>"Ollie, kickflip, and grind your way through the ash and smoke of the Underworld as you take on a seemingly impossible quest. Skate fast to destroy demons and save other tortured souls on your journey from fragile beginner to a hardened skater," reads the official Skate Story blurb on Steam.</p><p>The game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/demonic-skateboarding-game-skate-story-coming-in-2023">initially announced several years ago</a>, but has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-devolver-digital-is-delaying-into-2025">faced its share of delays since then</a>. But, those days are behind us now, and Skate Story's release is tantalisingly close. I do rather like the look of this one, I have to say.</p>

            <p>
The original 256GB LCD version of Valve's Steam Deck is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck/">20% off till 1st December</a>, knocking it down to around $319.20 or £279.20 in the UK. It's all part of this year's Blackening of Friday, whereby whimpering price tags are shoved partway into sausage machines for the benefit of the first Xmas shoppers. 
</p>
<p>
"That's a chunk of cheddar," whistled our new editorial director Julian, a choice of words I choose to take literally, mostly because he's just ruined my sausage machine analogy. According to the UK's Office of National Statistics, cheddar was 873p a kilogram as of January 2025, the last recorded figure. Assuming that average holds true, the Steam Deck is currently worth 32 kilograms of classic farmhouse cheese. That <em>is</em> a chunk of cheddar. Good work, Julian! This is why they handed you the big boss trousers.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
I'm vegan, so I'm totally unswayed by all these dairy-based overtures, but even if I were one of you lactose junkies, I still wouldn't get a Steam Deck at 20% off. James loaned me one of his a year or so ago, and I was quite impressed by its ability to let me play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a> lying down, but my PC gaming is half-and-half MK and controller. I already own a Switch, which has maybe a third of the best PC action-platformers on it already, and I've found that Steam Deck sucks for quintessentially desktop genres like real-time strategy. 
</p>
<p>
It's possible that this is a misapprehension born of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mech-engineers-demo-is-for-people-who-love-hateful-interface-design">lingering, amorous hatred for Mech Engineer's demo</a>, and that I'm missing out on a golden age of tightly optimised controller-native harvester raids and flanking actions. I look forward to your outraged comments in defence of portable Starcraft.</p><p>Yes, I know I can get a wireless mouse and keyboard, but if I'm going to round the thing out with accessories, why not just splurge on a basic gaming laptop with a better screen that can be used for a bunch of other things? Yes, I know you can output to your TV, but I've banished my TV to a wardrobe because the power "button" broke, and I've lost the remote. Hello, TV manufacturers! Please can you put proper fucking buttons on TVs again. A single, brittle plastic tab hidden inside the frame is not adequate for my needs.  
</p>
<p>
In conclusion, I hope you'll join me in firmly rejecting Valve's cut-price Steam Deck. Think of all the cheddar you'll be able to buy with the cash you've saved, you stinky whey-fancier. Alternatively, you could put your cheese money towards the purchase of a Steam Deck OLED - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-oled-review">I hear they're decent</a> - or one of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-announce-a-new-steam-machine-steam-controller-and-the-steam-frame-vr-headset-and-ive-played-them">Valve's many forthcoming new gizmos</a>.</p>
<p>If you do insist on buying an original Steam Deck, I recommend reading James's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-academy">Steam Deck academy hub</a> (as advertised in the header), which encompasses how-to guides, accessory roundups, and game-specific performance and settings overviews. Perhaps if enough of you read that piece, James will feel magnaminous and lend me one of his again, so that I can finish being angry and frustrated at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mech-engineer">Mech Engineer</a>.

<p>The very foundations of Rockstar Games were rocked in 2020 when Dan Houser left. Losing a co-founder was tough, but a source claims that the communication breakdown actually stemmed from a disagreement between Dan and his brother Sam.</p>



<p>Dan Houser has usually shied away from the spotlight over the years. But the Absurd Ventures founder has been more vocal in recent weeks. His sit-down interview with Lex Fridman revealed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rockstar-games-co-founder-reveals-real-reason-why-agent-was-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">real reason why Agent was canceled</a>, and he’s also opened up on why <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bully-2-rockstar-development-bandwidth-dan-houser/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bully 2 never happened</a>.</p>



<p>A new unofficial line has opened up on his Rockstar Games departure.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Where would the franchise be now? Credit to Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you know anything about GTA leaks, you probably know how reliable and revered Tez2 is in the GTA community. They’ve been a constant source of major GTA and Rockstar leaks for years.</p>







<p>So when the topic of Dan Houser leaving Rockstar Games recently popped up on the <a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/1004182-rockstar-games-alleged-union-busting/page/6/#comment-1072611067" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GTAForums</a>, Tez2 stepped in with a claim. One user asked: “We will probably never know exactly the reasons why [Dan Houser left], but I’m not the only one with this opinion, and pretending everything is hunky dory at Rockstar is baffling, especially when we keep hearing bad things coming from people working at a company that is in the middle of a union-busting scandal.”</p>



<p>Here was Tez2’s response:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“He left over a disagreement with his brother about the company’s direction, as per two former devs. If it was due to union busting or working conditions, he would have left in 2018 as a way of apologizing for his comment quoted in Schreier’s article.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This was in response to the recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fired-employees-were-leaking-information-rockstar-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rockstar Games firings</a>. Tez2 makes it clear that the two issues are not connected, but again, this isn’t official until this is all confirmed in the books one day.</p>



<p>Do you think Dan Houser’s exit will affect the quality of GTA 6? Should the brothers reunite for at least one more big project in the future? Let everyone know through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

The Pokémon Cafe's new menu looks set to bring these sweet treats into the real world, but it also might be teasing that a pair of legendary 'mon will make their return in the DLC.</p>
<p>Yep, we live in a world where Pokémon spoilers can come from anywhere, even doughnuts. But come on, take a look at the above two baked goods — currently appearing under the tentative titles of "Red Doughnut" and "Blue Doughnut" on the Pokémon Café's <a href="https://www.pokemon-cafe.jp/ja/pikachu_sweets/news/251121_3309.html">Pikachu Sweets website</a> — and tell us that you <em>don't</em> see Gen III legendaries Groudon and Kyogre.</p><div><figure data-videoid="Ty8h-8gLSNk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ty8h-8gLSNk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytTy8h-8gLSNk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ty8h-8gLSNk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ty8h-8gLSNk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed63b0c7yqsoip&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>These two doughnuts will appear in Tokyo's Pikachu Sweets store from 10th December for 550 yen. The accompanying item description teases, "The doughnuts are inspired by the special doughnuts that appear in the paid add-on content, 'Pokémon Legends: Z-A - Mega Dimension'! They look like some kind of Pokémon...?" — huh, you don't say.</p>
<p>A 'Hoopa's Mischief Ruby Chocolate Frappe' will also join the menu on the same date. Its bright pink colouring, cream, and Cheerio topping makes the whole thing look a <em>little</em> too sweet in this writer's opinion, but there's no knocking its dedication to the DLC bit.</p>

<p>You'll be able to start your journey through Hyperspace Luminose when the Legends: Z-A DLC arrives on 10th December for £24.99 / $29.99. We've seen a handful of new Megas coming to the expansion so far, including Raichu, Baxcalibur, Chimecho and Zeraora. The final DLC news drop will come next week on 2nd December, so brace for even more newbies.</p>

			<p>The new Ghost of Yotei 1.100 patch introduces significant performance improvements on PlayStation 5 Pro by enabling 120 Hz VRR across all of the game's display modes.</p>



<p><span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">These performance improvements are showcased in a new comparison video shared by&nbsp;<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.youtube.com/@RajmanGamingHD/videos" target="_blank">RajmanGaming HD,</a>&nbsp;which compares the game running with and without VRR enabled, using all of the game's display modes: Ray Tracing Pro, Balanced Ray Tracing Pro, Ray Tracing, Performance, Balanced, and Quality.</span> The comparison makes it clear how a significant amount of performance is left on the table on the PlayStation 5 Pro with the frame rate capped, as framerates are higher across all display modes with VRR and uncapped framerate.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><th>Display Mode</th><th>VRR OFF / Capped Framerate</th><th>VRR ON / Uncapped Framerate</th></tr><tr><td><strong>Ray Tracing Pro</strong></td><td>40 FPS</td><td>60 FPS (Average)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Balanced Ray Tracing</strong></td><td>40 FPS</td><td>60 FPS (Average)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ray Tracing</strong></td><td>30 FPS</td><td>40 FPS</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Performance</strong></td><td>60 FPS</td><td>Up to 95 FPS</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Balanced</strong></td><td>40 FPS</td><td>Up to 60 FPS</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Quality</strong></td><td>30 FPS</td><td>40 FPS</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

</p></figure>



<p>Ghost of Yotei also supports 120 Hz VRR on base PlayStation 5 with the new patch, but no performance comparison has been conducted to date, so it's not yet known how much performance was untapped with capped framerates on the system.</p>



<h2 id="h-1-100-patch-is-more-than-just-performance-improvements">1.100 Patch is More Than Just Performance Improvements</h2>



<p>Besides introducing 120 Hz VRR support and the new Balanced display modes, the new Ghost of Yotei 1.100 patch introduces a lot of new features that enhance the experience considerably, such as the ability to auto-loot items, an option to turn off fall damage, new Photo Mode features, a New Game+ mode, replayable endgame content, balance changes, and more. You can learn more about the new content and changes with the <a href="https://support.suckerpunch.com/hc/en-us/articles/43659450672795-Patch-1-100">official patch notes.</a></p>

            <p>Ubisoft has announced an in-game crossover quest between <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> and Attack on Titan (no, I wasn't expecting this this morning, either). This is a time-limited event, which will be available from today (25th November), until 22nd December.</p>
<p>"Deep within the enigmatic Crystal Cave, a terrifying experiment may unleash a monstrous enemy," reads the official blurb. "Will Naoe and Yasuke survive what lurks in the depths?"</p>
<p>You can check out a teaser for the Assassin's Creed Shadows x Attack on Titan collaboration below.</p>

<p>The new quest is available to all players who have unlocked Assassin's Creed Shadows' Yasuke as a playable character. As for the quest itself, it can be unlocked by talking to the quest-giver - Ada - in the Yamashiro region, North of Hanazo Tower.</p><p>Once things then kick off, players will be able to find customisations for their hideout, such as banners and a statue. Once the quest is complete, players will then be able to get their hands on a new crystal katana for Naoe.</p>
<p>There will also be in-store Attack on Titan item packs made available. These include outfits, weapons, trinkets, and a new mount to travel across the land with.</p>

<p>In addition to these Attack on Titan goodies, the latest Assassin's Creed Shadows update also adds the game's third free story drop known as A Puzzlement. This is described by Ubisoft as a "fun and humorous" quest for Naoe and Yasuke, who "encounter two old acquaintances having a loud argument about a mysterious door in south Wakasa". The duo need to work out how to open said door.</p>
<p>On their way to open this door, Naoe and Yasuke will learn new skills - lithe Naoe will learn how to perform her own version of Yasuke's war kick, while the powerful Yasuke will learn how to dispatch enemies in a non-lethal and stealthy way.</p>
<p>As with the Attack on Titan quest, players will need to have unlocked Yasuke as a playable character before accessing A Puzzlement. They will also need to have defeated two of the Shinbakufu.</p>

            <p>Yet another Nier Automata crossover has been announced, as 2B continues her journey to guest in as many different video games as possible. This time, she'll be pulling up to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-7-ever-crisis">Final Fantasy 7: Ever Crisis</a> as a boss fight, and bringing fancy cosmetics with her.</p>
<p>Starting the 27th November, the crossover event is split into two parts. First, the 2B boss fight event. By clearing panel missions players will unlock the Whirling Ravager enemy ability which is a pretty nifty feat of offensive acrobatics.</p>
<p>Then there are the cosmetics - it wouldn't be a crossover event without them, obviously. Players can earn Nier Automata-themed skins for both Yuffie and Tifa, both donning the Android black getups and blindfold. Each also has a new Nier Automata weapon skin too, to complete the look.</p>

<p>Final Fantasy 7: Ever Crisis is a gacha game, in case you didn't know. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-ever-crisis-turns-square-enixs-best-into-an-avalanche-of-money-grabbing-tactics">It's riddled with microtransactions</a>. This means you'll have to do gacha pulls for the Tifa and Yuffie skins. During the event, you can get ten free draws a day for the skins, and there's a login bonus too which'll reward players 3,000 blue crystals for logging in during the crossover. You also get one free crossover weapon draw a day too, which should hopefully make things a little easier to obtain.</p><p>Nier Automata is probably one of the most prolific crossover franchises in gaming history. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blades-nier-automata-dlc-drops-later-this-month">Stellar Blade had a Nier Automata crossover</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14s-nier-automata-inspired-raid-gets-an-airing-in-new-trailer">Final Fantasy 14 had a whole crossover raid</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/2b-from-nier-automata-confirmed-for-soulcalibur-6">2B popped up in Soul Calibur 6 of all places</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/babylons-fall-getting-nier-automata-collaboration-in-first-post-launch-season">even Babylon's Fall had a Nier collaboration</a>.</p>
<p>What's your favourite Nier Automata crossover? Let us know below, as well as when you think we'll get another mainline release in the series. It's got to be soon, surely!</p>

			<p>Isn’t it nice when a game comes out of nowhere and totally blows you away with its brilliance? GigaSword is one such game, a completely gorgeous nostalgia-soaked love-letter to the NES gaming era and metroidvanias.</p>
<p><iframe title="GIGASWORD | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oafJX_6jJ0w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Stylistically, GigaSword looks like a game that nine-year old me could have been blowing out dust from its cartridge before booting it up. However, there’s a lot more going on with GigaSword than can be seen in a static screen shot, with a multitude of modern video game sensibilities enhancing the experience significantly. Thanks to the hand-drawn visuals, there’s a palpable smoothness to the animation which most definitely was not a feature of my favourite NES games; heroic player character Ezra moving with effortless grace due to the sumptuous frame-by-frame animation.</p>


<p>Despite utilising only 25 colours, the expansive world – or tower, I suppose – that Ezra must explore in order to defeat big bid guy General Vearst and his cronies, is enormously varied, with some genuinely impressive vistas to stumble upon. The parallax backgrounds provide far more depth than a classic NES era game, depicting dust coated libraries, dingy dungeons, and dank sewers, but never losing that distinctive late 80’s/early 90’s aesthetic that remains so effortlessly endearing.</p>


<p>Thankfully, one thing GigaSword does loose from the NES era is the unrelenting difficulty, as my middle-aged reactions really aren’t what they used to be. Combat is satisfyingly simple and completely fair. Sure, some of the screen-filling bosses will test you, but thanks to a perfect difficulty curve and very generous check points – definitely not a feature of NES games! – your progress will not be hampered for long, resulting in an enjoyable and frustration free retro experience.</p>
<p>If it was just the combat and the exploration of a metroidvania that GigaSword offered, along with a slightly too slow release of new abilities, it would be decent but nothing special. However, the inclusion of an impressive range of puzzles elevates Jack Breen’s labour of digital love to the upper echelons of its genre. GigaSword, you see, is all about answering the question of what it would be like to actually wield an enormous sword. And, have no doubts, Ezra’s sword is so massive that it would make even Cloud Strife jealous.</p>

<p>Unlike the buster sword, though, Ezra’s weapon of choice is actually heavy. Whilst carrying it he isn’t as manoeuvrable and cannot jump, climb, and swim with as much grace-filled ease as he otherwise would. Cue some brilliant puzzles. The GigaSword is both vital but also an encumbrance, the player having to solve some deviously innovative brainteasers to get both Ezra and his sword through each section. We’re talking The Legend of Zelda levels of brilliance here, with each puzzle mechanic starting out seemingly basic, but then building and building until it hits the perfect amount of brain-tingling delight and satisfaction that only the best puzzle games can achieve. Each time I thought I’d seen every puzzle element that GigaSword had to offer, the game threw another superbly calibrated idea my way. Indeed, with a run-time getting on to twenty hours, there’s a whole lot of GigaSword here to enjoy.</p>
<p>The music is also brilliant, summoning the iconic sounds of NES era to the delight of my lugholes. GigaSword’s soundtrack was made in Famitracker using the Konami VRC6 sound chip, so it really delivers on the nostalgia. Alongside, to my great but welcome surprise, a genuinely emotive storyline and well-rounded characters, GigaSword proves that there really isn’t anything developer Jack Breen can’t do.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="39a6170d6ab5b"><a title="The Duskbloods leak" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/39a6170d6ab5b/the-duskbloods-leak.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: FromSoftware</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/duskbloods">The Duskbloods</a>, being that it's a FromSoftware joint and all that good stuff, is certainly high on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/27-upcoming-nintendo-switch-2-games-were-excited-for-in-2025">our list of things we're very excited about</a> arriving on Switch 2 in the near future. However, given that it's a multiplayer-typed deal in the same vein as the studio's divisive <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/elden_ring_nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a>, we understand that there's a little more trepidation surrounding it, or at least that's how it's felt.</p>
<p>Solo FromSoftware efforts get a big thumbs up very quickly, it seems, but words like 'multiplayer' or even 'online' might make you feel it's not a full-fat adventure from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dark_souls_remastered">Dark Souls</a> studio, perhaps. It's understandable. And yet, according to a new leak surrounding the game (as reported by <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-duskbloods-is-more-innovative-than-elden-ring-according-to-new-leak/">Vice</a>), The Duskbloods has been cooking longer and having more consideration put into it than any of FromSoft's work thus far.</p>
<p>The leak in question comes from a Chinese journalist who gained credibility after leaking correct <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a> info before it launched back in 2022. As translated by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lHUBWlGTgY">Ziostorm</a>, they report that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“From what I know, <em>The Duskbloods</em> was greenlit even earlier than the marketing period for <em>Sekiro’s</em> release. It is the FromSoftware title that has spent the longest time purely on gameplay prototyping and validation among all of their games so far. Although its PVE and PVP, it reportedly contains many innovative elements the team themselves are very proud of.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They go on to claim that the game, which sees Hidetaka Miyazaki on directing duties, lest you forget, could be more influential than the likes of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/sekiro_shadows_die_twice">Sekiro</a> (which launched in 2019) and its great big red mark that it paints on baddies for you. So it seems as though there may well be some big new mechanic at work here that we are yet to find out about as you get down and dirty as one of the game's vampire-flavoured Dusksworn combatants.</p>
<p>You can check out the full quote in Ziostorm's time-stamped video:</p>

<p>As to why it's been so quiet on the news front regarding the game thus far, the same leaker says that all Elden Ring Nightreign DLC will be wrapped up (something which occurs on 7th December) before FromSoftware turn their full attention to revving up their Duskblood engines. Oooh, we're quite excited, actually.</p>
<p>With no confirmed release date beyond "2026", plus not a whole lot of info about the PvPvE online adventure to sink our teeth into <em>and</em> the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/elden-ring-delayed-on-switch-2-to-allow-time-for-performance-adjustments">Switch 2 port of Elden Ring delayed into next year</a>, let's hope we're in for a little pre-Xmas info drop. Or even just a tease. Come on, lads, give us something! Check out the reveal trailer below for a reminder.</p>

			<p>Lynked: Banner of the Spark is perhaps the cosiest video game I can think of. It’s like a digital snoodie. One of the one’s that’s so soft it envelopes you entirely in a cloud of comfort. But don’t let Lynked’s 3D cartoon styled visuals fool you, this game is no pushover, offering an addictive and compelling dungeon-crawler experience.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lynked: Banner of the Spark | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x_6zU2ktIhQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game begins with an AI apocalypse, though the despicable robot that caused this global catastrophe is so adorable you’d be forgiven for just wanting to give them a hug. You take on the role of one of the last remaining humans, trapped within a brightly coloured and rather pleasant looking prison. You get to customise your character before you begin, with a rather beguiling amount of option to give your hero a unique look – hands off the big blue Gandalf beard though, that’s mine. Once you look suitably spiffing, the game begins proper with a prison break. You team up with a cute little robo called Buddy who guides you to freedom, and handily explains how to play the game on your way.</p>


<p>Combat is simple but satisfying. Played from a top-down perspective, your little fella takes it to their cutesy Pixar-ish foes – consisting of big cyclops-eyed mechs, teeny drones, and anthropomorphic androids – with the standard variety of combo attacks, dashes, and special abilities. You’ve fought these fights a thousand times or more, but there’s something comforting about the familiarity of the combat mechanics, which I’m pretty sure is what the developer FuzzyBot was going for. Sometimes the sense of contact when you strike feels a little off, rather too lightweight, and dashes aren’t always effective, but otherwise these are reliably enjoyable fisticuffs.</p>


<p>Being a roguelite, you head out to a dungeon, get as far as you can before dying, then start all over again, albeit with some permanent upgrades that make you slightly more powerful than you were before. It’s nice and satisfying to make incremental progress, but the real incentive to battle through that dungeon is to receive new building types for your town. That’s right, Lynked: Banner of the Spark is a building sim too, and it’s in this aspect that the game really delivers.</p>
<p>There’s a huge variety of buildings to decorate your homestead with, each having a meaningful impact on the gameplay experience, providing players with new abilities or tools to take back into the dungeon. Placing buildings and customising their look is simple and accessible and utterly wonderful, thanks to how freaking gorgeous everything looks when you get it set up just right. There’s a ton of activities to entertain yourself with too; from fishing, to gathering resources, farming, and socialising with the town’s charming inhabitants.</p>

<p>It’s all rather lovely, but there’s just one problem: a vital part of Lynked: Banner of the Spark is multiplayer. You can explore fellow player’s towns, assist them in their construction, take part in social activities, and obviously go get some loot from a nearby dungeon together. At least, that’s the idea. On PS5 I struggled to find a single other person to play with. Perhaps on other formats with a higher player count this would be less of an issue, but it did mean that my time with Lynked: Banner of the Spark was strictly single player. A real shame that there are no local multiplayer options either, as the game would seem an ideal fit for some enjoyable couch co-op shenanigans.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Lynked: Banner of the Spark is a hot chocolate of a game. Sweet, sumptuous and oh, so cosy. It offers an intriguing and fresh experience thanks to combining roguelite dungeon crawling with town-building, and it keeps you engaged from beginning to end. It's just a shame that, on PS5 at least, it’s a resolutely single-player experience rather than the multiplayer one that it’s intended to be.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A new Nintendo Switch 2 system update is now live, introducing fixes for a couple of specific issues while improving the system's stability.</p>



<p>The 21.0.1 update, which is also live for the original Nintendo Switch, addresses an issue that caused Error Code: 2011-0301 or Error Code: 2168-0002 to occur when attempting a system transfer from a Switch system to a Switch 2 system.</p>



<p>The new Nintendo Switch 2 system update also addresses an issue that prevented Bluetooth devices from connecting to the console after waking up the system from Sleep Mode or turning off Airplane Mode. This was a particularly annoying issue that forced the user to reboot the system, so this fix is particularly welcome.</p>



<p>Being a minor update, these seem to be the only changes introduced by the 21.0.1 update. You can find the official update notes below.</p>



<h2 id="h-switch-2-update-version-21-0-1-released-november-24-2025">Switch 2 Update Version 21.0.1 (Released November 24, 2025)</h2>



<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where Error Code: 2011-0301 or Error Code: 2168-0002 would repeatedly occur on a Nintendo Switch when attempting a system transfer using local communication from a Nintendo Switch system to a Nintendo Switch 2 system.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where sometimes, after waking up the system from Sleep Mode or turning off Airplane Mode, wireless controllers or Bluetooth audio devices were unable to connect.</li>



<li>General system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>



<p>Although the new Nintendo Switch 2 update is a minor update, some undocumented changes may have been introduced to the system. At the time of writing, <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" href="https://x.com/OatmealDome">dedicated dataminer Oatmeal Dome</a> has yet to report any findings; however, we will update the post as soon as new information about the update is discovered.</p>



<p>The latest major Nintendo Switch 2 system update was update 21.0.0, which launched earlier this month. The update introduced changes to the HOME menu to indicate whether the software shown is a physical or digital release, the ability to download data for a virtual game card even if the <em>"Use Online License" </em>setting is turned off, and more. <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/43314">More information can be found on the Nintendo Support website.</a></p>

            <p>
Saudi Arabia's conquest of the games industry continues apace, but whoops, the country's Public Investment Fund appear to be running out of money. In the sense of being reportedly down to a mere pocketful of billions, anyway. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
According to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/19/business/pif-saudi-arabia-fund-problems.html">New York Times</a> (paywall), via <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/saudi-arabias-investment-fund-reported-to-be-limiting-new-investments-as-cash-runs-low">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, a number of the PIF's investment projects are in "financial distress", and the organisation's representatives have allegedly told international investors that they're "unable to allocate" further funds for the near future. The NYT report that the PIF's total investments are worth around $1 trillion, of which a fair chunk have no public valuation and as such, would be difficult to sell off.
</p>
<p>
The PIF disagree with this assessment, naturally. PIF spokesperson Marwan Bakrali has told the newspaper that they still have $60 billion in cash and "similar financial instruments". I'm interested to see the exact ratio of hard cash to "similar financial instrument" here. My personal wealth at the minute is about 30% <del>scrumped</del> foraged apples, but I'm pretty sure the apples are of no interest to the student loan debt collectors. This is probably not a useful comparison, unless the PIF also have major investments in the oranges trade.
</p>
<p>
This is the same Public Investment Fund that recently linked arms with Jared Kushner and Silver Lake in order to launch <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-are-about-to-be-bought-for-50-billion-by-saudi-arabia-and-jared-kushners-investment-firms-claims-report">a $50 billion acquisition of Electronic Arts</a>, yes. According to the NYT, none of the PIF's videogame industry investments are in trouble, but the aforesaid Saudi-led consortium did buy EA using $20 billion of borrowed money, purportedly to be recuperated by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eas-new-owners-are-making-a-huge-bet-on-generative-ai-cost-cutting-to-help-repay-a-20-billion-loan-claims-report">coaxing a windfall</a> (not of oranges) from the groaning magic money tree that is generative AI. That deal is slated to close in the first quarter of the 2027 financial year.
</p><p>
The PIF's videogame investments go far beyond EA. They have stakes in Nintendo, Capcom, Nexon, Call of Duty and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> publishers Activision-Blizzard, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> publishers Take-Two Interactive. They've also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/saudi-government-backed-firm-and-giga-project-now-co-owns-fighting-game-tournament-evo">sunk a lot of money into esports</a>, alongside regular sports. All of this apparently forms part of an attempt to diversify the Kingdom's hitherto oil-dependent economy.
</p>
<p>
I dislike and fear the PIF's control of studios like BioWare mostly because it's operated by <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/middle-east/saudi-arabia/">a regime</a> that has journalists, gay people and migrant workers abused, dispossessed or murdered. But it also doesn't seem great that an increasing share of videogame developers are being consolidated under the banner of a group that appears to be having financial difficulties. One of the "distressed" projects mentioned in the NYT article is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neom">Neom</a> (pictured above), a planned city that has necessitated the eviction of thousands of local tribespeople, some of them on pain of execution, and has an estimated overall cost of $8.8 trillion.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund is reportedly running low on cash, following investments into projects in financial distress.</p>
<p>The claim comes from a new report from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/19/business/pif-saudi-arabia-fund-problems.html">The New York Times</a>, published as the crown prince of Saudi Arabia visits Washington, having spoken to a number of sources briefed on the country's operations.</p>
<p>Projects in financial distress include Neom, the planned utopian metropolis that's run into extensive construction issues, as well as a coffee chain, a cruise line, and an electric vehicle start-up.</p>
<p>The PIF claims it holds nearly $1 trillion in assets, but a "huge portion" of these are hard-to-sell assets with no public valuation. According to the NY Times, international investors have been told the PIF is "unable to allocate any more money for the foreseeable future".</p>
<p>While none of the mentioned projects in financial distress are in gaming, the PIF has made significant investments in the industry.</p>
<p>Indeed, its largest recent investment was its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-privately-acquired-in-55bn-deal-by-group-of-investors-including-saudi-arabias-investment-fund-and-donald-trumps-son-in-law">private acquisition of publisher EA</a>, as part of a group of investors alongside Affinity Partners, whose CEO is US President Donald Trump's son-in-law.</p>
<p>Other recent gaming investments include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-saudi-arabian-takeover-of-fighting-games-biggest-tournament-means-players-and-the-wider-community-have-a-choice-to-make-between-its-culture-and-a-payout">fighting game tournament EVO</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-responds-to-report-claiming-its-signed-a-saudi-deal-for-fresh-assassins-creed-mirage-content">DLC for Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed Mirage</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-will-be-sold-to-monopoly-go-maker-scopely-niantic-confirms">Pokémon Go developer Niantic</a>.</p>
<p>As the NY Times reports, Saudi Arabia's Prince Mohammed is an avid gamer, which is a big motivator behind these investments.</p>
<p>What this reported lack of cash means for these gaming projects remains unclear, but it does suggest a potentially rockier future than the country would have you believe.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/bethesda-would-like-shadowdrop-more-games-after-owning-the-day-with-oblivion-remastered/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bethesda-would-like-to-shadowdrop-more-games-after-%E2%80%98owning-the-day%E2%80%99-with-oblivion-remastered.1363804/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Earlier this year, Bethesda Game Studios briefly captured the interest of many gamers with the mystery surrounding the remaster of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. Rumors had swirled for months about it, but they did not confirm anything until the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-looks-gorgeous-and-its-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement and immediate release of Oblivion Remastered on April 22, 2025</a>.</p>



<p>It was a veritable 'shadowdrop', an unusual marketing strategy where the developer and publisher do not market their product in advance but instead focus entirely on maximizing the surprise effect. <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/after-oblivion-remastered-and-hi-fi-rush-bethesda-game-studios-director-wants-more-shadowdrops-because-we-all-have-short-attention-spans-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to Gamesradar</a> during the recent Golden Joystick Awards, Bethesda Game Studios Director Tom Mustaine, who was in charge of the Oblivion remaster project as Director of External Projects (Virtuos handled the game's Unreal Engine 5 port), mentioned the previous shadowdrop of Tango Gameworks' Hi-Fi Rush as a successful test run and suggested the studio would like to do more.</p>



<p><em>We had a real successful shadowdrop with Hi-Fi Rush through Xbox and through Bethesda. Todd Howard, the boss man, he's wanted to shadowdrop things for a long time because it's so great to be able to say, 'Here's the thing, get it today.' It's very valuable.</em></p>



<p><em>We all have short attention spans now. There's Grand Theft Auto, for example. I want that today, right? So it is an interesting strategy… I don't have any ideas of what would be next, but I hope it's not the last. Personally, I think it was great to own the internet for that day and, you know, give people exactly what they want the moment we talk about it. I'm a fan of that personally, but I'd love to see more people do it.</em></p>



<p>Indeed, the penchant of Bethesda Game Studios boss Todd Howard for shadowdrops is well known. Just recently, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-still-a-long-way-off-says-todd-howard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commented</a> that he'd love for the studio's next highly anticipated game, The Elder Scrolls VI, to 'just appear' eventually once it is ready to ship to fans.</p>



<p>It seems unlikely Microsoft would agree to let them do this to such a massively anticipated title, sequel to one of the best-selling games of all time, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Going with a more traditional marketing campaign would be the safest route, although perhaps a middle ground could be a Fallout 4-style reveal at E3 (now Summer Game Fest) and subsequent release in November. </p>



<p>A game that could be shadowdropped by Bethesda, similar to Oblivion Remastered, is the Fallout 3 remaster. <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-remastered-reportedly-in-the-works-fallout-3-remastered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to rumors</a>, it's in development alongside a remaster of Fallout: New Vegas.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a> is set to be turned into a live-action TV series on FX, something Ubisoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-far-cry-tv-show-that-doesnt-shy-away-from-the-darkest-most-absurd-parts-of-humanity-is-reportedly-in-development-at-fx">reportedly let slip</a> back in August, but has now been <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-ca/article/7sST77RTZF7s9GKsxETUy4/far-cry-tv-series-ordered-by-fx.">formally announced</a> by the publisher in a post that's yet to be randomly zapped into the ether.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The series is set to be co-created by Alien: Earth director Noah Hawley and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia's Rob McElhenney, now going by Rob Mac. Streaming on Hulu in the US and Disney+ internationally, each season of the show will be its own standalone actiony shindig just like a fresh Far Cry game, with a new setting and cast of characters.</p>
<p>So, probably your usual Far Cry affair of touring the world in search of civil wars or strife revolving around one bloke who's very good at making evil speeches. It's a formula that I've enjoyed plenty over the years, even if the last couple of entries have failed to really light my shrubbery on fire as well as Far Cries 2 and 3 did back in the day. Or maybe it'll gop for something a bit like caveman-filled spin-off Primal or 80s homage Blood Dragon, just to spice things up a bit.</p>
<p>"What I love about the ‘Far Cry’ game franchise is it’s an anthology," Hawley said. "Each game is a variation of a theme, the same way each season of ‘Fargo’ (another show he worked on for FX) is a variation on a theme. To create a big action show that can change from year to year, while always exploring the nature of humanity through this complex and chaotic lens is a dream come true. I’m excited to partner with Rob and bring our shared irreverent, ambitious sensibility to the screen."</p><p>Mac, who'll star and produce, added that Ubisoft have been "remarkably generous" and that he's keen to work with Hawley. It's worth noting that Mac and Ubi have previously collabed Apple TV+ series Mythic Quest, in which the actor played the creative director of an MMORPG alongside prolific game voice actress Ashly Burch.</p>
<p>Maybe it's time for me to finally dig that 2008 Uwe Boll-directed Far Cry movie out and see if it lives up to its <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1219216-far_cry">reputation</a>.</p>

            <p>Activision has announced the full suite of new additions coming to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> in its Season One update, which looks to be bringing a vast spread of new toys across all three game modes on the 4th December. It'll also let players skip the single player campaign and jump into the Warzone-style Endgame mode immediately.</p>
<p>Prior to Season One, players would have to complete the Black Ops 7 campaign before accessing the Endgame. Makes sense right? You'd want to know what the story is before hopping into the post-launch narrative vehicle which is the Endgame. Well, for those who want to farm out weapon cosmetics as fast as possible, you can skip past all the pesky narrative nonsense and get right into the action.</p>
<p>When you do you'll be facing a host of new world events, including a giant robot, and toxin-induced hallucinations. Later in the season you'll also be able to fight a VTOL aircraft that is, according to the official Season One blog post, "manifested by fear". It's a super scary VTOL, guys.</p>

<p>You'll also get new exotic skills to mess around with, and there'll be a Christmas-themed event near the end of the year to keep you festive. As for Black Ops 7 multiplayer, more than six new maps and modes are coming alongside a new scorestreak: the Deadeye Drone. Finally, multiplayer is gaining 12 returning loadout items from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a> too which should mix things up as you journey through the prestige ranks.</p>
<p>To conclude, Black Ops 7 Zombies is getting a new round-based zombies map, new modes for both a narrative-led and challenge-focused experience, returning loadout items, and a festive-themed limited-time-event.</p>
<p>It all seems rather jam packed with engaging pursuits for every kind of Call of Duty fan. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-underperforms-on-steam-during-launch-weekend-but-does-that-mean-the-games-sold-badly">popularity of this Call of Duty is a bit of a mystery right now</a>, with the public data we can look at pointing to a less successful launch for the military FPS series than we've seen in recent years. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-european-sales-are-63-down-on-battlefield-6-and-50-down-on-black-ops-6">We do know the game is selling far less than Battlefield 6 in Europe so far, and is looking worse off than Black Ops 6 was in the same region</a>.</p>

            <p>Promising half-vampire, half-human role-playing game The Blood of Dawnwalker used AI during development to test spoken lines before hired actors came in to record them. Game director Konrad Tomaszkiewicz - formerly director of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> - told me this during a recent interview, in which he shared a fairly balanced take on AI use in general.</p>
<p>"We used AI for voices during the testing period of time before the recordings," Tomaszkiewicz told me, "because my experience from the previous projects was that you [understand] a lot more when you hear the voices, and we wanted to have it as soon as possible to test the game and iterate on it. And then when we decided the story was great and it worked, we started the proper recordings with the actors. This is the use of the AI we had in our company," he said, "and I think that it's quite reasonable.</p>
<p>"But on this subject," he added. "I think that AI should help people and AI shouldn't replace them. If we can use AI to make people's lives easier..." Here, he gave an example. He said his quality assurance team on Dawnwalker is currently combing the game's world for intersections between environment meshes to check they all line-up correctly, and that there aren't any holes where, presumably, players can fall through. Their time, he believes, could be better spent elsewhere.</p>

<p>"To be honest, I'd prefer to do it automatically - we have the tools for that; not AI but our own tool - and use the time of the people to tell me if the game is good," he said. "If the feel of the gameplay is proper. If the story is good and the dialogues: they understand it, they feel emotions and so on. This is the way we should use the skills of creative people.</p><p>"I'm not totally against AI," he added, "but it needs to evolve to the place where it will be the tool which helps us, like Google Translate, not something which steals the author rights and creates the graphics or the animations because it learns from the creations of people."</p>
<blockquote><em>"You need to have people who feel, who have this creative fire, who want to prove something"</em></blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, he said, creative people will always be at the heart of a project. Replace them with AI and people will notice, because the human element will be absent. And it's that human element that's irreplaceable. "I don't believe that it will replace the creative people," Tomaszkiewicz said. "It can help, but not replace them. I don't feel that games created with only AI will have soul. I don't believe it. Really.</p>
<p>"I finished Dispatch recently," he went on, "which is my game of the year. I love this game. And I don't believe that AI could create something like this. It's not possible. You need to have people who feel, who have this creative fire, who want to prove something, who want to tell you a particular story and create emotions in these particular moments. A machine will not understand us as much."</p><p>Blood of the Dawnwalker is in development for PC, PS5 and Xbox Series S/X, and scheduled for a release sometime next year. It follows the adventures of Coen, a recently not-quite-turned vampire, who has 30 days and 30 nights to rescue his family. But how he goes about it - and where he goes in the world - is up to you; <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-3-directors-new-rpg-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-is-different-to-that-classic-cd-projekt-red-game-in-one-big-way-it-doesnt-have-a-main-quest">there is no main quest in The Blood of Dawnwalker to guide you</a>.</p>

            <p>An anthology series based on Ubisoft's Far Cry games has been announced.</p>
<p>The FX series will feature a new cast and setting, with the team promising "the exact level of chaos your therapist told you to avoid". That sounds up Vaas' street, or beach, anyway!</p>
<p>Attached to the upcoming Far Cry project is Rob Mac (née McElhenney), known to many as Mac from Always Sunny in Philadelphia, a show he created and co-developed with Charlie Day (the voice of Luigi in the recent Mario Movie adaptations) and Glenn Howerton. Mac will produce the series alongside Alien Earth creator Noah Hawley.</p>

<p>"FX has had magnificent partnerships with Rob Mac and Noah Hawley for a combined six series and 32 seasons of television, and we couldn't be more excited that they are teaming up for Far Cry," said Nick Grad, President, FX Entertainment. "I have no doubt that they will tell this story in a way that is original, gripping and wildly entertaining. We also want to thank our partners at Ubisoft for entrusting us with this beloved property."</p><p>"Getting to work alongside Noah Hawley is a dream realised," Mac added. "Ubisoft has been remarkably generous, entrusting us with one of the most iconic video-game worlds ever created. And through it all, my FX family continues to lift me up with their constant belief and support."</p>
<p>"What I love about the Far Cry game franchise is it's an anthology. Each game is a variation of a theme, the same way each season of Fargo is a variation on a theme," Hawley furthered. "To create a big action show that can change from year to year, while always exploring the nature of humanity through this complex and chaotic lens is a dream come true. I'm excited to partner with Rob and bring our shared irreverent, ambitious sensibility to the screen."</p>
<p>In addition to a producer role, Mac - who also played Ian Grimm on comedy series Mythic Quest - will star in the Far Cry series, but as who remains for now unknown.</p>

<p>Along with Far Cry, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-splinter-cell-animated-series-arrives-next-month-but-theres-no-sign-of-a-new-game">Ubisoft also recently released an anime series based on its Splinter Cell games</a>.</p>

<p>There's no information yet on the characters or series that might be included, but Paramount has a huge roster of popular franchises, with its portfolio including both Nickelodeon and Comedy Central. Some of its biggest series include SpongeBob SquarePants, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Transformers, South Park, Dora the Explorer, and Paw Patrol--though it seems unlikely that the franchises aimed at younger kids will be added to a video game like Fortnite.</p><p>Fans are also hopeful that the Paramount collaboration may mean an actual Sonic skin in Fortnite, with the Sonic the Hedgehog films being one of Paramount's major IPs. While Fortnite got a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rocket-leagues-best-rocket-pass-ever-just-dropped-especially-for-fortnite-players/1100-6534836/" data-ref-id="1100-6534836">Sonic collaboration earlier this year</a>, the cosmetics were mostly designed for Rocket League, and included only Sonic-inspired items rather than a full skin.</p><p>Two Paramount franchises were already rumored to be in line for future Fortnite collabs--SpongeBob and <a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss/status/1982196155606786464" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">South Park</a>--though it's unclear if those leaks were referring to the Sidekick integration, or if they will be getting more extensive collaborations. Fortnite's Simpsons mini-season has been hugely successful for the game, bringing in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-simpsons-update-led-to-a-huge-surge-in-players-the-most-in-a-long-time/1100-6535919/" data-ref-id="1100-6535919">largest number of new and returning players</a> in at least a year and boosting the game's <a href="https://fortnite.gg/player-count" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">average player count</a> higher than it has been for most of 2025. With such a successful cartoon collab, it wouldn't be surprising if Epic planned more mini-seasons for other nostalgic cartoons like those in Paramount's library.</p>
