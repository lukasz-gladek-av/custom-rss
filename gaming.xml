			<p>A new Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition comparison video was shared online, highlighting the differences between the new version of the game launching next year and the original Wii U release.</p>
<p>The comparison video put together by ElAnalistaDeBits highlights how the Definitive Edition of the game will feature improved character models, textures, lighting, and shadows. Judging from the video, the enhancements aren't as big as those seen in Xenoblade<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/xenoblade-chronicles-definitive-edition-essential-for-jrpg-fans/">&nbsp;Chronicles: Definitive Edition</a>, but that was to be expected, considering the first entry in the series was originally released on the Wii.</p>

<p>Besides visual improvements, Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition will feature some sort of new story content, as teased in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-launching-20-march-2025/">reveal trailer</a> shared yesterday, which featured an alternate version of the post-credit scene from the original. As the game is the only entry in the series with no relation to the other games, it wouldn't be surprising for the mysterious hooded figure seen in the new scene to bridge the gap with the other games.</p>
<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition launches on March 20th, 2025 on Nintendo Switch. More information on some of the game's unique features, such as the ability to create a custom avatar and ride massive mechs called Skells on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-brings-an-expansive-sci-fi-adventure-to-nintendo-switch-on-march-20/">Nintendo's official website.</a></p>

            <p>"Worthless,’ they'd declared. Most NFTs were ‘worthless.’ The greatest artistic movement since The Big BSoD, the greatest proof of the power of the blockchain, the very future of the whole funging Infobahn, and the hedgie soybean-counters say it's all ‘worthless’," once wrote the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-nfts-are-worthless-how-come-i-have-written-a-third-novel-about-nfts-saving-the-future">greatest living prophet of our era</a>.</p>
<p>Now, in an entirely predictable case of "I am <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/openai-gpt-4o-chatgpt-artificial-intelligence-her-movie/">once again </a>asking our tech overlords to watch the whole movie", those plucky chancers at Ubisoft have lifted AliceO’s ideas wholesale, ignored her timely and cogent commentary, and released a roiling puke reservoir of NFT upchuck masquerading as a game. Thank you <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-just-quietly-launched-a-full-blown-nft-game">Ian Games</a> for the spot. You are the Neal Stephenson to AliceO’s William Gibson, but for worthless crap. (The IGN piece has some very good context and is worth reading).</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles, which I won’t link because I respect the colour green too much, is “the ultimate Web3 competitive Turn-Based RPG”. You can only play the game via its own website, which I won’t link to because I respect the colour green too much. There’s also a trailer floating around. Not going to link to that either. Got a lot of respect for ‘things in motion’, I have, and this represents a terrible use of them.</p>
<p>As IGN point out, Ubisoft first announced it’d be sticking its head in the NFToilet bowl and daintily sampling the yellowing side-cruft about three years back <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-plans-create-blockchain-games-enable-pay-to-earn">in an earnings call</a>. Words like ‘revolution’ were used. The phrase ‘pay-to-earn’ was latched on to with glee. "[Blockchain] will imply more play-to-earn that will enable more players to actually earn content, own content, and we think it's going to grow the industry quite a lot," chirpy cockney urchin Yves Guillemot said at the time.</p><p>Contrast this to statements made by Ubisoft’s Philippe Tremblay to<a href="http://gi.biz/"> GI.biz earlier this year</a>, where the director of subscriptions said that a consumer shift "needs to happen" re: "Gamers are used to owning their games". Sure, blockchain and subscription-based access are different kettles of fish, but this does feel inconsistent. It’s almost like they’ll just say anything! Why even use words anymore! Why not just chortle and snort! You know you want to!</p>
<p>If you slept through or somehow mercifully forgot about the crypto craze of the last few years, you might be wondering why a game that lets you buy items as NFTs is a problem. First up, there’s the obvious pay-to-win element attendant on letting people cough up to forge more powerful characters - something that irks me less because of the holy sanctity of competitive game balance (although that’s enough to put me off playing), and more because these things are designed to play off the same vulnerabilities as gambling.</p>
<p>IGN report that the highest priced figurines - the characters you use to battle - are up on the marketplace at $63k. That doesn’t mean people are necessarily paying this much, mind, and those are outliers - most bits are a mere $300. Either way, it seems antithetical to anything actually interesting or valuable about game design. Why inspire organic investment when you can just invite players to join in a ghoulish sunk-cost spiral?</p>
<p>Secondly, the web3 industry have thus far failed to make a convincing case that this stuff isn’t a complete emissions disaster. <a href="https://ccaf.io/cbnsi/cbeci">According to one study</a>, Bitcoin alone uses the same amount of electricity each year as Argentina. For balance, I should point out that blockchain advocates argue that the technology can aid sustainability via “more accurate load monitoring, generation, and distribution in the grid through efficient use of data,” <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2023/01/13/why-blockchain-nfts-and-web3-have-a-sustainability-problem/">via Forbes</a>.</p>
<p>It's also hard to see the release of Champions Tactics right now as anything but an act of desperation from a Ubisoft evidently feeling financial pressure, or at least trying to get those numbers up before a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-considering-buyout-of-ubisoft-report-says">potential buyout</a>.</p>
<p>I leave you with more words of wisdom from RPS’s dearly departed scryer of crud:</p>
<p>"A crack revealing strata of vape pens, LaserDiscs, and bags for life. All of it, trash. The melted bumper of the weed-green Tesla Model X once owned by... she couldn't even say his name. Everything, trash. Two empty bottles of Irn-Bru Kombucha rising like the legs of Ozymandias. 5arah snorted. <em>Look on my apes, ye Mighty, and despair!</em>"</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Following the news <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-shuts-down-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-game-will-remain-permanently-offline">Sony has closed Concord studio Firewalk</a>, the live-service game's initial development deal reportedly cost $200m.</p>
<p>This, however, was not enough to cover the game's entire development costs, sources familiar with the agreement told <a href="https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290">Kotaku</a>. This cost also did not include the purchase of the Concord IP rights or Firewalk itself, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-acquires-firewalk-studios-as-it-continues-work-on-triple-a-multiplayer-exclusive">Sony acquired last year</a>.</p>
<p>Yesterday's news detailed the human cost of closing the studio, which employed around 150-170 people. The $200m figure adds a sense of the financial cost of even beginning development.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-reportedly-cost-300m-to-make-amid-a-culture-of-toxic-positivity">report from September</a>, after the game was shut down, suggested the game had cost $400m to produce, with development rife with "toxic positivity".</p>
<p>A final statement from Firewalk shared last night on social media details what the studio achieved during its time on Concord.</p>
<p>"Firewalk began with the idea of bringing the joy of multiplayer to a larger audience," reads the statement.</p>
<p>The assembled team then grew a new startup, the statement continues, built a "customised next-generation FPS engine", managed an acquisition from Sony, and ultimately delivered "a great FPS experience to players - even if it landed much more narrowly than hoped against a heavily consolidated market".</p>

<p>"We took some risks along the way - marrying aspects of card battlers and fighting games with first-person-shooters - and although some of these and other aspects of the IP didn’t land as we hoped, the idea of putting new things into the world is critical to pushing the medium forward," the statement continues.</p><p>"The talent at Firewalk and the level of individual craft is truly world-class, and teams within Sony Interactive Entertainment and across the industry will be fortunate to work with them.  Please reach out to Recruiting at PlayStation for inquiries, and thank you to all the very many teams, partners and fans who supported us along the way."</p>
<p>Despite this hard work, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-has-sold-just-25000-copies-estimate-industry-analysts">Concord reportedly sold only 25,000 copies</a> - clearly not enough to recoup its huge costs. It was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">pulled offline at the start of September</a>.</p>
<p>"The PvP first-person shooter genre is a competitive space that's continuously evolving, and unfortunately, we did not hit our targets with this title," wrote SIE boss Hermen Hulst in an internal email shared yesterday. "We will take the lessons learned from Concord and continue to advance our live service capabilities to deliver future growth in this area."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Sony’s remaster strategy remains a little baffling for ardent gamers, now that we’re firmly in an age of backward compatibility. You could argue that there’s clearly diminishing returns in graphical advancements, but they wouldn’t be sticking with this plan if it wasn’t showing some benefits. From Spider-Man Remastered to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/31/the-last-of-us-part-i-review-ps5/">The Last of Us Part I</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/10/until-dawn-2024-review/">Until Dawn</a> and now Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, there’s a layered reasoning for each release. They bring the games back to the forefront of discussion and release schedules, nudge sticker prices back up a notch, tie in with TV and movie projects, and more. And with games now taking longer than ever to make, they’re good projects to let developers gain experience, try out new techniques, push the envelope a little further while the sequel’s production is still going through the gears.</p>
<p><iframe title="Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered - Announce Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kMN-x9goE7M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In the case of Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, it’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/07/01/sony-acquires-pc-porting-specialists-nixxes-software/">Sony’s PC porting specialists at Nixxes</a> taking on a very different job, in partnership with Guerrilla Games, broadening the scope of what that studio is charged with doing for a full remaster in the latest iteration of the Decima Engine. While Nixxes was able to automate some parts of this, dropping new replacement assets in place with systemic changes, an awful lot has required a manual pass and complete overhauls with new techniques.</p>


<p>This could have come at the cost of performance, but thankfully it really hasn’t. Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered offers 30fps, 40fps (on a 120Hz screen) and 60fps modes, and there’s going to be some trade-offs here, but I felt like the 60fps performance mode looked absolutely fantastic. It matches the frame rate that the original game can get when played on PS5, but brings all the improvements we’re about to delve into, keeps a high resolution and has higher-quality anti-aliasing and upscaling. The frame rate and resolution metrics will only be pushed further with the PS5 Pro, which this game natively supports.</p>
<p>Arguably the biggest change and improvement is an overhaul for many of the conversations and dialogues in the game. This was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/02/20/horizon-zero-dawn-review/">one of the weakest aspects of the original release in 2017</a>, with particularly stilted-looking animations for a lot of dialogue and fixed camera angles that lacked the dynamism of the rest of the game. To improve this, they’ve gone back to the motion capture stage, grabbing new motion capture with which to liven up the thousands of dialogue elements in the game, and going through a bunch of rather complicated steps to feed those back in place.</p>


<p>The end result is worth the effort, as you go from the very workmanlike style of the original to something much closer to Horizon Forbidden West, and it’s seemingly across the board. Even relatively straightforward chats with a simple side quest giver now has the camera pulled back a bit, the opportunity for more upper body movement, more nuanced facial animation and character expression. It doesn’t change the story, of course, but it makes its delivery a smidgeon more engaging.</p>
<p>Beyond that, Nixxes has gone through the game with a fine-tooth comb to find other places to improve. The world lighting has been updated to use some of the techniques from the PS5-exclusive expansion Burning Shores, but there’s also needed the world lighting to be be redone by hand, just to try and match the same mood of the original with the fidelity of its sequel. The snow effects from the Frozen Wilds DLC have been applied to all snowy regions in the game, and there’s now the ability for a snow shader to build up on characters, and screen-space reflections help streams and bodies of water look so much better.</p>

<p>In general, it’s the lighting that can lead to the most striking differences. To give just one example, if you head down to the densely wooded, jungle-like biome to the south of the world map, the depth of colour feels much greater, the shadow darker and the streams of light and robot-induced lens flair all the more impactful.</p>
<p>The team also highlighted key areas, such as the ground of Meridian City, that were completely redone, the manual pass to manmade structures, the new skin shaders for character models to match Horizon Forbidden West –&nbsp;characters have that peach fuzz of hair to their skin, for example – and plenty more besides.</p>
<p>Some of these are very fine tweaks that you’ll barely have a chance to notice while sprinting through the world, and will stake a good long look to really appreciate when comparison set scenes and stills. What I will say is that Meridian City does definitely feel more lively than it does in the original. There is maybe a doubling of NPC counts for the same time of day, adding a bit more of the hustle and bustle that you might expect in a capital city.</p>

<p>This does, however, highlight some of the dumb-as-bricks NPC pathfinding, though. I’ve seen a few characters spin on the spot, as they encounter other characters walking toward them, children walk through someone else’s legs, and instead of sticking to paths, they might clamber over rocks alongside.</p>
<p>That, then goes to highlight some of the occasionally wacky physics that clothes can have, whether it’s Erend’s chunky armour flapping up over his legs while walking, or capes and cloaks of background character whipping around when there’s camera cuts during dialogue. Hair is seemingly less susceptible to this now, or at least in Aloy’s case.</p>
<p>As impressive as all of this is, though…. I’m pleasantly surprised with how well Horizon Zero Dawn still holds up. Sure, an awful lot of people would have played this game originally on base PS4, but PS4 Pro gave a lot of enhancements just from the jump up in resolution and checkerboarding, and a patch was released a few years ago that allowed the game to run at 4K checkerboarding with 60FPS on PS5. That level of performance on PS5 is fantastic.</p>
<p>It makes this upgrade feel rather inessential…. the saving grace being that upgrading on this occasion is rather cheap. Anyone that owns the original game, whether that’s the base game, the complete edition, or the freebie handout during Days of Play, can pay $10 for a pretty decent visual overhaul, and return to Aloy’s original adventure with a smattering of new finery.</p>

            <p>The line between escapist entertainment and Problematic fantasy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-play-a-fascist-unpacking-the-hideousness-of-the-space-marine">can be thin</a>, but I think Indiana Jones's dislike for the German National Socialist Party of the 1930s and 1940s is fairly clearcut. "Nazis - I hate these guys!" he says in Raiders Of The Lost Ark. Let's play Devil's Advocate and try to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Nc88_ZEfxg">Lionel Hutz</a> that quote: "Nazis? I hate <em>these</em> guys!" [pointing at some Communists]. Yeah, I'm not really feeling it.</p>
<p>I guess Indiana did sleep with a Nazi once, but only by accident, and yes he did once cosplay as an SS officer and get Hitler's autograph, but again, only by accident. Aww, he's such a ditz! I think his political stance is abundantly obvious in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones And The Great Circle</a> - the new Wolfenslike from MachineGames, in which you will blast and bludgeon literally hundreds of Shitlerites in unambiguously one-sided first-person view. So it's amusing, if not wholly unexpected, that MachineGames and Bethesda have slapped the game with an explicit disclaimer stating that the game's depictions of Nazis are not, in fact, Nazi propaganda.</p><!--more-->
<p>I saw this on the start-up screen during <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-redefines-the-gun-toting-archaeologist-as-a-grabby-lucasfilm-fanboi">my hands-on with the game</a> a few weeks ago. I meant to email for a copy of the text and write it up, but I forgot, and then those chancers at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesdas-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-denounces-nazis-with-in-game-statement/1100-6527469/">Gamespot</a> did an article, so here I am playing Journo Come Lately. Here's the disclaimer in full:</p>
<blockquote><p>Please note that Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is a fictional story, inspired by historical events and characters. Names, characters, organizations, locations, and events are either imaginary or depicted in a fictionalized manner, not intended to disrespect any historical or cultural beliefs.</p>
<p>The story and contents of this game are not intended to and should not be construed in any way to condone, glorify, or endorse the beliefs, ideologies, events, actions, persons, or behavior of the Nazi and fascist regimes, nor any other regimes or to trivialize any war crimes, genocide, and other crimes against humanity.</p></blockquote>
<p>It's likely just the usual legal arse-covering, of course. The game itself might be bruisingly frank about the fash, but there's nothing to stop an opportunistic far-right chowderhead cherry-picking a screenshot or video for the sake of a meme, or modding the game to let you play as the goose-steppers.</p><p>It's also possible the disclaimer is designed to ensure compliance with Germany's <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2018/08/germany-lifted-its-ban-on-nazi-imagery-in-video-games-thats-great.html">qualified lifting of prohibitions on depictions of Nazis in video games back in 2018</a>, following which "symbols of unconstitutional organisations can be used in games in individual cases, as long as those symbols serve an artistic or scientific purpose, or depict current or historical events."</p>
<p>Still, it does look a bit ridiculous. This is Indiana Jones! I'm curious about whether the developers have any internal guidance about how to avoid counter-intuitively glorifying Nazis while teaching you to beat them to death. I guess you could argue that Indiana Jones And The Great Circle might inadvertently build a little sympathy given that it is basically a Third Reich Bullying Simulator.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-a-return-to-what-made-bioware-great-ea-head-says<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>EA's CEO Andrew Wilson said <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> is a "return to what made BioWare great".</p>
<p>During a Q&amp;A with investors in EA's quarterly earnings call, Wilson reflected on BioWare's recent history, which included looking back at beleaguered multiplayer shooter, Anthem.</p>
<p>The EA exec said this game was "probably the one people remember the most for not really living up to the expectations of what a 'BioWare game' should be". He noted the studio was trying to "do something very very different" to what had gone before, adding the "pieces of the puzzle" ultimately didn't come together as BioWare had hoped.</p>

</figure>
<p>Following Anthem, a "big shift" subsequently happened at the developer, which Wilson said saw the studio "really returning to BioWare-type games" and "returning to BioWare's strengths". And, that brings us to Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which is set to release across PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC on 31st October.</p><p>"The BioWare team has really rallied around what made BioWare a fan-favourite studio and a fan-favourite brand and the types of games they make; incredibly rich worlds, incredibly nuanced characters, really powerful and compelling stories with camaraderie and friendships and relationships, and decisions that matter in the context of gameplay," Wilson said.</p>
<p>"And I think it’s been that return to what made BioWare great and giving the studio the time to deliver against what makes BioWare great in the context of the Dragon Age world is what amounts to a game like Dragon Age: The Veilguard."</p>

            <p>Pokémon TCG Pocket, the digital trading card game, is now available on mobile.</p>
<p>It's free-to-start and allows players to split open booster packs to acquire digital versions of popular Pokémon trading cards - and then compete in battles.</p>
<p>The game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-heading-to-mobile-this-year">first announced at the Pokémon Presents event in February</a> and is now finally available to download across iOS and Android devices.</p>

<p>One of the biggest draws are the "immersive cards" that allow players to dive into the artwork to explore the worlds within.</p>
<p>However, while free-to-start, there are microtransactions and multiple currencies in the store to acquire time boosters and other items, allowing players to open more packs.</p>
<p>Poké Gold costs 79p for five pieces, or up to £79.99 for 500 pieces. This can be used to buy bundles of items, costing from 45 pieces to 115 pieces.</p>
<p>That said, there are various freebies each day so, if you're willing to wait, you'll still have access to a decent chunk of the experience without paying - so far at least.</p>
<p>At launch, cards are from the Genetic Apex collection, which includes plenty of fan favourite Pokémon originating from the Kanto region.</p>
<p>Back in September, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pockets-focus-is-on-pack-opening-but-theres-a-promising-version-of-the-card-game-underneath">Eurogamer's Lottie Lynn went hands-on with the experience</a> stating while the focus is on opening card packs "there's a promising version of the card game underneath".</p>
<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket is expected to be a success, though it remains to be seen if it can reach the same levels as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a>.</p>
<p>That game just launched its Gigantamax feature to a mixed response, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-gigantamax-battles-will-be-made-easier-in-response-to-mixed-feedback">Niantic acknowledging feedback to make the battles easier</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Sony have shut down Firewalk Studios, the developers behind ill-fated multiplayer hero shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a>, and confirmed that the game will not be returning to stores. In doing so, they are effectively striking a line through a big, red $200 million in their books - a number that some report is only part of the loss. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>"[Certain] aspects of Concord were exceptional," said Hermen Hulst, CEO of Sony's Studio Business Group in <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/an-update-from-playstation-studios/">a press release</a> yesterday, "but others did not land with enough players, and as a result we took the game offline.  We have spent considerable time these past few months exploring all our options.   </p>
<p>"After much thought, we have determined the best path forward is to permanently sunset the game and close the studio. I want to thank all of Firewalk for their craftsmanship, creative spirit and dedication."</p>
<p>In another example of a businessman using "sunset" to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-lay-off-more-workers-for-the-second-time-in-a-year-and-add-evolving-to-our-big-list-of-nonsense-words-companies-use-to-describe-job-cuts">poetically obfuscate</a> a painful closure (when you open a studio, you do not "dawn" it), Hulst suggests that the shooter scene is crowded and it was difficult for the game to draw a crowd. </p>
<p>"The PvP first person shooter genre is a competitive space that’s continuously evolving," he said, "and unfortunately, we did not hit our targets with this title."</p>
<p>That's putting it lightly. Concord launched to little fanfare and was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hero-shooter-concord-taken-offline-as-sony-say-its-initial-launch-didnt-land-the-way-wed-intended">taken offline just three weeks afterwards</a> - a painfully quick hobbling by Sony. The game was removed from storefronts and players who paid for the game at launch were offered refunds. Back in 2023, our Katharine (RPS in peace) wrote about all <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-stop-it-with-all-the-bland-new-multiplayer-shooters-that-will-die-in-six-months">the doomed multiplayer shooters</a> lining up at the PlayStation showcase. She predicted that most would not survive six months. Concord did not even make it one. </p>
<p>"We will take the lessons learned from Concord and continue to advance our live service capabilities to deliver future growth in this area," said Hulst.</p>
<p>"I know none of this is easy news to hear, particularly with colleagues and friends departing [Sony Interactive Entertainment]."</p>
<p>The game saw an initial investment of $200 million, according to sources who <a href="https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290">spoke to Kotaku</a>. But that outlet also notes that this figure doesn't cover the entirety of development, or the cost of Sony buying the studio along with the rights to Concord as a piece of intellectual property. Just how much Sony lost on this game, they're unlikely to state plainly. </p>
<p>Alongside the closure of Firewalk, another studio has been given a bullet in the back of head at sunset. Neon Koi, a studio who have been working on an action game for mobile phones, was also closed. </p>
<p>"Both decisions were given serious thought," said Hulst, "and ultimately, we feel they are the right ones to strengthen the organization. Neon Koi and Firewalk were home to many talented individuals, and we will work to find placement for some of those impacted within our global community of studios where possible."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>PUBG Corporation and Krafton have just gone and announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/project-arc">Project Arc</a>, a top-down 5v5 shooter "inspired by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a>". To be honest with you, it looks more inspired by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege">Rainbow Six Siege</a> with what looks to be one team aiming to hack a crypt by breaking down defences, while the other reinforces structures to prevent them from doing that. There's also a big emphasis on sightlines, too, where gaining or robbing an enemy team's vision is crucial to blatting them in the head with lead. It looks interesting! If a difficult sell, given the fact it's yet another 5vs5 shooter…</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As mentioned above, the attacking team's aim is to hack into a "hidden Crypt" on a map, all of which seem to be small buildings promoting close-quarters fights. To get to the crypt, they're to use grenade launchers and "explosive hammers" to break through walls or get the jump on baddies. Meanwhile, the defenders can barricade walls, chuck gas grenades, or pop mobile cover to counteract the raid.</p>

<p>Success seems to rely on getting sightlines on your enemies, or robbing them of theirs. That seems to be achieved through, say, chucking a stun grenade to suddenly reduce an enemy's cone of vision drastically. Or maybe, extending you and your allies' vision cones by lighting up a segment of the map over in the distance. It's a neat idea and one that could make for some Hotline Miami-esque duels between players in confined spots.</p><p>Weirdly, it reminds me a bit of League Of Legends. In the sense that a lot of League's map is permanently fog-of-warred, so good players and teams gain vision control by placing Wards (these light up the fog-of-war) in clever spots. A lot of fights (and matches) can be won or lost based on these Wards and who's spotted who first. I'd imagine the same philosophy rings true in Project Arc.</p>
<p>There's no release date yet for Project Arc but you can follow its progress over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3143710/Project_ARC/">Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>When Shadows of the Damned was first released back in 2011, the expectations were huge given the collaboration between industry giants Suda 51 and Shinji Mikami. These two titans of Japanese gaming combined to produce a cult classic that still feels unique in its sleazy grindhouse aesthetic and over the top humour. I view the original as part of a previously lost trilogy of 360/PS3 era horror infused titles alongside Lollipop Chainsaw and Splatterhouse, all three of which embraced the absurd and relished their combination of silliness and ultra-violence. With that in mind I’m crossing my fingers for a Splatterhouse remaster, even if music licensing issues might make this a futile wish.</p>
<p><iframe title="Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered - Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TwpT42plQiI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Getting back to the matter in hand, Shadows of the Damned is a B-movie style fever dream that takes huge inspiration from low budget horror whilst depicting a twisted take on a classic damsel in distress narrative. You play as Garcia ‘fucking’ Hotspur, a foul-mouthed, hard-drinking demon hunter whose exploits attract the attention of the Lord of Hell, Fleming. As vengeance for the demons lost to Hotspur, Fleming abducts his girlfriend, the mysterious Paula and drags her to the underworld. In order to rescue her, Garcia grabs his Johnson (the ridiculously named demon that serves as Garcia’s gun and motorbike) and jumps through the closing portal to Hell. What follows is a high octane third-person shooter with linear progression and light-based puzzles.</p>


<p>Graphically, the Hella Remaster mostly just changes the resolution, but in going up to 4K, so much detail can be revealed and appreciated, really helping the distinctive visual design to pop. The aesthetics have a comic book feel to them with bold lines and moody environments whilst light and dark plays a huge role in the overall gameplay mechanics. The original voice acting is retained, fortunately so, as everyone is clearly having a lot of fun delivering some of the ripest lines you’ll hear this year. Musically there is a spooky mariachi feel which further adds to the Mexican Day of the Dead stylings.</p>


<p>Shadows of the Damned is an over the shoulder third-person shooter at heart and this style of gameplay has not been touched or refined in the remaster. On the one hand this is a good thing in terms of gaming history but it is starting to show its age and certainly doesn’t live up to the likes of the Resident Evil 4 Remake and its shift into modern controls. Garcia takes up a substantial part of the screen and controls relatively clunkily. The game doesn’t often require swift reactions and evasion so this isn’t generally a problem, but a couple of chase sequences remain just as annoying here as they were in 2011.</p>
<p>Gunplay is the main focus and it is here that you must rely on gripping your trusty Johnson. This demon initially takes the form of a solid pistol that does a decent amount of damage but as you progress you unlock different gun forms and upgrades for each. By the end you’ll be spraying hot leaded death from your Johnson. Um, the innuendos here are inevitable and a key part of the game’s particular brand of humour.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the game you see Johnson transform into a motorbike that Hotspur rides on the highways of Hell but this is never returned to as a gameplay mechanic unfortunately. There is some gameplay variety added later on with several 2D shmup levels that do help to break things up somewhat.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most iconic level, and certainly the one I most vividly remembered from my original time with the game, is the introduction of the Big Boner, a huge cannon form of Johnson with puerile dialogue to match. The sheer ridiculousness of this level is perhaps a litmus test for your engagement with Shadows of the Damned. For me it is so obviously camp and self aware that I can’t help but love it, so wonderfully skewering the excessively macho idea of the gun as a penis extension. However, I am aware that this over the top presentation is a somewhat acquired taste.</p>
<p>The representation of Hostpur’s ‘angel’ Paula remains just as awkward as it always was, as she runs around Hell in a series of more revealing nightwear. This perfectly suits the grindhouse setting though, and Shadows of the Damned isn’t really a game that you should look to for progressive ideas. The aim here is clearly to revel in the politically incorrect and the pulp trash inspirations. This pulp approach can be seen in the increasingly grotesque and disgusting boss fights that will test your pattern recognition and shooting accuracy. These are all stand out moments that also require you to use your Johnson’s secondary function.</p>

<p>Alongside the lethal ammunition fired by Johnson, you can also fire light shots that illuminate dark areas, remove lethal clouds of demonic darkness, and stun enemies. This is a recurring mechanic that adds a welcome dose of puzzle solving to the gunplay and there are some really well designed moments here. One particular highlight is a Rubik’s Cube like level where you have to rearrange platforms to find the exit – a level that uncannily predicts a similar one in the Bloober Team Silent Hill 2 Remake.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered is a great version of the original that offers limited but welcome updates such as resolution increases, faster load times and a much requested New Game+ mode. The unique grindhouse aesthetic and over the top humour remains as distinctive as they always were and it is here that the appeal of Shadows of the Damned lives or dies. If the absurd humour and over the top ideas are your cup of blood then this is an easy recommend even if you don’t have nostalgic memories of the original. Get ready to grab your Johnson and kill some demons.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-key-feature-could-be-pssr-says-dying-light-dev/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to Tymon Smektala, Dying Light Franchise Director at Techland, while the increased GPU power of the PS5 Pro will be very nice, PSSR (PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution) may be even more important for game developers. <a href="https://gamingbolt.com/pssr-could-potentially-be-more-important-than-direct-increase-in-gpu-power-dying-light-the-beast-dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to GamingBolt</a>, he stated:</p>
<p><em>We're just starting to discover the full capabilities of PS5 Pro, but it's already exciting as it gives us a lot more flexibility with graphics and performance. The boost in GPU will allow us to push visual fidelity, especially with complex environmental details like weather effects, which are very core to Dying Light: The Beast's experience. This kind of power also means generally smoother gameplay at higher resolutions, and that’s something very important for a game like ours, where the highest level of immersion is of utmost importance.</em></p>
<p><em>Sony's PSSR is a substantial push for the supersampling tech that other companies are experimenting with. It's a great initiative as, in the future, this can allow developers to focus slightly less on performance and have bigger creative liberty. If what Sony is proposing will become a new standard, then PSSR could potentially turn out to be even more important than the direct increase in GPU power that the console delivers.</em></p>
<p>As a reminder, PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution is an AI-based upscaling technique that leverages machine learning to reconstruct pixels from a lower starting resolution. According to recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-pssr-superior-amd-fsr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">testing</a> from Digital Foundry, PSSR is superior to AMD FSR 3.1 but inferior to NVIDIA DLSS. This is not surprising since AMD FSR 3.1 isn't based on machine learning, whereas DLSS premiered the usage of AI in image reconstruction techniques several years ago. However, not all games will support it; Empire of the Ants, one of the launch titles, <a href="https://wccftech.com/empire-of-the-ants-tech-qa-pushing-visuals-with-ue5-in-an-rts-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will not</a>. On the upside, PS VR 2 games will soon be able to<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-spectral-super-resolution-to-work-across-the-full-library-without-patches-will-also-support-ps-vr2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> take advantage of PSSR</a>.</p>
<p>The PS5 Pro will launch next week, on Thursday, November 7, for the considerable price of $699/£699/€799. You can learn more about the console <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/ps5-pro-everything-you-need-to-know-about-sonys-new-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.

<p>The DM-10 is a Marksman Rifle in Call of Duty <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> capable of killing enemies in just two shots. However, you must use the best set of attachments, Perks, and Equipment to make the most out of the weapon in multiplayer.</p>

</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-dm-10-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best DM-10 loadout attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic</strong>: Kepler Microflex</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Ported Compensator</li>



<li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Long Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel</strong>: Weighted Handguard</li>



<li><strong>Fire Mods</strong>: Rapid Fire</li>
</ul>



<p>The <strong>Kepler Microflex</strong> is a good optic choice for the DM-10 as the maps in Black Ops 6 are on the smaller side, and having a bigger scope would only leave you tunnel-visioned when the action is intense and fast-paced. This clean optic provides enough field of view to take down enemies easily.</p>



<p>Coming to the <strong>Ported Compensator</strong>, this muzzle will improve the accuracy of the Marksman Rifle by significantly enhancing the vertical and horizontal recoil. The <strong>Long Barrel</strong> will improve the damage range while the <strong>Weighted Handguard</strong> further lowers horizontal recoil.</p>



<p>Get hold of the <strong>Rapid Fire</strong> Fire Mods as it will increase the fire rate of the DM-10. This will come in handy to shoot down enemies faster, especially when they appear in numbers.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-dm-10">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for DM-10</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1</strong>: Ghost</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2</strong>: Forward Intel</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3</strong>: Cold-Blooded</li>



<li><strong>Perk 4</strong>: Bankroll</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard</strong>: Perk Greed</li>



<li><strong>Lethal</strong>: Semtex</li>



<li><strong>Tactical</strong>: Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade</strong>: Tactical Insertion</li>
</ul>



<p>The combination of <strong>Ghost, Forward Intel, and Cold-Blooded</strong> will activate the <strong>Recon</strong> Specialty – which is crucial as a Marksman Rifler. You can briefly see opponents’ positions through walls during the start of a round and that split-second is enough to plan for lethal attacks.</p>



<p>Once you unlock Perk Greed, keep <strong>Bankroll</strong> in the fourth Perk slot to gain a +150 score toward <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-scorestreaks-black-ops-6-and-how-to-unlock-them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scorestreaks</a>. This will come in handy to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-level-weapons-fast-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">level your weapons quicker</a> as Scorestreaks will recharge faster.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-best-secondary-for-dm-10">Best Secondary for DM-10</h2>



<p>The ideal secondary weapon options for the DM-10 are Stryder .22 and GS45.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-dm-10-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock DM-10 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>You need to reach <strong>player Level 43</strong> to unlock the DM-10 in Black Ops 6. This is the last Markman Rifle you can unlock at launch and will require you to play several matches to get this gun. In case you were wondering, here’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-level-up-fast-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how you can level up fast in BO6</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-dm-10-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the DM-10 any good in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>Yes, the DM-10 is one of the best Marksman Rifles in the game at the moment. It comes with a very fast TTK and offers great mobility at the same time. Although its ADS speed is a little slower and a semi-auto weapon, you can kill enemies in just two headshots.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-alternatives-to-the-dm-10-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives to the DM-10 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>If you don’t like handling semi-auto weapons, then the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-xm4-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XM4</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-best-ak-74-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AK-74</a> would be the best DM-10 alternatives in BO6. They are fully automatic rifles and are two of the most hard-hitting ones you can use.</p>

			<p>With G-Star 2024 scheduled to start in just two weeks at the usual venue (the Busan Exhibition and Convention Center), NEXON has shown off several trailers for its upcoming games, starting with The First Berserker: Khazan.</p>
<p>This intriguing Dungeon and Fighter spin-off is an action RPG that <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-gamescom-hands-on-preview-vast-potential/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">caught our attention at Gamescom</a> and then again during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-closed-beta-hands-on-preview-setting-up-for-greatness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent closed beta test</a>. Francesco De Meo wrote in his latest hands-on:</p>
<p><em>The First Berserker: Khazan may have been influenced by the Souls series for many of its game systems, but I feel, now more than ever, that the game will have what it takes to emerge from the competition. My time with the Technical Closed Beta Test build made me even more excited about the game, and I really cannot wait to experience more of the game when it launches next year on PC and consoles.</em></p>
<p>Today, NEXON published the game's opening cinematic. Check it out in the embedded video below.</p>
<p><iframe title="The First Berserker: Khazan | Opening Cinematic | G-STAR 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W8zwxh2FyHA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The South Korean company also published a new gameplay trailer for Project Overkill, another game set in the Dungeon and Fighter universe. Originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/nexons-overkill-is-a-3d-side-scrolling-arpg-set-in-the-dungeon-fighter-universe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> in early 2021, it is a 3D sidescrolling action RPG powered by Unreal Engine technology. It has no release date yet.</p>

<p>Today, NEXON unveiled a brand new Dungeon and Fighter game. Dungeon &amp; Fighter: Arad is an open-world action RPG for PC, consoles and mobiles in which players will experience exhilarating battle action and a journey with various characters on the Arad continent.</p>
<p><iframe title="G-STAR 2024ㅣ던전앤파이터: 아라드" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I-Ve5kMV37g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game developer also shared a brief new trailer for Vindictus: Defying Fate, a character action RPG based on the Mabinogi Heroes IP (just like the Vindictus MMO-lite game). Defying Fate is coming to PC and consoles, with an Alpha test scheduled to go live next Summer.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Vindictus: Defying Fate - Delia and Karok Sneak Peek" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KKZ_nIeVn1Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Last but not least, NEXON announced Project DX, a dinosaur-themed MMORPG based on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/durango-wild-lands-is-nexons-next-dino-themed-mmo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Durango: Wild Lands</a> IP. Codenamed Project DX, it promises an immersive story with unique characters and battles with giant dinosaurs against the backdrop of a post-apocalyptic world. Let's hope it won't be confined to mobile like the predecessor.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="G-STAR 2024ㅣ프로젝트DX" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QyNjRtkoiW0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The publisher might share more footage and information when G-Star actually begins. Stay tuned.</p>

            <p>When they’re not doing environmental art for projects like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wasteland-3">Wasteland 3</a>, The Brotherhood have a history making enticingly odd games.

<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2591790/ANIMAL_USE_PROTOCOL/">Steam page</a> describes it as a “first-person, narrative-focused survival horror” (you’ve got a bad thing chasing you, one of those), but I also would have accepted “Grimdark <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ape-out">Ape Out</a>”, which sound facetious but is actually one heck of a sell. Your very smart monke, Penn, is escaping from a lab with a bunch of other test animals, including a little rat mate named Trip who lives on your gravity gun and does a little jump whenever you fire it.</p>
<p>The trailer shows off a similar sort of grimy, unnerving tech to Brotherhood’s previous games. This is good. It also does that horror game trailer thing where it has a bunch of kids singing the Barney The Dinosaur theme really slowly. This is bad and stupid. It’s got a massive tortoise in it. It also contains potassium benzoate etc. Most bad-ly of all, it’s not actually out until 2026. So why am I writing about it now?!</p>
<p><em>Monke.</em></p>
<p>Or Chimp, I suppose, although if you were about to type a comment along those lines, I would first suggest you make sure you know your phylum and genus from your ligma. Feel free to ask about that last one. Here are some more deets:</p>
<blockquote><p>In this 3D first-person, narrative-focused survival horror game, you play as Penn, a hyper-intelligent chimpanzee leading the desperate escape of lab animals from a nightmarish facility, where every corner hides new terror.

<p>Several sources have revealed that Call of Duty zombies original crew might be making their return in Call of Duty 2025.</p>



<p>The news comes from several sources who were invited to Call of Duty 2025 playtests and feedback sessions, where it was revealed that the original crew for zombies are set to make their return. </p>



<p>Dempsey, Tank, Takeo, and Nikolai were all said to be featured as a part of the feedback sessions, with one eagle-eyed zombies fan stating that the versions of the characters were not Ultimis, and that the characters looked older than Primis. </p>



<p>According to the same sources, the zombies storyline will evolve around a new enemy character who wants to absorb the “Dark Aether Essence” of the original four characters and bring back the old multiverse. </p>



<p>Sources also corroborated the recent zombies leak, that also originated from such playtests and feedback sessions. Sources said that the main zombies map will be “Tranzit inspired,” with some form of travel system to navigate around the map. One source, who was a part of such playtest also revealed that there was the plan to have 6 total zombies maps throughout the lifecycle of Call of Duty 2025, but whether or not the games scope has changed is unclear.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that these playtest events usually have some variations to the details, in order to gain valued feedback and potentially pinpoint the origin of leaks. However, from what we’re been able to determine, this information has been at various different feedback events worldwide over the past 12 months or so, suggesting that the information is almost certainly accurate (but never say never).</p>



<p>Per Insider Gaming’s reporting, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-2-call-of-duty-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty 2025 is set to be a Black Ops 2 sequel</a>. It’s understood that the games campaign follows Harper and Mason as they try to save the world from a new villain following the death of Menendez. </p>

<p>Black Ops 6 players have figured out that you can explore the upcoming Warzone map ‘Avalon’ by using Black Ops 6 spectator mode.</p>



<p>Video footage of people exploring the map have been ongoing since the games launch, which shows the entirety of the upcoming map and what exactly it’s going to entail.</p>



<p>To load the map yourself, simple load up the multiplayer map ‘Lowtown’ in a Black Ops 6 private match and enter spectator mode, from here, you’ll be able to explore the map in full detail in the ‘Codcaster’ role.</p>



<p>You can see a video of the full flythrough below:</p>

Black Ops 6 Accidentally Leaks New Avalon Map?!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OfWzQB1DdIM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>But don’t get your hopes up just yet. Despite the map being already fully complete (and being so for a while now), it isn’t actually the next Warzone map to be released. Earlier this year, we reported that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-verdansk-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk is set to make its triumphant return first</a>, which was a decision made around the same time as the highly popular original Fortnite map made its return and was tremendously successful.</p>



<p>It’s understood that Verdansk is set to make it’s return sometime at the beginning for 2025, with Avalon releasing sometime later in the year depending on Verdansk’s success.</p>

Kotaku's number aligns with an <a href="https://www.dfcint.com/sony-acquires-video-game-studio/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">earlier report</a> saying that ProbablyMonsters — Firewalk's original parent company — raised $200 million in 2021. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Firewalk is signing off one last time.</p><p>Firewalk began with the idea of bringing the joy of multiplayer to a larger audience.

Looking back on the studio's history, the note reflects on being a new startup during the global pandemic, and how Concord only entered full production in 2022. It also talks about building a "new, customized next-generation FPS engine in Unreal 4 -&gt; 5, delivering top-tier gameplay feel, beautiful worlds, and a performant 60fps technical experience on a stable and scalable backend on PS5 and PC to hundreds of thousands of players in our beta."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It all points to Concord being seen as an ambitious project that was expected to attract a large audience. Instead it launched to tepid reviews and low interest, prompting PlayStation to pull the plug within days of release. One estimate suggested it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing">only sold around 25,000 copies</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Midia Research Analyst Rhys Elliott told IGN shortly before Concord was shut down, “Pivoting to live services is high-risk, high-reward venture, and the risk is heightening to levels that might not be worth it for many AAA console/PC publishers that aren’t already active in the space."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Concord is hardly the only expensive live service game to fail to meet expectations, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-troubled-development-revealed-in-new-report">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League facing similar struggles</a>. Live service games are increasingly facing a calcified market dominated by the likes of Fortnite and Call of Duty while costing hundreds of millions dollars to make. Despite that, PlayStation continues to bet big on service games, with Fairgame$ and Marathon among the projects next on the docket.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">PlayStation Studios CEO Hermen Hulst says Sony will learn from its experience with Firewalk Studios. "The PvP first person shooter genre is a competitive space that’s continuously evolving, and unfortunately, we did not hit our targets with this title. We will take the lessons learned from Concord and continue to advance our live service capabilities to deliver future growth in this area."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

Earlier today, <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/101385/amd-could-have-ton-of-reveals-for-ces-2025-strix-halo-rdna-4-gpus-new-x3d-cpus-and-more/index.html">a Chiphell leaker rumored</a> that AMD would announce its RDNA 4 graphics at CES 2025 in January, alongside its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/1/24211083/what-if-amd-gaming-tablet-but-hugely-more-powerful-plugged-in">leaked Strix Halo</a> and Fire Range gaming notebook parts, its confirmed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/6/24237735/amd-z2-extreme-gaming-handheld-pc-chip">Ryzen Z2 handheld gaming chips</a>, and more.</p><p>AMD expects its gaming revenue to continue to decline this quarter, due in no small part to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles aging out, and<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/30/24209938/amd-q2-2024-earnings-datacenter-ai-revenue"> it’s not exactly the company’s primary focus these days anyhow</a>. On today’s call, Su pointed out how gaming only accounts for two percent of the company’s revenue, while data center is now well over half of the company’s business. She says that after spending 10 years turning AMD around, her next task is to “make AMD the end-to-end AI leader.”</p><div><p>The company had previously revealed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/9/24240173/amd-udna-gpu-ai-gaming-rdna-cdna-jack-huynh">it’s turning its back on flagship GPUs to chase AI first</a>, so you shouldn’t expect new consumer RDNA 4 parts to compete with Nvidia’s best and priciest GPUs. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In the wake of Anthem, Wilson said a "big shift happened" that saw "BioWare really returning to BioWare-type games; really returning to BioWare's strengths."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"BioWare has rallied around what made BioWare a fan-favorite studio and a fan-favorite brand and the types of games they make – incredibly rich worlds, incredibly nuanced characters, really powerful and compelling stories with comaraderie and friendships and relationships, and decisions that matter in the context of gameplay," Wilson said. "And I think it’s been that return to what made BioWare great and giving the studio time to deliver against what makes BioWare great in the context of the Dragon Age world is what amounts to Dragon Age: The Veilguard."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>BioWare has rallied around what made BioWare a fan-favorite studio and a fan-favorite brand and the types of games they make...</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Wilson's comments come in the context of what has been reported to be a sometimes fraught relationship with EA.

The game is currently headed toward season 23 in early November, and while its player numbers <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1172470/charts/#1y" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">aren't quite at the heights</a> they <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-games-concurrents-rankings">used to be</a>, the hero shooter still seems to be doing all right for itself. Some companies might be thinking right about now as to how they can refresh and replenish that playerbase with a sequel, but EA CEO Andrew Wilson doesn't seem interested.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During today's Q2 earnings call, Wilson stated in answer to an investor question that large live service games such as Apex that reach massive audiences must continue to creatively innovate and update, or they risk losing that coveted top spot. For that reason, he continued, EA recognizes a "need for meaningful systematic innovation that fundamentally changes the way the game plays," and said that this is something the teams are actively working on.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As a follow up, someone else asked him that as the teams are working on that "systematic rethink of Apex," if they're considering doing "a whole studs-up rebuild" on something like an "Apex 2.0", as opposed to incremental change over time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wilson's answer? No. Here's his response in full:</p><blockquote>Typically, what we have seen in the context of live service-driven games at scale is the 'version two' thing has almost never been as successful as the 'version one' thing. And so actually the objective right now is to ensure that we are continuing to support the global playerbase that we have, and deliver them new, innovative, creative content on a season-by-season basis, as well as build these other things, but build them in a way that players do not have to give up the progress that they've made or the investment that they've put into the existing ecosystem. Anytime we cause a global player community to have to choose between the investments they've made to date and future innovation and creativity, that's never a good place to put our community in.</blockquote><blockquote>Our objective will be to continue to innovate in the core experience...and then build additional opportunities for engagement in different modalities of play beyond what the current core mechanic delivers. And we think we can do those two things together, and we don't believe we have to separate the experience in order to do so.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">So, per Wilson, no Apex 2.0 for the foreseeable future, but there is some sort of "systemic innovation" on the horizon that could shake-up Apex Legends in a big way.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-gained-15m-new-players-in-the-past-year-despite-being-over-a-decade-old<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> might be getting on a bit, what with having launched over a decade ago now, but that doesn't seem to have dulled interest in the long-running life sim series; EA just announced The Sims 4 has managed to gain over 15m new players this year alone.
</p>
<p>
To put that into perspective, it took The Sims 4 six years to amass 20m players after its launch back in 2014 - a figure that then skyrocketed following EA's decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-base-game-is-going-permanently-free-starting-in-october">transition the formerly premium title into a free-to-play game</a> in October 2022. That business model shift more than quadrupled The Sims 4's audience, with EA touting 85m players back in May this year, and we now know the past 12 months have brought a total of 15m new players.
</p>
<p>
That most recent figure was revealed as part of EA's <a href="https://s204.q4cdn.com/701424631/files/doc_financials/2025/q2/Q2-FY25-Earnings-Release-FINAL.pdf">second-quarter 2025 financial earnings report</a> ("Increased engagement led to higher-than-expected net bookings for the franchise in
Q2", the publisher noted), and helps provide additional context for its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-5-not-happening-as-ea-moves-beyond-linear-sequential-sims-releases">announcement earlier this year</a> that, despite its age, The Sims 4 will remain "a foundational Sims experience" as the series moves "beyond linear, sequential Sims releases".

<p>
The Sims 4's surge in popularity also explains EA renewed focus on the ten-year-old game, with the publisher having pledged <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-pledges-more-bug-fixes-more-often-as-it-looks-to-address-years-of-frustrating-technical-issues">more bug fixes more often</a> this May as it looks to address years of 'frustrating' technical issues. That's on top of a range of new in-game initiatives, such as the new live-service style Reaper's Rewards Event, and a continuing avalanche of new DLC.
</p><p>
Next on the expansion list is The Sims 4's extremely promising and wonderfully macabre <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sims-4-gets-embalming-grim-reaping-reincarnation-and-naked-moon-rituals-in-new-life-death-expansion">Life &amp; Death expansion</a>, which releases this Thursday, 31st October. Its launch follows a free base game update last week considerably expanding Sims' ghost-form gameplay (and making it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-ghostly-update-puts-woohoo-ing-the-grim-reaper-back-on-the-table">possible to bonk Death</a>), and comes ahead of a new series of creator-designed DLC packs.
</p>
<p>
Things have certainly come a long way <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-responds-to-fan-outcry-over-the-sims-4-missing-features">since Swimmingpoolgate</a>.

We're not sure how helpful the extra two face buttons on the left module would be, but Turtle Beach was smart to move the D-pad into the other slot for fighting games, side-scrollers, and other games that feel more natural with D-pad movement controls.</p><p>Both thumbsticks use Hall Effect anti-drift sensors.</p></div>                      </div><p dir="ltr">While the reversible modules are the Stealth Pivot’s main features, the controller can be customized in other ways, such as adjustable trigger and thumbstick sensitivity, four remappable microswitch buttons, adjustable trigger locks, and digital or analog modes for the D-pad. </p><p dir="ltr">The Stealth Pivot sports some other cool features, including a mini-LED which is used to configure up to five custom control profiles, adjust settings, and even display social notifications or other alerts. It also supports rumble and various Turtle Beach audio enhancement features like EQ presets, chat volume mixing, and more. It can connect via 2.4GHz wireless, Bluetooth 5.2, or wired USB to Xbox consoles, PC, or mobile. In wireless mode, it offers up to 20 hours of battery life and has quick charging via USB-C. </p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4392241-unnamed%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4392241" data-ratio="0.41" data-width="1200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4392241-unnamed%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4392241"></a><figcaption>Stealth Pivot's rotating modules</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4392241-unnamed%281%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Turtle Beach brought over many of the Stealth Pivot's features from the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/High-Performance-Wireless-Controller-Licensed-Xbox-X/dp/B0CJVQFZ1S?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Stealth Ultra</a>, which released last holiday for $200.

If relentlessly amassing sticks and bopping rocks is starting to feel a little stale in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disney-dreamlight-valley">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a>, there's something new on the horizon. Developer Gameloft has unveiled The Storybook Vale, a second paid expansion for the village-life sim, that'll whisk players to a world of Greek myths, Scottish folktales, and more when it launches on 20th November.
</p>
<p>
The Storybook Vale, which follows on from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disney-dreamlight-valleys-massive-a-rift-in-time-expansion-detailed">last year's A Rift in Time expansion</a>, introduces another world for Dreamlight Valley players to explore in the form of the titular Vale. Described as "the place in your heart where all your most treasured stories live", it's said to have previously hung in the sky over Dreamlight Valley - but was stolen away by Maleficent and Hades, eventually falling into disarray as the pair began to bicker. And that's where players come in, embarking on a quest for the Lorekeeper - an enchanted book who holds the world together - to retrieve her scattered pages and restore peace.
</p>
<p>
And all this takes place across The Storybook Vale's three new biomes. There's The Bind, inspired by "dark academia" and the "cool yet cosy ambience of an autumnal forest"; Mythtopia, themed around "Greco-Roman culture and ancient myths" (and it even gets its own Mount Olympus), plus Everafter, a blend of "dark enchanted mushroom forest and windswept moorlands" inspired by "Scottish and Scandinavian folklore".

<p>
The Storybook Vale will be released over two parts, the first arriving on 20th November and the second due next summer. Part one introduces three new villagers - Brave's Merida, Hercules' Hades, and Tangled's Flynn (who'll be able to reunite with Rapunzel if players happen to have last year's A Rift in Time expansion) - alongside new collectibles, tools, resources, and "dozens" of new recipes. Players can catch koi fish, for instance, or gather ambrosia, and there are new animal companions in the form of owls, mini dragons, and mini winged horses.
</p><p>
Additionally, the expansion introduces Trials, special quests inspired by fairy tales and myths that players will need to unscramble using their old and new tools. One of those new tools is the Royal Net, used to capture the Lorekeeper's scattered pages, come to life as ancient origami creatures known as Snippets, which can then be assembled into jigsaw-like tapestries and hung in in-game homes. And that's just Part One, with next year's Part Two, The Unwritten Realms, seeing players "venture into a strange world beneath the Storybook Vale [to] solve the mystery of the missing princess", alongside Maleficent and a currently unannounced second character. 
</p>
<p>
Both parts of The Storybook Vale are included in Disney Dreamlight Valley's second expansion pass, which releases on 20th November. Purchases also include 5,000 Moonstones - as the game's premium currency is known - and there's a Magical Edition, featuring 10,000 Moonstones, the Autumn Manor House stye, Storybook Vale dress and ensemble, plus Baby Pegasus companion and house. Alternatively, the Storybook Bundle includes the base game, new expansion, and 13,000 Moonstones, while the Enchanted Edition gathers together the base game, both expansions, 18,000 Moonstones, plus "exclusive rewards". Gameloft hasn't announced prices for any of these at the time of writing, but last year's A Rift in Time expansion cost £24.99 so expect things to start from there.

<p>
Alongside all <em>that</em>, Gameloft has shared a look ahead at the base game's next series of free updates, starting with Sew Delightful on 4th December. This brings Sally from A Nightmare Before Christmas to the Valley, complete with the usual introductory quest and Friendship rewards. That's alongside a new premium Star Path, which includes ice-themed furniture and other rewards. Sew Delightful also promises a number of new features, including floating islands. These act as extra building spaces, themed after existing base game biomes, that players can expand to if they need more room (object limits are independent from other locations) with each island being comparable to their Valley counterparts. Plaza Island, Forest Island, Sunlit Island, and Frosted Island as set to launch in December with more to follow. 
</p><p>
Additionally, builders feeling limited by the game's current four points of rotation will soon see that increased to 16, opening up new decorating possibilities. Gameloft says the enhanced placement system applies to furniture, buildings, landscaping items, resources, and even dropped items like prepared dishes, with support for fences and paths coming at a later date. 
</p>
<p>
But that's still not quite everything announced during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJJ6OqlJig0">Gameloft's latest Disney Dreamlight Valley stream</a>. The developer also shared a roadmap covering its three free updates for the first half of 2025. Early 2025, for instance, will let players explore "a whole new world and revel on a magical adventure" - the accompanying picture teasing the arrival of Aladdin and Jasmine - while Spring 2025 promises a "land of wonder", its image of the Cheshire Cat unquestionably marking the arrival of Alice's Adventures. And finally, Summer 2025 will give players the opportunity to "solve an ancient mystery and discover who is waiting inside Skull Rock." And given Skull Rock's origins and the red feather buried in the sand in Gameloft's tease, this should finally be the moment Disney Dreamlight Valley welcomes Peter Pan and friends.

Expect more details as their respective releases draw nearer.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-impressions<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've played a lot of Call of Duty this year, so when I picked up Black Ops 6 over the weekend, I was coming in hot.</p><p>There's a lot you can say, and there's a lot that's been said, about this game's politics. And other <em>Black Ops</em> games’ politics. And other <em>Call of Duty</em> games’ politics. <em>Black Ops 6</em> has WMDs and Saddam; you're up to your eyeballs in the establishment of the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_world_order_(politics)#:~:text=Bush's%20speech%20of%20September,South%20economic%2C%20and%20security%20problems." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> New World Order</a>; you spend a lot of time, as is pretty standard in a <em>Call of Duty</em> game, mowing down dudes for whom English is not their first language at home. If that kind of stuff makes you want to bail on it, or not touch it at all, I get that, it's a lot!</p><figure></figure><p>As a white Western man, I have historically loved this shit, it's my video game comfort food, even as I appreciate the comfort zones at play and, as an Australian, give zero fucks about all the star-spangled HOO-RAHs. So when I say I love this shit, I don't mean the politics, which I let wash over my back like water off a duck, but everything <em>around </em>them. <em>Call of Duty</em> fills the same spot in my heart that Schwarzenegger movies (many also featuring pretty crummy politics!) used to, in that they are interactive versions of big, dumb, explosive action movies, something to switch off to, but which here also happen to have some of the best moment-to-moment rhythm in video games.</p><p>Sadly, the last few games haven't done it for me, but with<em> Black Ops 6, </em>the <em>Call of Duty</em> singleplayer campaign is back, baby. I'm not saying it's good, even by this series' dire standards over the last few years. But it does at least clear the low bar set by the <em>Modern Warfare </em>reboots, which given the state of their singleplayer campaigns is nothing short of extraordinary.</p><p>The contempt shown towards the last two <em>Modern Warfare</em> singleplayer campaigns (the third especially) pointed towards a future where <em>Call of Duty</em> simply gave up and abandoned them altogether.<a href="https://aftermath.site/call-duty-aaa-graphics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> The high cost of meeting (self-imposed) visual standards</a>, the priority given to the series' multiple multiplayer modes and some dismal story-telling doomed them from the start, a real shame considering the last campaign before that--2021's <em>Vanguard</em>--was pretty good!</p><figure></figure><p><em>Black Ops 6</em> isn't a return to the heights of the original <em>Modern Warfare</em> games, but it is at least a reversal out of the bin. It's a full, proper singleplayer campaign, complete with a fleshed-out cast, scripted missions, a plot, the works. None of it made any sense to me, of course, but I found it was more fun not knowing who anyone was or what they were doing, because this allowed me to write everything off--particularly an attempt at looping the zombies mode into the narrative--as a fever dream and just concentrate on the shooting.</p><p>I had fun blasting my way through a very well-animated, Tom Clancy-ass story about political intrigue and biological warfare. The series' gunplay, as always, is crisp, almost tangible. Pulling up your iron sights, pulling the trigger, seeing something fall down, this is where <em>Call of Duty </em>has always excelled, and <em>Black Ops 6</em> is no different. There's something about the speed it all takes place at, the sound, the animation–nobody does it better.</p><p>Panning back out from those iron sights, I appreciated some non-shooty bits of <em>Black Ops 6</em> as well. There's loads of interesting espionage gear to play with, an adventure game sequence set at a Bill Clinton fundraiser, a casino heist and some surprisingly enjoyable stealth missions (enjoyable because the second you're inevitably discovered it just turns into a regular <em>Call of Duty</em> mission, guns blazing). There are also some bigger missions set on the game's bigger multiplayer maps, where you're given multiple objectives to complete and the freedom to tackle it all at will. One plays out like a miniature <em>Far Cry</em>, another like a homage to <em>Control</em>, there’s even a Diet <em>Hitman </em>in there, and all are a nice little diversion from the more linear, traditional missions.</p><figure></figure><p>The tributes to other games don't end once you're between stages, either. For reasons that are never quite adequately explained, you and your team of wanted international mercenaries are holed up in a house in Bulgaria where you...can spend cash you pick up during actual levels to take part in what's essentially a home improvement minigame. You know, mercs for hire, on the run, taking time out to sink some brews and renovate. Normal <em>Call of Duty</em> stuff. It's extremely stupid, but also charming in its own way; getting to see these gruff killers cooking a stew is a vulnerable, personal touch I wish the series gave us more of.</p><p><em>Black Ops 6</em>'s campaign is not a great shooter. Not by general standards, not even by the franchise's own standards, which to be fair are, at their peaks, pretty close to some of the best ever made. But you know what, I don't really mind. It's just nice to have a <em>Call of Duty</em> singleplayer game around that's not terrible. Comfort food doesn't need Michelin stars. And with my brain switched off and my finger on the trigger, <em>Black Ops 6</em> sees <em>Call of Duty</em> once again hitting the spot.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Some are worried that it simply means Bandai Namco is planning to dole out each new style over months and years through a relentless drip-feed of microtransaction add-ons as it’s done with <em>Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2</em>. <em>Sparking</em>&nbsp;<em>Zero </em>seems destined to be the ultimate <em>DBZ</em> sim, but no <em>DBZ</em> sim is complete without more robust dress-up options. </p><p>Enter modders who are at least bringing some of these costume changes to the PC version of the game. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gamebanana.com/mods/551869&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/551869" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Piccolo Postboy outfit</a></span> was added to the GameBanana mod repository yesterday.

Of course, there are plenty of other outfits still missing, like Goku and Vegeta’s “SAB” winter jackets from the <em>Dragon Ball Super: Broly </em>movie and Gohan’s Kai outfit from the Buu Saga. </p><p>I can forgive some of these missing from the game at launch, but too many of the best alternate costumes seem MIA at the moment. I’m not above paying for them all if they get rolled out later. It would have felt more satisfying if they were all late-game unlockables, though. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
