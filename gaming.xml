<p>If you’ve been anywhere on social media in the last few days, you might have seen a new meme called ‘Chill Guy’. It has been represented by some of the biggest brands in gaming, such as Call of Duty, and parodies of it have appeared all over TikTok and Twitter.</p>



<p>It’s a brilliant and lighthearted meme that many are enjoying worldwide, but the creator of the character used in the meme has suddenly announced a copyright action. He stressed on social media that he’ll start issuing takedowns against certain profiles using the image ‘over the next few days’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-that-s-not-very-chill">That’s Not Very Chill</h2>



<p>On Twitter, @PhillipBankss shared an image of a cartoon dog in 2023. This character mulled around on social media for a while before skyrocketing as a viral meme image just days ago. For some reason, influencers and cryptocurrency brands got their hands on the image and started using it in a series of parodies to promote their products.</p>



<p>That’s the source of the creator’s anger, and it’s why the image has been copyrighted.</p>



<p>He admitted on Twitter that not everyone will feel the brunt of his takedown notices:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>just putting it out there, chill guy has been copyrighted. like, legally. I’ll be issuing takedowns on for-profit related things over the next few days</p>



<p>not like brand accounts using him as a trend, that’s kinda something i dont really care about (i do just ask for credit. or xboxes.). mainly unauthorized merchandise and shitcoins</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As the meme goes, a brand or a creator will use the image with a caption reading ‘something, something, but you’re just a chill something’. It’s tough to explain, so here’s an example from Halo:</p>



<p><em>When Master Chief trades you his plasma pistol for your rocket launcher but you’re just a chill marine:</em></p>



<figure></figure>







<p>I’m getting old and appreciate memes less and less, but this one still makes sense to me.</p>



<p>To give PhillipBankss credit, he revealed that his social feeds and DMs were being spammed by crypto shills and at times nefarious brands using his image to get in on the trend and traffic. That’s who he aims to target with this copyright action, and the run-of-the-mill users sharing it on social and content platforms won’t be impacted.</p>

<p>STALKER 2 is finally here after more than a decade of on-and-off development, and it’s turning heads worldwide. In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my review</a>, I rated STALKER 2 with a 9 out of 10 score, and many other publications have echoed that sentiment. Others, not so much – STALKER 2 is proving to be an extremely divisive game within the wider community.</p>



<p>On social, streaming, and gaming platforms, the entire STALKER franchise is undergoing a boost in popularity thanks to the launch of STALKER 2, which has been met with mixed opinions.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-they-re-not-bugs-they-re-anomalies">They’re Not Bugs, They’re Anomalies</h2>



<p>One of the most common pieces of feedback being levelled against STALKER 2 is that it’s riddled with bugs and performance issues. That’s not untrue, but it’s not as bad as people are making out. As someone who put 30 hours into a pre-release version of the game, I’ll say quite transparently that users have <strong>no idea </strong>the number of issues that GSC Game World patched out ahead of launch.</p>



<p>STALKER 2 will get better with time, and when modders step in to help GSC, the timescale for those improvements will be dramatically shortened.</p>



<p>On Twitch, <a href="https://twitchtracker.com/games/29106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">STALKER 2 saw massive growth</a> at launch, hitting a peak viewer count of 415,708 users. By comparison, Bethesda Game Studios’ Starfield, which before it was released was one of the most anticipated games in many years, hit a peak viewer count of 552,000 little more than a year ago.</p>



<p>On Steam, every STALKER game has seen a player gain in the last 30 days. </p>



<p>For instance, STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl has racked up a 40% growth in players, while Call of Pripyat has soared by 37%.</p>



<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl managed to pull in a peak player count of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1643320/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">113,587 on Steam alone</a>, but it’s widely expected that the figure will be doubled or tripled on Xbox and PC (Game Pass). STALKER 2 is free on the popular subscription-based platform, and that’s where the bulk of the game’s players will likely come from.</p>



<p>Despite the mixed opinions on social media, STALKER 2 really isn’t doing so badly.</p>



<p>It has 80.5% positive reviews on Steam, and on Metacritic, it has secured a score of 74 overall. That’s below the predictions, but it’s not at all representative of what one critic wrote: <em>‘Sadly, Stalker 2 is, by far, the most unstable game we have reviewed in a long time.’</em></p>



<p>GSC Game World has already emerged on social media promising that the repair work to patch up the game as much as possible will be ongoing in earnest to smooth out the rough edges of the release version. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review.1041444/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/21/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>In the earlier days of the internet, when social media wasn’t in everyone’s hands and gaming was niche and nerdy, some of the best video games were gatekept secrets and whispers on message boards. This rang particularly true for games from Japan or Europe, that often got overlooked by mainstream media. For years as a teen on the web, one game series in particular that felt like legend was STALKER. People would simply talk differently about these games, treating them like immersive experiences where you don’t just beat a level or complete a quest, you live in The Zone, and you become a Stalker. Now, with the first new entry in the series since 2009 and my first real foray into the franchise, I can tell you that all those stories were true. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/stalker-2">STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> is immersive, and frightening, and hilarious, and magical, and intense, and unlike pretty much anything else out there.</p>
<p><iframe title="S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl — Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PKO4PL8Xzik?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/stalker">STALKER</a> series owes its inspiration to societ scifi novel Roadside Picnic and the loosely related film adaptation by Andrei Tarkovsky. In the wake of 1986 Chornobyl nuclear reactor disaster, STALKER paints the picture of an alternate history where a 2nd disaster rocked the Exclusion Zone decades later in 2006. This has warped the entire region from a barely inhabitable wasteland to a truly alien world.</p>


<p>Mutated creatures stalk through the bushes, while sudden emission storms turn the sky and rip the earth apart. And then there are the anomalies – environmental oddities like psionic whirlwinds or chutes of fire that can shred you in an instant if you aren’t careful. Stalkers are dedicated wanderers and survivors who may not share ideals or allegiances, but all take part in overcoming the odds of The Zone to track down artefacts, make a little money, and strive to see another day.</p>


<p>This is all the narrative setup that truly matters to the overarching experience. In STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl, the game will attempt to paint you into the box of a man named Skif, who works as a Stalker to investigate the truth behind a unique artefact he uncovered after his old family home was destroyed. His story is fine, it’s okay, but what makes this game truly special is turning it into your own story, though. Like the freedom that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2010/10/19/review-fallout-new-vegas/">Fallout: New Vegas</a> or <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/05/baldurs-gate-3-review-ps5-pc/">Baldur’s Gate 3</a> give you in crafting your own protagonist and filling the moments in-between dialogue with your own role-played lore, this game provides that same kind ofcanvas. However, you aren’t just painting it with dialogue options or character builds – your story is told through moments of survival.</p>
<p>STALKER 2 is relentless, but combat is just one part of the tense tapestry it weaves. Gunfights can be fast and brutal. When you fight humans, they’re fragile, and so are you. A lined-up headshot can cause a bandit to crumble on the spot, but a bullet to your back can take you out just as quickly if you aren’t careful. Meanwhile, packs of dogs will upturn your plans at the worst possible time, every time. Mutated rats and invisible monsters will soak up your bullets and leave you drained of resources. Every moment of existing in The Zone is a calculated struggle, yet it never feels like an artificial challenge like so many other survival games do. You aren’t managing arbitrary hunger and thirst meters or idly gathering wood and stone – there is a constant direct connection between your survival needs and what is happening on-screen, and it is incredible.</p>

<p>As you learn what it takes to survive in The Zone, you’ll start to dig deeper into the overarching storyline of Heart of Chornobyl. While Skif’s personal journey is easy to ignore, there is a massive conflict brewing in the world between multiple factions that you quickly find yourself embroiled in – your choices on which sides to trust or not trust will leave a lasting impact on your playthrough. After one moment of siding with a group of Zone-revering Stalkers called Spark, I found myself in multiple situations where I would be attacked on-sight by their direct rivals, The Ward. On one of those occasions, though, a crew of Spark-affiliated Stalkers was nearby and helped me turn the tide on battle. Afterwards, I walked up to one of them, he offered to sell me items and boasted about “only having the good shit”, and I opened his inventory to see him selling two beers and a sausage. My man.</p>
<p>There’s an undercurrent of comedy to STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl – the improvisational nature of the world and it’s inhabitants and how they all interact can toggle between frightening immersion and gut-busting hilarity in a moment. I love that, and I think we all need that. When you take into account the real-life circumstances faced by the Ukrainian development team behind this game, it’s easy to see how the unique charm of The Zone might be something that they really need right now, too.</p>

<p>Part of the comedy of errors that tends to play out in this game also comes from a litany of literal errors and bugs – the series’ reputation for being buggy continues. Some are hilarious visual oddities, like a mutated rat flying into the sky after I knifed it. Other bugs can be boring technical frustrations, though. Most of these bugs contributed to the charm of the world as I played the review build of STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl. A day one patch larger than the game itself arrived after I wrapped up my time with the game, and notes fixes many of these silly or frustrating bugs.</p>
<p>Even without those fixes, though, Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl is like almost nothing else out there. It’s full of charm in so many different flavors, and is a visual feast on top of that. It’s a new bold path for survival games and shooters that I never want to turn back from.</p>

<p>Off The Grid, an all-new battle royale game splitting opinions everywhere has already held a massive tournament. Yesterday, 60 of North America’s most popular streamers dived into Off The Grid to win a portion of a $600,000 prize pool. It’s almost unheard of that a game so early in the development cycle hosts such a large tournament, but that’s crypto money for you, I guess.</p>



<p>By the time the dust had settled, a diverse roster of squads had picked up some sizeable prizes in Off The Grid’s All-Stars Invitational. The winners included retired Call of Duty pro players, Fortnite streamers, and the single biggest names in content creation.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-backed-by-the-blockchain">Backed by the Blockchain</h2>



<p>Off The Grid has been splitting the community down the middle since it surfaced several weeks ago.</p>



<p>It’s no big secret that Off The Grid is backed by blockchain technology and has heavy investment from cryptocurrency-focused firms, and that has been a sticking point with players everywhere. It’s a solid game, but the connection with crypto has been a hard pill for many to swallow, and that’s why the game is struggling to gain traction.</p>



<p>If it wasn’t for the developer stuffing the scene with money and prolific events like the All-Stars Invitational, Off The Grid would likely be passing under the radar.</p>



<p>During the recent tournament, 60 players entered the running in teams of three, with each game (of six) boasting a prize worth $60,000 for the top team, $20,000 for second place, and $10,000 for third-placed teams. Gunzilla, the game’s developer, has wasted no time enticing players to the platform with daily tournaments and cash prizes all over the place.</p>



<p>Here’s how it all went down, winners-wise:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Game 1</strong>: Team IceManIsaac</li>



<li><strong>Game 2: </strong>Team IceManIsaac</li>



<li><strong>Game 3: </strong>Team Holly</li>



<li><strong>Game 4: </strong>Team Huskerrs</li>



<li><strong>Game 5: </strong>Team IceManIsaac</li>



<li><strong>Game 6: </strong>Team IceManIsaac</li>
</ul>



<p>There’s a trend there, I think.</p>



<p>Team IceManIsaac was represented by the man himself, Skullface, and Aydan, some of the best battle players and champions in the world. Aydan has long been a superstar streamer in the Warzone space, and Skullface has claimed wins in the World Series of Warzone, so they’re well-placed to dominate any battle royale game like Off The Grid.</p>



<p>Do you think it’s right that Gunzilla is trying to ‘buy an audience’ with Off The Grid? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

It doesn't do much beyond what the original did, but advancements in technology have enhanced its anomalous strengths, breathing new life into its massive open world and the ways in which you and everything around you can interact with it."</p><hr><p dir="ltr">Several of the biggest games of 2024 are also on sale right now, if you’re looking to prepare yourself for a festive season gaming binge.

While it feels somewhat alien to use at first, leverless fight sticks are becoming very popular with professional fighting game players as these can help pull off tricky moves in games more reliably. As for colors, there are two options here, depending on your tastes.</p><p dir="ltr">Both models have Sanwa Denshi 30mm buttons, a removable Sanwa Densi Ball-top joystick on the regular model, and a foam lap pad for comfortable gaming sessions. You can also open them up for when you want to do some customization or cleaning, and since they're made from a single piece of aircraft-grade aluminum, they can easily survive a turbulent trip to Las Vegas for the next Evo tournament. If you'd prefer something nondescript, you can pick up one of these fight sticks in a crisp PS5-style white, or for something flashier, there's a bright purple finish.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Victrix Pro FS fight stick (PS5/PS4/PC)</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3VRDML3?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">White</a> -- $320 ($<del>400</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3VQXXJR?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Purple</a> -- $320 ($<del>400</del>)</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr">Victrix Pro FS-12 leverless fight stick (PS5/PS4/PC)</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3VP2M12?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">White</a> -- $320 ($<del>400</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3VQKGHW?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Purple</a> -- $320 ($<del>400</del>)</li></ul><hr><p dir="ltr">Alternatively, you can also check out the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CCX2DMXV?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Razer Kitsune</a>. This is a bit more affordable at $270 (was $300), and depending on your preferences, it might be superior to the Victrix Pro.

It’s shaped like a musical note, and in this case, it’s painted to look like Kirby. You play the instrument by sliding your finger into different positions on its neck, while opening Kirby’s mouth will alter the sound. The instrument is also built with a 3.5mm jack, allowing you to connect it to headphones or speakers. It’s a quirky gadget--and it might take some time to master--but just about anyone should be able to pick it up and have fun with its charming sounds.</p>                      </div><p>The Deluxe edition includes an exclusive Kirby Strap to help you find a comfortable playing position and an instruction manual to teach you the basics. The keychain edition isn’t quite as elaborate as the other two models, as you’ll just be pressing a button to the rhythm to make one of its many songs play.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-ranked-play-cheaters/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Black Ops 6 Ranked Play has been added to the game in record time, and to the chagrin of competitive players worldwide, it’s already packed full of cheaters. On social media, clips have surfaced from pro players and streamers revealing them being matched against stacked hackers disrupting the game for everyone else – as always.</p>



<p>It took one day for cheaters to throw Black Ops 6 Ranked Play off the rails.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-every-time">Every Time</h2>



<p>Every time Activision’s studios release a ranked mode in a Call of Duty game, it’s infested with hackers.</p>



<p>For those not in the know, Ranked Play is a competitive ecosystem with more restrictions, a tighter map and mode rotation, and more rewards than regular, non-ranked multiplayer playlists. Players relish the opportunity to dive into Ranked Play as it allows them to unlock exclusive operator skins, calling cards, and more.</p>



<p>It’s also a breeding ground for cheaters, for some reason. Typically, the highest echelons of the Ranked Play leaderboard are reserved exclusively for cheaters, who year in, year out fly under the radar of Team RICOCHET’s anti-cheat mechanics.</p>



<p>It’s getting better, but it’s <strong>far </strong>from being perfect.</p>



<p>Chris ‘Parasite’ Duarte, one of Call of Duty’s first world champions, posted on Twitter:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>HACKERS HACKERS HACKERS HACKERS HACKERS HACKERS</strong> EVERY GAME WHERE IS THE ANTI CHEAT TREYARCH</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Last season’s CDL world champion, Dashy, posted a video of him slamming teams full of cheaters in Ranked Play, and Simp, one of the best Call of Duty players in the world, was sharing comments on Twitter about the trademarks of BO6 cheaters.</p>



<p>It seems like Ranked Play in Black Ops 6 is already cooked, and it’s another year back-to-back that cheaters have completely ruined the mode.</p>

Brave the arena alone or team up in matches of up to eight players.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong>Weapons Live, Lights Out</strong> – <em>Blindfire</em> is an online multiplayer first-person shooter. Set in a shadowy underworld, the ultra-wealthy bet on illicit bloodsports beneath a neon skyline. For contestants lured by the promise of untold riches and unimaginable glory, it’s kill or be killed.</li><li><strong>Every Kill Counts</strong> – Brave the arena alone or team up in matches of up to eight players. In Bodycount mode, score the most points over five rapid-fire rounds. Be the last person standing when the lights come on and earn your place in the winner’s showcase.</li><li><strong>Danger Lurks in the Dark</strong> – Light is a rarity in close-quarter arenas riddled with traps for intense firefights. Players must decide where and when to fire at the risk of exposing their position. Hone your senses with the room-scanning Echo mechanic to help you navigate the arena and locate your opponents.</li><li><strong>Revenge Under the Blacklights</strong> – When defeated, spectators gain access to the arena’s cutting-edge night vision cameras. Blacklight reveals the vibrant hues of hidden street art and transforms the slick designs of contestants’ outfits. The eliminated spectators can assume control of traps in the arena to influence the outcome of the match and exact revenge.</li><li><strong>Light Them Up</strong> – The pitch-black battlefields of <em>Blindfire</em> turn the first-person shooter genre on its head. Stalk the shadows as the tension builds, then run for cover as the shots start flying in a volley of muzzle flashes. Think you’ve got what it takes to eliminate the competition in <em>Blindfire</em>? Then grab your weapon and LIGHT THEM UP.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>PlayStation 5 Early Access Launch Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="BLINDFIRE - PlayStation Release Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kNgKTcssaR4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While no one associated with the episode explicitly tells us what happens that makes it so bloody, the descriptions we have gotten may be enough to give us a hint. Executive producer Dave Wilson says, “Pac-Man is Joe Pesci and the swordsman is Guy Pearce in <em>Memento.” </em>Seeing how Pesci almost exclusively plays homicidal hotheads, and Guy Pearce strangles a man to death in <em>Memento</em>, the 10-minute <em>Pac-Man</em> episode may just live up to its bloody hype if that comparison holds true. </p><p>As surprised as you may feel about a violent <em>Pac-Man</em> story, the people behind it point out how the original game isn’t all that innocent. JT Petty, teleplay writer of the <em>Pac-Man</em> episode, describes the game as essentially “eating pills in a labyrinth while you’re being chased by ghosts,” in a world where the ghosts’ eyes return to the center of the game to regenerate and repeat the destructive cycle. </p><p>When you look at <em>Pac-Man</em> that way, you can see how there could be a darker side to it; a darker side we’ll have our still-attached-to-our-heads eyes glued to when the episode releases in December.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-players-have-made-their-own-battle-format-that-bans-ex-monsters<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Don't bring an EX to a NOEX fight.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokemon TCG Pocket continues to be ridiculously popular, but in the early days of the game there are only a limited number of ways to engage with other players. Trading still hasn't been released yet, and battling only has one regular format that lets you start a match with a friend, or a random player. So in order to spice things up, the community is coming up with its own workarounds, including a brand new battle format that's been very well-received so far: NOEX.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"NOEX" is a battle format with one simple rule: no EX Pokemon allowed. EX Pokemon, if you're unfamiliar, are ultra-powerful monsters that are very difficult to defeat, but which award two points upon destruction as opposed to just one. Due to their sheer power, most good meta decks in Pocket are built around at least one EX card, and the end result is that you tend to run into a lot of the same decks over and over when you engage in random battles. For the last month or so, for instance, I've been playing a deck that revolves around Pikachu EX, and have been fighting a lot of Mewtwo EX, Charizard EX, and Starmie EX.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But in NOEX, all those cards are banned, which forces players to build decks around other Pokemon for some interesting combos. For this article, I engaged in a couple of NOEX battles myself. In one match I faced a Butterfree/Dugtrio stall deck that I'd never seen before that decimated my army of Nidoran, and in another I barely scraped out a win against a wacky Dragonite/Weezing combo thanks to a lucky final draw. It's a fun format if you want to shake things up a bit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, NOEX exists on an honor system. There's no way to officially create your own battle formats in Pocket just yet, so players have created this by word-of-mouth. If you want to join a NOEX battle, simply select "Private Match" under battles, and use "NOEX" as the password. But you're essentially on your honor to use a deck with no EX Pokemon, as there's nothing in the system to stop you. Some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gvrqsl/ah_yeah_thats_the_kind_of_opener_you_want_to_see/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">players are already complaining about opponents bringing EX Pokemon to a NOEX fight</a> and ruining their fun - an unfortunate hazard of a community-created format.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/20/screenshot-2024-11-20-143838-1732135159067.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: /u/Boomerhands420 on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gvryhu/noex_format_is_insanely_fun/">Reddit</a>.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, it sounds like NOEX is otherwise going pretty well. Community members are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gvryhu/noex_format_is_insanely_fun/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">praising it on Reddit</a>, and while my personal experience is limited, the speed with which I was able to get into matches with others who were respecting the format indicates this might have legs. It also sounds like some players are suggesting other types of formats that can be done in the same way, such as only allowing a single EX card per deck, or no decks considered by the community to be "S-tier."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hopefully, it won't be long before we start to see new features creep in that will hopefully eliminate the need for the community to invent stuff to do. We've already learned that there's a "<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-is-getting-more-booster-packs-before-2025">major update</a>" coming in the near future that will include trading, and new booster packs on the way will hopefully spice up the meta a bit as well. Given how <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-estimated-to-have-made-120-million-in-3-weeks">wildly popular TCG Pocket is</a>, the updates can't come fast enough.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

At this point, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/vampire-survivors" rel="nofollow"><em>Vampire Survivors</em></a> hasn’t just made its mark on the world, it’s still a primary point of the gaming culture space, not just unfettered by new releases, but also a point of influence for many a copycat to “improve” the formula. Everything always needs X to improve on, it needs X to provide Y, in the palatable form of Z! <em>Vampire Hunters</em>, if anything else, is one of many such cases.</p>

<p>This is the latest game from Brazilian developers Gamecraft Studios, a team that also dabbles in assisting development with other devs and games, like 2023’s <em>BIT.TRIP ReRunner</em>. <em>Vampire Hunters</em> has toured the circuit as an Early Access title for some time before kicking into gear with a 1.0 release at the end of October. The result is ideas on top of ideas.</p>

<p>It’s a first-person shooter, relying on some boomer shooter-esque inclinations, while never fully going all the way. You’re in an arena, almost perfectly equipped for some old-school, 90s <em>Unreal Tournament</em> action, and set spawn points will release an endless barrage of increasingly difficult monsters to defeat within an allotted time. As time goes on, you’ll also completely fill your screen with up to 12 weapons, each of which is an extension of your God-given power to completely decimate the battlefield.</p>



<p>The structure is more encroaching than your usual <em>Survivors</em>-type shenanigans. The maps are very tight, both in their designs, and their chokepoints, with it teaching you these basic facets almost immediately. Not only that, but every map has different objectives in order to “complete” the map, whether it’s closing off spawn points, collecting items, or destroying bigger bosses and their minions.</p>

<p>“Tight” is probably the only way one can describe it. Tunnel vision is an almost inevitable effect of the game, especially as the screen fills with monsters, bullets, effects, triggers, health bars, warning icons, damage indicators, and so much more. As a result, the game relays more of its influence from <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/serious-sam-4" rel="nofollow"><em>Serious Sam</em></a> – where walking back and never letting go of the fire button is a primary function of its core gameplay loop – and as such, calling it a “boomer shooter” seems almost counter-intuitive to what a boomer shooter actually is.</p>

<p>That isn’t to say <em>Vampire Hunters</em> or indeed, even <em>Serious Sam</em>, fail to exhibit certain qualities of the memetic genre, but in <em>Vampire Hunters</em>’ case, the pacing is there, yet the speed isn’t. You can make the body count rise to the thousands in low-polygon gibbing glory, but it’s never to the same tune of progression. Progression is defined by time here, not by how you execute it, so many cases of victory will be made by playing the game like <em>Snake</em>.</p>



<p>This isn’t new for <em>Vampire Survivors</em> and their ilk however, the constant backpedaling and kiting, so <em>Vampire Hunters</em> rides or dies on how it executes it all at a peak. The result is a mixed bag, where on the one hand, it excels in the chaos, the invigorating colorful steam of bullets, bombs, and bodies being presented wonderfully. On the other hand, the feedback of certain items, and the conveying of information in regards to progression, is obfuscated for no other reason than to seemingly imply complexity that isn’t there.</p>

<p>It’s all so singular in its craft, less about creating a zone for which death is certainly instantaneous for any monster that dares to breach the 12ft gap between you and the enemy. Instead, you’re constantly proactive, removing the privilege of going AFK in favor of making you feel more in control with the damage you deal. As a game following the <em>Survivors</em>-like formula, it easily does the most to make every action an opportunistic one, as you watch damage counters rise, and the timer tick by.</p>

<p>This is best accentuated by its “Classic Mode”, a more innately basic iteration of its FPS gameplay that removes the crafted arenas in favor of a long, seemingly endless hallway. It’s a firing range on an escalator, one which provides endless runner-esque mechanics in the form of a damaging mist that will envelop you if you lag too far behind. It relies a lot more on pacing, yet introduces a lot more confusing elements like manual weapon combination and an engineering stat, neither of which are explained adequately at any point.</p>



<p>Regardless of whether you choose Classic mode or not, <em>Vampire Hunters</em> is a numbers game in its most generic sense, one which it manages to elevate with the mechanic of reloading. Whether it’s manually or automatic, even with 12 weapons strapped to your person, the amount of legitimate tactical intervention that spawns from when and where to reload is honestly staggering. Weapons waver between heavy beasts and quick-fire repellent, although you’d be hard-pressed to figure out which is which based on sight.</p>

<p>While it may be a result of how much more zoomed in the action is, <em>Vampire Hunters</em>’ aesthetic and visual design still leaves a lot to be desired. Its crusty nature, and overall inability to truly commit to a direction that isn’t just “low-poly” leaves a lot of the action undefined in the wake of more focused destruction. You can tell what weapons have brought you to your destination in games like <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, <em>Army of Ruin</em>, and <em>Slime 3K</em>, but here, a revolver looks the same as a rifle, which looks the same as a machine gun, which looks the same as a minigun.</p>

<p>It’s strange because while I can certainly class <em>Vampire Hunters</em> as an addictive experience, one that is proactive, consistently engaging, and rewarding – more so than most other <em>Vampire Survivors</em> clones on the market – I struggle to call it an objectively good experience. So much of it is left to interpretation, or an upcoming Steam guide where stuff is answered for you, despite the fact that so much of it is smoke and mirrors. It’s not that there isn’t depth, but the word is merely an excuse for why the game doesn't explain itself.</p>

<h2><em>Vampire Hunters </em>Review | Final Verdict</h2>

<p><em>Vampire Hunters</em> is a video game, a minimal hardline for what an FPS, a game adjacent to <em>Vampire Survivors</em> and its kin, and a game inheriting certain boomer shooter aesthetics should provide. Its quality isn’t necessarily defined by what it does right or wrong, but by how it exemplifies the averages one must attain before being a part of the discussion for what constitutes being a good game. So many moving parts to contribute to a core that is, ultimately, formless.</p>

<p>As it stands, this is an experience. An experience without cause, but not without merit.</p>

            <p>Two theme parks are being planned based on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-minecraft-seeds-java-survival-seeds">Minecraft</a>. Mojang are partnering with Merlin Entertainments to open the destinations, including rides, hotel rooms and shops, in the UK and US in 2026 and 2027. Merlin are the operator of existing theme parks and attractions including Alton Towers, Legoland, Sea Life, and Madame Tussauds.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The Minecraft parks will be opened as part of an existing theme park or as new city centre attractions, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/19/minecraft-theme-park-deal-uk-us-merlin-entertainments">according to The Guardian</a>. Mojang and Merlin also have plans to expand to other countries and territories.
</p>
<p>These attractions won't be the first time Mincraft has crossed in the real world. Earlier this year, Mojang partnered with Supply + Demand to launch <a href="https://www.minecraftexperience.com/">Minecraft Experience: Villager Rescue</a>, an "immersive, interactive Minecraft quest" in Plano, Texas. The partnership with Merlin seems an order of magnitude more ambitious, however.
</p>
<p>Minecraft is shaping up to have a busy few years, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-minecraft-movie-trailer-looks-expensively-naff">a live action movie on the way</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-animated-series-announced-for-netflix">a Netflix animated series. It could also be a big few years for UK theme parks, with </a><a href="https://universalukproject.co.uk/">Universal planning a potential park as well</a>.
</p><p>The biggest news for Minecraft is obviously that we just named it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-rps-100-2024">the best PC game ever</a>. Yes, I will be taking my son to the Minecraft theme park, even if it just turns out to be a shed full of cardboard boxes. I can't resist.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/superstore-3000-review-shoppers-delight<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the far future, we’ll commute on trains full of aliens, fly around in zippy little spaceships, and hang out with robot buddies, but <i>where</i> will we get a haircut or catch a movie? That’s the question at the heart of <a href="https://store.asmodee.com/products/superstore-3000" rel="nofollow"><i>Superstore 3000</i></a>, a new tile-placing game from Space Cowboys. Distributor Asmodee sent along a copy for me to check out, so read on for my thoughts in TechRaptor’s <i>Superstore 3000</i> review!</p>

<h2>The Mall of Tomorrow… Today!</h2>

<p>I grew up in a suburb of Philadelphia, in a little town called King of Prussia. Funny name for a town, but that’s not what made it famous - that honor goes to the King of Prussia Mall, a sprawling complex full of all the staples, from Cinnabon to Hot Topic. Living walking distance from one of the largest malls in America, my friends and I truly lived the mall rat life. So when I got the chance to check out <i>Superstore 3000</i>, I knew they’d have me on theme alone.</p>

<p>But what is the theme of <i>Superstore 3000</i>? In the game, designed by Rodrigo Rego, you and up to three other opponents are vying to create the most attractive mall in the galaxy. To do so, you’ll draft mall store tiles from an automatic store creator, place them onto your play space to create as a growing, sprawling, and potentially spiraling out of control mall.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/superstore-3000-mall-building-taller.jpg?itok=VVYzrva8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/superstore-3000-mall-building-taller.jpg?itok=pC_-T6v9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Build your mall up into the sky to score points, unlock more resources, and give your shoppers what they're looking for.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Gameplay Basics of <i>Superstore 3000</i></h2>

<p>The reason you’ll be drafting and laying down tiles is simple - you want to attract customers to your mall, and you want them to find what they’re looking for a remain satisfied customers. Each turn, you’ll draft one of four different colored tiles which all correspond to a type of store - except for the red tiles, which are entrances that’ll be placed with two little customer tokens.</p>

<p>Those customers know what they want, and they’re coming to get it. If placed within three spaces of the kind of store they’re looking for, you’ll move them to that store and they’ll remain there as a satisfied customer. At the end of the game, these happy shoppers will be the key to your scoring success.</p>

<p>One of the aspects of the game I really like is that you have to juggle money and your stores. The store on the bottom of the automatic dispenser is free, but any store tile above it costs money. You start with a little bit of money, but can also get money instead of taking a store tile. This creates a sense of urgency as you try to figure out exactly what to do that will be most beneficial. This is all complicated by the fact that as soon as you draw a tile, you have to immediately place it on your board.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/superstore-3000-man-wants-clothing.jpg?itok=UAVmsI6E 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/superstore-3000-man-wants-clothing.jpg?itok=yL4yhcM9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The shopper on this tile is looking for a clothing store, as soon as the clothing store tile is placed, he'll move there be counted as satisfied.</figcaption></figure><p>At first, you’ll only be able to build in a vertical line going up, above your main entrance - but you’ll soon be scoring special agendas to let you put parking garages on your first floor (which can be built upon) and even big, audaciously shaped special features like a big, round aquarium, a long bowling alley, a zig-zagging space floating attraction, and more!</p>

<p>This is where the real fun of the game comes in, you’ll find it sometimes difficult to lay the tiles out in a way that makes cohesive sense in your mall… but that’s not the point! We’re in the far-flung future, and in this future the zanier the better!</p>

<p>My only wish from the gameplay was that there was a bit more to these special tiles. I would love tiles that let you break the rules a bit more, and right now these are simply meant to take up space, branch your mall out in fun directions, and look very cool on the board. But it would have been nice to see some effects that changed how we drafted tiles, placed our shoppers, etc.</p>

<h2>Light but Intuitive Competition</h2>

<p>The game isn’t the most cutthroat new game on the market, but it does involve a little bit of friendly competition. You’ll be competing against the other players at the table for the stores as they show up on the automatic store dispenser. But you’ll <i>also</i> be competing for the specialty tiles I mentioned above.</p>

<p>Not only do these tiles open up new avenues for you to build out from your base mall, but they’re also worth valuably points at the end of the game. Because they’re achieved by a specific objective, you may find yourself naturally racing against your opponents to fulfill the pre-requisites to get that special tile.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/superstore-3000-tornado-simulator-attraction.jpg?itok=CZ_7C-_L 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/superstore-3000-tornado-simulator-attraction.jpg?itok=zsODIoyr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Attractions add spice to the game in <em>Superstore 3000</em>, like this tornado simulator attraction!</figcaption></figure><p>That’s why I like this game’s approach to competition - it’s what I would call light, but still intuitive. You don’t need to puzzle out how you can best your opponent, it’ll be quite clear what they’re going for. And it’s up to you to decide if it’s more valuable to try to stop them by drafting tiles they need, or whether you’d be better served worrying about your own board.</p>

<p>This intrinsic push and pull is a hallmark of a lot of lighter-weight games that encourage competition, and you’ll find it put to perfect use here.</p>

<h2>Retro Futurism - Take Me Back!</h2>

<p>Before I get into my final thoughts of the game, I <i>have</i> to talk about the artwork by Ryan Goldsberry, which absolutely exudes a sort of bubbly, over-the-top (and yet somehow still refined) design. This game could have featured snarling aliens and realistic robots, or it could have looked like a kid’s cartoon. But instead, much to my delight, the artist took a retro-futuristic approach.</p>

<p>Think <i>Jetsons </i>here when we talk about the artwork, and as you can see from the photos it’s all a vision of the far future as seen through the lens of a 1960s illustrative style. I love it, I think it perfectly fits a game about a mall in the future, and it helps the game stand out amongst its peers. It’s absolutely an art style I wish would truly have a resurgence, and maybe we will see more hand-drawn, personality-first artwork as the world slides into AI image generation drudgery.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/superstore-3000-shopping-figurines.jpg?itok=xhAiEia5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/superstore-3000-shopping-figurines.jpg?itok=UQ3YZjLo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Everything from the construction to the illustration of the shopper meeples just screams retro-futurism in Superstore 3000</figcaption></figure><h2>Superstore 3000 - Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>As you can maybe tell by now, I’m very high on <i>Superstore 3000</i>. I think the gameplay is fun, light, and evocative. I think the artwork is bold, bright, and full of personality. And even though it’s not the deepest or most complex game in the world, there’s a lot of fun to be had here against your fellow players. I do wish it could support more players, which might be my only real mark against it.</p>

<p>I recently wrote a pretty rough review for another tile laying game, where I felt like everything the game had you doing was a bit predictable. And that the central puzzle of laying the tiles wasn’t very engaging. With <i>Superstore 3000</i>, I couldn’t feel more differently. Here, you’re hoping and praying for that one specific tile, you have a lot more agency over what you’re picking, and you need to balance spending money with getting tiles that could be useful.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a fun but light gaming experience with friends, and you like tile-placing games where you have to think on your feet to score points and achieve goals, <i>Superstore 3000</i> is definitely for you.</p>

Separate product from Deckard’s “Roy” controller(s)," Lynch <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1858925211363553316">tweeted</a>, as spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2024/11/19/24300757/valve-steam-controller-2-roy-deckard-leak">The Verge</a>. "Both are being tooled for a mass production goal in their factories right now. That’s why I know they’re in later stages of productization".
</p>
<p>Deckard is reportedly the codename for a standalone VR headset from Valve. They have made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valves-latest-patent-filing-is-for-a-new-vr-headset">occasional and dull patent filings</a> in recent years that could be for such a headset. The "Roy" controllers are reportedly new motion controls designed for use with the new VR headset.
</p>
<p>In another <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1857153531897131182">tweet</a>, Lynch says that the Roy controllers will "have at least: DPAD, Bumpers, Grip Buttons, Triggers, ABXY, system button, and some sort of strap".
</p>
<p>"I am confident in this info based on datamining AND sources who wished not to be named," Lynch writes.
</p>
<p>None of this is hard proof that any of this is actually happening. Valve have not announced any new hardware, other than last week's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-limited-edition-steam-deck-oled-comes-in-white-and-will-be-available-globally-this-time">limited edition white Steam Deck</a>. 
</p>
<p>It's possible I'm just posting this because I want it to be true. I've been using a Valve Index for four years and I've started to long for something with higher resolution screens. I can't bring myself to buy a Meta product, however, so I'm really hoping Valve eventually deliver.
</p>
<p>A Steam Controller 2 is less immediately appealing, but I'd still be curious to see Valve take another swing at any of their past hardware.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The telecommunications tycoon is a majority shareholder in one of France’s largest internet providers, Iliad SA. He’s worth and estimated $10 billion and he was apparently biding his time. </p><p>Last week on November 15, six months after JimmyBLLT sent their original tweet, Niel appeared at the Lidl on rue Sainte in Marseille. “I’m waiting for you,” he wrote in a quote-tweet of the original post. JimmyBLLT apologized but it was too late. Words have consequences, even on X. “Where are you? Come on!

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-need-to-learn-to-play-jrpgs-normally.1041183/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/metaphor-jrpg-completionism<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> is a perfectly reasonable JRPG with a <a href="https://aftermath.site/video-games-perfect-length" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">correct length</a>. Unlike its spiritual predecessor <em>Persona 5</em>, which <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/15221" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overstays its welcome</a> by about 20 hours, <em>Metaphor</em> wraps up in <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/129956" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">65-70 for the main story</a> — long by the standards of games generally but right in the sweet spot for sprawling JRPGs. But I can’t just “finish” a JRPG; I am a prisoner to these games, I have been since childhood. So my final playtime was well over 100 hours, pointlessly grinding and optimizing. I need to learn to stop.</p><p>What I am describing is primarily a “me” problem, although you may share it. To both my detriment and benefit, I cannot live an unoptimized life when the optimized one is clearly and directly in my line of sight. Sometimes this compulsion bears fruit and I come out of a fugue state having learned the best multi-ply Japanese cookware set. Other times I get caught in a gameplay sinkhole and cannot do anything until I beat a game, truly beat it, totally and completely.</p><p>JRPGs bring out this behavior in me more than any other subgenre. They are often meant to be a grand investment of your time, something you slowly whittle away at for a few hours every night after work, or consume uninterrupted in your teen years like a seagull swallowing a large fish in one gulp. These games are replete with secrets, often not signposted clearly, and god help you if you miss them and you have to reload an old save. Older JRPGs, particularly the ancient and unreasonable ones, can instill a sense of paranoia in you. This is particularly felt if you have ever saved yourself into a corner before an unreasonably strong boss with little or no way to improve your position.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Some fights in JRPGs and tactical RPGs punish you if you don't over-prepare. If you know you know. Credit: SquareEnix/<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzCGAgmc9ns" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jasonsgroovemachine</a></figcaption></figure><p>In a classic JRPG&nbsp; there are almost always one to four grueling super bosses whose difficulty will far outstrip the main boss. There are hidden items and ultimate weapons, often with elaborate quests, that may or may not be useful by the end of the game. Modern Ubisoft-coded open world games attempt to ape this mystique superficially, but they always feel like Potemkin objectives — a marker for a marker’s sake, a quest for a quest’s sake. (Ironically, I felt this false accomplishment strongest this year in <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>).</p><p>This is partially why playing the <em>Persona </em>games have been torture for me since <em>Persona 3</em>. The calendared <a href="https://aftermath.site/persona-tokimeki-memorial-coming-of-age" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">schooldays</a> with their various events and quizzes invite a specific, optimized route with little room for deviation. I cannot help but be tied to a guide while playing those games, it is in my nature and the game’s. This rigorous structure sucks the joy away and turns the entire thing into homework for me. To <em>Metaphor’s </em>immense credit, the developers have pulled the guts out of that series and retooled it so that you can easily maximize your social links <a href="https://aftermath.site/metaphor-refantazio-guides-travellers-voices-gallica" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">without ever looking at a guide</a>.The sheer mercy in that act alone, along with the fact that they don’t do anything terribly tone deaf or egregious, makes it a radical improvement over that team’s previous outings. Maybe it is a recognition that such a brutally narrow schedule was unnecessary in 2024, or maybe the designers realized they were getting too old for this too.</p><p>And yet, despite that, I still spent 146 hours according to Steam (some of this was screen idling or involved reloading old saves to maximize the final days) pummeling this game into the pavement, grinding well beyond the threshold of being able to beat the secret dragon bosses handily. <em>Metaphor </em>makes it simple to grind enemies below your pay grade — small fry enemies can be easily wiped out in the dungeon without having to engage in combat, which makes the entire loop feel like you’re playing a game in an emulator with frameskip on. It also makes the question of money trivial by making the Merchant Archetype a money printer – simply grinding weak foes in dungeons trivializes any financial woes. But <em>Metaphor</em> also has a deep job class system — a succulent time sink for each and every one of your characters.</p><figure><figcaption>If you are old like me you remember that they occasionally would sell PC games in Trapezoids. </figcaption></figure><p>I remember a summer in middle school playing <em>Final Fantasy VII </em>for the second time. The first time had been on PlayStation, a rental from Blockbuster Video that I had returned many weeks late and stopped right before the last boss on the third disk. The second was on PC, in my bedroom with crisp, Voodoo 2 accelerated graphics. I had the family’s hand-me-down TV going in the background with DVDs on a loop (a TV and a computer in your room was an extravagance at the time). I did not see the end of <em>FFVII</em> until each and every character was at level 99. By the time I had completed it, I had forgotten why I was doing it except that I had chosen to do it. I got no reward from it, no special ending with all the characters telling me what a good job I did. I don’t think I felt more satisfied having done it. The light of that game had long gone away, and nothing had remained except the impulse to see the number go up until it couldn’t any more.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Final Fantasy Tactics How To Learn Ultima (Limberry Castle Gate)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kF7AijdBwRc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>The easiest way to learn Ultima in Final Fantasy Tactics is to have Ramza be attacked by the assassins at Limberry Castle Gate while he is a squire. It isn't a particularly good skill and I never used it after I got it. </figcaption></figure></div><p>I remember doing lesser versions of this countless times. <em>Final Fantasy Tactics Advance</em> for the GBA consumed a summer. <em>Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King </em>consumed a semester. <em>Disgaea </em>felt like it was designed in a lab specifically to fuck with me. Recently I replayed the original <em>Final Fantasy Tactics </em>on my MiSTer and power leveled my jobs far beyond what was required, going out of my way to save scum Limberry Castle Gate until Ramza learned Ultima despite Ultima not being that good a spell. I have had never touched <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> because I have lived the MMO lifestyle and I know precisely how badly it would fuck my life up.&nbsp;</p><p>This is also why I have such a deep respect for shorter JRPGs like <em>Chrono Trigger</em>, <em>Live-A-Live</em> and <em>SaGa Frontier </em>– games that are either so brief that they can’t trap you in a grinding loop or introduce multiple characters and storylines to interrupt the temptation of linear progression to level 99. One of the strongest choices a game can make is to decouple or mess with the attachment players have towards their digital selves, <em>Nier Automata </em>being the best example. We are all going to die one day, some of us sooner than others. Trite though it is to say, it’s true that the journey is the important part, and most of us will never return to these over-optimized selves. Maybe we should let go and delete our save files, dumping those personas into the ocean. I don’t want to say that the completionist path is time wasted, I can only speak for myself, but I can think of several uses for my time that would have made me feel more fulfilled.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="LIVE A LIVE - Launch Trailer - Nintendo Switch" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G0oOta9Lfts?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Games like <em>Live A Live</em> and <em>SaGa Frontier</em> prevent you from falling into this trap by being shorter games with multiple, selectable characters that can be played in any order. The former is my favorite retro remake of all time.</figcaption></figure></div><p><em>Metaphor </em>is ultimately a far more reasonable game than the ones that I let suck me in before. And as I approached the end, after I had beaten the super bosses, I did loosen up a little bit. I did not maximize all my Archetypes, although I did spend some time seeing how hard I could hit the last boss by throwing money at him. I am older, I am thinking about having children, and I do not have the kind of time that I used to have. I am learning to take things easy, to be a little less optimized and at a lower level. One day I will figure out how to play these games normally, though I guess that what I’m describing is far more common an affliction than any of us would like to admit.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-wont-be-getting-a-ps5-pro-patch-anytime-soon/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In a short and sweet post on X by CD Projekt Red on the official Cyberpunk 2077 X account, they confirmed that there are no plans for a PS5 Pro patch. For many, this comes as a huge disappointment, especially since the game has come such a long way from how it was when it was first released. When Cyberpunk 2077 was first released, the game was incredibly buggy and wasn't performing the way many had expected from CD Projekt Red. After all, this is a company that made award-winning games like The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. However, since that time, the game has improved significantly, with a smoother performance, stunning graphics, and a great story for many to get lost in.</p>
<p>With the release of the PS5 Pro, many huge titles on PlayStation have been confirmed to be getting a PS5 Pro patch, which will enhance the game to work with the new hardware within the PS5 Pro to provide frame rate boosts and better-looking graphics. To celebrate the PS5 Pro, Sony has proudly announced that there are at least 40 or 50 games that will get the PS5 Pro patch on launch. However, there has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-has-double-the-amount-of-enhanced-games-than-ps4-pro-at-launch/">an updated list</a> since then that confirms over 80 games will be getting the PS5 Pro patch when the console launches or when the game is set to release.</p>
<p>CD Projekt Red confirmed that there will be no PS5 patch anytime soon after a user named <a href="https://x.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1859151714747552122" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NextGenNero reached out on X</a> to ask whether it will be getting one. They stated, "We currently have no plans for the PS5 Pro patch," which led to a lot of fans of the game being disappointed by the news.</p>
<p>While Cyberpunk 2077 has no plans for getting a PS5 Pro patch, games such as Silent Hill 2, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, and Alan Wake 2 have been confirmed to get patches to supposedly enhance the game on the new expensive version of the PlayStation 5. However, these games, in particular, have had mixed results, as confirmed by tests by Digital Foundry. That being said, they have tested some other top games on the PS5 Pro and given the new patches a whirl, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-ps5-pro-hands-on-preview-is-it-worth-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some games have performed as expected</a>, providing improved frame rates and better graphics.</p>
<p>Whether CD Projekt Red is just waiting it out and plans to do a PS5 Pro patch once audiences have had a chance to experiment with games that are enhanced for the Pro, or they just don't plan to do a patch at all remains to be seen.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-group-announces-res-arcana-duo-two-player-board-game-spin-off<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-financials-q2-2024" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Asmodee Group</a> is releasing <em>Res Arcana Duo</em> at the end of the week. The global tabletop publisher known for producing many beloved titles like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fantasy-flight-games-announces-marvel-champions-next-evolution" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Marvel Champions</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/river-of-gold-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>River of Gold</em></a> has announced a unique spin-off of Sand Castle Games' competitive board game series, one designed for two players.</p>

<h2>The <em>Res Arcana Duo</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>According to the store page listing, <em>Res Arcana Duo</em> is a standalone installment in the <em>Res Arcana</em> series. Like the main series, players take on the roles of powerful magicians caught in an elaborate game of mystic supremacy. A visual trademark of the series is the detailed artwork provided by Julien Delval.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/res-arcana-duo-board-set-up.jpg?itok=dPuX4Fa1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/res-arcana-duo-board-set-up.jpg?itok=r9HzZtpP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As the name implies, a game of <em>Res Arcana Duo</em> is framed as a wizard's duel. Each player chooses a Mage (Druid, Alchemist, Necromancer, etc.) and gets a deck of unique artifact cards. Using these artifacts helps you claim Monuments and Places of Power, providing resources that fuel the art of magic. Make your moves wisely and you can conquer your enemies.</p>

<p><em>Res Arcana Duo</em> contains a new set of game pieces, cards, and mechanics. These include a new set of Mages, Artifacts, Monuments, and Places of Power designed for the spin-off's one-on-one format.</p>

<p>If you own the base game of <em>Res Arcana</em>, <em>Res Arcana Duo</em> can function as an expansion. In addition, the <em>Lux et Tenebrae</em> and <em>Perlae Imperil </em>expansions can be used with the game to provide a more robust tabletop experience.</p>

<p>A copy of the game contains the following:</p>

<ul><li>4 New Mage Cards</li>
	<li>16 Artifact Cards</li>
	<li>7 Monument Cards</li>
	<li>2 Double-Sided Place of Power Tiles</li>
	<li>5 Magic Item Tiles</li>
	<li>1 Starting Player Tile</li>
	<li>5 x5 Essence Chips</li>
	<li>60 Essence Tokens</li>
	<li>1 Storing/Sorting Tray</li>
	<li>1 Rule Booklet</li>
</ul><p><em>Res Arcana Duo</em> is available right now for pre-order at an MSRP of $24.99. The game will ship to players on November 22, 2024.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> is making changes to how it handles mods in order to address server stability issues. Come the next big update in December, mods "will be prohibited from public online sessions," according to an update from the game director.

<p>"We wanted to make a game that was moddable from the start (this is why our game pack files are not encrypted, for example). It's always a pleasure for me, as a developer, to see what our community can create. Mods are great, and they will no doubt contribute to this game's longevity," writes Dmitriy Grigorenko <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/114-mod-support-a-message-from-the-game-director">on the Focus Home Interactive forums</a> (also shared <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/6681747476222836957">on Steam</a>).
</p>
<p>"However, we as developers must also ensure game stability and continuously work towards a smoother experience for all players. Our data shows that a non-negligible amount of recent server stability issues are related to mods, and that instability impacts even those users who don’t have mods installed. We have also received user reports that their save files were corrupted after playing alongside players with mods.
</p>
<p>"This is why, starting with our next big update in December, mods will be prohibited from public online sessions. That means that you will no longer be able to enter a public game if you have mods installed."
</p>
<p>The update goes on to explain that mods will "still be allowed in private Operations lobbies". Grigorenko also says they'll release some of their own tools to make it easier for people to make mods.
</p>
<p>I'm not clear on what kind of mods people were taking into public servers, but it's a Warhammer 40,000 game, so naturally <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40000spacemarine2/mods/?BH=2">Nexus Mods</a> has several pages of cosmetic re-paints of your soldiers. It also sounds as if a lot of players are hacking at the UI, blood effects and FOV options.

<p>Brendan had a lot of fun with his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review">Space Marine 2 review</a>, finding it a spectacular jaunt and "pure ambrosia" for 40K fans.
