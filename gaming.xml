            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-set-for-june-5th-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo has revealed the release date and price for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, with the sequel to their hugely popular handheld set to launch on June 5th 2025.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 builds on the familiar design and features of the Nintendo Switch, a hybrid console that can be used handheld, on TV or propped up on a tabletop, but that form has evolved. The screen is larger, the Joy-Con have a new connection style, and there’s some new functionality as well.</p>


<p>The console will cost you £395.99/€470 for the standard edition, or £429.99/€510 bundled with a copy of Mario Kart World. Pre-orders start on the 8th April.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Switch 2 – Overview trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B1-W7ZV0RNw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The screen is now 1080p 7/9″ with up to 120fps with HDR support in compatible games and the buttons and sticks are larger than those found on the original console.&nbsp; The console also has 3D audio which will be supported via headphones, and via the speakers after an update. The storage has been upgraded to 256gb and if you use the docking station, which now includes a fan, games can be played in up to 4K.</p>

<p>The new Game cards are the same shape and size as Switch cards but have faster data transfer speeds, and you can only use MicroSD Express cards for expansions. There’s also a new Pro Controller for those who prefer a more traditional controller.</p>
<p>Game Share is a new feature in which compatible games can be shared with four players for local multiplayer, so only one person needs to own the game.&nbsp; Switch 2 will also get a Nintendo Online expansion pack that gives you a bunch of older games including&nbsp; Wind Waker, SoulCalibur 2, and F-Zero X.</p>
<p>The Joy-Con 2 now features optical sensors, so that they can be used like a computer mouse when propped up on their side, and this has some niche gaming potential. Additionally, there’s a new C-button on the right Joy-Con, which is used for Game Chat which is exactly what you would expect, online chat with up to four other players via the microphone in the console. You can use the feature even if you are playing different games and It also lets you share your screen with other players, although the frame rate is very low. There’s also a new Nintendo Switch 2 camera which you can use to put yourself on screen.</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing GameChat (Nintendo Switch 2)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fiLqwWgejrs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Elsewhere in the Nintendo Direct stream, we got a good look at some of the games that are set to launch for Nintendo Switch 2. These include the long awaited <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-kart-9">Mario Kart 9, aka Mario Kart World</a>. The presentation started with a look at the game with twenty-four of your favourite characters racing about on karts, jetskis,&nbsp; planes, and bikes. Some Switch games will be getting an upgrade to a Switch 2 version, such as Super Mario Party Jamboree Switch 2 Edition, and you will be able to upgrade by purchasing as pack – no free upgrades here.</p>
<p>Also revealed were Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition, Drag x Drive, Hades 2, Street Fighter 6, Deamon x Machina, Split Fiction (launch title), EA Sports FC, Madden NFL, Hogwarts Legacy (launch title),&nbsp; Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4, Hitman: World of Assassination (launch title),&nbsp; James Bond (Project 007), Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster,&nbsp;and Yakuza 0: Directors Cut.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="ELDEN RING is coming to Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EGAaGwQIDoU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Also on the way is&nbsp; Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment,&nbsp; Borderlands 4, Civilisation VII (launch title),&nbsp; WWE 2K, NBA 2K, Survival Kids, Enter the Gungeon 2, Starseeker Astroneer Expedition, Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition, (launch title),&nbsp; Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade, Hollow Knight: Silksong, Goodnight Universe, Two Point Museum, Wilder Hearts S, Witchbrook,&nbsp; Marvel Cosmic Invasion, Star Wars: Outlaws, Fast Fusion, Reanimal, Fortnite,&nbsp; Kirby Air Ride, and an awful lot of games from the East that had very long titles that I couldn’t write down fast enough.</p>
<p>The big reveal was a new game from FromSoftware, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/fromsoftware-announce-the-duskbloods-exclusively-for-nintendo-switch-2/">The Duskbloods</a> that will arrive in 2026 as a Switch 2 exclusive.</p>
<p>The 60 minute presentation featured a bunch of new games and announcements, and many of these will be on show over the coming weeks and days. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/a-nintendo-direct-and-in-person-events-for-switch-2-are-coming-in-april/">Live public events start on Friday 4th April in Paris and New York</a>, before the travelling show heads to other countries and cities around the world through the end of May.&nbsp; One of the games, Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour lets you wander around&nbsp; the inside of the console and explains all the functions.&nbsp; It is packed with mini games that let you explore the console functions.</p>
<p>Nintendo is breaking out the Nintendo Treehouse Live for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> on 3rd and 4th April, bringing gameplay deep dives to the masses following the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct stream taking place tomorrow, on 2nd April.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Treehouse Live broadcasts will start at 3PM UK time – 7AM PT / 10AM ET / 4PM CEST – and you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NintendoAmerica/streams">watch both of them on YouTube</a>. It’s not clear how long they will run for through the day, but as they will be running in tandem with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/a-nintendo-direct-and-in-person-events-for-switch-2-are-coming-in-april/">live hands on events taking place in New York and Paris</a>, we can expect them to run for several hours with numerous different segments.</p>

		<p>Nintendo has revealed the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2 </a>Edition upgrade scheme for original Nintendo Switch games to get enhancements for the Nintendo Switch 2. This is starting with Super Mario Party Jamboree expansion Jamboree TV, and will also bring upgrades for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, Kirby and the Forgotten Lands and more.</p>

<p><iframe title="Super Mario Party Jamboree – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV – Announcement trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y1NyPA3GfPM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>A new mode called Bowser Live will integrate the camera into play. Here your body movements and sound can be used to hit blocks, guide an RC car and more depending on camera use. Mouse controls can then be used on a rollercoaster ride to shoot enemies, to control a spray can, and plenty more.</p>

<p>Other games do not yet have their upgrade dates confirmed, but here’s what we know.</p>
<p>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom are upgraded with better frame rates, higher definition and HDR support. There’s also a new Zelda Notes feature in the Switch Online app, giving you a map and more to quickly glance at. Kirby and the Forgotten Lands is gettting similar treatment, with a new Star-Crossed expansion.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kirby and the Forgotten Land – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World – Reveal trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sYtu69lxTjE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Upcoming games are also having the Switch 2 Edition treatment, though integrated as full cross-gen releases. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond has mouse controls for movement and aiming, while graphics support will allow for 4K at 60fps or 1080p at 120fps visuals. Pokémon Z-A is the last game to be enhanced.</p>
<p>Civ 7 will have mouse controls.</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches in early June worldwide, as many correctly predicted in the past few months.</p>
<p>The next-generation console will officially launch on June 5th, as announced during today's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXUmjX7DsP8">Nintendo Direct</a>. While the system's price wasn't confirmed during the presentation, Nintendo revealed in a press release that the system will retail for $449.99 / €469,99, which is a little higher than the price most predicted.</p>
<p>Besides confirming the Nintendo Switch 2 release date, today's presentation provided additional information on the system. The console will sport a 7.9-inch, 1080p resolution LCD screen complete with 120 FPS and HDR support. The docked experience will also be a marked step up over the previous system, as the new dock will support up to 4K resolution for compatible games, as well as HDR. The dock will have a built-in fan that will keep the system cool in docked mode.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will feature plenty of other improvements over the original system, such as faster and bigger internal storage, 256 GB over the 32 GB offered by the original Switch, two USB-C ports, one on the top and one on the bottom of the system, which will be handy for connecting the newly announced Nintendo Switch 2 camera or for charging the console in tabletop mode.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con 2 and Pro Controller 2 also sport plenty of improvements over their predecessors. The detachable controllers are attached magnetically to the system and feature, as rumored, mouse functionality for both the left and right controllers. The brand-new C button will be used to access a new GameChat feature that brings a flexible chat system to the system that will take advantage not only of the already mentioned Nintendo Switch 2 camera but also of the built-in microphone, allowing Nintendo Switch Online subscribers to use the new chat system without any additional purchase. Until March 31st, 2026, the GameChat system will be available for free for all Switch 2 owners. The Pro Controller 2, on the other hand, now features <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-upgrade-dev-kits/">a headphone jack</a> as well as two additional buttons on the back of the controller which can be programmed.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 audio features have also seen a big improvement over the previous system. Built-in speakers have been greatly improved to offer a much better audio experience, a better experience that will also be provided by 3D audio support.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Direct: Nintendo Switch 2 – 4.2.2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DXUmjX7DsP8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-gamecube-switch-2-online<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has revealed that GameCube games are coming to Nintendo Switch Online as part of the Expansion Pack addon, but only if you've got a Switch 2.</p>

<p>The service, which already allows you to play the likes of SNES, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-boy-and-game-boy-advance-titles-are-finally-coming-to-nintendo-switch-online" rel="nofollow">Game Boy Advance</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/38-nintendo-switch-online-n64-games-are-planned-dataminer-says" rel="nofollow">N64</a> games, will be getting GameCube games on the same day as the Switch 2's launch, which, in case you missed it, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">is June 5th</a>.</p>

<p>Several GameCube games will be available for the service at launch, including&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em>, fighting game&nbsp;<em>SoulCalibur 2&nbsp;</em>(complete with Link's cameo, of course), and racer&nbsp;<em>F-Zero GX</em>. See? Nintendo hasn't completely forgotten the franchise!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-gamecube-switch-2-zelda.jpg?itok=KVRsSoyJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-gamecube-switch-2-zelda.jpg?itok=Bw0E4fx7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>GameCube games, including&nbsp;<em>Zelda: The Wind Waker</em>, are coming to Switch Online for Switch 2.</figcaption></figure><p>GameCube games that support multiplayer will support four players either locally or online, and Nintendo is promising "higher resolution" and clearer image quality than the originals, as well as customizable controls.</p>

<p>Other games being added in the future include the likes of&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Sunshine</em>,&nbsp;<em>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</em>,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness&nbsp;</em>(and <em>Pokemon Colosseum</em>),&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Strikers</em>,&nbsp;<em>Chibi-Robo</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Luigi's Mansion</em>.</p>

<p>Notable by its absence is&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</em>, so hopefully, Nintendo is planning to release an updated version of that game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metroid-prime-remastered-announced-and-available-today" rel="nofollow">along the lines of 2023's&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime Remastered</em></a>. A man can dream, right?</p>

<p>A dedicated GameCube controller designed in the same way as the original peripheral is also being released, and that, too, will be available on the same day as the Switch 2. You'll need to be a Switch Online member if you want to pick it up, though.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5th. Its GameCube lineup, and GameCube controller (if you're a Switch Online member), also launch on the same day.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-announced.1152243/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced the Nintendo Switch 2 release date, and the console is coming in summer, just as many people predicted prior to today's Nintendo Direct show.</p>

<p>As revealed during the presentation, the Switch 2 will be launching on June 5th. That fits with accessory maker <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-release-april-september-nacon" rel="nofollow">Nacon's prediction</a> that the console would launch sometime between April and September (although that wasn't a particularly out-there prediction in the first place).</p>

<p>When it launches, the console will arrive with a 1080p screen, a 4K-supporting dock (for certain games), and 256GB of internal storage, and launch games like&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour&nbsp;</em>will be available alongside the machine.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-welcome-tour.jpg?itok=3ItutcNe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-welcome-tour.jpg?itok=DiBUZ16z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour&nbsp;</em>is one of the launch games that will be available for Switch 2 when it arrives in June.</figcaption></figure><p>As <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-specs-revealed" rel="nofollow">revealed earlier in the show</a>, the Switch 2 will also boast a built-in fan for its dock that allows you to cool the system in TV mode, as well as HDR support for both handheld and TV modes. It'll also support 4K resolution and up to 120fps for certain games.</p>

<p>The console will be able to play both Switch 2 games and original Switch games, although it doesn't look like it'll feature any kind of upscaling for the latter, unfortunately. 4K and 120fps won't be available for Switch 1 games, either, it seems.</p>

<p>Although that may be the case, "some games" that came to Switch will receive "upgraded versions" with improved visuals and more.&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Party Jamboree&nbsp;</em>was the first such game announced during the show.</p>

<p>The Switch 2 version of&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Party Jamboree&nbsp;</em>will "expand on the base game" and add features like mouse controls, audio recognition, "more expressive rumble", and support for the Nintendo Switch 2 Camera peripheral.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch 2 Specs Revealed During Today's Direct]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-specs-revealed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-specs-revealed-during-todays-direct.1152240/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-specs-revealed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo revealed the specs for the Switch 2 during today's Nintendo Direct presentation, and it looks like the machine will bear many improvements over its predecessor.</p>

<p>First, Nintendo <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">unveiled&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em></a>, one of the system's launch titles, and following that, we got to see some of the new features and specifications the console will boast.</p>

<p>The Switch 2 will sport a 7.9-inch screen, but it'll maintain the original Switch's thickness. That screen will display up to 1080p resolution, and the system will support up to 120fps as well, although only "supported titles" will be compatible with that feature.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-direct-specs-handheld.jpg?itok=PZUjEYPG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-direct-specs-handheld.jpg?itok=04jSSREQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Nintendo Switch 2 looks like a pretty beefy machine compared to its predecessor.</figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo is promising "double the pixels" of the original Switch's screen for a sharper image, and the display will also support HDR for sharper contrast between colors. This mode will be supported in both handheld and TV mode.</p>

<p>Docking the Switch 2 allows you to play games in up to 4K resolution, although just like 120fps, only certain games will support this resolution. I'm assuming old-school Switch 1 games won't be compatible, sadly.</p>

<p>As was previously rumored, the Joy-Con 2 controllers will dock magnetically, and they'll also support mouse-style control; both Joy-Cons will be able to take advantage of this feature in "compatible games" (which is fast becoming a refrain, eh?).</p>

<p>The Switch 2 will feature 256GB of storage, and it'll also boast two USB-C ports: one on the bottom and one on the top. It looks like both ports will be able to support either chargers or additional accessories.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-direct-specs-usb-c-ports.jpg?itok=cZYdDS0F 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-direct-specs-usb-c-ports.jpg?itok=65V2iwbq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Switch 2 will boast two USB-C ports.</figcaption></figure><p>The dock will also feature a built-in fan to help your system cool down during more heated gameplay sessions, a feature that the original Switch's dock notably lacked.</p>

<p>During the Switch 2 Direct, we also got a look at the new GameChat feature, which is the purpose for the right Joy-Con 2's C button; it allows you to chat with your friends and access other social features during gaming.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 Camera, an extra peripheral that lets you video chat with your friends, was also revealed. It'll launch on the same day as the Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/634632/mario-kart-nintendo-switch-2-trailer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>We knew a <em>Mario Kart </em>game was coming to the Switch 2, and now Nintendo has finally shared some real details in its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXUmjX7DsP8">latest Nintendo Direct</a>. It’s called <em>Mario Kart World</em>, and it will be a day-one Switch 2 exclusive when the console launches on June 5th. <em>Mario Kart World</em> features an open-world mode, in-game atmospheric effects that depend on “the time of day and weather conditions,” and up to 24 drivers per race. After the Direct, Nintendo announced a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634603/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-details">$499.99 launch day Switch 2 bundle</a> that includes a download code for <em>Mario Kart World</em>. The company plans to share more about the game in a Nintendo Direct scheduled for April 17th at 6AM PT / 9AM ET.</p><p><em>Mario Kart World</em>’s open-world mode is called “Free Roam,” and it’ll sound familiar to <em>Forza Horizon </em>5 players, letting users drive on or off-road around the world, “take scenic drives with friends, and take photos together at different locations.” There’s also a “Knock-out Tour” mode that lets you do a cross-country <em>Cannonball Run</em>-style checkpoint race.</p><p>Nintendo showed off some new gameplay mechanics, like abilities to grind on rails and power lines or wall jump, as well as new vehicles like boats and snowmobiles. Other shots showed what looked like on-the-fly character customization. Characters that appeared in the trailer included standards like Mario and Wario, as well as new ones to the mainline series like the cow from Moo Moo Meadows in <em>Mario Kart 64.</em></p><p><em>Mario Kart</em> was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24337198/switch-2-mario-kart-nintendo">the one new game teased</a> during <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">the initial Switch 2 reveal event in January</a>. And it makes a lot of sense as a debut title for the platform, as the kart racing series has arguably become Nintendo’s most popular franchise. <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/1/23941695/mario-kart-8-deluxe-wave-6-dlc-tracks-release-date-characters">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a></em> is the bestselling Switch game to date, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/15/5714102/mario-kart-8-review">its predecessor</a> holds the same title for the Wii U. Meanwhile, <em>Mario Kart 7</em> was the top-selling 3DS game, <em>Mario Kart Wii</em> was second only to <em>Wii Sports</em> on that platform, and <em>Mario Kart DS</em> sat just behind <em>Nintendogs</em> to claim third place on the handheld.</p><p>Today’s reveal was part of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24236766/nintendo-switch-2-games-direct-date-time">a Nintendo Direct event</a> aimed at sharing more hard details about both the Switch 2 and its initial lineup of games.</p><p><em>Developing…</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Switch 2 will be available on June 5th, priced starting at $449.99. A separate bundle with the new <em>Mario Kart World</em> game will also be available for $499.99.</p><p>The Switch 2 be available for preorder in North America from select retailers on April 9th. The console will come bundled with Joy-Con 2 controllers, the Switch 2 dock, a HDMI cable, a USB-C charging cable, and Switch 2 AC adapter.</p><p>Nintendo has also revealed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/630264/nintendo-switch-2-specs-details-performance">more hardware details about the Switch 2</a> today during its dedicated stream.

Nintendo is also upgrading the Switch’s best <em>Zelda </em>games with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641365/nintendo-zelda-botw-totk-switch-2-edition-announced">Switch 2 Editions</a>.</p></div><div><p>Its predecessor, the original Switch, has been a defining success for Nintendo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/1/14772530/nintendo-switch-review-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">since its launch in 2017</a>. The console has sold more than 150 million units to date, putting it within spitting distance of platforms like the Nintendo DS (155 million) and PlayStation 2 (160 million). For that reason, the last few months have still seen a number of notable releases for the original Switch, including <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24253919/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-nintendo-switch">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/629964/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-review-nintendo-switch">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a></em>.

The LCD screen has a 1080p resolution and supports HDR and up to a 120fps refresh rate. The Joy-Con controllers are bigger, too, and as hinted at, they can be used similarly to a mouse. (Though a footnote says that mouse mode will only work with compatible games.) And they stay connected to the Switch 2 via magnets.</p><p>It has 256GB of internal storage, up from 32GB on the first Switch. As shown in the Switch 2’s initial reveal trailer, it also has two USB-C ports for connecting accessories and for charging. When using the dock, you can play games at up to 4K resolution at 60fps. The dock also has a fan to keep the system cool.</p><p>The new “C” button can also be used to activate a chat menu that lets you access controls like muting your voice during the Discord-like “GameChat” calls. To help users better understand the features of the Switch 2, Nintendo will also release a <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em> paid digital game that will be available on launch day.</p><p>The game cards for the Switch 2 will be red, a change from the black cards for the original Switch. The system also supports microSD Express cards, but original microSD cards for the Switch are not compatible.</p><p>There’s a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637833/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-details">new Pro Controller, too</a>, which has new rear buttons, a headphone jack, and the C button.</p><p>Nintendo will also let players share compatible games locally with a new feature called GameShare.</p><p>Nintendo officially revealed the Nintendo Switch 2 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">in a brief video in January</a>. In the video, arguably the only “spec” that Nintendo stated was that the console would be backward-compatible with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24343666/nintendo-switch-2-cartridge-backwards-compatibility">original Switch carts</a>. But, from the video, it was apparent that the Switch 2 was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24345191/nintendo-switch-2-bigger-screen">a bigger device</a> with an extra port on top of the console. You could also see that it had a new way to connect to Joy-Con controllers; instead of sliding on and off, they snapped to the sides. That video also showed that the controllers could slide around a surface, similar to the way a mouse does, and snap into accessories.</p><p>In the initial Switch 2 announcement, Nintendo also revealed that the dock had a more rounded shape than the one included with the first Switch.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The hyped Nintendo Switch 2 event revealed that GameCube games are coming to the Nintendo Switch Online service. This includes a ton of classic franchises, including Mario, Pokémon, Luigi’s Mansion, and much more.</p>



<p>Amongst the Switch 2 details, including its release date, price, new first-party games, and features, we also learned that Nintendo Switch Online is adding a ton of retro games to the already stellar library. </p>



<p>Nintendo has slowly cultivated a library of antique titles from NES and SNES games to big-time eras such as the Mega Drive and Nintendo 64. Now, it’s the turn of the GameCube to come to Nintendo Switch Online.</p>

<p>It has been revealed in a press release that Gamescom – the biggest gaming expo in the world – will remain in Cologne going forward, thanks to a new cooperative contract backed by the state of North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany. Cologne has been the home of Gamescom since 2009, and in that time, it has grown to become something utterly monumental.</p>



<p>In a statement, the team at Koelnmesse said that the partnership between all involved parties has ‘proven to be a success story year after year.’</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-not-going-anywhere">Not Going Anywhere</h2>



<p>With 15 years in the books in Cologne, it comes as no surprise to learn that Gamescom isn’t going anywhere for the foreseeable future. Last year, the event in Germany captured the attention of 335,000 visitors, including <strong>Insider Gaming</strong>‘s team. This year, we’re back – and we’ll be there in force with a full-team representation, so keep an eye open!</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.gamescom.global/en/gamescom-remains-as-the-worldwide-largest-games-event-in-cologne-and-will-be-further-expanded" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the statement</a> released by the Koelnmesse team, it was explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Cologne and Gamescom are the perfect match – a partnership that has proven to be a success story year after year.</p>



<p>Together, we have made Gamescom the world’s largest and most relevant games event while continuously setting new records. The long-term contract extension is an expression of this successful cooperation. </p>



<p>It gives us the opportunity to further expand Gamescom in Cologne together with the satellite events Gamescom Asia and Gamescom LATAM as well as Devcom and Gamescom LAN – and to make it a festival for a wide variety of pop cultures around the world.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The commitment to keep growing Gamescom is a collaboration effort between the Germany Games Industry Association, Koelnmesse, and the City of Cologne. With a new contract being signed, Cologne’s government and the wider state of North Rhine-Westphalia have ‘pledged their support and extended funding measures for the future’.</p>



<p>Cologne’s mayor, Henriette Reker, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Cologne is the home of Gamescom and will remain so. This is good news, because Gamescom is an important economic factor for our city and the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. </p>



<p>It strengthens the local economy through the hundreds of thousands of people who travel to Cologne from all over the world every year, creates jobs and consolidates Cologne’s role as one of Europe’s leading industry locations. But I am sure that Gamescom will also continue to benefit from Cologne as a creative media metropolis.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Gamescom 2025 will take place from August 20 to August 24, with the Opening Night Live ceremony being held on Tuesday, August 19.</p>

<p>Nintendo Switch 2 Direct went live today, finally revealing all the new features of the new console, and the community has been impressed with the GameShare feature.&nbsp;</p>







<p>The developers have arrived with a proper upgrade for co-op gameplay on the new console. The original Switch allowed players to play a game together by passing a JoyCon controller to them. Now, through the new GameShare feature, they can share the entire game with compatible devices locally.</p>



<p>With the help of Nintendo Switch 2’s GameShare feature, players can play games with multiple screens, even if only one person owns a compatible match. Players can temporarily share their games with not only Nintendo Switch 2s but also other Nintendo Switch systems, such as the original console and the lite version.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Players will be able to use Nintendo Switch 2’s GameShare feature with up to three systems at a time. The newly announced GameChat feature will be available alongside GameShare, so players can freely communicate with each other while playing together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The GameShare feature will only be available for compatible games and will arrive via software updates for select titles in the future. The feature is also planned for specific games exclusive to the Nintendo Switch 2.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Nintendo Switch 2 is attempting to streamline the process of connecting with your friends, thanks to the addition of a new C button that launches a chat interface. You'll also get a chance to have actual video chats with your friends, as the Nintendo Switch 2 Camera will launch alongside the console on June 5.</p><p>While we don't have a full specification list for the camera, it's designed to connect to your Switch 2 via a USB-C port. It'll then allow you and your friends to join webchats, negating the need to use the Nintendo Switch Online app on your phone. There also seem to be some in-game features that require the camera, including various mini-games in Mario Party Jamboree.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4469284-switch2camera%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4469284" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4469284-switch2camera%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4469284"></a><figcaption>Nintendo Switch 2 Camera</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4469284-switch2camera%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>You'll need to have a Nintendo Switch Online membership to use GameChat. However, GameChat will have a brief open access period that allows everyone to try the feature for free. When using the camera feed, your screen will split into two sections--a large top portion showing your game and a smaller panel at the bottom showing your group's streams.</p><p>Expect to learn more about the Nintendo Switch 2 Camera in the coming days.

                <p>During today's<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/" data-ref-id="5005-154"> Nintendo Switch 2</a> broadcast, Supergiant Games has confirmed its roguelike sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hades-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-577618">Hades 2</a>, will be coming to the new console. It's unclear whether Hades 2 will be a title available at the launch of the Switch 2, as a release date wasn't provided.</p><p>Speaking at the broadcast, Supergiant's creative director Greg Kasavin confirmed the news that Melinoe and her fellow Greek mythological characters would be arriving on Switch 2.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4469290-nintendodirect_nintendoswitch2%E2%80%934.2.20251-2-2screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4469290" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4469290-nintendodirect_nintendoswitch2%E2%80%934.2.20251-2-2screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4469290"></a><figcaption>Hades 2 is confirmed for the Switch 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4469290-nintendodirect_nintendoswitch2%E2%80%934.2.20251-2-2screenshot.png"></figure><p>Hades 2 entered early access in May 2024, but it's unclear from the announcement whether the game's full release will coincide with the release of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/switch-2-nintendo-direct-april-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6391/" data-ref-id="2900-6391">Switch 2</a>, or if it'll remain in early access. In our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hades-2-review-witching-hours/1900-6418231/" data-ref-id="1900-6418231">Hades 2 review</a>, we said that the sequel is "an ambitious expansion of all the ideas that came before it" thanks to the split-level dungeon crawling experience that sees the contents of Hades 2 almost doubled from its predecessor. There are more boss fights, more collectibles, more achievements, and more mechanics, but that never becomes overwhelming.</p><p>Kasavin ended the short segment promising more news about Hades 2 later in 2025, but whether that includes a date for the game's full release remains to be seen.</p>
