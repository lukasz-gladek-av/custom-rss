            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Good things come to those who wait. In a world of instant gratification, Playdate are doing things differently with their ridiculously charismatic handheld. Some of that wait was unintentional, the team initially caught unawares by the popularity of their new handheld, but some of it was by design, with the console’s key games released weekly, as part of an ungoing season of releases. With Playdate now fully available, and the recent launch of its Season 2 games, it feels like the perfect time to review the canary-coloured console, amidst the stacked 2025 roster of handhelds.</p>
<p><iframe title="Say Hello to Playdate!!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HdF3CnFvxg4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Playdate is a handheld that’s built on classic design briefs, while adding in one almighty kick back against the status quo. On first impressions, it looks like a Game Boy Pocket that’s been squashed and stretched back out in a kitchen accident while rolling out pizza bases. That familiarity is enhanced by its simple face controls – a cross shaped D-pad and two input buttons – and its incredible-looking monochrome screen. There’s a joyful sense of nostalgia that’s hard to ignore, but Panic have made sure that there’s plenty to separate the Playdate from its forefathers.</p>


<p>First, primary, and most obviously is the metal crank. This little analogue crank arm with its yellow handle protrudes from the right-hand side of the console, and it’s there to disrupt, differentiate and innovate, which, let’s face it, is not what we’ve come to expect in the video game console market outside of Nintendo.</p>


<p>It’s there to give developers a new way to control their games, adding things like true fishing mechanics to some, and generally letting devs’ imagination run wild. One of my absolute favourite games from Season One, Crankin’s Time Travel Adventures, sees you turning the crank in an effort to get a stick man to his date on time, and it causes far too much hilarity for a console you can take on the bus.</p>
<p>After the crank, you can’t help but be drawn to the impressively sharp screen. Coming in at just 400×240 and launching without a backlight to illuminate it, this is a screen that manages to be thoroughly retro – if the light is being turned off, it’s time to stop playing unless you want to use a torch – while boasting all the clarity and precision you’d expect from a modern screen.</p>
<p>There’s a single front-firing mono speaker, with a cool little metal grill, and besides the wonderful bleeps and bloops that it delivers to your ears, it goes more than loud enough if you need it to. There’s also a 3.5mm jack socket for a wired pair of headphones, and while there is Bluetooth, it’s not currently usable.</p>

<p>While this is a retro-inspired handheld, the UI and the way your interact with it shows plenty of modernity. A silver lock button at the top edge apes modern smartphones, and a cute little home button brings up the central menu, giving you access to settings and other essential features. There’s 4GB of flash memory for storing games, and you can scroll through them in a simple rotary list, even using the crank to do so if you want. While there’s no Bluetooth support, there is Wi-Fi, and you can access the Playdate Catalog, the online store, or receive over-the-air updates with a suitable connection.</p>
<p>This is also how you’re sent the latest games each season, and one of the greatest delights of the Playdate is the flashing notification light that tells you a new game has arrived. Initially, the console launched with Season 1, which brought players 24 games across 24 weeks. It has to be one of the greatest ideas in console launch history, avoiding the highs and lows of game release schedules, and making each one an event.</p>
<p>From Casual Birder, a weird but wonderful little RPG about taking pictures of birds, to Boogie Loops, a fun diversion that lets you create musical loops while pandas and pizzas have a dance, there’s just a heap of creativity to everything that Panic feeds you, and that’s continued through into the brand new Season 2, which has been smaller in scale, with twelve titles rather than twenty-four, but has proven to be no less fun and characterful.</p>
<p>Chief among them, at least personally, has been <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/04/playdate-season-2-unearths-the-best-game-about-digging-since-minecraft/">Dig Dig Dino</a>. Some of that comes from a deep-seated love for dinosaurs that I share with my son, but this manages to make a fun and continually appealing game out of digging. Ostensibly, it’s like a roguelite with a spade, but there’s just something eternally endearing about the visuals, the mechanics, and how you can dip in and out of it.</p>

<p>I’ve also loved Fulcrum Defender. This shooter has a killer soundtrack, and uses the crank to turn your aiming reticule, attempting to pick off the approaching enemies, while levelling up your abilities, expanding your means of fighting them off with new weaponry or increased ammo. As with many Playdate games, it’s a true pick-up-and-play handheld experience, and you can dip in and out of the idiosyncratic lineup as you wish.</p>
<p>If you want a sense of the random, unexpected and darkly humorous thread that runs through Playdate’s output and outlook, then Blippo is the perfect example. This turns your Playdate into a black and white TV, with an 11-week-long showcase of the weirdest TV you’ll have seen since Channel 4 in the 80s.</p>
<p>There’s sci-fi shows, avant-garde dance programming, teletext-like sections, interviews about… well, I’m not entirely sure what they’re about, but you’ll find yourself frozen in front of your Playdate each week as you watch them. The fact that it’s a finite show – new content has been dropping each Thursday – makes it all the more special, but I truly hope that there’s more. The world in general needs more of this.</p>

<p>What makes Playdate even better is that it’s always waiting for you. Unlike most of the handheld devices I’ve owned in the past couple of years, Playdate holds onto power for up to two weeks, so when you pick it up, it’s ready to go. With eight hours of actual use, that’s a lot of rounds of Fulcrum Defender.</p>
<p>It also fits in your pocket. I laughably tried to put my Switch 2 in my pyjama pocket the other day, and while it didn’t fall out, I looked like I was trying to smuggle a chopping board. The Playdate, meanwhile, has a smaller footprint than most mobile phones, and you never feel that it’s a pain to take out with you, or to chuck it in your bag. Admittedly, frantically spinning the crank does get you a few odd looks on the train, but this is 2025 and, let’s face it, we’re all a little odd.</p>
<p>Playdate is an open platform too, and you can sideload games from places like itch.io, as well as design your own via the SDK and a web browser. Playdate is clearly Panic’s passion project, but they want it to be yours too. I’ve rarely been tempted to create my own game, but for the Playdate, I’m planning out artstyles and thinking out how the crank can be used. Thanks to the unique, retro-like framing, it feels genuinely approachable, while tinkering with Unreal Engine 5 is clearly not.</p>
<p>Are there any downsides? My biggest gripe is the lack of a backlit screen, not least because I often play late into the night, and while it’s briefly amusing to huddle up next to a lamp, or seek out direct sunlight, there is a reason we haven’t returned to the dark times before backlights. Heck, even a Kindle is backlit, so yes, if there was one thing I’d change, that would be it.</p>

<figure><a title="Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7fde7eddc2247/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Level-5</em></figcaption></figure><p>Earlier this month, Level-5 announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fantasy_life_i_the_girl_who_steals_time">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a> would be treated to a Photo Mode in an upcoming July update. Rather unsurprisingly — given that today is the 31st July and all — the dev has revealed that the update has been pushed back to <em>next</em> month, but this is no bad thing, because it looks like it's going to be a big one.</p>
<p>In a new post shared on the <a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/topics/250731/">Fantasy Life website</a>, Level-5 states that it is "currently working to deliver multiple new features in a single update," so ver. 1.5.0 will be much more than a photo op. The dev then goes on to outline some of the upcoming features, revealing that mounts will be getting an overhaul (hello, climbing and double jumps!), a new camera angle will be added, and you'll be able to switch up your party formation on the fly with a new Weird Pad option.</p>
<p>We imagine that there will be more than this added in the next update, but for now, here's a little more detail on the above features that will accompany Photo Mode in ver. 1.5.0.</p>
<h2>Fantasy Life i ver. 1.5.0 (Coming August 2025)</h2>
<h3><strong>Mount Performance Enhancements<br>
Dash speed will be increased, and mounts will be able to perform double jumps and climb cliffs.</strong></h3>
<p>You'll be able to ride mounts at a higher speed, and double jump will also be unlocked.<br>
In addition, a new feature will allow you to climb cliffs while remaining mounted.</p>
<h3><strong>New Camera Feature for Distant View at Base Camp<br>
New craftable objects will also be added.</strong></h3>
<p>The camera's movement range within your base camp will be expanded, allowing you to see farther into the distance.<br>
New craftable objects are also planned to be added.</p>
<h3><strong>Party Formation Management via the Weird Pad<br>
A new option will also allow you to remove players during multiplayer.</strong></h3>
<p>By using the Weird Pad, you'll be able to change your party's formation at any time.<br>
A new planned feature also lets you remove players during multiplayer sessions.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-revenue-up-microsoft-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-revenue-up-following-thousands-of-microsoft-layoffs.1257954/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft has released its fiscal information for the final quarter of 2025, as well as for the year as a whole, and despite thousands of layoffs earlier this month, the company's revenue continues to climb.</p>

<p>Per its Q4 <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2025-q4/press-release-webcast" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">earnings release</a>, Microsoft's revenue grew by 15% for the year overall, and its quarterly revenue jumped by 18% when compared to last year's Q4 earnings. There's pretty much no area in which Microsoft's finances aren't growing.</p>

<p>When it comes to Xbox, Microsoft's gaming wing is doing just fine as well. The Xbox division saw its "content and services revenue" increase by 13% compared to last year's fourth quarter, and, as noted by TweakTown's <a href="https://x.com/DeekeTweak/status/1950666422742393018" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Derek Strickland</a>, Xbox earned a record-breaking $23.45 billion in revenue this fiscal year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-revenue-up-indiana-jones.jpg?itok=d1b5dt1b 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-revenue-up-indiana-jones.jpg?itok=-BMrdYBO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Xbox's revenue was no doubt bolstered by releases like&nbsp;<em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle&nbsp;</em>this fiscal year.</figcaption></figure><p>In an accompanying earnings call, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says that Xbox now has "500 million monthly active users across platforms and devices", and that it is the "top publisher on both Xbox and PlayStation this quarter", although one would hope Xbox is the top publisher on its own hardware, honestly.</p>

<p>Nadella says that revenue from Game Pass reached "nearly $5 billion for the first time", which feels like another slightly strange way to phrase the achievement; "nearly" reaching a figure for the first time doesn't quite feel like the win Nadella seems to think it is.</p>

<p>Still, these figures will be very encouraging for Microsoft, although they won't be anywhere near as encouraging for the nearly-9,000 employees (there's that word again!) who lost their jobs as part of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">massive layoff wave</a> earlier this month.</p>

<p>That layoff wave also saw Xbox subsidiaries like Rare and The Initiative affected; the former's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow"><em>Everwild&nbsp;</em>was canceled</a>, while the latter's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow"><em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>reboot was shuttered</a>, along with the studio as a whole.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/perfect-dark-xbox-the-initiative-revenue.jpg?itok=DvXsbqdn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/perfect-dark-xbox-the-initiative-revenue.jpg?itok=hd0mdPlZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Xbox canceled at least two projects earlier this year and shuttered one of its subsidiary studios.</figcaption></figure><p>Between those layoffs and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-3-percent-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">several</a> earlier <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-layoffs-january-2025" rel="nofollow">rounds</a> of job cuts, it feels particularly galling that Nadella <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs" rel="nofollow">took home an eye-watering payrise</a> back in October, but that's just the hyper-corporate world we live in, I suppose.</p>

<p>Whether or not Microsoft and Xbox continuing to do these kinds of numbers will affect their approach to keeping staff on in the future is unclear, but I suspect the answer is no. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Lots of us are in multiple of these communities as well, participating in or hosting the things on both Steam and itch.io. I’ve seen people in each of these groups react, and give a call to action.”</p><p>There’s good reason lewdtubers feel Steam and itch.io’s censorship issue affects them too, especially given how the two fields so frequently interact. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/podgekinn&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/podgekinn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Podgekinn</a></span>, a goblin lewdtuber and adult voice actor, saw Steam and itch.io’s policy changes as part of a larger pattern. When they spoke with <em>Kotaku</em>, they directly pointed to Fansly’s Terms of Service update from late June, which <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://futurism.com/fansly-outlaws-furry-content&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://futurism.com/fansly-outlaws-furry-content" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">effectively banned furry content</a></span>. At the time, Fansly said its guidelines were changed “to closely comply with our payment processors.”</p><p>“I don’t think VTubers are uniquely at risk, but we do definitely face some additional challenges,” Podgekinn told <em>Kotaku</em>. “For example, many creators using furry or furry-adjacent avatars have now had to re-design their models for adult content on Fansly, as well as delete all of their previous content using those models, or risk being banned.”</p><p>Kira mentioned the “overlap” between lewdtubers and various other fields. For example, some lewdtubers perform voice work for adult video games–Podgekinn included–and their work was hit in the latest payment processor-based censorship wave.</p><p>“I voice for some of the games that have been impacted and it has put a lot of fear and uncertainty into my career both as a voice actor and an 18+ creator,” they said. “The Fansly ban is the same payment processor issue that Steam and Itch are facing, and that pressure is impacting every adult creator to re-assess what we do, and in some cases completely shift gears on our content.”</p><h2 id="h622814"><a id=""></a>For VTubers, a sense of solidarity</h2><figure id="" data-id="04e55a659d4101644a2b45af35df1e1c" data-recommend-id="image://04e55a659d4101644a2b45af35df1e1c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1381" data-height="943" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="YunadereVA with a knife in her mouth." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="YunadereVA with a knife in her mouth." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->YunadereVA</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="04e55a659d4101644a2b45af35df1e1c" data-recommend-id="image://04e55a659d4101644a2b45af35df1e1c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1381" data-height="943" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="YunadereVA with a knife in her mouth." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Many VTubers are internet denizens of yore who are intimately familiar with online censorship. To them, Steam and itch.io are the latest casualties in a very lengthy war. One VTuber we spoke to referenced the Tumblr NSFW ban in a statement to <em>Kotaku</em>. Another lewdtuber, who originally began as an adult voice actor, described MasterCard and Visa as having “really strict and vague guidelines” that creators have had to manage “for years.” That lewdtuber, who asked to remain anonymous, also mentioned the wider issue of VTuber censorship on platforms like Twitch and YouTube, drawing a throughline between payment processor restrictions and ongoing censorship against VTubing as a medium.</p><p>“I think lewdtubers are especially vulnerable because they’re at the intersection of several groups that get treated the most harshly by restrictions online,” that lewdtuber told <em>Kotaku</em>. “VTubers are often censored and treated as inherently sexual on platforms like Twitch and YouTube, even if they don’t make NSFW content, so lewdtubers often get flack from both platforms and fellow VTubers. Payment processors are also quite weird about lewdtuber content and anime porn in general. There’s a lot of weird animosity between lewdtubers and IRL camgirls, too—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1yoRdFoFJaCY-AGfD9W0wQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1yoRdFoFJaCY-AGfD9W0wQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Projekt Melody</a></span> for instance received a lot of negative backlash when she started streaming on Chaturbate and got super popular. Needless to say, it’s pretty rough out here.”</p><p>YouTube and Twitch are notorious for taking punitive action toward VTubers. ASMR VTubers commonly face warnings or strikes for their content on YouTube, even though their material follows the platform expectations. Meanwhile, Twitch bans often provide little context for VTubers to understand why they have been temporarily pulled from streaming. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/YunadereVA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/YunadereVA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yuna</a></span>, an adult voice actor and lewdtuber, stressed that creators across all content forms will increasingly have to ask themselves, “Will what I make be acceptable in the eyes of the platform?”</p><p>“A point that I’d like to see more in posts is that this affects more than just NSFW content,” Yuna told<em> Kotaku</em>. “Thinking ahead in the future, I’m worried that these companies (not just payment processors) will pressure us to conform to their ideals. I don’t want that, nor should you.”</p><figure id="" data-id="69718711afdd94d704110c2845d6e5d5" data-recommend-id="image://69718711afdd94d704110c2845d6e5d5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Podgekinn, a goblin VTuber, next to a mirror." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Podgekinn, a goblin VTuber, next to a mirror." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Podgekinn</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="69718711afdd94d704110c2845d6e5d5" data-recommend-id="image://69718711afdd94d704110c2845d6e5d5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Podgekinn, a goblin VTuber, next to a mirror." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The entire adult VTubing space is under increased pressure at the moment. Yet the feeling in the air among lewdtubers is one of unity and collective activism. Podgekinn encourages VTuber fans to speak with their wallet and get in touch with their local representatives. Yuna suggests others should “let the payment processors know what you think” and discuss online deplatforming “with friends or your platform no matter the size.”</p><p>Payment processor censorship is awful–remote, financial corporations dictating what can and cannot be sold or hosted on independent platforms goes nowhere good. But if consumers rise up and fight on behalf of their favorite content creators, be they game developers, lewdtubers, or something else, then change just might occur.</p><p>“I think for the fans, their power lies in their number,” Kira told <em>Kotkau</em>. “We can challenge the payment processors if we make them know how much of a concern this is for us, through sheer volume of calls asking for change.”</p><p><em>(Disclosure: Podgekinn has provided voice work for Shady Corner Games, a studio forwhich reporter Ana Valens is an affiliate for.

            <p>It's been an interesting year for Capcom, so far. After the successful launch of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> earlier this year, the keystone franchise for the developer appears to have hit a snag, as sales have declined rapidly in the post-launch window. As the game released, it broke records for Capcom as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-is-capcoms-fastest-selling-game-ever">its fastest-selling game ever</a>, and enjoyed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-has-biggest-physical-launch-of-any-ps5-game-in-japan">the biggest physical launch</a> of any game in the series.</p>
<p>Per Capcom's <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2025/1st/explanation_2025_1st_01.pdf">latest financial results</a>, however, it's clear that the initial fervour around the game has died down. In the last quarter, Monster Hunter Wilds sold 477k copies - that's only a bit higher than the 389k copies <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a> managed to shift in the same period. And that game is four years old.</p>

<p>This significant sales falloff is probably due to a couple of factors. Firstly, there has been plenty of criticism of the game for its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-suffering-an-influx-of-overwhelmingly-negative-steam-reviews-can-capcom-turn-around-monster-hunter-wilds-with-the-upcoming-title-update-2">poor optimisation and lack of end-game content</a>. PC players, in particular, have been frustrated by a perceived lack of support for the game on the platform (with some player noting it was literally unplayable for a while due to<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-performance-related-pc-improvements-coming-this-week-says-capcom"> issues with shader compilation and stuttering frame rates)</a>. Though Capcom has consistently been applying patches to the game,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-details-next-monster-hunter-wilds-update-as-steam-reviews-continue-overwhelmingly-negative-plunge"> it's clearly not enough</a> to stem the sales bleed.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>The result? Capcom's share price has dropped significantly in Japan. The company's share price sat at t ¥4,283 at the end of Wednesday, as of this morning's market opening, it was down nearly 10 percent. Perhaps frustratingly for the company, though, it's operating profit was actually up 90.8 percent year-on-year - it's amazing to see what an impact the perceived slump in just the Monster Hunter series can have on the markets. Capcom insists brand health is still strong, going as far as pointing out the strength of legacy series titles:</p>
<p>"Regarding catalog titles, although sales were soft for Monster Hunter Wilds, the latest title in the series released in February this year, Monster Hunter Rise, a previous title in the same series, continued to see sales growth."</p>
<p>Attempts to put Monster Hunter Wilds back on course continue, and just this week Capcom announced a rejig of the game's roadmap to address player concerns<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-revised-roadmap"> and move planned features up the schedule</a>.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Meanwhile, the Devil May Cry series (which hasn't seen a wholly new release since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/devil-may-cry-5-special-edition">Devil May Cry 5 Special Edition</a> in 2020) has proved to be a smash hit for the publisher over the past few months. Per the financials, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/devil-may-cry-5">Devil May Cry 5</a> sold 1.782m units in the last quarter alone (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-anime-boosts-devil-may-cry-5-sales-to-over-10m">bringing total sales of the game to over 10.5m</a>). The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/devil-may-cry-hd-collection">Devil May Cry HD Collection</a> sold 594k in the last quarter, and Devil May Cry 4 Special Edition sold 495k in the same time period. That means overall series sales rose 3m, up to 36m as of June 30, 2025.</p>
<p>Capcom attributes these bumper sales figures to "the series' synergies with the newly released anime series", despite a lot of criticism from fans about the quality of the animated show. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/devil-may-cry-season-1-review">Our reviewer seemed to like it to some degree</a>, although popular consensus would say that it's a bit too juvenile for most tastes (and deviates a fair amount from the source material, to boot).</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the Devil May Cry series has also seen plenty of sales over the past six months, and there was even a Humble Bundle deal (<a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/games/devil-may-cry-devil-trigger-collection">the Devil Trigger Collection</a>) that was live from 16th July through to 31st July that managed to shift 13,182 units, raising £25,285 for charity.</p>
<p>Overall? Despite share price woes in the short term, it's clear Capcom is still in a very healthy place, and - here's hoping - we'll get an announcement about the future of the Devil May Cry series soon. DMC1 remake, anyone?</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/devil-may-cry-5-monster-hunter-wilds-capcom-latest-financial-quarter]]></content:encoded>

That sub-header quote from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hitman_absolution">Hitman: Absolution</a> has made us sad now. Poor Agent 47. It must be lonely being an insane psychopath who spends his time flying around the world, looking cool, getting free clobber, and offing folk in trendy nightclubs.</p>
<p>However, chin up, baldy, as we've got some good news that involves you: Feral Interactive has just announced that Hitman Absolution is coming to both Switch 1 and Switch 2 in late 2025 and TBC 2026, respectively.</p>
<p>This follows on from the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">Hitman: World of Assassination</a> alongside the Switch 2 back in June.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067syltij&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Here are some more early details from the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hitman Absolution features all the series’ hallmarks of stealth, distraction and disguise, while revealing 47 as a more complicated and thoughtful character, aware of the effects of his actions, for both good and evil.</p>
<p><em>Absolution</em>’s missions invite players to explore and experiment as they stalk their targets, engineering opportunities to strike from the shadows or, when the bullets fly, unleashing an arsenal of weapons, gadgets and anything else that may come to hand. Whether executing a silent hit or creating mayhem, players have no end of inventive ways to approach their targets, with opportunities to beat their high scores and meet each mission’s multiple Challenges."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We think it's fair to say that Absolution was <em>quite divisive</em> amongst critics when it launched back in 2012, and for what it's worth, this writer did initially kind of hate it when it came out. It was just so far removed from the vibe and style of a 'proper' Hitman, it really didn't hit well.</p>
<p>However! It has to be said that a replay a year or two later, away from the excitement and noise of release week, well, it's a fine enough action game if you just take it on its own terms, really.</p>
<p>The game is also coming to iOS and Android, and Feral says that more details on the Switch versions will be coming "later this year". We'll keep you updated on this one as we find out more.</p>

			<p>Half-Life 2 Remake, an impressive fanmade remaster of the second entry in the popular series by Valve in the Source 2013 engine, is getting a playable demo before release to allow players to check out the impressive gameplay and visual improvements featured in the project for themselves ahead of the full release next year.</p>



<p>The demo was confirmed on the project's Mod DB page by GameROOSH, the developer behind the project. As of now, the developer is considering two different possibilities—a demo featuring a couple of levels or a remake of the Lost Coast demo that Valve itself released in 2005 to showcase the Source engine's HDR capabilities. While a decision has yet to be made, the developer seems to be leaning more towards the latter option to preserve first impressions of the project at launch.</p>



<p>The Half-Life 2 Remake project aims to remaster the original game's visuals with realistic graphics on par with those of modern games while properly conveying the game's unique atmosphere. Besides the impressive new visuals showcased in the screenshots below, the project will also feature new gameplay features, like realistic bullet simulation, destructible objects, and more to deliver an improved experience that fans of the original are sure to appreciate.</p>

<p>Fan projects like the Half-Life 2 Remake continue to be the only new releases related to the series. Still, the situation may change in the future, as a new entry in the series is rumored to be in active development. <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hlx-end-of-development/">Earlier this year</a>, we learned that the mysterious project codenamed HLX may be close to the end of development, and some of its features, like the story, are being openly talked about in certain circles. Hopefully, it won't take much longer to see what this project will be about, and if it will indeed be the Half-Life 3 that fans have been waiting for for decades.</p>

<p>Based on real dreams?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Mexican indie studio Interactive Dreams has announced that its short interactive story, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/a_dream_about_parking_lots">A Dream About Parking Lots</a>, arrives on Nintendo Switch... today.</p>
<p>The game, which only takes around 30-40 minutes to complete according to the PR, sees you search for your car, whilst at the same time having a conversation with a therapist about why you have this recurring dream about parking lots.</p>
<p>It may be short, but when indies hone in on something mighty specific in a laser-focused way like this — and especially when the writing is up to scratch — special things can occur. And, given this one is currently sat on a "Positive" user rating <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3500340/A_Dream_About_Parking_Lots/">over on Steam</a>, where it released back in March, it seems it might pack some big messages into its short running time.</p>

<p>You can check out the trailer above, and here's some more from the PR blurb:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A Dream About Parking Lots</em> is a short, surreal narrative game where you search for your car in endless parking lots while talking to your therapist about recurring dreams. Blending retro visuals with emotional storytelling, it explores themes of feeling lost, creative block, and the strange logic of dreams 🧠</p>
<p>Look for your car by using your car key!<br>
30-40 minutes long.<br>
Retro-style graphics.<br>
Existential story about feeling lost and creative blocks.<br>
Based on real dreams!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can't find details on pricing, as it's not yet showing up on the eShop, but it's $3.99 on <a href="https://interactivedreams.itch.io/adreamaboutparkinglots">itch.io</a> and Steam. It's 699 yen <a href="https://store-jp.nintendo.com/item/software/D70010000101018">on the Japanese eShop</a>, although there's a 20% launch discount right now that brings it down to 559 yen.</p>
<p><em>Looking forward to having therapy in a car park that may or may not exist?</em></p>

			<p>Hideo Kojima is disappointed in the current state of the video game industry, as there are too many games that look and play the same.</p>



<p>Speaking with Ssense, the legendary game creator commented on the current state of the video game industry following this year's Summer Game Fest showcase, noting how almost every game shown involved fighting either aliens or medieval monsters. It's not just the premise that seems to be almost identical, as Hideo Kojima finds that even visuals and gameplay systems are pretty much the same. While he understands that many people enjoy these games, he believes that it is important to put something really new for the industry, which is something that the legendary game creator has consistently been doing for years, especially with the release of the two Death Stranding games, and only indies seem to be doing nowadays. Being disappointed in a game industry that is putting out games that look and play almost the same, it's not surprising that Hideo Kojima is not going to play Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, the remake of the third entry in the series, which will not change the original's gameplay significantly.</p>



<p>Although Hideo Kojima's games often manage to set themselves apart from almost every other game out there, the legendary game creator hasn't been exempt from criticism, especially for its extreme involvment in many aspects of game development. However, he believes that it is this singular concentrated vision the reason of his success, as it allows him to work on multiple aspects of a game simultaneously, unlike a movie where the process proceeds step by step, starting with writing the script then moving on to storyboarding and production.</p>



<p>With Death Stranding 2: On the Beach now out, Hideo Kojima and his Kojima Productions studio are working on <a href="https://wccftech.com/physint-kojima-new-stealth-ip-playstation-transcend-film-video-games/">Physint</a>, which will mark his return to Metal Gear Solid's action/stealth formula, and the mysterious&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/od-hideo-kojima-horror-game-xbox-revealed-jordan-peele/">OD</a>, which will be something totally different that people will either love or hate. Once the game is out, Kojima-san will listen to people's opinions, but reception won't matter, as he is sure the legacy of his games will be defined in the future.</p>



<p>You can learn more about the aforementioned latest game by Hideo Kojima, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/">review</a>.

            <p>Very <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tamriel-man-skywind-squeezes-morrowind-into-skyrim">long-in-the-works</a> Elder Scrolls modding project <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skywind-releases-long-new-trailer-for-morrowinds-21st-anniversary">Skywind</a> has hit another milestone in its winding road towards an eventual release. The folks behind the mod, which aims to deliver a version of the series' beloved third entry <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind">Morrowind</a> remade in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>'s engine, have recruited the final three voice actors they were looking for to fill out the base game's entire roster of characters.</p>
<p>Skywind's still without any kind of release date, meaning it's almost certainly further off than its Oblivion-centric sort of cousin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a>, which is aiming to arrive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skyblivion-project-lead-and-gog-chat-about-partnering-up-to-release-the-massive-elder-scrolls-mod-following-fallout-londons-troubled-success">this year</a>. However, the regular updates we've been getting about it of late are encouraging signs that it will eventually let us into its heart chamber.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The team behind the mod have taken to the socials to announce that they've now cast voices for every character in the base game. "Roughly 300 voice actors are lending their voices to give life to the approximately 3000 NPCs of Vvardenfell," the modders explained, "and we are looking forward to you all hearing them on your adventures."</p>
<p>Given that scale, you can see why it'd take such a gargantuan effort to bring together enough dulcet tones to fill the voice boxes of everyone from Alvis Teri to Zabarbael. The final three characters the Skywinders were looking to find voices for weren't exactly minor roles either. As the team explained in their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wWpMR5mo-w">most recent showcase of the mod</a> back in May, Dagoth Ur, Vivec, and Yagrum Bagarn were the trio left communicating via silent text.</p>

</span></p><p>Jeff Baker's performance as Dagoth's only one of the most iconic things about the original Morrowind, how tough can it be to fill those god-sized shoes? Well, I'd certainly not want to be the one tasked with bellowing at Nerevar to come and look upon the heart, and Akulakhan, and bring Wraithguard please, because I have need of it. My work certainly wouldn't be god-tier enough to make folks want to stick synthwave behind it to form <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iR-K2rUP86M">funky tunes</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, Moon-and-Star, the Skywind team aren't resting on their laurels having ticked this box, and they're still looking for volunteers to help out.

Many of the experts I spoke with at the conference in Sao Paulo waxed lyrical about the passion and ability of developers in the region, but acknowledged that what's so often missing from teams and studios of all sizes is experience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There is a definite gap in the skills that are needed to get to the pro level," explained Amber general manager Jorge Suarez Basañez, during a fascinating panel that sought to spotlight how Latam studios can achieve global success.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Basañez has spent decades building and growing studios in Mexico. He currently oversees full-service development company Amber, which is headquartered in Guadalajara and has worked with notable partners like Amazon, Netflix, Paradox Interactive, King, Epic Games, Disney, and more.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Basañez, the talent destiny in Latin America is surging—which is turn has created an opportunity for studios in the region to nurture and retain developers on home soil. Of course, he suggests employers ensure their workers want to stick around for the long haul, and that means they must play to their unique strengths.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-make-it-political-how-can-the-brazilian-game-industry-establish-itself-on-the-global-stage-" target="_self" data-discover="true">'Make it political:' How can the Brazilian game industry establish itself on the global stage?</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;Implement systems that nurture those talented people and help them to grow&quot;">"Implement systems that nurture those talented people and help them to grow"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He believes rising development costs in North America and Europe coupled with a widespread return-to-office drive at major studios in those regions has created a window for employers in Latam to flip the script. As such, he tells developers across Latin American to encourage hybrid and remote work, noting how people will be attracted to companies that allow them to choose between working productively at home or in-studio based on their individual needs.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a move that would also enable employers to access talent outside of larger urban areas, where the cost-of-living might also be lower.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"[By enabling remote working] you can tap into a whole lot of talent in small towns that didn't previously have an opportunity, and that makes a big difference," he says. "Implement systems that nurture those talented people and help them to grow."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's about building for the future—and to do that, employers must strive to understand how to instill cultural values that enable them to punch above their weight. For instance, he suggests the elephant in the room right now across Latin American studios is salary. Although studios in the region might not be able to offer the same wage as some of their rivals, what he feels they can do is ensure people "don't feel like a number on the payroll."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/investors-and-publishers-share-their-pitching-tips-at-gamescom-latam" target="_self" data-discover="true">Investors and publishers share their pitching tips at Gamescom Latam</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He suggests employers can offer both financial compensation and emotional compensation—and for some people the latter is far more important. "The best projects attract the best talent and the best talent attracts the best talent," he adds. "The best way to let go of your best people is to keep the people with a bad attitude."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In short: build your team around the positive influences and refuse to let toxicity fester. Nurture your workforce by offering training that allows them to expand their skillset rather than stagnate. Basañez explains Amber has a training center dedicated to bridging the skill gap between its more youthful hires and more experienced team members, pushing them to evolve their technical and soft skills beyond what was taught at university.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer was invited to Gamescom Latam by event partner Abragames, which covered flights and accommodation.</span></span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

<p>Dauberman has secured the screen rights to the game and will produce the film alongside Mia Maniscalco, the president of Coin Operated - the production company he founded (thanks <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/gary-dauberman-spooky-video-game-the-medium-exclusive-1236333819/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>).</p>

<p>"When I talked to Piotr [Babieno, Bloober CEO] about it, we immediately connected on our mutual love of horror and his vision for where the genre is headed," he continued. "I have no doubt anything Bloober develops is going to push horror forward in unique and terrifying ways, and I'm excited to be working alongside them."</p>
<p>The search for a writer and director for the film adaptation has now begun.</p>
<p>"Adapting games into films often involves balancing many interests, but with The Medium, I have a deep sense that Gary is the perfect partner for us," said Babieno. "From our very first conversation, I felt we were completely in sync. And every conversation since has only reinforced that feeling."</p>
<p>This won't be the first game adaptation Coin Operated has worked on, after the company co-produced the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/full-until-dawn-film-trailer-shows-plenty-of-gruesome-deaths">Until Dawn film</a> with PlayStation Productions.</p>
<p>Dauberman himself is known for writing The Conjuring Universe films Annabelle and The Nun, as well as the 2017 film It and its sequel (based on Stephen King's novel).</p>
<p>The Medium, released in 2021, followed Bloober's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/layers-of-fear">Layers of Fear</a>, Observer and Blair Witch. Set in Poland, it's a psychological horror with a protagonist who's able to travel between two terrifying realms.</p>
<p>Bloober has since seen success with its remake of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> and is now preparing for the release of Cronos: The New Dawn later this year. According to our preview, it pilfers liberally from other survival horror games.</p>
<p>"In the crudest terms possible, Cronos: The New Dawn is a survival horror game about going back in time to steal things from the past," wrote Eurogamer's Ian Higton in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cronos-the-new-dawn-feels-like-a-combination-of-every-other-survival-horror-game-ive-played-before-it-which-isnt-always-a-good-thing">Cronos preview</a>. "I say this because its developers, Bloober Team also seem to have gone back in time and stolen almost every aspect of Cronos' gameplay from past survival horror titles and more."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/bloobers-the-medium-will-be-adapted-to-film-courtesy-of-it-and-annabelle-writer-producer-gary-dauberman]]></content:encoded>

                <p>In the realm of Warhammer 40k, players have faced formidable enemies for years. But Warhammer publisher Games Workshop has run into an unlikely foe that it has yet to defeat. According the company's latest financial disclosure, Games Workshop's plan for a new car park have apparently been derailed by a "cute looking" bat</p><p>As spotted by IGN, Games Workshop <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/ost7hseic9hc/6RTEwwgirDZoH36H2AfQ8f/41dd13da3aad11bb599a6c2ad9df8f2b/2024-25_Press_statement_29_Jul.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">has shared its latest financial report</a> for investors, and notes that a "cute looking pipistrelle bat is delaying our work on our new temporary car park," before adding that the company is "carefully looking after the bat."</p><p>The report notes that Games Workshop amassed huge profits for its fiscal year ending in June 2025. However, President Trump's tariffs are a larger concern going forward for the company's lucrative physical goods business.</p><p>"We hope the uncertainty around tariffs is resolved soon," notes the company in the report. "We are also mindful of the increased risk of supply chain disruption as a direct consequence of conflicts around the world, which we highlight as a principal risk... This new problem will be dealt with in our normal pragmatic way. We will not change our operational plans too much... It's mostly out of our control."</p><p>Games Workshop also acknowledged that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-and-games-workshop-finalize-deal-for-warhammer-40000-adaptations/1100-6520022/" data-ref-id="1100-6520022">a deal with Amazon for the Warhammer 40k adaptation rights</a> has been finalized, with some creative issues still to worked out for any film and television projects.

Other Microsoft titles including Doom: The Dark Ages, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, and Minecraft also appeared as best-sellers on PlayStation's Q2 chart.</p><p>Microsoft went on to state that Black Ops 6 has drawn 50 million players to date, and added that the Minecraft movie led to record active usage and revenue for the already wildly successful game.</p><p>The report doesn't really dwell on the recent layoffs or the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-a-decade-rares-everwild-canceled-as-part-of-xbox-layoffs-report/1100-6532912/" data-ref-id="1100-6532912">canceled gaming projects like Rare's Everwild</a>.

            <p>Xbox Game Pass made Microsoft almost $5bn in annual revenue last year, proving the company is in a healthy state despite last month's shock layoffs.</p>
<p>During the company's latest earnings call, CEO Satya Nadella stated "Game Pass annual revenue was nearly $5bn for the first time" and Microsoft has 500 million active users across multiple gaming platforms and devices.</p>
<p>Indeed, Microsoft overall has seen an 18 percent increase in revenue (up to $76.4bn) and 23 percent increase in operating income (up to $34.3bn). As <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/30/microsoft-q2-2025-earnings">The Guardian</a> has reported, the company's stock rose by more than seven percent on Wednesday, as it remains the world's second-most valuable company.</p>
<p>Said Nadella: "Cloud and AI is the driving force of business transformation across every industry and sector.</p>
<p>"We're innovating across the tech stack to help customers adapt and grow in this new era, and this year, Azure surpassed $75bn in revenue, up 34 percent, driven by growth across all workloads."</p>
<p>The news follows <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-is-thriving-claims-ceo-doubling-down-on-ai-after-9000-employees-lost-jobs-in-latest-layoffs">a statement from Nadella last week</a>, where he claimed "Microsoft is thriving" and doubled down on the importance of AI.</p>
<p>"What does empowerment look like in the era of AI?" he said. "It's not just about building tools for specific roles or tasks. It's about building tools that empower everyone to create their own tools. That's the shift we are driving - from a software factory to an intelligence engine empowering every person and organisation to build whatever they need to achieve."</p>
<p>But this success comes at a human cost. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-june-2025-tracking-the-situation-as-it-happens">Over 9000 employees were laid off from Microsoft earlier this month</a>, including across its gaming divisions. The likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rares-everwild-reportedly-cancelled-following-xbox-job-cuts">Rare's Everwild</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">The Initiative's Perfect Dark reboot, and a new ZeniMax MMORPG were all cancelled</a>, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/candy-crush-developer-king-reportedly-replacing-laid-off-staff-with-ai-tools-they-helped-to-build">roughly 200 staff from Candy Crush developer King were laid off</a> and reportedly replaced by the AI tools they helped to build.</p>
<p>Microsoft told Eurogamer the layoffs were "necessary to position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace".</p>
<p>This Game Pass success is alongside Microsoft's success as a third-party publisher on PlayStation. As we reported earlier today, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-games-made-up-most-of-playstations-top-sellers-in-the-us-last-quarter">the majority of PlayStation's top-selling games in the US over the last quarter were published from Microsoft</a>, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, and The Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion Remastered.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-hits-almost-5bn-in-annual-revenue-and-microsoft-profits-grow-despite-thousands-laid-off]]></content:encoded>

			<p>I would be hard pressed to call Dear Me, I Was a game in any true sense of the word, because it really does not feel like a game. Describing it as a visual novel would do Dear Me, I Was a disservice to its artistic style too. The best way to describe Dear Me, I Was is a reflective piece about life from beginning to end.</p>
<p><iframe title="「Dear me, I was...」Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s43znSJMsAQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The story of Dear Me, I Was follows the life story of an unnamed woman from her childhood to old age, with each significant moment getting its own chapter, of which there are ten in total, including the epilogue. The start of each chapter begins with a meal for breakfast, and one of the few interactive moments in the experience where you pick each item to eat. As the woman grows older her breakfast of choice changes from a glass of milk and some fruit as a kid to croissants and coffee. It’s a good way to introduce each chapter, as it signifies the change in life that the woman is going through.</p>


<p>Every scene is depicted as a watercolour, with moods shown through how bright or muted the watercolour is. The art style immediately stands out and Dear Me, I Was could be a contender for visual design of the year with the way the story is played out through Taisuke Kanazaki’s watercolours which are brought to life through rotoscoping.</p>


<p>Each scene is unique and brief, but carries enough meaning to provide the context of what you are seeing. These scenes are accompanied by plaintive piano pieces, with the music again matching and complementing the scenes, from positive songs to slower and more depressive tones when the story calls for it.</p>
<p>To discuss any element of the story would be a spoiler, but it shows the highs and lows that each of us will experience at some point in life, especially the relationships we have with others. In that way, Dear Me, I Was is relatable even if our life experiences are different to what the woman in this piece goes through.</p>
<p>Dear Me, I Was lasts approximately one hour and in that time you will only be required to put in minimal effort to interact. Already mentioned is picking at the food at the start of each chapter, but there are other moments where you ‘sketch’ scenes, though this is just holding the A button while moving the analogue stick to uncover pictures. There are a few other interactive moments, but it feels like they have been thrown in so you are given something to do instead of simply being a passive viewer.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Dear Me, I Was offers reflection on a life accompanied by eye-catching art and gentle piano music. There's very limited interactivity though, and while the story is relatable at some points, it's not particularly unique. It is worth picking up if you're looking for something that will make you sit back and reflect, but it feels as though Dear Me, I Was will only appeal to a very specific audience.	</p></div>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hey-microsoft-is-it-%E2%80%98xbox-pc%E2%80%99-or-%E2%80%98xbox-on-pc%E2%80%99.1257840/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft first started using the “Xbox PC” term in a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/gears-of-war-reloaded-release-date/">blog post</a> announcing the <em>Gears of Wars</em> remaster in early May. It was a new branding effort designed to signal that games are available on PC through its own Xbox PC app and store. The Xbox PC branding didn’t last long though, as Microsoft has now started using “Xbox on PC” instead. Which one is it, Microsoft?</p><p>The Xbox PC branding has been picked up by third-party publishers, with Focus Entertainment using it for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETCpWo0A0i0">gameplay trailer</a> in early June. Then on June 25th Microsoft introduced the Xbox on PC branding for its <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/25/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-enhanced-update/"><em>Hellblade II Enhanced</em> announcement</a>, but confusingly used both Xbox PC and Xbox on PC in the same blog post.</p><p>Xbox game studio World’s Edge used the Xbox PC branding <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MkpGj44bFc">for its trailer</a> of an <em>Age of Mythology: Retold</em> expansion in June, and then swapped to the Xbox on PC branding in a <a href="https://www.ageofempires.com/news/pre-order-heavenly-spear-for-age-of-mythology-retold/">preorder blog post</a> yesterday. <em>Grounded 2</em> was also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0HQNOtg1WI">announced</a> last month as an Xbox PC title, before an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcUeK3xv17k">early access trailer</a> debuted yesterday and also switched to the Xbox on PC branding.</p><p>I wrote <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/693576/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-steam-notepad">last month in my <em>Notepad</em> newsletter</a> that calling the Xbox app on Windows simply Xbox PC was a clear bid to position it as a Steam competitor or alternative. The Xbox on PC branding isn’t too different, but it’s a subtle change that makes it sound more like you’re getting Xbox games on PC rather than needing some kind of Xbox PC hardware.</p><p>Both of these brands have challenges, though. Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22827140/microsoft-pc-game-pass-naming-rebrand">rebranded</a> its Xbox Game Pass for PC subscription to just PC Game Pass four years ago because people were getting confused. There has always been an inherent conflict with Microsoft’s efforts to bridge PC and Xbox, because the experiences are often so different.</p><p>That’s something Microsoft is now trying to change, especially as it heads towards its next generation of Xbox consoles that look set to lean further towards Windows than ever before. Microsoft is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682011/microsoft-windows-xbox-pc-combination-features-rog-xbox-ally-devices">combining Windows and Xbox for handheld PCs</a> later this year, and we’ll hear more about that effort at Gamescom next month.</p><p>I think the Xbox PC branding is just a little too early, and that’s probably why it has changed to Xbox on PC in a matter of weeks. It’s a similar situation to how Microsoft used its “this is an Xbox” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24296420/microsoft-this-is-an-xbox-marketing-campaign-xbox-everywhere">marketing campaign</a> months before it started to make sense.</p><p>Microsoft is attempting to redefine the Xbox brand as a platform that spans across phones, laptops, TVs, handheld gaming PCs, and even VR headsets. There are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/693576/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-steam-notepad">plenty of challenges</a> to overcome to make that a reality, and let’s hope Microsoft avoids some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/11/6135053/windows-mobile-history-branding-names">Windows Mobile-esque branding changes</a> in the process.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/microsoft/716564/microsoft-xbox-pc-xbox-on-pc-branding-changes]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>One developer has said it will give away its game for free to anyone who responds to a social media post, but only if <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> Silksong shows up at this afternoon's Nintendo Direct.</p>
<p>Game developer Pere Albacar, who founded Guateke Studios, is gearing up to release "cute" indie Sands of Hope. "Explore the sandy landscapes of Cydonia as you use your ancestral powers to build and attach magnetic cubes, find energy cores to restore the land's water flow and meet other villagers with the help of a loyal dog," reads the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2821450/Sands_of_Hope/">upcoming game's description</a> (and, yes, you can pet the dog).</p>

<p>Now, in anticipation of this afternoon's Nintendo Direct, Albacar has said that anyone who responds to his social media post will be gifted a Steam code for Sands of Hope if we do indeed get some information on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. And, well, at the time of writing, <a href="https://x.com/pere_albacar/status/1950562003208073222">Albacar has had 32k replies</a>.</p>
<p>"Ohhhh boy, what have you done," reads one such response, to which Albacar replied: "Wasn't expecting 20k comments haha." It has, of course, more than that now. When someone else added they hoped Albacar was "ready" for this afternoon, the developer said he wasn't. "There's so many comments," Albacar wrote in what seems to be good humour.</p>
<p>Many have said that even if Silksong doesn't get a release date or equivalent this afternoon, they will still check out Sands of Hope anyway. The game is due to be released on 4th August via Steam.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3768120/Sands_of_Hope_Demo/">demo for Sands of Hope</a> was released earlier this year, and reviews for it are currently looking pretty good overall.
