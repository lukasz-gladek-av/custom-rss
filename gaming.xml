			<p>The Xbox UI is set to change significantly in the future, and it may soon show Steam games that are installed on the system, judging from an image shared online that was promptly removed shortly after.</p>
<p>As reported by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/633478/microsoft-xbox-steam-games-support-ui" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Verge</a>, an image was shared in a new blog post titled&nbsp;<em><a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/articles/2025/03/gdc-2025-opening-a-billion-doors-with-xbox/">"Opening a Billion Doors With Xbox</a>," </em>which highlighted changes in the game industry and users now tending to engage with games across multiple devices, showing how the Xbox UI could change in the future to account for this tendency. What makes this new interface interesting is a clearly visible Steam label in all variants of the interface: TV, tablet and handheld. According to unspecified sources, Microsoft is working on an Xbox app update that will show every game installed on a PC, including games purchased on other digital storefronts like Steam and the Epic Games Store. As this Xbox app update is still in the early stages of development, however, the inclusion of all installed PC games in the interface may be scrapped as work continues.</p>
<p>Besides working on a new Xbox UI and app update, Microsoft is also hard at work on the hardware side of its <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-release-2027-premium-handheld/">next-generation plans</a>, which include a premium successor to the Xbox Series X and a handheld console. In addition, the company is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-project-kennan-is-reportedly-being-made-by-asus/">reportedly working with ASUS</a> on a handheld known as Project Keenan that will launch later this year. This handheld system, which will look markedly Xbox, will run full Windows with a focus on the Microsoft Store and PC Game Pass. As such, it will definitely be able to run games purchased on Steam and other digital storefronts, so it wouldn't be surprising for the new UI featuring the Steam label to launch alongside the system.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/system-shock-2-25th-anniversary-remaster-release-date</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/system-shock-2-25th-anniversary-remaster-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nightdive has announced the&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster&nbsp;</em>release date, with the reworked version of the classic FPS coming to PC and consoles in summer.</p>

<p>As revealed in a brand new trailer,&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2</em>'s remaster will be launching across PC and consoles (that's current-gen and last-gen consoles, happily) on June 26th.</p>

<p>Just in case you're wondering what happened to Nightdive's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/system-shock-2-enhanced-edition-is-being-ported-to-kex-engine" rel="nofollow">previously-revealed</a>&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2: Enhanced Edition</em>, this is, in fact, that very thing; the project was renamed to&nbsp;<em>25th Anniversary Remaster&nbsp;</em>earlier this year, but it's still the same, ahem, enhanced edition Nightdive has been working on for the past few years.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/system-shock-2-remaster-release-date-robot.jpg?itok=u9-8m4kP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/system-shock-2-remaster-release-date-robot.jpg?itok=J5FgeGFv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>System Shock 2</em>'s remaster is coming in June.</figcaption></figure><p>As you've probably come to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nightdive-the-thing-remaster-tease" rel="nofollow">expect</a> from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/poed-definitive-edition-nightdive" rel="nofollow">previous</a> Nightdive <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nightdive-studios-remastering-shadow-man-restoring-cut-content" rel="nofollow">remaster projects</a>,&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster&nbsp;</em>will bring a number of new features to the iconic 2000 FPS-RPG.</p>

<p>You can expect a visual revamp that will touch up some of the game's rougher edges and models without deviating from Irrational and Looking Glass' artistic vision, as well as some minor quality-of-life improvements, controller support, and more.</p>

<p>The game will also support Steam achievements, as well as achievements and trophies on the relevant consoles, and it'll boast 144fps and ultrawide support too, so this'll likely be the best-looking version of&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2&nbsp;</em>you can play (without mods, of course).</p>

<p>On the subject of mods, Nightdive is also promising expanded mod support for&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster</em>, so if you want to turn all the enemies into Mr. Blobby and work out some very specific trauma, you should find it pretty easy to do so.</p>




<p>It's worth remembering that although Nightdive is the studio responsible for 2023's excellent&nbsp;<em>System Shock&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/system-shock-goes-gold-release-date-for-pc-announced" rel="nofollow">remake</a>, this project isn't on the same scale; it's not a full reimagining, but a remaster, so bear that in mind if you pick it up.</p>

<p><em>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster&nbsp;</em>launches for PC (via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/866570/System_Shock_2_25th_Anniversary_Remaster/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/system_shockr_2_25th_anniversary_remaster" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>), <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10013043" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/System-Shock-2-25th-Anniversary-Remaster/9P4FK543SMZF" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and Nintendo Switch on June 26th. Make sure you pick this one up if you're interested in a revamped slice of FPS history.</p>

<p>It’s time for a new expansion with Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket’s Shining Revelry content. We’re already putting Triumphant Light behind us as we’re being blinded by the long-awaited arrival of Shiny Pokémon&nbsp;in Shining Revelry.</p>



<p>The next main-set Expansion is here, and it’s called Shining Revelry. A fitting name as it welcomes Shiny Pokémon&nbsp;variations into Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket. Shinies have become part and parcel of the Pokémon&nbsp;experience in the mainline games and Pokémon&nbsp;GO.</p>



<p>It’s Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket’s turn to have Shinies, and they are the centerpiece attraction of Shining Revelry.</p>

<figure><figcaption>I’ve looked at this for hours. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket Shining Revelry expansion comes to us on <strong>March 27</strong>—giving you only a few days to fill in the gaps of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-triumphant-light-secret-missions-pokemon-tcg-pocket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Triumphant Light</a> and other sets.</p>



<p>The headline-makers we’ve seen—so far—in <a href="https://tcgpocket.pokemon.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokémon Pocket</a>‘s Shining Revelry set are a <strong>Shiny Charizard ex</strong> and a <strong>Shiny Lucario ex</strong>. They look absolutely stunning, and it introduces a new form of rarity to the grading system.</p>



<div><article><p><span>It’s time to shine ✨ in the latest </span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PokemonTCGPocket" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#PokemonTCGPocket</a><span> expansion!

Shiny Pokémon arrive alongside Pokémon from the Paldea region in the upcoming expansion, Shining Revelry! Available on Thursday, March 27.</span></p></article></div>



<p>Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket Shining Revelry’s debut likely coincides with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-ranked-coming-to-pokemon-tcg-pocket-release-period-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ranked Battles</a>. The PvP mode was announced a while back after being a rumor. So it’s a double-whammy for Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket players as the mobile app continues to Rock Smash it.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The Entertainment Software Association has unveiled the Accessible Games Initiative, which aims to help people understand accessibility features available in video games. The US-based effort came about from some of the biggest companies in the industry: Nintendo of America, Sony, Microsoft, Google, EA, and Ubisoft.</p><p dir="ltr">The Accessible Games Initiative is kicking off <a href="https://accessiblegames.com/accessibility-tags/" rel="nofollow ">with 24 tags</a>. So far, they're categorized under four different features--auditory, gameplay, input, and visual--and then specified from there. For example, there is a Full Input Remapping tag, meaning the game offers the ability to swap button actions, joystick functionality, and other controls. This differs from the Basic Input Remapping tag, advertising only buttons can be reconfigured. Other official tags include Narrated Menus, Playable With Mouse Only, Color Alternatives, and Large Text. These should start appearing on digital storefronts and product pages in the near future.</p><p dir="ltr">"Tens of millions of Americans have a disability and often face barriers to experiencing the joy and connection that comes with playing video games," ESA president and CEO Stanley Pierre-Louis said in a press release. Specifically, <a href="https://accessiblegames.com/" rel="nofollow ">the Accessible Games Initiative website</a> points out that 44.1 million US residents have a disability, with reportedly almost half of them playing video games.</p><p dir="ltr">The ESA states that Amazon Games, Riot, Square Enix, and WB Games have joined the Accessible Games Initiative. This is just one of the latest pushes for better accessibility in the gaming industry. Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-adaptive-joystick-is-available-now/1100-6530210/">Microsoft revealed the Xbox Adaptive Joystick</a> that looks similar to a Wii nunchuk.

		<p>There seems to be a major movement towards bigger, bolder indie RPGs right now, that push the boundaries of what we should expect in the indie space. We’ve just had the excellent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/29/eternal-strands-review/">Eternal Strands</a>, and now Empyreal is heading towards launch on the 8th of May. The development team at Silent Games is keen to give players an early glimpse of the game, and to help them understand the world and some of the systems that they’ll encounter so they’ve dropped an all-new overview trailer with a heap of detail to dispense.</p>
<p><iframe title="Empyreal - Official Game Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_gRQlppV4vM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>



<p>In the seven-minute Game Overview video, creative director Joseph Rogers delves into the game’s key mechanics and narrative. You can learn more about the stories waiting to be told, the myriad ways to build your character, and how the mysterious Cartograms will affect every journey into the belly of the Monolith.</p>
<p>Empyreal is described as a feature-rich action RPG where players explore an imposing Monolith and fight to survive against the guardians that lie within. Uncover a complex narrative combining mythology, philosophy, and transcendental revelations as you lead an Expedition further into the structure to discover the truth that lies at its core. There’s already a demo available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1377700/Empyreal/">PC players via Steam</a>, so if you fancy checking it out early, you can!</p>

<p>The main features of the game are a unique and complex combat system, a memorable cast of characters, with personal questlines and multiple endings for each one. A beautiful but shattered ancient world, where you can explore breathtaking environments filled with hidden details. You can also customise your character with a vast array of equipment and collect armour sets that confer powerful bonuses, while upgrading and modifying the loot you find. Besides that you’ll ablso unlock new abilities to personalise your playstyle.</p>

<p>It definitely looks fantastic, and we can’t wait to show you more. Empyreal will release on 8 May for PC via Steam, PlayStation®5, and Xbox Series X|S. Empyreal is priced at £24.99/$29.99/€29.99, with a 10% launch discount on Steam.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/assassins-creed-shadows-how-to-refill-scouts/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> features some brand new gameplay mechanics that set it apart from past entries in the series. After accepting the vast majority of main and side quests, the game won't tell you outright where to go and will only provide some general hints regarding where you have to go, leaving you on your own to search for your next quest objective. If you want to speed up this process, you will have to use <strong>scouts</strong>, but every season, you will only be able to use them for a limited number of times, and you will have to wait for the season to change if you want to use them again.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250321131024_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Thankfully,<strong> you are not forced to wait for a season to change if you want to use scouts again</strong> after depleting their use and if you are willing to spend some resources. Besides forcing a partial season change via the main menu when the compass in the top right of the map hits south, which still requires time to pass, in any <strong>Kakuraga safehouse</strong> that you have unlocked, you can <strong>refill scouts</strong>&nbsp;by interacting with the sacks hanging on one of the walls and paying 200 mon. Constantly refilling scouts can be a costly endeavor, so you should still avoid abusing the system, but in case of emergency, this option is extremely handy to have, especially if you prefer to use scouts to salvage Stockpiles from enemy strongholds or use them to clear the Wanted status instead of using them to find quest objectives faster. To expand and improve the capabilities of scouts, you will need to upgrade the Kakurega in your Hideout to level 2 and the Stables.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250321132000_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>If you like using the scout system in Assassin's Creed Shadows a lot, you will also want to recruit as many scouts as possible. To do so, you will need to upgrade your <strong>Study</strong> in the Hideout, as each upgrade will increase the number of available scouts up to 9. You will need a lot of resources to do so, and the best way to gather enough of them relatively quickly is to complete the seasonal contracts available for each region, besides clearing enemy camps and strongholds. Much like refilling scouts, seasonal contracts can be accepted in any Kakurega.</p>

<p>The dust has finally started to settle on Monster Hunter Wilds’ incredible launch. But if you thought Capcom would leave it there, you’re deadly wrong. We’re just getting started, and the newly announced Monster Hunter Wilds First Title Showcase coming in April is the next phase.</p>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-is-2025s-best-selling-game-in-the-united-states-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best-selling game in the United States</a> in 2025. Monster Hunter Wilds is also the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-has-become-the-fastest-selling-game-in-capcoms-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fastest-selling game in Capcom’s long and illustrious history</a>. They’re some impressive accolades to shout from the mountains. Although I wouldn’t recommend it as you’re likely to disturb <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/creature-coin-monster-hunter-wilds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ancient Wyverns</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-catch-whoppers-in-monster-hunter-wilds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Whoppers</a>, and other other-worldly creatures.</p>



<p>The first major content injection is on the way courtesy of the Monster Hunter Wilds First Title update. A Showcase has been set in stone which will unveil new footage and features.</p>

<p>Capcom has announced a Showcase for the first Free Title Update in Monster Hunter Wilds. The presentation is set for <strong>March 25</strong>, with the update launching in “<strong>Early April</strong>.”</p>



<p>The developer has also declared the Showcase is being presented by producer Ryozo Tsujimoto. You can watch the show on the <a href="http://twitch.tv/monsterhunter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Monster Hunter Wilds Twitch channel</a>, and it will show “Mizutsune and a host of other new additions.”</p>



<p>We reported a while back that Mizutsune was part of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-roadmap-mizutsune-dlc-update-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monster Hunter Wilds roadmap</a>. This will be our first real look at the creature, how it fights, and how you can prepare yourself for the titanic battle.</p>



<p>Capcom is making sure fans are eating good. If this announcement isn’t a testament to that, you only need to look at the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-promotion-is-rewarding-players-with-lots-of-free-goodies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monster Hunter Wilds promotion offering free goodies and bonuses</a>.</p>

The first of these, <em>FEAR</em>, is now in.</p><p>Meanwhile, 2004's <em>Silent Hill 4</em> has joined the program with the addition of “restored scenes that were never available on PC before,” according to a press release from GOG. This includes missing “hauntings,” the strange events that occur, which GOG found were in the PC code but never included—their engineers have dug them out and got them working.</p><p>Alongside those two headliners are some other classic games that could easily merit the same moniker. Stone-cold classics like <em>Deus Ex</em>,&nbsp;<em>Fallout 2</em>, <em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Redemption</em>, <em>Alone In The Dark 1</em> to <em>3</em>, and all eight original <em>Ultima </em>games are also now included, meaning they will be constantly maintained to work on modern PCs for as long as GOG exists (and, the company told me, it has plans in place to ensure preservation can continue if it was to go away). Oh, and Crystal Dynamic’s first three&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raiders</em>.</p><p>Here’s the full list of new additions.

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visions-of-mana-director-leaves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Square Enix</a> can release as many remakes and new mainline FF entries as it wants. However, none of them are likely to have as great an impact as Final Fantasy 14 Online continues to have. With tens of millions of subscribers coming back each month, FF14 Online is where it’s at—and new DLC expansions help.</p>



<p>Every so often a giant update comes along with a content pile so big it makes the content of Santa’s sleigh seem minimal. The Seekers of Eternity 7.2 update is the latest and great patch for Final Fantasy 14, so let’s check it out.</p>



<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-14-update-7-2-release-date">Final Fantasy 14 Update 7.2 Release Date</h2>



<p><strong>March 25 is when the Seekers of Eternity update goes live in Final Fantasy 14.</strong></p>



<p>There’s also a cinematic trailer to get you ready for the incoming content and patch notes. You can check it out here.</p>

<h3 id="h-new-quest-to-complete">New Quest to Complete</h3>

<h3 id="h-battle-system-bolstered">Battle System Bolstered</h3>



<p>We know there’s a new dungeon to explore called the Underkeep. Plus, Season 8 of Final Fantasy 14’s PvP is set to get underway, and many other changes and tweaks have been made to combat.</p>



<h3 id="h-greater-graphics">Greater Graphics</h3>



<p>Square Enix has made a serious graphical improvement to lots of the game’s weapons and accessories, improved the resolution for vegetation and environmental objects, and adjusted lighting and shadows to appear more realistically.</p>

Here, you can see every single change, which piece of DLC you need to benefit properly, and what to expect overall.</p>



<p>This should keep Final Fantasy 14 fans ticking over until the 7.3 update and the eventual successor to Dawntrail.</p>

		<p>It’s a great time to be a driving game fan, with 2025 already hotting up with the arrival of games like Wreckfest 2 and Assetto Corsa Evo. Firmly on our upcoming radar is JDM: Japanese Drift Master, which might boast a Ronseal-styled name, but which is looking absolutely incredible, especially if you have any interest in the Japanese drift scene (watching Fast &amp; The Furious: Tokyo Drift doesn’t count, Initial D does).</p>
<p><iframe title="JDM: Japanese Drift Master | Eurobeat Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VFOkWEiIhIw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The new trailer shows off more of the drifting action as racers slide their way through neon-infused Japanese cities and towns through to the beautiful, traditional countryside. The team have used their own photos, as well as images lifted from Google Earth to truly capture the look and feel of the country, something that it looks as though they’ve absolutely done.</p>
<p>This new trailer features an exclusive Eurobeat song that’s been written for JDM: Japanese Drift Master. Called LIFESHIFTFIRE!, it’s an electrifying Eurobeat track composed by Kamil Hasselhoff, Naski, and Marga, and it made its international debut during the Future Games Show. Music looks to play an integral part in the game, and in keeping with the drift scene, it’ll bounce between Eurobeat, Dance and Nu-Metal while you’re trying to achieve drift supremacy.</p>


<p>There’s a fully featured story mode here, and you’ll play Polish driver Touma, a new entrant on the scene. It’s up to you to take him from a nobody to the drift master, and there’s a great bunch of licensed cars from manufacturers like Nissan and Mazda in which to do it. JDM looks like it should be fairly welcoming too, with a Simcade driving setup that will give you heaps of control, without being too exacting.</p>
<p>JDM: Japanese Drift Master is due to arrive on the 21st of May, and will be available on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1153410/JDM_Japanese_Drift_Master/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/japanese-drift-master-b4fd48?__cf_chl_tk=b5um8CjyirgFe0bmT1hc5EMp5tCkEheD_xZPmT01ybw-1742556033-1.0.1.1-H9l41dC590rpjYP0w1iB5coAWf3qRK_AtPiNvYL45T4">Epic Games Store</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/japanese_drift_master">GOG</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-one-million-players/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows reached an important player number milestone on its first day of availability, Ubisoft confirmed.</p>
<p>A few hours after the latest entry in their series launched on PC and consoles, the publisher confirmed the game had passed 1 million players. While it's not clear how many have accessed the game via a Ubisoft + subscription, this is definitely an excellent result which bodes well for the upcoming weekend, when the number will likely get higher.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">It's not even 4PM here in Canada and Assassin's Creed Shadows has already passed 1 million players!</p>
<p>Thank YOU from the bottom of our hearts for joining this adventure in Feudal Japan. We are beyond excited to start this journey with you! 💝 <a href="https://t.co/1cqwABrQfN">pic.twitter.com/1cqwABrQfN</a></p>
<p>— Assassin's Creed (@assassinscreed) <a href="https://twitter.com/assassinscreed/status/1902802072640295067?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While not exactly attempting to push the boundaries of the open-world RPG formula established by Origins, Assassin's Creed Shadows is a more than worthy new entry in the series. Despite its often inaccurate recreation of Feudal Japan, it attempts to bring back stealth gameplay into the spotlight while not doing away completely with the combat-focused approach seen in Valhalla, making for a surprisingly varied experience. You can learn more about it in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a>.</p>
<p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows is one of the finest entries in the series, successfully bringing back stealth-oriented gameplay while retaining the RPG mechanics and refined combat mechanics seen in previous entries in the series, seamlessly integrating them with the dual protagonist setup and a well-paced story that doesn't overstay its welcome. While the game still features way more content and gameplay systems than necessary, its rendition of Feudal Japan is among the best ever seen in a video game, and it is well worth experiencing for the vast majority of players.</em></p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>

		<p>It’s the time of the week where we’re starting to hit cruise control, readying ourselves for two days of chilling out, time with family, and hopefully, one or two video games. But first we have to tell you what we’ve been playing <em>this</em> week, and I have to say I’m feeling a renewed love for gaming at the start of 2025. Monster Hunter Wilds has probably helped with that, though friends and family alike already feel that they’ve squeezed nearly everything out of the launch build, and are now impatiently waiting for more.</p>
<p>I’ve played a bunch of my Dreamcast favourites on the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/20/retroid-pocket-5-review-one-of-the-best-gaming-handhelds-you-can-buy/">Retroid Pocket 5</a>, as well as continuing with my run through Yakuza: Like a Dragon which I’m really enjoying. Other than that, I’ve been playing Wanderstop for review, and I loved returning to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/18/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-switch-review/">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a> in its Definitive Edition.</p>

<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has been playing Destiny 2, Helldivers 2, and “Generically Dull RPG With Too Much Talking #23787, aka Dragon Age: Veilguard”. Also Split Fiction which he says, “Is just fab.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile <strong>Gamoc</strong> has spent the week playing Atomfall for review, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/">AC Shadows for some guide work</a>, plus some Phasmophobia and Earth Defence Force 5 with his sister.</p>

<p><strong>Aran</strong> has played a bit more Witcher 3, starting the Hearts of Stone DLC. He’s also played Football Manager 24, telling us, “I gave up the FC Brea save as that was too impossible. Now I’m at SC Bastia and overachieving with them. Expected mid-table but currently flying in the promotion places.”</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> is still working his way through Mafia III, though he thinks he’s on the home stretch now. He said, “I’ve had a good time with it but it definitely suffers from that open world bloat that’s become prevalent in a lot of games. Story missions are gated behind open-world activities to the point where – 25 hours in – I’m eager to wrap things up and move onto my next game.”</p>

<p><strong>Ade</strong> was on our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/18/assassins-creed-shadows-review/">Assassin’s Creed: Shadows review</a>, which he thoroughly enjoyed! Also, Split Fiction, “it’s fantastic!” and watching his partner play Two Point Museum, which “looks loads of fun!”</p>
<p>Joining us from the States, <strong>Miguel</strong> played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/17/atelier-yumia-the-alchemist-of-memories-the-envisioned-land-review/">Atelier Yumia</a>, Zenless Zone Zero, Girls Frontline 2 EXILIUM, and the Demon Tides demo!</p>

<p><strong>Steve</strong> is thankfully on the mend, and he’s been able to get some gaming time in along the way. He told us, “My recovery has not been accompanied by Nintendo titles as I had thought it would, with Avowed instead providing a surprisingly chilled out RPG experience. Combat is a little dull but the world is cool to explore. I’ve also spent some family time playing through Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga which is more bloated and unnecessarily expanded than my gallbladder was when I went to A&amp;E… but a lot more fun than that experience.” Glowing praise indeed!</p>
<p>Finally, <strong>Tef</strong> has also dipped a toe in with Atomfall’s opening hours and is looking forward to more, but the game that’s really starting to gets its hooks into him is <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/20/33-immortals-early-access-preview/">33 Immortals</a> with its large scale action-RPG raid battle vibes. He’s even roping me in to start playing it with him.</p>
<p><em>But enough about us, what about you? What have you played?</em></p>

<p>After a hugely successful release, it seems several studios are already set to battle it out to claim the rights to a full-length Split Fiction movie—bringing the dramatic journey of Mio and Zoe to life.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-trophy-and-achievement-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a> had the tough job of following up <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-co-op-games-like-it-takes-two-split-fiction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It Takes Two</a>—2021’s Game of the Year. I’d argue that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-reaches-major-sales-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">milestone of two million copies sold in just one week</a> has put this doubt to rest. Josef Fares and his team have done it again, and it looks like another triumphant statement that cooperative multiplayer sells.</p>



<p>Now, it’s time to see if the medium is as effective on the big screen. A Split Fiction movie is heavily rumored—barely two weeks removed from its debut—and it looks promising.</p>



<h2 id="h-split-fiction-movie-could-make-a-great-co-op-caper">Split Fiction Movie Could Make A Great Co-op Caper</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Imagine what the power of modern cinema could do. Credit to Hazelight Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/split-fiction-movie-video-game-adaptation-1236344367/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a>, the 2025 Game Developers Conference has birthed Split Fiction movie talk. Story Kitchen is the company potentially “<strong>Putting together the film’s cast, writers and director into a package as offers for the rights keep coming in from multiple top Hollywood studios.</strong>“</p>



<p>Again, the rumor and chatter come directly from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gdc-awards-balatro-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GDC 2025</a>, so it remains to be seen if the talk will continue once the event has concluded. Hopefully, a Split Fiction movie has better luck than the It Takes Two one. A movie for the previous co-op title was given the go-ahead, but it apparently remains on hold for now.</p>



<p>If we do get a Split Fiction movie, will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-split-fiction-voice-actors-revealed-who-voices-zoe-mio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zoe and Mio’s voice actors</a> get to reprise their roles? Only time will tell. For now, we’ll continue to lap up every second of Split Fiction. After all, new secrets keep being discovered such as the now-infamous <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-split-fiction-laser-hell-secret-level/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Laser Hell Secret Hell</a> featuring a guest appearance from director Josef Fares himself!</p>

			<p>Yesterday, Netmarble Neo announced that the action/adventure RPG Game of Thrones: Kingsroad will debut on Steam Early Access in just a few days, on Wednesday, March 26. This follows the demo that <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-pc-demo-out-now-on-steam-full-release-in-q2-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went live last month</a> as part of Steam Next Fest. Clearly, the developers received positive feedback and are ready to move on with the next step.</p>
<p>The game is planned to be in early access for at least four weeks, which would be an unusually brief timeframe. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3183280/Game_of_Thrones_Kingsroad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">store page</a> provides several details on how the early access version will differ from the full release:</p>
<p><em>Much of Westeros will be available to explore during the Early Access phase. Players will be able to visit the major cities such as Winterfell, King's Landing and Highgarden and visit the surrounding areas. The Early Access version contains 50 chapters of the main storyline, hundreds of side missions and open world encounters, multiple co-op dungeons, and endgame PVE challenges. During Early Access, players will begin their journey in the northern regions of Westeros, exploring iconic locations such as Castle Black, Winterfell, and areas beyond The Wall, eventually making it to The Reach.</em></p>
<p>Following the early access phase, Netmarble will expand into the Stormlands region to introduce additional areas for Game of Thrones: Kingsroad players to explore. These new areas, such as Storm's End and Felwood, will feature new open-world content, new quests, and co-op dungeons. During early access, the developers will gather feedback to further refine elements such as game balance, graphics, UX/UI, and more.</p>

<p>While the full game will be free to play, to play Game of Thrones: Kingsroad during the early access phase, players will have to purchase one of the Founder's Packs. The Standard Pack is priced at $24.99 and includes a Northern Outfit, the Emoji Pack - Jon Snow, and 350 Iron Bank Marks of currency. The Deluxe Pack is priced at $49.99 and includes the aforementioned in-game items plus the Battle Pass Premium, Wandering Crow Outfit, Darkcloud Mount, Nameplate Background: Ghost, Nameplate Frame: Harbinger, 750 Iron Bank Marks, and 50K Copper.</p>

<p>The Ultimate Pack is the most expensive at $89.99, adding access to the Battle Pass Premium+, White Fang Mount, Brotherhood Without Banners Reins and Saddle (Horse) and Brotherhood Without Banners Saddle (Direwolf), Nameplate Background: Iron Throne, Nameplate Frame: Conqueror, 2K Iron Bank Marks and 200K Copper.</p>

            <p>Six years ago Nightdive Studios announced they were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/20-years-after-release-system-shock-2-is-finally-getting-an-enhanced-edition">doing a remaster</a> of sci-fi sequel <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/system-shock-2">System Shock 2</a>, which they were calling System Shock 2: Enhanced Edition. But back then they were also busy working on a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/system-shock-remake">full-blown remake</a> of the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/system-shock">System Shock</a>. Turns out that first outing to Citadel Station took priority. But now that they're done with that, the studio has finally revealed a release date for the sequel's remaster, which they've sneakily renamed System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster. </p>

<p>It's coming out June 25th this year, as revealed by Nightdive in the above trailer shown during the Future Games Show's spring showcase. As you can see this is definitely "remaster" territory as opposed to a full remake. Resuited, but not rebooted. Watch as an HD-ifying line sweeps over the screen to show before and after shots of Citadel Station and its hostile inhabitants. The changes seem fairly light-handed, too.</p>
<p>There's widescreen support, remodelled enemies, "enhanced" reload animations, and "optimized controller support" among other small improvements, we're told. Some similar improvements can already be achieved for free thanks to the game's long-standing mod scene, which lessens the impact of these tweaks a little for anyone who has already done that. The remastering studio were "paying particular attention to the co-op multiplayer" wrote news poster Craig back in 2019, after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-one-knows-who-is-patching-system-shock-2">talking to Nightdive director Stephen Kick</a>. There doesn't appear to be any mention of co-op in the Steam blurb but the studio has previously confirmed it's still intended to appear.</p>
<p>"Multiplayer and co-op is currently in development," said the studio <a href="https://x.com/NightdiveStudio/status/1894841847350206848">in a tweet</a> last year. "We will share more info on these and other features as we get closer to launch day."</p>
<p>System Shock 2, while beloved by many, can be quite clunky to play from a modern perspective. It'll be interesting to see whether the changes make one of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">the best RPGs on PC</a> more approachable. Nightdive have earned a lot of trust with the series - Jeremy expressed much love in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/system-shock-review">review of the System Shock remake</a>, calling it "a breathtakingly beautiful and astonishingly faithful remake." And this upcoming remaster will be free to anyone who pre-ordered that first remake, say Nightdive. So that's nice.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Nintendo has announced its next batch of SNES games headed to the Switch Online catalogue - and there's a pretty obvious nod to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> on the list.
</p>
<p>
Four strategy games from Koei all arrive for Switch Online next Friday, 28th March, including two Nobunaga's Ambition titles. 
</p>
<p>
Nobunaga's Ambition lets you compete for control of Japan either as the infamous Oda Nobunaga or his rivals as they attempt to unify the country. This is the same conflict that plays out over the course of Ubisoft's new Feudal Japan-set Assassin's Creed, in which Oda Nobunaga is also a key figure.
</p>
<p>
Coming to Nintendo Switch Online next week are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Nobunaga's Ambition</li>
<li>Nobunaga's Ambition: Lord of Darkness</li>
<li>Romance of the Three Kingdoms 4: Wall of Fire </li>
<li>Uncharted Water: New Horizons</li>
</ul>
<p>
And you can watch footage of all four games in the video below:
</p>
<p>
28th March is also when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-removing-game-from-switch-online-catalogue-in-japan">SNES game Super Soccer will be delisted from Nintendo's Switch Online catalogue</a>, at least in Japan - the first game to disappear from the subscription service.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer previously contacted Nintendo for more information on why the game will be removed, and whether this removal will also take place elsewhere in the world. We're yet to receive any more information there.

		<p>Still riding the highs of the success of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/14/silent-hill-2-2024-review/">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, Bloober Team has released a new dev diary to reveal more about their upcoming original horror game, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cronos: The New Dawn | Deep Dive Into The World - Bloober Team Dev Diaries" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RuSJpd2c7UY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/17/bloober-team-reveal-cronos-the-new-dawn/">Announced last October</a>, the behind the scenes video explores Cronos: The New Dawn’s setting, a post-apocalyptic rendition of 1980s Poland. This is the home to a survival horror adventure with some hefty helpings of sci-fi and time travel. You’ll play as a time-hopping Traveller, going back through time rifts to try and extract people who didn’t survive the apocalypse.</p>
<p>Co-directors Jacek Zieba and Wojciech Piejko gave us a tour of this setting. Amongst the inspirations are games like Dead Space and the challenge of Dark Souls, while movies such as Twelve Monkeys also provide some similar tones. The unusual looking suit for the Traveller is intended to look a bit like a deep sea diver, the heavy plates and the large dome-like helmet in particular. You’ll need that armour to survive encounters with the Orphans, the twisted human forms of what is left of humanity from this time, delving into a bit of body horror.</p>
<p>There’s some small snippets of gameplay within the dev diary, but Bloober say that a broader gameplay reveal will likely be coming soon.</p>

<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC sometime this year.</p>

            <p>
Ubisoft has announced its first sales milestone for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, which launched yesterday and had notched up more than a million players by the afternoon. 
</p>
<p>
It's our first indication of how well the game is performing, as a pivotal title not just for the Assassin's Creed series, but Ubisoft in general - though it is still very early.
</p>
<p>
"It's not even 4pm here in Canada and Assassin's Creed Shadows has already passed 1 million players," stated a message posted to the official <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1902802072640295067">Assassin's Creed social media account</a>. "Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for joining this adventure in Feudal Japan. We are beyond excited to start this journey with you!"

<p>
Assassin's Creed Shadows faces some tough comparisons - the series' last large launch Valhalla arrived in late 2020, when many of us were at home - and arrives at a time when Ubisoft is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-considering-fresh-business-to-own-assassins-creed-and-other-big-franchises-co-owned-by-others-like-tencent">reportedly considering a sale or some other kind of reorganisation to turn around its ailing fortunes</a>.
</p>
<p>
The game was also repeatedly delayed for further polish, following last year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> - another key title for Ubisoft, but one <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">which significantly underperformed</a>.
</p>
<p>
How well does Assassin's Creed Shadows have to do for Ubisoft to consider it a success? The publisher has not said. But it's worth considering the scope and scale of the game, the number of Ubisoft studios working on it, and the impact of those delays. 
</p>
<p>
For example, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-passes-major-sales-milestone-in-just-48-hours">Split Fiction notched up 1m sales in just 48 hours last week</a>, but will have cost far less to make and market.
</p>
<p>
An early look at <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3159330/charts/#1w">Steam figures</a> - as the only major platform to share player numbers publicly - shows a peak of 41,412 players overnight. But again, comparisons are difficult - the game is also available on PC via Ubisoft Connect, so this does not paint a full picture. 
</p>
<p>
In other words, it's likely we'll have to wait until after the game's first weekend - and likely more word from Ubisoft itself - before Shadows' early fortunes become clear.
</p>
<p>"Majestic in scope, impressive in detail, Ubisoft's epic adventure honours the beauty of feudal Japan, even if its strongest moments are saved for the personal stories of its two protagonists," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-review">Eurogamer's Assassin's Creed Shadows review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Remedy Entertainment has confirmed that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a> will launch this summer for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC, shared a healthy dose of gameplay and revealed one of the big supernatural dangers you’ll face in the game: Sticky Notes.</p>
<p><iframe title="Jobs and Gameplay – FBC: Firebreak (Community First Look)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4rdE55zqOOc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Oh sure, yellow sticky notes seem innocuous enough to you and me, their small size (often cut into cute shapes these days) and weak glue making them mildly useful, but in The Oldest House and with the Hiss still running rampant? Well, haunted sticky notes are a real problem. The gameplay reveal for FBC: Firebreak focuses on this Job, a crisis-filled mission that will take you to the Executive Sector of the Federal Bureau of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/control">Control</a>. This mission, titled Paper Chase, is just one of many to take on in the game, with the sole objective to destroy as many sticky notes as possible. Other missions might have you try to find mannequin ski instructors and load them onto a paranatural ski lift…</p>
<p>With three-player PvE co-op at its heart, you’ll have three saved loadouts to choose from, Crisis Kits, which are themed around a particular tool and playstyle. You’ll then pick the Threat Level and Clearance Level of a Job, determining the difficulty of enemies and then the complexity and length of the mission.</p>
<p>The trailer and dev diary both show plenty of what you’ll expect to face. There’s regular Hiss zombie-type enemies, bomb squad Hiss with much heavier armour, and then humanoid forms constructed entirely of sticky notes. There’s even a giant Sandman-like boss to battle. One thing you’ll have to be wary of is getting covered with sticky notes yourself, with allies able to wash you down or showers dotted around the world to do the same – albeit at the cost of slowing you down for a bit from the cold water, unless you fix the heaters for the showers.</p>

<p>In addition to standard weapons like shotguns, there’s also a crank-fired fluid projector, an electric charge impactor, and the big wrench which can have a squeaky toy pig attached to it.&nbsp;There’s plenty of Left 4 Dead vibes to the action here, with safe rooms helping to provide some structure to the levels, and the need to defend from alerted enemies.</p>
<p>Remedy has already confirmed that FBC: Firebreak will be available day one on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a>, PC Game Pass, PlayStation Plus Extra and PlayStation Plus Premium. In addition to this, they’ve now confirmed that all playable content will be available to all players for free, meaning any new levels will be playable for all. There’s no word on monetisation outside of that, but Remedy will share those details another time.</p>

			<p>Bloober Team <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuSJpd2c7UY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aired</a> the first episode of the Cronos: The New Dawn developer diary series during the Future Games Show: Spring Showcase 2025. This episode saw the game's two directors revealing a few details, such as the inspiration, which came from Carpenter's The Thing but also Netflix's TV series Dark, as well as Dead Space, movies like 12 Monkeys, and surprisingly even the Dark Souls series of games was cited as Bloober reportedly seeks to push this game into a slightly more challenging direction.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-is-bloober-teams-next-survival-horror-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, you play as one of the Travelers. They are being sent to the ruins of human civilization to search for the time rifts and jump back in time to extract people who didn't survive the apocalypse. Travelers are the only ones who can travel to the past and survive the inevitable encounters with monsters. The suit's design looks like a diver because Travelers are not typical soldiers, but more like divers in time.</p>
<p>The setting is an alternative history when the world ends in the 1980s with an apocalyptic event that the team called The Change. Interestingly, the monsters are called the Orphans because they are what was left by humanity. They can take different forms, so players will face different enemies with different abilities. The important ingredient, Bloober Team said, is body horror, perhaps a little bit as an homage to The Thing. So, they are only created from human flesh.</p>
<p>At the end of the deep dive, the directors also replied to a few rapid-fire community questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>There will be ladders</li>
<li>There will be locations with huge walls of flash</li>
<li>There may be aliens</li>
<li>Yes, you can punch monsters in the face (if they have a face)</li>
<li>Fire is important in the game</li>
<li>Dismemberment is featured in Cronos: The New Dawn, but it doesn't work like in Dead Space, as the team implemented their own take on combat</li>
</ul>

<p>Following the highly acclaimed launch of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, Bloober Team's next project is undoubtedly much anticipated among horror fans. The game is scheduled to launch later this year on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> may have only been released a couple of weeks ago, but there is already a bidding war for the rights to a reported film adaptation.</p>
<p>That's according to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/split-fiction-movie-video-game-adaptation-1236344367/">Variety</a>, which revealed a film adaptation of Hazelight's latest co-op caper is now in the pipeline. Sources told the publication that media company Story Kitchen - a name you may recognise from our coverage of other video game to screen projects, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/toejam-and-earl-film-in-the-works-at-amazon">ToeJam and Earl</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-survivors-animated-tv-series-in-the-works">Vampire Survivors</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/slime-rancher-movie-rights-acquired-by-production-company-story-kitchen">Slime Rancher</a> - is in the process of assembling the film's cast, writers and director.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Variety stated offers for rights to the Split Fiction film are "coming in from multiple top Hollywood studios", although no names were mentioned in today's report.</p>

<p>This is not the first Hazelight game reportedly getting a film adaptation. In 2022, marital platformer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hazelight-studios-acclaimed-it-takes-two-being-adapted-for-film-and-television">It Takes Two was also said to be making its way to both the big and small screen</a>.</p>
<p>It was later suggested that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-takes-two-movie-enters-development-at-amazon-studios-dwayne-johnson-may-star">Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson was attached to the film project</a>, while Pat Casey and Josh Miller - the writing duo behind dj2's live-action Sonic the Hedgehog movies - were working on the big screen adaptation.</p>
<p>Little has been heard of the project since, and earlier this year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/even-josef-fares-doesnt-know-whats-happening-with-the-it-takes-two-film-adaptation">Hazelight founder Josef Fares told Eurogamer even he didn't know what was happening with the It Takes Two film</a>.</p>

<p>As for Split Fiction, well, it has certainly done well for itself. Along with glowing reviews across the board, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-passes-major-sales-milestone-in-just-48-hours">the game sold 2m copies in the first week of release</a>.</p>
<p>"Fantastic from start to finish, Split Fiction is one of the most inventive and joyful co-op games to date, and a testament to the power of human imagination," our Katharine wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-review">Eurogamer's five star Split Fiction review</a>.</p>
<p>Also in Split Fiction news, earlier this week two players were invited to Sweden to see Hazelight's next game after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-players-invited-to-see-studios-next-game-after-beating-rock-hard-secret-level">they completed a secret level so challenging that "barely" any members of the studio's own team have managed to complete it</a>. "This is a crazy, crazy achievement," Fares told the skilled duo via a pre-recorded message found at the end of the level.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Microsoft seemingly has an update in mind for the Xbox App which will show every game users have installed on their PC. That includes titles on both Steam and Epic Games.</p>
<p>Microsoft inadvertently included a mockup of this  user interface as part of an official blog post titled <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/articles/2025/03/gdc-2025-opening-a-billion-doors-with-xbox/">GDC 2025: Opening a Billion Doors with Xbox</a>. It subsequently removed the image after enquiries were made, but not before eagle-eyed viewers took a copy.</p>
<p>The image itself, which you can see in the header above, showed an Xbox UI displayed on a TV screen, which at cursory glance may seem unextraordinary, however on closer inspection you can see the UI has a clear Steam tab listed along with the likes of Game Pass, Recently Added and Owned. Elsewhere in the image, the same UI with that telling Steam tab label is displayed on tablets and handheld devices.</p>

<p>While only a Steam label is visible on Xbox's mockup, sources tell <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/633478/microsoft-xbox-steam-games-support-ui">The Verge</a> Microsoft is working on an Xbox app update that will show <em>every</em> game users have installed on their PCs, so that includes the Epic Games Store even though it is missing from the image.</p>
<p>"I understand Microsoft will label these games accordingly," The Verge's Tom Warren writes, adding this update is still "in the early stages" of development. It may not even ship at all, Warren suggests.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has asked Microsoft for further comment on the leaked UI images.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the news, earlier this month it was reported Microsoft is aiming to release its next-gen Xbox Series X/S successor in 2027. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-next-gen-console-reportedly-targeting-2027-with-handheld-device-due-this-year">a much-rumoured handheld Xbox is said to be arriving later this year</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>During the Future Games Show: Spring Showcase 2025, TaleWorlds Entertainment announced that a new nautical expansion will launch this June for Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord.</p>
<p>Called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2927200/Mount__Blade_II_Bannerlord__War_Sails/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">War Sails</a>, it will introduce naval warfare for the first time, as well as a Viking-inspired faction and new explorable coastal regions. Players will be able to command fleets, engage in naval battles, board enemy ships, and enforce blockades, reshaping warfare on land and sea. According to TaleWorlds, the ability to explore by sea, conduct naval blockades, and engage in ship-based combat will influence battle strategies throughout Calradia, not just in the new territories. Beware, though: storms and attrition can undo even the best-laid plans.</p>
<p>Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord Players will have to master wind and water physics, board or ram ships, and cripple enemies by smashing oars, sinking hulls, or tearing sails. There are 18 ships available, each with unique handling characteristics shaped by wind and waves. They can be upgraded with siege engines, sails, and rams. Throughout the gameplay, players will get to acquire new ships, upgrade ports or win ships and figureheads.</p>
<p>The Nords call the new Northern Kingdom home. In true Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord style, players will be able to trade, recruit, or fight in this land of craggy peaks and icy fjords. The War Sails expansion also adds a northern sea, islands, rivers and open waters. Of course, players will also find new companions, Norse banners, hairstyles, tattoos, armor, unique weapons, new spears, swords, and axes.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord - War Sails - Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IA0YoFBX60M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The release of the War Sails expansion, scheduled for June 17, will also be accompanied by the release of the free patch v1.3. The developers are also planning further updates to introduce new gameplay mechanics, including stealth and disguise systems for dungeons and hideouts, random events that will tie into the character trait system, a Parley feature, numerous combat improvements, new weapon types, and additional exciting improvements for players and modders alike.</p>
<p>In closing, TaleWorlds announced that Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord has sold over five million units across all platforms since<a href="https://wccftech.com/mount-blade-ii-bannerlord-confirmed-to-launch-on-october-25th/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> its launch</a> a few years back.</p>
