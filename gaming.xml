If you meet the criteria, you can apply for the playtest from the “To application page” link <a href="https://playtest-p.nintendo.com/en-us">on Nintendo’s website starting today at 11AM ET / 8AM PT</a>. </p></div><p>Applications will stay open until October 15th at 10:59AM ET, though Nintendo says it will stop taking applications early if it reaches capacity.</p><p>I imagine you’ll be up against a legion of hopefuls, but if you want to throw your hat in the ring, here’s what you need to know:</p><p>Perhaps most importantly, is the fact that only people with an active Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership as of October 9th (that was Wednesday) at 6PM ET can apply. So, if you didn’t already subscribe to that tier, you’re out of luck.</p><p>You’ll also need to be at least 18 years old and have your Nintendo account registered in France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, the US, or the UK.</p><p>Nintendo will choose people on a first-come, first-served basis — unless you’re from Japan, where participants may be selected from a raffle “if there are many Japanese applicants.”</p><p>If you’re lucky enough to get in, the playtest will run from October 23rd at 9PM ET to November 5th at 7:59PM ET, and Nintendo says that you’ll have to download “exclusive software.”</p><p>I don’t currently subscribe to Nintendo Switch Online, so I’m unfortunately out of the running. Good luck to everyone who tries to get in. Tell me how the playtest is — whatever it is!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The game features an extensive technology tree, known as the Idea Tree, in which you can unlock new advancements that make surviving the frozen apocalypse easier. And to get it, you’ll need to build the Research Institute.</p><p>Here’s how to build and use the Research Institute in <em>Frostpunk 2</em>!</p><h2 id="h7939"><a id=""></a><strong>How to build the Research Institute</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="0d502d0ef85bd7b520489faee39b95ee" data-recommend-id="image://0d502d0ef85bd7b520489faee39b95ee" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The enormous construction area for the Research Institute." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The enormous construction area for the Research Institute." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->11 Bit Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0d502d0ef85bd7b520489faee39b95ee" data-recommend-id="image://0d502d0ef85bd7b520489faee39b95ee" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The enormous construction area for the Research Institute." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>To place a Research Institute, you require a tier-two Housing District. It’s not enough to plop down a bit of Housing, as it’s not large enough to accommodate a building upgrade. Instead, place the Housing District, select it once construction completes, and select the upgrade option—the left-most icon on the bottom of the pop-up that appears. It looks like four arrows expanding outward.<br></p><p>Of course, expansion isn’t free. You require prefabs and heatstamps to expand a Housing District. However, it’s not <em>overly</em> expensive and, at this point, it’s worth every single resource to unlock the technology tree.</p><p>With the Housing District leveled up to its second tier, select the Building construction menu from the bottom-right HUD. It’s the icon that looks like a building or a stack of boxes. Choose the Research Institute under Housing, then place it in your newly expanded District to kickstart research!</p><h2 id="h7940"><a id=""></a><strong>What to research first in Frostpunk 2</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="70fd33a8ed088a660e6672057c60b393" data-recommend-id="image://70fd33a8ed088a660e6672057c60b393" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The rather anticlimactic appearance of the Idea Tree." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The rather anticlimactic appearance of the Idea Tree." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->11 Bit Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="70fd33a8ed088a660e6672057c60b393" data-recommend-id="image://70fd33a8ed088a660e6672057c60b393" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The rather anticlimactic appearance of the Idea Tree." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You need to pick and choose wisely, as you can only research a single Idea at a time, making progress relatively slow—unless you optimize your research with additional Institutes across your settlement. You’ll want to prioritize city problems like heating and food production first, before delving into the necessary but less essential projects. Here’s a short list of research to prioritize:<br></p><ol data-type="List" data-style="Number"><li><strong>Housing Insulation</strong>: As your population grows, so do your heating requirements to keep everyone alive and happy. Housing Insulation reduces the base heat demand of all Housing Districts from 40 to 20, stretching your heating budget further.</li><li><strong>Hospitals</strong>: Found under the Society category, Hospitals help reduce the risk of widespread Disease and cure Sick Absentees regularly to keep your Workforce in rotation.</li><li><strong>Filtration Towers</strong>: A Housing District expansion, Filtration Towers help reduce your city’s squalor, which is crucial as you’ll spend a lot of resources investing in industrial districts that increase squalor significantly.</li><li><strong>Sawmills</strong>: Your settlement constantly requires additional resources to fund future developments, and Materials prove most important. A Sawmill upgrades your Extraction District, requiring a single building slot, producing additional materials, expanding your opportunities.</li><li><strong>Relationships</strong>: In the same vein as requiring an ever-expanding number of resources, you need a growing Workforce to satiate such demands and continue production. Relationships, found under the Society tree, increase Population Growth!</li></ol><hr><p>With your research underway, surviving the harsh world of <em>Frostpunk 2</em> may start to get a <em>little</em> easier.

<p>Overwatch appears to be heading to your phones and tablets. According to journalist Jason Schreier, Overwatch Mobile is in development at Blizzard.</p>



<p>The information comes from his new book, <a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/jason-schreier/play-nice/9781538725443/?lens=grand-central-publishing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, and Future of Blizzard Entertainment</a>.</p>







<p>“Overwatch was led by Walter Kong, who oversaw the release of regular heroes and content for Overwatch 2, as well as new projects like a mobile version of the franchise,” Schreier wrote in his book.</p>



<p>No other details about the game were revealed, including a potential release date. It’s also worth noting that Blizzard has yet to publicly announce Overwatch Mobile. That said, it being included in the book is confirmation that it is being worked on.</p>



<p>In addition to Overwatch Mobile, Blizzard did have a Netflix series in production based on the game. That was cancelled, however, due to Blizzard suing Netflix.</p>



<p>Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, and Future of Blizzard Entertainment is available now in either physical or e-book.</p>

                <p>Ahead of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metaphor-refantazio/" data-ref-id="5000-590950">Metaphor ReFantazio</a>'s release on October 11, Sega has announced that it'll give one fan in the UK the chance to become a royal member of the world's smallest--and unrecognized--sovereign state. The lucky winner will be granted the title of "Hand to the Sovereign Prince of Sealand" and will also receive a boat trip to see the micro-nation.</p><p>To enter, residents living in the United Kingdom must post a video on why they deserve to become nobility. Fittingly, this ties into the central plot of Metaphor ReFantazio, as the game focuses on a race to win the hearts of the people and become recognized as the next king of a magical kingdom.</p><p>If you're unfamiliar with it, Sealand has a long and fascinating history. Originally built during World War 2 and christened HM Fort Roughs, it was decommissioned after the war and was taken over by pirate-radio broadcasters. In 1967 it was seized by Paddy Roy Bates, who intended to form his own pirate-radio station at the time. Bates then declared the independence of Roughs Tower and the establishment of the Principality of Sealand.</p><p>Its status as an independent nation hasn't been officially acknowledged by any government, although the Principality of Sealand claims that it was de facto recognized by the UK and Germany through a UK court ruling and Germany's dispatch of a diplomat to the offshore platform. Bates passed away in 2012, but Sealand does remain in the hands of his family and associates. If you're interested in the history of Sealand, there are several documentaries detailing its founding and several attempts to hijack the fort.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeTgAwkbP5E" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UeTgAwkbP5E" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"When my grandfather founded Sealand in the 1960s, one of his first actions was to bestow the title of Princess Joan on my grandmother," Prince Liam Bates said in a press release. "In the more than five decades since we've established several noble titles, but never a Hand to the Prince. We've achieved a lot as the world’s smallest nation but this partnership with Sega and Atlus to create a one-off title marks our first foray into the world of video games, and it's a venture future Sealand Royals will look back on with pride."</p><p>Metaphor ReFantazio is only the second game this year to receive a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-gamespot-10-10-review-score/2900-153/" data-ref-id="2900-153">rare 10/10 score on GameSpot</a>, as the new IP from Atlus has been praised for its polished turn-based action, imaginative art direction, and a story that offers several surprises.</p><p>"Metaphor: ReFantazio combines Atlus' skill in crafting emotionally charged RPGs with brilliant plot twists, a keen sense of adventure, and fantastical idealism to create one of its greatest games yet," Jessica Cogswell wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metaphor-refantazio-review-everybody-wants-to-rule-the-world/1900-6418297/">Metaphor ReFantazio</a> review.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-woke-up-thinking-about-how-good-the-game-echo-was.1006041/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/echo-ultra-ultra<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A lot of thoughts go through my head in the morning. The first is usually about getting coffee into myself as quickly as possible. The next is usually a rundown of all the things I have to do that day. This morning, though, I had a nice break from my standard to-do list panic when I suddenly thought, “Boy, <em>Echo</em> was a great game.”</p><p><em>Echo</em> was a stealth game from 2017, by a studio called Ultra Ultra that <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/echo-developer-ultra-ultra-has-closed-down" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">abruptly closed down in 2019</a>, leaving <em>Echo</em> its only game. It had a convoluted sci-fi plot focused on a young woman named En, who goes to an elegant space station called a Palace to use its technology to try to resurrect her grandfather. The backstory of this mission has something to do with a cult she grew up in, and we learn more about all that through moments in the game when En walks and talks/bickers with her AI companion London.</p><p>When I covered <em>Echo</em> for <a href="https://kotaku.com/echo-is-a-terrifying-game-where-you-teach-enemies-how-t-1818592258" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the old site</a>, I found the game’s opening hours slow, but came to miss them as the game got into its core action. The Palace is full of beings En called “Echoes,” copies of herself that fill each spacious room by the dozen. Here’s where things get weird, but also awesome: when the lights are on, anything En does is recorded by the Palace. After a while, the Palace has a blackout and then reboots; in the next light cycle, the Echoes learn to do anything En did in the previous cycle. In between the end of a light cycle and the reboot, there’s a brief period of semi-darkness where En can do anything she wants.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="ECHO - LAUNCH TRAILER" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kMtMCD4z3z4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>(Warning: There are some flashing lights in this video)</figcaption></figure></div><p>One of your first introductions to this is a level where multiple Echoes are separated from En by water they can’t cross. En has to cross it, though, to reach a key she needs to unlock a door. On the next light cycle, the Echoes can walk through the water because En did it, meaning you’ve lost one of your tools for avoiding them.</p><p>The whole roughly six-hour game is this give-and-take. You can crouch and sneak to avoid Echoes, but then they can do it too. You can run, but they’ll run, and they’re always faster than you. You can make the game’s worst decision and use your gun, but it <em>sucks</em> when the Echoes get a gun.</p><p>As I wrote in 2017,</p><blockquote><p><em>Echo</em> uses the hallmarks of good stealth play against you. Creativity and improvisation are usually the sole possession of the player, weapons against the patterns and limits of the AI. But when anything you do can be done to you in turn, thinking like a stealth player becomes a liability. In-the-moment calculations have immediate rewards and future risks. In one level, I tried to avoid opening doors as much as possible so I could close off the Echoes in [the] next round, but this meant taking circuitous routes through the Palace’s rooms and having to vault barriers instead, which led to a round of Echoes vaulting up behind me. I ate fruit I didn’t need to slow Echoes down, only to find them loitering near my cover spots next time, munching away. The AI isn’t that smart, but there are a lot of them, and when they can do the kinds of things usually only a player can do, they can be unstoppable.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p><em>Echo</em>’s design means the game seems to always have a counter for anything you do, with both stealth and run-and-gun having their own consequences. The goal of each level is to gather a number of keys you need to get to the next level, which forces you to move through space, encountering Echoes and making choices and then creating new problems for yourself. Our Kotaku colleague Harper made an excellent video breaking down exactly how the game’s design creates its unique brand of tension.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Tricks That Make Echo's Stealth Gameplay So Tense" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cgu1QlgivJo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I remember the absolutely revelatory feeling of playing it, with its unusual twist on one of my favorite genres making me think about stealth games in a whole new way. (I’d call it a stealth game, but it doesn’t <em>have</em> to be; blending genres was another of the cool things <em>Echo</em> did.) It’s not a perfect game by any stretch: the tense levels can be unpleasant depending on your stress tolerance, and interrupting the action with long sections of forced slow walking and exposition can mess with the pacing. You could argue it never does anything new with its core mechanic, but honestly, thank goodness: you get enough variables in each light-and-dark cycle without adding <em>more</em> to the mix. There’s no one strategy that will work the whole way through, and I never found any tricks or ways to “game” the design. You just have to face what the game wants you to face, dealing with the Echoes and with <a href="https://x.com/rcmacleod/status/910341686613725185" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">your own choices</a> as best you can.</p><p>I don’t know why Ultra Ultra shut down. In its announcement, the studio wrote simply that “Ultra Ultra has ceased to exist,” and its inactive <a href="https://www.facebook.com/uullttrraa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook</a> page says “Ultra Ultra is a defunct Indie Game Studio. We made ECHO before disappearing into the void.” It feels criminal that <em>Echo</em> was the studio’s only game; there was a movie in the works, but no one seems to have heard about it since 2019. While I doubt the movie still exists, I also don’t think it would do justice to what makes the game special. <em>Playing</em> it is the best way to experience it, which luckily you can still do on PC and PlayStation. If you missed it in 2017, you should absolutely check it out.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Sports Interactive has delayed the launch of Football Manager 25 again - this time until 2025.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://x.com/FootballManager/status/1844377892303798752">statement</a> this afternoon, the developer said it had agreed with publisher Sega to postpone the game's launch on all platforms until March next year.
</p>
<p>
Previously, the footy sim had been set to arrive on 26th November for PC, PS5 and Xbox (and on Nintendo Switch on 3rd December). Before that, it had been expected earlier this year.
</p>
<p>
"After careful consideration, Sports Interactive have made the tough decision to further delay the release of Football Manager 25," the developer wrote in a statement released this afternoon. "Following discussions with Sega, our licensors and partners, we have agreed the best course of action is to delay the launch until March 2025. Specific platform release dates will follow once confirmed.
</p><p>
"In our last Development Update in September, we explained that we needed to push FM25's original release back to give ourselves more time to deliver the best possible experience for this first instalment in a new era of Football Manager.
</p>
<p>
"This additional time has not been sufficient to ensure the game quality and experience meets your expectations and our very high standards. In the previous blog we explained that it has been a difficult development cycle for the studio. Many things have been moving slower than we had predicted - despite everyone in the team working at an incredible pace to try and get everything done. 
</p>
<p>
"Timelines were already tight and, as rightly pointed out by many of your recent comments, we were simply rushing too much and in danger of compromising our usual standards. This has put an enormous amount of pressure on everyone working across the studio, who are all passionately committed to delivering the best game possible. 
</p>
<p>
"FM25 is the biggest technical and visual advancement in the series for a generation. We simply cannot compromise the delivery of this crucial juncture in Football Manager’s history by rushing to release it in November. Of course, this is not where any of us expected to be seven weeks out from our release but, in the spirit of our studio values, we always consider the bigger picture – and the bigger picture here is that we need this additional time to deliver a game that we can all be proud of.
</p>
<p>
"For the large numbers of you who have already pre-ordered the game, we thank you very much for your trust and support. Given the delay, however, should you wish to claim a refund, please contact your retailer.
</p>
<p>
"Something you noted as missing from our announcement on 30th September was mention of Advanced Access on PC/Mac. We can confirm Advanced Access will be available ahead of the new release date and, when we are confident on how long that period will be, we will update you at the first opportunity. The new gameplay reveal will also now move to the end of January 2025.
</p><p>
"We are intensely aware that this will be massively disappointing for you. We share that disappointment and are extremely sorry. Thank you for reading and your patience. It means the world to us as we continue to work on creating a new era for Football Manager."
</p>

"It's been a difficult year," Jacobson admitted to Eurogamer. "[But] it's been a great learning experience!"

            <p>Brighter Shores, the upcoming MMO from Fen Research, is having its early access launch on Steam pushed back by a single day to Wednesday 6th November. Why? Well there's that whole US election happening on Tuesday 5th November, so Andrew Gower, one of the founders of Fen Research announced the one-day push back on his <a href="https://x.com/AndrewCGower">X (formally Twitter) account</a> yesterday.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">We have decided to push the launch of Brighter Shores back to the 6th Nov, because apparently there is some sort of election thingy on the 5th - who knew?!</p>— Andrew Gower (@AndrewCGower) <a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewCGower/status/1844016463205785795?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 9, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>Andrew Gower is best known for being one of the creators of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/runescape">RuneScape</a>, having developed the long-running MMO alongside his brother Ian and Paul. RuneScape continues to be a popular title in the MMO scene since its release in 2001. It even gained a sister title in 2013 with Old School RuneScape where players can enjoy the traditional RS gameplay from 2007. (The XP grind will never die.) Gower, however, left Jagex in 2010 and founded Fen Research shortly after his departure, with development on Brighter Shores beginning in September 2016.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">People often ask me when I started creating Brighter Shores. The answer is rather complex so I made a picture. P.S. Only 12 people have Steam keys to the alpha, most of them staff, so don't be upset that you don't have one :) <a href="https://t.co/oNBank94RG">pic.twitter.com/oNBank94RG</a></p>— Andrew Gower (@AndrewCGower) <a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewCGower/status/1819021220911673582?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 1, 2024</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>From the graphics to what we know of the gameplay, Brighter Shores definitely has a RuneScape vibe to it. I would know - I've been playing RuneScape for like 18 years. (Honestly, it could be longer. I've started to lose track a little. Let's just say Lottie's played a lot of RuneScape for a long while.) Combat is divided into melee, range and magic through three classes: Cryoknight (melee), Guardian (range) and Hammermage (magic). Meanwhile, Brighter Shore's professions, such as Fisher, Chef and Woodcutter, have a similar flavour to RuneScape's selection of skills, like Fishing, Cooking and Woodcutting.</p>

</figure>
<p>Still just because a cabbage looks the same, doesn't mean it tastes the same and the difference always reveals itself in the eating. (Cabbage is a RuneScape joke. Sorry, I couldn't help myself.) Brighter Shores promises to have an on-going storyline released in episodic format; beginning with the player starting their new job as a town guard in Hopeport. Each episode will then add additional features to the MMO, such as new areas and side quests. There will also be no microtransactions in Brighter Shores, with the MMO instead being divided into two tiers - one for free-to-play and a Premium Pass, which will include additional locations and features, like player-to-player trading.</p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/AndrewCGower/status/1825657416983392507">Gower has stated, again on X</a>, that Brighter Shores will remain in early access until PvP is added and that 'There will NOT be a save reset at the end of early access.' This means everyone's free to venture to Hopeport on 6th November without the worry of losing any progress later down the development line. You may get to experience Brighter Shores a little earlier though if you're part of its closed beta starting on Tuesday 22nd October.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/infinity-nikki-beta-hands-on-preview-%E2%80%93-glitz-and-glamor.1006008/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/infinity-nikki-preview-glitz-and-glamor/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As someone who has never played a game <a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/en/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from the Nikki series</a> but knew a lot about it from other people talking about the mobile games, I was truly shocked playing the Closed Beta of Infinity Nikki. My time with the game was short, but I can't wait for more. If you're someone who loves to customize your character, unlock new outfits, and get to play dress-up, this is the perfect game for that. Typically, I avoid the<a href="https://wccftech.com/infinity-nikki-reaches-20-million-pre-registrations/"> gacha game</a> experience, and it took me a while to realize that Infinity Nikki was a gacha game until it was mentioned in a tutorial. Compared to other gacha games, the micro-transaction part of the game didn't feel like it was forced on you or like you were being influenced into purchasing something.</p>
<p>Instead, it simply felt like an accessory to the game, where you could form your own decisions about whether you used the system or not. However, stepping into the world of Infinity Nikki was nothing short of magical. From the high-definition graphics to the sparkle effects on the clothing, I was enamored immediately.</p>
<p>As a kid growing up with browser games, I spent a lot of time playing dress-up games online, including StarDoll. Growing up, I continued to love games where I could dress characters up and customize them, which is why I have such an intense love of The Sims, even today. Getting to step into a world full of magic, glitz and glamor felt like a dream come true, and every second I played of Infinity Nikki was an absolute delight.</p>
<p>The fashion wasn't the only thing that blew me away. The Unreal Engine 5-powered graphics and location designs were absolutely stunning, and I ended up with quite a few screenshots just to create some backgrounds for my laptop. The lighting was perfect, and it was very realistic and magical to look at. In certain locations, it reminded me of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, but with more realistic animations and stylistic choices.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/infinity-nikki-flying-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>


<p>Going into it, I had no idea what to expect. I knew it was an open-world game, but that was as far as my knowledge went. What I wasn't expecting was to have to complete puzzles, take part in delicate platforming, and fight enemies. The enemies in the game reminded me a lot of the Heartless from Kingdom Hearts, giving me a little shot of nostalgia when I'd have to interact with them. Although it wasn't much of a combat sequence, as you just had to fire a purification orb at them, they would disappear.</p>
<p>I liked that Nikki's dress would change depending on what abilities she had to use. For example, if she had to jump and float, her dress would change into a gorgeous blue dress full of shimmer as she floated on bubbles to get to her location. It reminded me a lot of typical girly toys you'd get as a kid, like the Barbie dolls that would change color when submerged in water.</p>
<p>The first city you stumble upon is beautiful and teeming with life, with plenty of different characters to talk to, mini-games to complete, and side-quests to embark on. One of the mini-games I enjoyed was having to steer a paper crane away from trees and stones to be able to complete it. It wasn't difficult by any means, but it had a lovely, unique animation style.</p>
<p>My only gripe came when entering the Stylist's Guild. For some reason, you go from being able to pan your camera around as much as you want to a locked camera. Maybe it was a bug or just my game having issues, but it made navigating the area really difficult. I found myself running into walls time and time again to try and figure out how to leave the building.</p>

<p>Overall, my experience with Infinity Nikki was a great one. I loved figuring out how to platform and parkour my way to getting items, finding secret chests with new clothing, and discovering secrets around every corner. I truly cannot wait for this game to be fully released, and I just know it will be a huge time-sink for me. The game doesn't have a release date yet, but it should be available soon on PC (via <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/infinity-nikki-71fc64?lang=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>), <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/infinity-nikki/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/infinity-nikki/id6502622570" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iOS</a>, and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.infoldgames.infinitynikkien" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wizard-of-legend-2-roadmap<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Dead Mage and publisher Humble Games have revealed the&nbsp;<em>Wizard of Legend 2&nbsp;</em>roadmap, showing off what's coming to the co-op action roguelite during its Early Access period.</p>
<p><em>Wizard of Legend&nbsp;</em><em>2&nbsp;</em>was released just a couple of days ago, but Dead Mage is already looking to the future, and it looks like that future is solid despite <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/humble-games-lays-off-over-30-employees-as-it-restructures">Humble Games' recent layoffs and restructuring</a>.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2193540/view/4670886977421955728" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam post</a> titled "What to Expect for&nbsp;<em>Wizard of Legend 2</em>!", Dead Mage says today's roadmap is intended to show off what the team is working on, but that there's still room to "adapt based on your feedback and input".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizard-of-legend-2-roadmap-full.jpg?itok=dueteFXB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizard-of-legend-2-roadmap-full.jpg?itok=fQGq0fwi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Lots of new stuff is on its way to&nbsp;<em>Wizard of Legend 2&nbsp;</em>in the coming months.</figcaption></figure><p>The&nbsp;<em>Wizard of Legend 2&nbsp;</em>roadmap isn't organized by time, and the new features it promises are presented "in no particular order", Dead Mage says.</p>
<p>New biomes, including the Castle and "the Final Biome", are on the way, and you can also expect two brand new elemental bosses based on Fire and Wind, both of whom will have unique attacks for you to deal with.</p>
<p>You can expect the game's story to be significantly expanded during the Early Access period, with Dead Mage promising "more profound lore and story elements", and, of course, you'll be getting more Arcana, as well as more upgrades and enhancements for those Arcana.</p>
<p>Other improvements promised by the roadmap include four-player co-op play, as well as more relics and medallions, more contracts, and more ways to customize the game. It's Dead Mage's hope that these additions "provide endless replayability" for&nbsp;<em>Wizard of Legend 2</em>.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Wizard of Legend 2</em>, it is, believe it or not, the sequel to <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/wizard-of-legend">the original</a>&nbsp;<em>Wizard of Legend</em>.</p>
<p>Released last week in Early Access,&nbsp;<em>Wizard of Legend 2&nbsp;</em>introduces a new 3D visual style, as well as new spells, new challenges, and more. Dead Mage says the plan right now is to stay in Early Access "for at least six months".</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Wizard of Legend&nbsp;</em>on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2193540/Wizard_of_Legend_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> right now.</p>

Astonishingly, the game has yet to feature major monsters like Arceus, Naganadel and Silvally, and even the most banal minor names like Phione, Honedge and Blipbug. The gaps in Gen VII are inexplicable. But fortunately, one such enormity is being addressed: at long last, this Halloween, Morpeko is arriving.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="192873" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Pocket Monsters And Simulated Goats" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="133" data-playlist="192873,196165,194141" data-current="192873"><div><p>The Week In Games: Pocket Monsters And Simulated Goats</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192873/192873_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192873/192873_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192873/192873_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192873/192873_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/18337.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The Gen 8 <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pikachu-raichu-pichu-clones-mimikyu-pachirisu-1850622444&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pikachu-raichu-pichu-clones-mimikyu-pachirisu-1850622444">Pikachu-like</a></span> is wonderful because it represents us all. Morpeko, admittedly one of the more shameless examples of a Pika-clone, has two forms: One is Full Belly Mode, and the other is Hangry Mode. Yes, you feel seen.</p><p>Why is it so prone to the major munchies? Because while this flagrant cut-and-paste of Pokémon’s main mascot goes as far as to including it generating electricity in sacs in its cheeks, in Morpeko’s case, this is a major drain on its energy levels, leading to becoming ravenous. And if that appetite isn’t quickly sated, it causes a hormone imbalance that induces a physical transformation—Jekyll &amp; Hyde-style—where its fur and eyes change color, and its mood becomes aggressive and volatile. Or put more simply, when it gets hungry, it gets <em>mad</em>.</p><h2 id="h19549"><a id=""></a>Morpeko finally shows up</h2><p>Come October 22, from 10 a.m. (no matter where you live), Morpeko will finally be appearing in <em>POGO</em>, and brings with it a small tweak to battling. Form changes have been entirely ignored by the mobile app as an element of battles until now, so it’s nice to see it feature. Although it’s pretty much by default, as Morpeko will change form each time you use a Charged Attack, and at first, only when fighting Team Rocket or in the GO Battle League.</p><p>Also, while I’m sure Niantic will find a way <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-go-sword-shield-path-galar-timed-challenge-1851659409&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-go-sword-shield-path-galar-timed-challenge-1851659409">to charge money for things that happen in the game anyway</a></span>, you’ll be able to get the monster without paying. Morpeko will be a reward encounter in the GO Battle League, which is free to take part in.</p><p>Talking of charging you for things, Niantic’s continued effort to paywall everything that used to just be a nice part of playing <em>Pokémon Go</em> continues, with costumed characters rewarded for Timed Research this Halloween put behind a $2 or $5 ticket. Joy. And, as ever, a bunch of them are recycled. Imagine, Piplup in a pumpkin hat! Drifloon in a boater! Again! (Good lord, I have the same behatted Drifloon and Piplup on my account from <em>2021</em>.

Take on the role of Falconet, a young bogatyr born without hero’s powers, shunned and underestimated by almost everyone around him. Conquer numerous ordeals, overcome insurmountable odds, and become a legendary hero whose tales will be told for ages to come.</p><p>Falconet dreams of following in the footsteps of his father, a fabled bogatyr—but during what seems like a simple task, he finds himself in the dark and mysterious Far Far Kingdom where he meets his demise. To his surprise, the young hero is revived by a mysterious spirit with whom he must now share his body. Falconet faces three daunting tasks: reclaim control over his soul, uncover an ancient mystery surrounding his new companion, and save the world from imminent doom.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_920593"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->

            <p>There's a new Star Wars game on the horizon. No, I am not talking about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heavy-rain-developer-quantic-dream-reveals-star-wars-eclipse">Eclipse</a> or even that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kotor-remake-alive-and-well-says-saber-interactive-ceo">Knights of the Old Republic remake</a>. I am in fact talking about the surprise announcement of Star Wars: Episode I: Jedi Power Battles, a spruced up version of the original game, which first released all the way back in 2000 (slowly crumbles to dust).</p>
<p>Star Wars: Episode I: Jedi Power Battles is developed by Aspyr, and coming to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. It will feature improved gameplay, enhanced models, the option to play with modern or classic controls and so on. It will also have all secret characters and levels from the original game unlocked from the start, so you maul as Darth Maul from the off if you so desire.</p>
<p>There are also going to be 13 newly unlocked playable characters to battle it out with on Star Wars: Episode I: Jedi Power Battles' release. These include a Rifle Droid and a Tusken Raider. My favourite feature, though. The cheats are all there as well. Big Head Mode, here we come. You can check out the announcement trailer for Star Wars: Episode I: Jedi Power Battles below.</p>

<p>I just hope Aspyr releases a slightly, erm, more polished Star Wars game this time. </p>
<p>The developer released its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-battlefront">Star Wars: Battlefront</a> Classic Collection earlier this year, but it arrived in a bit of a sorry state, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/players-criticise-star-wars-battlefront-classic-collection-for-bugs-server-woes-at-launch">numerous bugs and severe lack of preparation for online multiplayer</a>.</p>
<p>Aspyr was also originally at the helm of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-confirms-aaa-project-has-switched-studios-following-report-of-kotor-trouble">KOTOR remake</a>, before development was moved to Saber Interactive.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fifa-konami-esports-partner<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>FIFA has announced that Konami is its new partner for the FIFAe World Cup esports event, replacing former partner EA, with whom FIFA parted ways back in 2022.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/konami-replaces-ea-as-fifas-esports-partner" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a GamesIndustry.biz report</a>, the free-to-play football (sorry, but I'm going to be saying "football" throughout rather than "soccer") game <i>eFootball&nbsp;</i>will now be the game in which the esports World Cup takes place.</p>
<p>Naturally, prior to this partnership, that honor went to EA's <i>FIFA&nbsp;</i>series, but that franchise was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-fifa-games-to-be-replaced-with-ea-sports-fc-next-year">renamed to&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-fifa-games-to-be-replaced-with-ea-sports-fc-next-year">EA Sports FC</a>&nbsp;</em>following the split between EA and FIFA. A reason for the split was technically never officially revealed, although <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/it-really-looks-like-fifa-23-wont-be-thing" rel="noopener" target="_blank">it was reported</a> that a licensing fee dispute was the cause.</p>

<p>A total of 18 countries have been invited to take part, including England, France, Brazil, and Portugal, among others. The champion will be named at the conclusion of each tournament.</p>
<p>Konami senior executive officer Koji Kobayashi says he's grateful to FIFA for giving Konami the opportunity to play host to the FIFAe World Cup, and that it looks forward to sharing the "enthusiasm, excitement, and joy" of players worldwide.</p>
<p>FIFA CBO Romy Gai, meanwhile, says the association is "incredibly excited" to team up with Konami, and that the partnership is part of FIFA's "mission to promote football globally".</p>

<p>Still, FIFA's decision to partner with the studio that created the game which was, at one point, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/efootball-2022-just-released-but-its-already-worst-rated-game-on-steam">Steam's worst-rated game of 2021</a>&nbsp;is perhaps a touch questionable.

<p>Elsewhere in Konami news, the company's gaming CEO Steve Sutherland was recently <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241010529209/en/Konami-Gaming-CEO-Steve-Sutherland-Awarded-AGEM-Memorial-Award-for-Excellence-in-Commercial-Gaming-Professionalism" rel="noopener" target="_blank">handed a trade association award</a> for "excellence in commercial gaming professionalism".

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/astro-a50-wireless-headset-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Logitech has released the Astro A50 Wireless 5th Gen headset, an audio-based marvel that will sit atop a gamer’s head as if it were a crown. This versatile, sumptuous device offers unparalleled audio quality, stellar comfort levels, and intense customisation options – but all that is reflected in the price. If you’ve been sitting on the fence about this device because of the price point, hopefully, this Astro A50 Wireless headset review can set your mind straight.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-pretty-penny-gorgeous-peripherals">Pretty Penny, Gorgeous Peripherals</h2>



<p>The Astro A50 Wireless headset is now in its fifth generation, and this latest evolution is a superb one. Logitech has packed so many features into one device with the new Astro A50, allowing users to take advantage of the company’s proprietary LIGHTSPEED technology and PLAYSYNC Audio mechanics.</p>



<p>That means that the wireless connectivity of the Astro A50 is lightning fast, and thanks to the enhanced base station, you can connect it to three devices at once and switch between them at the tap of a tactile button – it’s brilliant.</p>



<p>It’ll run up quite a bill, though. The Astro A50 Wireless Gen 5 headset floats around $300, which makes it one of the most expensive gaming headsets on the market, but believe me when I say it’s worth every penny. From the broadcast-grade omnidirectional microphone to the Pro-G Graphene drivers, every inch of the Astro A50 Gen 5 headset is <strong>premium</strong>.</p>



<p>It comes in at just 363 grams, which means that the hulking frame of the A50 is decisively misleading. It looks like it should be much heavier, but it’s a wonder to wear it for hours on end without suffering from any fatigue. No matter what game you’re playing, you’ll be soaking up pinpoint spatial sound while taking advantage of phenomenally comfortable padding around the ears and the top of your head.</p>



<p>It has now been more than 12 years since the first Astro A50 headset was released, and from content creators to competitive esports players, it has become a firm favourite of so many gamers worldwide. The Gen 5 release represents the cherry on top; the icing on the cake in the form of a true multi-dimensional headset that’s a must-have for the multi-platform gamer.</p>



<h2 id="h-into-the-performance">Into the Performance</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The Astro A50 Wireless Gen 5 headset looks good in black or white, but how does it perform?</figcaption></figure>







<p>I’m in love with the Astro A50’s magnetic charging dock. As a forgetful gamer, I’ll leave wireless accessories out until their batteries run flat, but since testing the Astro A50, I haven’t once managed to leave it hanging on a monitor or sitting on my desk. It’s <strong>satisfying </strong>to click the headset into the stand and have it sitting in pride of place on a nearby shelf.</p>



<p>The status indicators on the base unit are super helpful, too. Even when you’re wearing the headset, a slight glance to the base unit will give you an indication of the battery level. With up to 24 hours of playtime on a full charge, you’ll find it hard to run the headset into the ground, which is fantastic.</p>



<p>The <strong>one drawback </strong>I have is that my PlayStation and Xbox consoles are across the other side of the room to my PC, so it’s almost not possible to have them connected to the base unit unless I use a really long USB-C cable. It means I can’t use the PLAYSYNC technology effectively, but it’s not a deal-breaker for me, as I’d have bought this <strong>to use it</strong> <strong>exclusively </strong>on PC games.</p>



<p>On all platforms, you can take advantage of the ‘mixamp-like’ audio mixing features, and on PlayStation and Xbox, you can use Dolby Atmos or PlayStation 3D Audio for better depth of sound. </p>



<p>The Astro A50 Gen 5 really shines brightest on PC, though. This is where you can utilise the G Hub software to fully tweak the device (G App is useful elsewhere), and you’ll get 24-bit audio by default without needing to worry about the HDMI 2.1 AV passthrough requirement.</p>



<p>I found that when playing a shooter like Escape from Tarkov, where every sound matters, I was picking up footsteps and audio cues much clearer, and the directional clarity was second-to-none. I’ve been around the houses when it comes to headsets, and the Astro A50 Gen 5 is without a doubt the cream of the crop.</p>



<p>Ultimately, Logitech’s Astro A50 Wireless Gen 5 headset is an audio experience in a tangible form. It sounds phenomenal, feels great on your head, and offers enough features under the hood to make the price point worthwhile. When you throw in the high-tech and attractive base unit, you’ve got one hell of a peripheral package that any gamer should be proud to own.</p>

                <p>Giant spiders have been a fantasy trope for a long time. From Shelob in The Lord of the Rings to the arachnids in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-origins-review/1900-6238632/" data-ref-id="1900-6238632">Dragon Age: Origins</a> and its subsequent follow-up games. But later this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-gone-gold/1100-6526915/" data-ref-id="1100-6526915">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> will buck this trend by excluding spiders from the entire game.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/comments/1fz1yyu/comment/lqzsrqc/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a Reddit thread</a>, a BioWare associate community manager confirmed that there are no spiders in The Veilguard. This marks a significant change for the franchise, since the arachnids were so common in Origins and also present in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-ii-review/1900-6301579/" data-ref-id="1900-6301579">Dragon Age 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-inquisition-review/1900-6415949/" data-ref-id="1900-6415949">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a>.</p><p>No one seems to have asked the obvious question about whether there's an in-game reason for the absence of spiders. In the real world, Saint Patrick's Day is partially based on the myth that Saint Patrick drove all of the snakes out of Ireland. If someone rid Thedas of all its spiders, shouldn't they get their own holiday? It seems only fair, even if it's just an excuse to get drunk in-game.</p><p>Just because the spiders are gone doesn't mean The Veilguard will be lacking in fearsome enemies to fight. One of the recently revealed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay-trailer-unleashes-an-epic-dragon-battle/1100-6526689/" data-ref-id="1100-6526689">gameplay trailers depicted an epic battle</a> between the player's character Rook and a blighted dragon. Perhaps whoever got rid of the spiders should have dealt with the dragons first.</p><p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard will hit PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on October 31.</p>

Activision said this requirement is in place to "deliver the highest-quality visuals while also reducing the game's overall storage space on your hard drive."</p>

"With these capabilities, we can cycle content that is less frequently used by players to a streaming cache, avoiding the need to download it directly to your device's storage.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/10/mario-luigi-brothership-preview/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s a little odd to think it, but since the turn of the century, Mario’s been as much of a role-playing powerhouse as a platforming icon. Between <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/21/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-switch-review/">Paper Mario</a>, Mario &amp; Luigi and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/10/17/mario-rabbids-sparks-of-hope-review/">Mario + Rabbids</a>, there’s actually been more new RPGs than jump man adventures, and that lead is only going to be extended next month with the release of Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership – Making Memories in Concordia – Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tffEKtODS4g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>it’s actually been nine years since the last new Mario &amp; Luigi game, with a couple of remakes during the Nintendo 3DS’s twilight years. The original developer AlphaDream closed down after the last of these remakes failed to perform, leaving the series’ future in doubt. However, it’s lovely to see it get another chance. We don’t know the name of the studio yet – Nintendo being as mysterious as ever – but some of the original developers were noted as being involved.</p>


<p>This new game sees the most iconic Italian brothers since Romulus and Remus thrown into another adventure in strange lands. Concordia has been shattered into islands, and this dynamic duo are the only ones that can help the local partner characters Connie and Snoutlet –&nbsp;not a pig –&nbsp;drag the realm back together again.</p>
<p>With an island adventure before them, they’re going to need a boat. What they end up with is Shipshape Island, a ship that’s also an island, able to traverse the seas and search for new islands to launch Mario and Luigi at from a cannon. Each island then needs to be linked back to Shipshape by finding a magical lighthouse and connecting their beacons together.</p>


<p>We got to fire ourselves at two islands from the game, showing that early evolution of introductory gameplay, as well as some of the pair’s new tricks. Landing on Twister Island, and needing to reach one of the locals who’s now stranded up on a clifftop, the famous twisting vines having withdrawn because nobody’s dancing anymore… and nobody’s dancing because there’s a serious hair gel shortage. It’s a real struggle, but thankfully it’s not that tricky to find Spiralia, the one person who knows how to make hair gel, and get them back to their shop, even if they work in the middle of a forest that’s full of bugs they are absolutely petrified of.</p>
<p>It’s an absolutely barmy series of situations in isolation, and I hope there’s a bit more heft to the overarching narrative of the game. Still, this allows the familiar Mario &amp; Luigi tandem gameplay shines through. Just getting around the world is a quirky little challenge, as pressing ‘A’ makes Mario jump and ‘B’ makes Luigi jump, who is invariably right on his heels, and you can get the pleasing one-two jump as you lead the pair around (though it’s far more forgiving than I remember the GBA original being). There’s some environmental puzzling here, as helping Spiralia requires you to carry her past meandering bugs, hopping over ledges and passing her back and forth between the two brothers.</p>
<p>Later, on Merrygo Island, a new Luigi Logic system shows up, with the taller brother able to take more of an independent role in certain scenarios. It could be helping you chase after collectibles that float around, and Luigi splitting off to go man a gong trigger, while Mario heads up to get a view of the surroundings –&nbsp;Merrygo Island is home to a huge circular maze, which needs to be shifted and moved around to let the pair pass through.</p>

<p>Then there’s the brotherly baddie bashing in combat. Similar to Paper Mario, every encounter is triggered by running into enemies in the world, sending you into battle with the possibility that you can get a free attack (or that the enemy does). From there you’re in a fairly standard turn-based system, picking from a jump attack, hammer attack or a special shell attack. The twist is that every single attack has Mario and Luigi teaming up, with active button presses for the two characters boosting your damage. From an acrobatic launch into the air, to winding up and hitting hammers together for a whirling dervish of damage, or the back and forth passing of a shell to build up to a shell attack, it’s a quick little QTE that’s nice and straightforward. That said, it is visually and mechanically quite repetitive with the limited abilities available this early in the game, and I’m definitely looking forward to more shell attacks later on.</p>
<p>More difficult to grasp is the timing of button presses when defending and possible countering enemy attacks. They all have multiple attack types to learn, and you have to read not only what attack is coming, but which brother it’s going to target. This is where the real learning curve comes in the game’s combat, and I was often getting caught out, especially with return attacks as enemies swoop back onto screen.</p>

<p>A further factor is the Plugs, consumable modifiers that boost various abilities alongside levelling up and grabbing new gear. You can apply multiple plugs and they can provide boosts to make counters more easy, give your attacks a dizzy effect, boost damage against flying enemies, drop an extra spike ball on an enemy with an Excellent rating, and more. Each plug has a set number of charges before needing to be replaced, but you can swap them in and out pretty much whenever you like. It’s a neat little system, relying on finding collectable energy in the world to craft them.</p>
<p>There’s plenty more that we didn’t get to really explore. Shipshape island will naturally be a hub for the game, and there’s some little back and forth minigame challenges to find around the different islands that we only really dipped a toe into. There’s also some fun team up abilities for the world exploration, with Mario and Luigi able to effective start tangoing, and then turn into a flying saucer when they jump. It’s a hell of a trick that would have the Strictly judges lose their minds, but more practically it will let you hover across wider gaps in the world.</p>
<p>If there’s one aspect I’m less enthused by, it’s the art style, which honestly might have worked best on the 3DS as opposed to the Switch. It’s a bit too heavy on the thick outlines, the picture quality a bit too soft, and there’s also this odd colour gradient to Mario and Luigi’s red and green tops and hats. Maybe it will grow on me with more time spent in the game, but it’s not one I’ve instantly loved.</p>
<p>It’s lovely to see Mario &amp; Luigi return, a role playing counterpart to Paper Mario, just like the back and forth of 3D and 2D Mario platformers. I’m curious to see how safe or adventurous the wider game will be, but it’s already clear that there’s plenty of unusual character to meet amongst the Concordians. Also… did I mention that Snoutlet, the sassy pig that’s definitely not a pig, actually lives in Luigi’s hat? I’m here for that. More games should have hat pigs (that aren’t pigs).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/halo-infinite-2-was-in-development-with-the-slipspace-engine-before-the-switch-to-unreal-engine-5/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to a rumor <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xh07V_QF5Oc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> by YouTuber RebsGaming, Halo Infinite 2 was in development at 343 Industries before Microsoft decided to drastically change the franchise's plans. The YouTuber's anonymous source says that right after the release of Halo Infinite (December 2021), 343's campaign team began working on the sequel in the Slipspace Engine. The team reportedly had 'high hopes' for the gameplay improvements that could have been introduced in Halo Infinite 2.</p>
<p>However, plans changed completely when there was a leadership <a href="https://wccftech.com/head-of-halo-infinite-steps-down-as-microsoft-starts-a-343-industries-restructure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">change</a> inside 343 Industries in September 2022. with Bonnie Ross being replaced by Pierre Hintze. The new leadership decided to switch to Unreal Engine for future Halo games and canceled the Halo Infinite 2 project. The team was asked to start learning Unreal Engine 5, which lasted until early 2023 when Microsoft's big round of layoffs hit 343 Industries hard. RebsGaming's source was also affected, so they do not know if the team is still working on a direct sequel to Infinite or not. The game was fairly well received upon launch; it got an 8 out of 10 score on Wccftech from Chris Wray:</p>
<p><em>Halo Infinite is, in my opinion, the best game of the series. While still faltering in the narrative, character development, and exposition, it improves earlier titles. Combat is entertaining and engaging, with improvements made across the board, but mention must go to new abilities like the grappling hook. The move to an open world helps the game stand apart, with added freedom to take the fight to your enemies and a vast arsenal of weapons and vehicles to bring into battle. While it slips up on a few occasions, from somebody who has never been part of the Halo fan club, this has given me a glimpse of what could be great things to come.</em></p>
<p>Still, it's official now: Microsoft has <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-has-multiple-projects-on-the-way-made-with-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rebranded</a> 343 Industries to Halo Studios, and the team has multiple games in development with Unreal Engine 5. In the meantime, Infinite is <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-infinite-getting-third-person-mode-in-november/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">getting</a> some new stuff soon, including a third-person view.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/cryptic-studios-is-laying-off-staff-at-the-end-of-october" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Game Developer report</a>, a number of Cryptic employees, including artists <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7248093634103803905/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Amelia March</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mauricio-tejerina-758619_i-will-be-leaving-cryptic-studios-at-the-activity-7248056180013510656-5q3n/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mauricio Tejerina</a>, have confirmed that they're being laid off on business social networking platform LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Cryptic art director Thomas Marrone subsequently <a href="https://x.com/thomasthecat/status/1843662460315980227" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmed the layoffs</a> via social media a couple of days ago, adding that "some wonderful people are being let go" and that "their loss will be deeply felt" at the company.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cryptic-studios-layoffs-star-trek-online.jpg?itok=i7H52S9k 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cryptic-studios-layoffs-star-trek-online.jpg?itok=dnG6HGZl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Cryptic Studios is responsible for games like&nbsp;<em>Star Trek Online</em>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Neverwinter&nbsp;</em>and others.</figcaption></figure><p>This isn't the first time Cryptic Studios has been hit by layoffs, either. Back in November last year, the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cryptic-studios-layoffs">let an unknown number of personnel go</a>, citing an "organizational change".</p>
<p>That decision was likely part of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-has-laid-off-8-of-its-employees-and-it-isnt-done-yet-despite-record-quarter">restructuring effort</a> by Cryptic's parent Embracer, which saw the holding company cut a huge number of jobs and outright close or sell some studios (including&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-shuts-down-saints-row-developer-volition"><em>Saints Row&nbsp;</em>developer Volition</a>).</p>
<p>Supposedly, however, that restructuring program is over, having concluded with Embracer announcing its intent to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-splitting-three-companies">split into three separate companies</a> back in April.</p>
<p>With that in mind, the reason behind these latest Cryptic layoffs isn't entirely clear, and neither Embracer nor Cryptic have announced anything through official channels, so no clear reason has been given by either company.</p>

Since yesterday, the developers have added 4 types of downloadable content for the game. Three have already been announced: the Anime Music Pack 1, Anime Music Pack 2, and Ultimate Upgrade Pack.

The developer said it can make tuning changes “faster and with more frequency while working on the balance of the game.”</p><p>Live Tuning Update #1 reduces ball trajectory height for lobbed passes and crosses in Rush matches (Ultimate Team’s eye-catching new mode for FC 25), and reduces the accuracy of first-time lobbed through passes and lobbed through passes taken at severe angles across all gameplay.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>FC 25 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>But it’s the end of the game-breaking speed boost exploit that will be of most interest to core FC 25 fans. This speed boost glitch saw players accelerate unintentionally quickly using a simple combination of input commands, which in turn caused chaos especially in Ultimate Team’s ranked PvP mode, Division Rivals, and the ultra hardcore FUT Champs mode.</p><p>All that was required was a press and hold of L1 on PlayStation or LB on Xbox then a tap of the Sprint button, which would see your players explode beyond bemused defenders and into space. Hopefully with this live tuning update the exploit will be gone for good.</p><p>The live tuning update follows the release of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-fc-25-title-update-2-tackles-the-horribly-unresponsive-menus">FC 25 Title Update 2</a>, which made a relatively small number of changes to the game just a week after launch. But EA Sports clearly has plenty more work to do getting FC 25 up to scratch, with unresponsive menus and gameplay as well as overpowered defending and dodgy passing among the many community complaints.</p><p>Wondering what's changed in FC 25? Here's a <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/ea-sports-fc-25/EA_FC_25_Changes:_Everything_New">list of everything new</a> - we've also got the <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/ea-sports-fc-25/Best_EA_FC_25_Tactics_Codes">Best EA FC 25 Tactics Codes</a> to help you prepare your game plan, plus a breakdown of <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/ea-sports-fc-25/Skill_Moves_and_How_to_Perform">every Skill Move in FC 25</a> and how to perform them.</p><h2>EA Sports FC 25 Live Tuning Update #1 Patch Notes:</h2><p>Made the following changes:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Reduced ball trajectory height for Lobbed Passes and Crosses performed in Rush matches.</li><li>Reduced accuracy of first time Lobbed Through Passes and Lobbed Through Passes taken at severe angles.</li></ul><p>Addressed the following issue:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>[PS5/PC/XBSX|S Only] Reduced instances of players accelerating unintentionally quickly when a Sprint is requested.</li></ul><p>In order to ensure this update has been applied, shut down and relaunch EA Sports FC 25 when you see this message in game.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
