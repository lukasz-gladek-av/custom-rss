<p>It won't be updated "in time for the main game's release"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a> got a Switch 2 demo a few weeks ago, and it's raised some concerns about the performance of the game on Nintendo's new hybrid platform, with players reporting all sorts of issues about the frame rate.</p>
<p>While the eShop showed the game operating at 30FPS, there were seemingly some frame rate hiccups. Fortunately, Atlus is aware, and it seems the experience will be improved in a "future patch" for the main game.</p>
<p>General producer Yoshihiro Komori acknowledged this during a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/we-have-absolutely-no-intention-of-neglecting-her-persona-3-reload-devs-on-femc-and-porting-to-switch-2">recent interview with Nintendo Life</a>, but also noted how it wouldn't be ready in time for the full game launch this week:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life:</strong> The demo that was recently released on the Switch 2 eShop shows the game running at 30FPS, but with some frame rate hiccups. Is the team hoping to have those problems worked out for the final release of the game?</p>
<p><strong>Yoshihiro Komori:</strong> "We are currently taking steps to improve this. Since careful QA is required, it was difficult to address this in time for the main game’s release but will be in future patches."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, again, these improvements won't happen overnight, but there will be an update for this in a future patch. Be on the lookout for our full review of this title later today. It also details the game's performance on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>And if you want to try out this demo for yourself, head on over to the Switch eShop and download it now. Save data will also carry over to the full version.</p>

<p>Ahead of the arrival of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4</a> later this year, why not take a trip to the past with some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/metroid_ii_return_of_samus">Metroid II: Return of Samus</a> jams?</p>
<p>This title originally made its debut on the Game Boy in 1991/92, and now the entire soundtrack is available to listen to on the Switch Online Nintendo Music app. As usual, you'll need to be an active subscriber if you want to listen to these songs on this app.</p>
<p>All up, there are a total of 19 tracks, with the entire album length apparently a 30-minute runtime.</p>

<p>This particular album joins existing Metroid titles on the Nintendo Music app service including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime">Metroid Prime</a>, and the original NES and Famicom Metroid albums.</p>

<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/sonic-team-takashi-iizuka-interview/">Polygon at the Brasil Game Show</a> recently, the series producer Takashi Iizuka mentioned how DLC could potentially stretch beyond a year. It all depends on how much attention the game is getting from fans and the feedback the team is receiving.</p>
<p>Here's exactly what he had to say, noting how Sonic Team is also open to requests - from characters to other in-game adjustments:</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067kzxjut&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"People really like the game, which gives us the confidence to continue making more content...If enough people are coming in and playing it, there's conversations about the game. We have one year of DLC, we could do year two, we could do year three of DLC... Tell us what you want!.. These are the things we can do because it is an online game. We could add new gadgets, we could balance the game differently.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Speaking of things like new DLC, Sega has also today announced the next free character update for this title will be arriving this week on <strong>22nd October 2025</strong>. In case you missed it, it's Joker from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/persona_5_strikers">Persona</a> series, along with a new themed festival.</p>

<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is out now on the Switch and will arrive later this year on the Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>What a year it has been for <a href="https://techraptor.net/series/ninja-gaiden" rel="nofollow"><em>Ninja Gaiden</em></a>, one of the most beloved franchises in the action genre.&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ninja-gaiden-2-black-update-new-game-plus" rel="nofollow">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a>&nbsp;</em>was released in January and served as a gripping remaster for a beloved game. This summer saw the release of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-review-razor-sharp-retro-platformer" rel="nofollow"><em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em></a>, an outstanding homage to the franchise's roots. With&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>, this marks the finale of the Year of the Ninja.</p>

<p>With <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/platinum-games" rel="nofollow">PlatinumGames</a> at the helm in collaboration with <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/team-ninja" rel="nofollow">Team Ninja</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/koei-tecmo" rel="nofollow">Koei Tecmo</a>,&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4&nbsp;</em>is a bombastic gorefest. The action is more visceral than ever as you slash through armored warriors, vicious demons, and terrible fiends in a relentless fury. <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> is a shot of adrenaline, and I can't get enough of it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ninja-gaiden-4-yakumo.jpg?itok=2buy8Pzk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ninja-gaiden-4-yakumo.jpg?itok=ezV7fQ47 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Get ready to get bloody.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> is Action In Its Purest Form</h2>

<p>I'll just get to the point, because&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>&nbsp;doesn't hold back from throwing players right into the fray. The gameplay is electric. It's fast-paced, unrelenting, and is exactly the evolution fans of the series yearned for.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> is a shot of adrenaline, and I can't get enough of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Ninja Gaiden 4&nbsp;</em>is an action game through and through, focusing almost purely on the minute-by-minute gameplay of racking up combos, slashing through foes with sick moves, and dominating the battlefield (or dying despite your best efforts).&nbsp;</p>

<p>You play as Yakumo of the Raven Clan, an expert fighter, and the main character of this entry. Ryu takes a bit of a backseat; though, we'll talk about him in a bit. Yakumo starts with the Takeminakata, duel katanas that cut swiftly and severely into his foes. This is your starter weapon, but as you progress, several more weapons unlock.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ninja-gaiden-4-fighting.jpg?itok=-6h9Hg9d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ninja-gaiden-4-fighting.jpg?itok=tGOo4TMe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sick flip, Yakumo.</figcaption></figure><p>Additional weapons in the roster include the Yatousen, a speedy, rapier-like lance; Magatsuhi, a swift and sweeping staff perfect for taking out groups of enemies; and Kage-Hiruko, a box that contains a menagerie of iconic ninja tools.</p>

<p>This weapon roster might seem smaller compared to&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 2</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 3</em>, but each of these four weapons feels diverse and has a complexity that requires mastering to tap into their full potential.</p>

<p>You'll also unlock new abilities for each weapon that use simple inputs, like flicking the joystick in a circle and pressing light or heavy attack. Weapon XP is accrued as you fight through encounters and complete missions, so there's a nice feeling of progression both in your own skill with these weapons and through the unlocking of these new moves.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ninja-gaiden-4-new-weapon.jpg?itok=HwUCU6m5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ninja-gaiden-4-new-weapon.jpg?itok=_ATShw3g 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>New weapon, who dis?</figcaption></figure><p>Enemies in&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>&nbsp;are pretty bulky despite the feeling of power behind every move, so you're encouraged to lean into these abilities and string together combos without getting hit. Yakumo, in the hands of a dedicated player, is an unrelenting stream of savage blows in between dodges and flips.</p>

<p>The sheer brutality of combat is emphasized by the dismemberment of enemies. Often, cutting off a limb doesn't mean they're down and out, so you can use Obliteration technique with the touch of a button to execute them. Combine that with the series' iconic Ultimate Technique (an overwhelmingly powerful flurry of blows used by charging heavy attack), and I couldn't get enough of slicing through foes.</p>

<p>Of course, being a master ninja is easier said than done. Most enemies are capable foes, even the weaker ones, if you're not careful, and <em>especially </em>when they come in droves. Each weapon is more than sufficient to use on its own, but switching between them in the heat of battle is seamless and often the difference between life and death.</p>

Add in Bloodraven Form, and things get even more interesting. See, Yakumo, as a Raven Clan ninja, can transform his weapons with Bloodraven Form, so in fact,&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>&nbsp;ends up having something like eight weapons.</p>

<p>Using Bloodraven Form transforms your current weapon into a wholly new one. Holding down the left trigger allows you to enter this state and utilizes a finite resource that accrues as you fight. Thus, each move in the Bloodraven Form requires some of that resource but is more powerful than your average attack.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>A lot of enemies in&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>&nbsp;utilize guards, and the only way to penetrate through that armor is with a powerful attack. A normal attack from any of your weapons will bounce off guarding enemies and make you vulnerable, so using the Bloodraven Form is the solution that breaks through that tough armor.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ninja-gaiden-4-ninja-bombs1.jpg?itok=z0Mtd64j 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ninja-gaiden-4-ninja-bombs1.jpg?itok=pGRbEWhW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ninja bombs? Why not!</figcaption></figure><p>As for the weapons' new transformations, our duel swords become one single, sweeping katana that can take out groups of enemies in a wide area. The rapier turns into a drill that, when holding down attacks, allows you to spin it and rearrange enemies' guts, no matter how powerful they might be. The Kage-Hiruko, that box of ninja tools, throws empowered katanas with its light attack and uses even more powerful ninja tools with the heavy ones that can be strengthened by releasing your inputs at the right time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My personal favorite is the staff, the Magatsuhi. This turns into a giant hammer and really emphasized the depth of&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>'s gameplay when it comes to its weapons. The hammer is slow but powerful, and similar to the Kage-Hiruko, releasing the input at certain moments in your combos allows it to explode and deal even more damage.</p>

<p>Mastering&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>'s weapons was a gratifying experience, but I'm not going to claim I'm an expert with them. It's just getting the timing down for the hammer was a bit weird at first, but once it clicked, it was an extremely potent tool in my arsenal and absolutely tore up the battlefield.</p>

<p>I can just imagine someone more skillful than me going ham with the different weapons, switching between them in the midst of combat to formulate unstoppable combos. The Bloodraven Form of these weapons adds so much to the gameplay, so it's such a blast to use them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bloodraven Form really is just the tip of the iceberg for&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden</em>&nbsp;<em>4</em>'s combat. There are so many techniques and moves to purchase through your NinjaCoins to enhance your moveset even further. Parries, perfect dodges, the Izuna freakin' Drop, and more are unlockable as techniques, much to the delight of action fans.&nbsp;</p>

You're welcome.</figcaption></figure><p>There's even a Berserk State that uses a separate resource, which, when used, makes your Bloodraven form even&nbsp;<em>more&nbsp;</em>powerful by causing explosive attacks. While in this state, you can unleash one giant attack that takes out large groups of enemies in a single hit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trust me, you're going to need every single tool to win in&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>. The difficulty on Normal felt just right to start that steadily ramps up as it throws more enemies and challenges your way. Moving on to the new hardest difficulty made me appreciate how far my skills have come, though I'm still not ready for Master Ninja just yet.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ryu_ninja-gaiden-4.jpg?itok=_yYLEgUd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ryu_ninja-gaiden-4.jpg?itok=msxyYJPS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>He's too cool, I can hardly stand it.</figcaption></figure><h2>Ryu Returns</h2>

<p>It's not a spoiler to say you also play as Ryu in&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>&nbsp;-- it's in the marketing material. Though, don't go expecting him to be the main character here, that's Yakumo. Ryu is playable for several chapters, however, and it's nice to step into the shoes of the genre's greatest hero.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ryu has his own moves and skills separate from Yakumo, so both play and feel distinct. Ryu's moveset operates more like the traditional&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden&nbsp;</em>we know and love; it's hard to describe how, exactly, but playing as him felt closer to <em>Ninja Gaiden 2</em>&nbsp;than Yakumo, no doubt. In this case, he uses just one weapon, but has four different Ninpo spells fans should recognize, including but not limited to a powerful fire attack that targets multiple enemies.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ryu_ninja-gaiden-4-2.jpg?itok=QbLQWCgA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ryu_ninja-gaiden-4-2.jpg?itok=-xP-2SB8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A master ninja doing what a master ninja does.</figcaption></figure><p>Ryu doesn't use Bloodraven form, but he still has a resource that allows him to tap into other attacks. This is called Gleam Form, allowing Ryu to unleash these kinetic, super-fast slashes that break through armor and deal tons of damage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Your time as Ryu is brief, and it's probably best that way. He plays fine enough, it's just that the segments featuring Ryu retread previous levels you played as Yakumo. You even fight the same bosses, and they're not even different than the first time you fought them. These levels could have used more variation, but it almost comes across as padding the game's length.</p>

<p>Before I dive deeper into bosses, I want to commend&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>&nbsp;for its enemy variety.&nbsp;I like dealing with a diverse roster of baddies to cut through since it requires me to adapt on the fly, and facing off against humans, demons, and fiends means each encounter has something new.</p>

<p>This variety also means&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>&nbsp;has a few annoying, pesky enemies that break up the flow.&nbsp;Mainly, it's these flying lanterns that lob ranged attacks at you. Before they die, they charge into you and try to explode. When you're dealing with multiple of these, it's just a huge nuisance.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/boss-ninja-gaiden-41.jpg?itok=nfFrCpXx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/boss-ninja-gaiden-41.jpg?itok=xiD2meGD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ah hell, what in tarnation am I about to fight.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>There are a couple more enemies like this, and most of them use range-based attacks. I suppose the solution to this is to "git gud," but compared to the rest of the enemy roster, they're more infuriating than intimidating.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Boss fights are, similarly, a hit or miss. Some of these bosses are just tanky as all hell and feel like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/series/dark-souls" rel="nofollow">Dark Souls</a>&nbsp;</em>bosses, with these wide, sweeping attacks that, like those lanterns, are more annoying than difficult to deal with.&nbsp;The smaller bosses -- and I really do mean more human-sized -- are much more fun and exciting to fight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tokyo rains blood. The Dark Dragon's corpse bleeds a toxic rain over Tokyo, leading the once prosperous metropolis into disarray. The only way to save this city is to revive the Dark Dragon and slay it once more; though, as prophesied, only a Raven Clan ninja can purge this monstrosity for good.</p>

<p>Thus, our hero Yakumo sets out to unseal the Dark Dragon, revive it, and fulfill his destiny. The Divine Dragon Order (DDO), a paramilitary group of "peacekeepers," stands in his way, as does Ryu Hayabusa and a number of fiends and demons. With the help of his clan, as well as a priestess named Seori, perhaps Tokyo can be saved.</p>

The story acts more as a vessel to throw players into cool situations against the DDO, demons, fiends, and the like. Really, what&nbsp;the story lacks is strong characters. Yakumo, despite being our protagonist, is monotone.</p>

<p>Yakumo's a badass ninja, don't get me wrong, but he's too one-note. He doesn't really have a personality, or at least there isn't enough time for the story to develop one. He has an affinity for priestesses, though I'm not sure why, since there aren't many face-to-face interactions with them together. With just a few other side characters, I didn't feel any connection for Yakumo, his clan members, or Seori. It was nice to see Ryu because that's Ryu freakin' Hayabusa, but he's not the main focus here anyway.</p>

<p>The whole time I was playing&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>, I couldn't get over how&nbsp;<em>awesome</em>&nbsp;the soundtrack was. Having a good track to go along with your fight is essential in an action game, and few do it as good as&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>. Thinking about my favorite boss fights, I get chills, and part of that is because of the music. A lot of the OST has this hard rock or post-metal feel, and when the vocals start playing, I&nbsp;<em>locked in</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I found myself going back to these fights just to hear the music, and thankfully, it's quite easy to fight previous bosses. Post-game&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>&nbsp;offers a hefty amount of content, like replaying bosses and levels on higher difficulties to get a high score.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The post-game Trials will put your skills to the test as it throws you into unique scenarios as either Yakumo or Ryu. Trials might, for instance, restrict the use of Bloodraven form or Gleam, while others might mean one hit from an enemy, and you're dead. Even though it's a single-player game, I feel compelled to get better, hone my skills, and complete these trials just to prove something to myself.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Dyson built its reputation on mastering airflow in vacuum cleaners so jumping into hair dryers might seem like an odd pivot until you realize it’s the exact same engineering challenge. The Supersonic Origin applies that airflow expertise to drying hair faster and with less heat damage than traditional dryers that basically just blast hot air at your head.</p>
<p>Right now, Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4621/">has dropped this powerful tool to $299, down from its usual $419 price</a>, which marks an all-time low for a device that rarely sees discounts. If you’ve been frustrated with frizzy results or spending 20 minutes blow-drying your hair, this deal makes switching to professional-grade technology affordable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4621/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>What Makes the Supersonic Different From Your Average Dryer</h2>
<p>The Supersonic Origin places the <strong>motor at the handle instead of the head and</strong> entirely alters the balance and handling. Classic hair dryers place a cumbersome motor at the top and cause your arm to tire within minutes and producing that unpleasant weight distribution. Dyson’s V9 <strong>digital motor rotates at 110,000 rpm</strong> which is ridiculously quick next to standard dryers that top at 20,000 rpm. The fast motor drives 13 liters per second through the barrel and produces a concentrated, high-velocity airbeam that dries hair internally, not roasting the top.</p>
<p>Its smart heat control system<strong> takes air temperature readings 40 times per second</strong> and transmits the readings to a microprocessor that controls the heating element. The result is that the <strong>air temperature never goes above 302°F</strong> and that’s important because hair damage takes off at a very rapid rate above that temperature. Drugstore dryers are not very temperature-controlled at all and can easily reach 350-400°F and they fry the protective cuticle layer on your hair. The Supersonic controls temperatures evenly, so your hair dries fast without the crispy, damaged feel that so often comes from the intense heat.</p>



<p>This Supersonic model comes with the necessary attachments that will suit the majority of daily styling requirements. The concentrator for styling allows for a focused airflow for smooth and controlled drying and is ideal when using a round brush to add volume. The wide tooth comb attachment is ideal for hair that is coily, curly, or highly textured, and enables curl drying and lengthening at the same time without interfering with the natural form. The diffused air attachment is for fine hair or sensitive scalps that cannot tolerate strong direct heat.</p>
<p>These are actual airflow and heat settings, not the typical low-medium-high. You get<strong> three real speed settings with four heat settings</strong> and a cold shot button that sets your style with the closure of the cuticle on your hair. The cold shot is not a gimmick: it seals the hydrogen bonds of your hair at the completion of heat styling, and your blowout will last longer.</p>



<p>The acoustic engineering deserves mention because loud hair dryers are genuinely annoying, especially if you’re drying your hair early in the morning with roommates or family around. Dyson tuned the motor frequency to an inaudible pitch and then added acoustic silencers to further reduce noise. The <strong>result measures at 79 decibels which is noticeably quieter than most professional dryers</strong> that scream at 85-90 decibels. That 6-10 decibel difference translates to roughly half the perceived loudness, making the experience far more pleasant.</p>
<p>Right now, you’re paying roughly three times the price of an entry-level dryer at $299 but the technology is so good that it’s really worth it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">In so many ways, Ninja Gaiden 4 is exactly what I wanted it to be. It’s a collaborative effort between Team Ninja and Platinum Games, two of my all time favorite developers; it builds off the combat from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/05/26/ninja-gaiden-ii-review">Ninja Gaiden 2</a>, which has the best action of the series in my eyes; and it comes packed with small touches that make it a bit more approachable without sacrificing the tough-as-nails difficulty that longtime fans like me expect. But while I’d even go so far as to say this combat system is among the very best I’ve ever seen, Ninja Gaiden 4 stumbles in many other areas – from its bland new lead character, to its uninspired level design, to its predictable story that falls completely flat. The action is still so good that a lot of those shortcomings get deflected like bullets against Ryu Hayabusa’s sword, but others slip through that defense and wound what is otherwise an incredible revival for the Master Ninja.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Story has never been a selling point of the Ninja Gaiden series, so it didn’t come as a surprise to me that Ninja Gaiden 4’s plot was one of its weakest elements. It introduces us to our new protagonist, Yakumo, a skilled ninja of the Raven Clan whose initial goal to kill a priestess of the Dark Dragon instead quickly turns into a mission to escort her to a handful of magic seals in an effort to really for realsies kill the Dark Dragon for good this time. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Ninja Gaiden 4 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What follows is an extremely predictable 10-hour campaign with attempts at big emotional moments that fall flat because the legwork to make you care about these characters is never done. There is some banter that happens between Yakumo, his handler, and the other members of his little Raven Clan squad, but it’s never charming or endearing, and certainly never develops to a point where I ever got a real sense that these characters were actually close. Yakumo primarily communicates with grunts, growls, acknowledgements of the mission objectives, and angry threats, and as a result just comes off as a lame edgelord most of the time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You do get to play a couple of chapters as Ryu toward the end, and while these are a welcome reprieve, they also feel like a huge missed opportunity. His levels have him retracing Yakumo’s steps, fighting through the same environments, mostly the same enemies, and the same bosses, but this time with fewer combat options since Ryu only has access to one weapon, a far less interesting Gleam Form to replace Yakumo’s Bloodraven Form, and just four returning Ninpo super attacks. Imagine Dante’s missions from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/02/04/devil-may-cry-4-review-2">Devil May Cry 4</a>, except he doesn’t get any new weapons, his playstyle is almost exactly the same as Nero, and there’s none of the cool Dante trash talk. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Ninja Gaiden 4's combat isn't just good, it's phenomenal.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I am willing to forgive an action game for <em>a lot </em>if the action itself is good, and fortunately Ninja Gaiden 4’s combat isn’t just good, it’s phenomenal. It’s incredibly fast, the enemies are intelligent and won’t let you do the same thing over and over again, there’s a great deal of flexibility that allows you to change up your approach to each fight, it looks slick as hell, and it has that trademark Team Ninja fluidity mixed with the over-the-top craziness that Platinum Games is renowned for. It just checks every single box.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The secret sauce here is enemy aggression. Enemies are absolutely <em>ruthless </em>in Ninja Gaiden 4. They don’t politely wait their turn as they attack from off screen, hit you with unblockables, grab you if you try to turtle up, armor through your regular attacks, and overwhelm you with sheer numbers. It’s a style of combat that is totally unique to this series, and that suffocating pressure from enemies is what makes every combat encounter such a thrilling fight for survival. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of that may sound brutal, but Yakumo’s own toolset is extremely powerful as well. You have the iconic Flying Swallow technique that allows you to zip towards an enemy, potentially slicing their head off in just a single hit; the Izuna Drop air combo that ends in a flying piledriver that will instantly kill most enemies in a single blow; the plethora of powerful unlockable attacks for each weapon; and most importantly, ultimate techniques that let you absorb essence from defeated enemies to charge up a flashy combo that is completely invulnerable, can hit multiple enemies, and does extremely high damage. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">None of this is new to Ninja Gaiden 4, and in fact is just a basic overview of what’s always been great about the combat in this series. But it’s important to talk about because my biggest concern coming into Ninja Gaiden 4 was that it would feel less like Ninja Gaiden and more like a Platinum Games game – not that there’s anything wrong with that, it’s just not what I’d want out of a return I’ve been waiting 13 years for. Fortunately, that’s not the case. This is a Ninja Gaiden game through and through with a light touch of Platinum flavor to enhance it even further.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This is Ninja Gaiden through and through with a light touch of Platinum flavor.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That flavor mostly comes in the form of one big addition to the combat system: Yakumo’s Bloodraven Form. By holding down the left trigger, Yakumo will transform his weapon into a slower, more extravagant version with a completely new set of moves and the ability to break an enemy’s guard or interrupt their super attacks. These attacks are sick as hell, and definitely bring to mind some of Bayonetta’s Wicked Weave heavy attacks, especially the Rapier that turns into a huge drill, or the staff that turns into a giant hammer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But more than being cool to look at, they add a new dimension to combat that forces you to be reactive to how the enemies are dealing with your offense. If you go into autopilot and spam light attacks, enemies will block your strikes and deliver a damaging counter of their own. But if you notice that they’re flashing white and shrugging off your attacks, you can hit them with a Bloodraven Form attack to not only deal big damage, but also open them up to even more punishment after breaking their guard.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Bloodraven Form moves are tied to a meter that drains pretty quickly, adding an extra layer of resource management I enjoyed. These blood infused attacks are also generally pretty slow, which makes them a bit risky to try and interrupt a faster armored attack. So you need to decide whether to risk wasting your meter by pre-emptively using a blood attack to try and catch an armored move during its initial animation, whether to risk your health by trying to wait and react to one of their slower and more telegraphed armored moves, or or whether to use the meter defensively instead to try and perfectly block otherwise unblockable techniques. Whatever the case, having multiple different options to deal with a challenging combat encounter is crucial in a game like this, and Ninja Gaiden 4 is stacked with options to play around with.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One departure from previous games is that instead of individually upgrading your weapons and having each improvement come with new moves and increased power, this time around you must buy all of your upgrades a la carte. Universal upgrades that affect every weapon cost Ninja Coin, which is a currency gained primarily from completing side missions, optional Purgatory challenges, and as a reward for completing a chapter. Weapon specific techniques on the other hand must be purchased with Weapon EXP, which is gained simply by fighting enemies. The better you perform, the more Weapon EXP you get. I enjoyed always having something new to unlock the whole way through, even though I do think Ninja Gaiden 4 is a little stingy with your starting set of upgrades. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/20/master-ninja-gameplay1-1760985620521.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">I'm not gonna sugar coat it: X, Y, X, X, X, Y</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You’re not even able to absorb essence to instantly charge your ultimate technique, quickly charge it after landing from a jump, or even charge it up to level two by default. All of those techniques have to be purchased, along with staples like the aforementioned Flying Swallow and Izuna Drop<em>. And </em>that same currency is also used to purchase consumable items, leading to a brutal economy in the early going. Especially if you didn’t purchase the Deluxe Edition, which gifts players with a whopping 50,000 Ninja Coins right from the start. That’s enough to buy virtually every starting upgrade and fill up your inventory. If you only have the standard edition, the first couple of hours can be pretty rough as you slowly build up the arsenal of techniques that bring Ninja Gaiden 4’s combat to life. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The final new combat wrinkle is the addition of a Berserk Meter that fills up as you deal or take damage, as well as when you defeat delimbed enemies with Obliteration Techniques. When the Berserk Meter is full, your charged-up Bloodraven Form attacks will trigger Bloodbath Kills, which are basically cinematic one-hit kills. It’s another fun element of resource management that gave me a way to satisfyingly clear a whole screen of tough enemies in just a few seconds, if I managed to survive long enough to be able to build up the meter.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Berserk Meter adds another fun element of resource management.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Platinum also injects a healthy dose of style and creative expression into the combat by giving Yakumo the ability to hot swap between his weapons with just the press of a button. So you can do cool things like launch an enemy with the dual swords, hit them twice in the air, switch to another weapon, hit them twice again, switch to a third weapon, max out that air combo, and then send them crashing down with an Izuna Drop. We’re not talking <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/06/devil-may-cry-5-review">Devil May Cry</a> levels of potential for combo creativity, but there’s still a lot of fancy stuff you can do between the many techniques that you’ll unlock for each weapon, and there’s even a training mode so you can practice optimizing your damage and stylish combos. Variety like this goes a long way for me in terms of making combat feel fresh and exciting throughout the entire campaign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I did my first playthrough of Ninja Gaiden 4 on Hard, and while that was the sweet spot in terms of difficulty for me, it’s worth noting that you can change this setting at any point (except in Master Ninja mode), which is a great feature for anyone struggling with its demanding challenges. Hero mode has been added as well which allows you to enable auto-block and auto-dodge at low health, along with an auto-assist that allows you to do damaging combos with just single button presses. It’s not for me, but I appreciate its inclusion nonetheless as a way to let more people enjoy the spectacle and action of the Ninja Gaiden series. </p><div id="rank-the-ninja-gaiden-games" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rank the Ninja Gaiden games</h3><h3>Rank the Ninja Gaiden games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While the action is pristine and the combat arenas themselves have some great interactable elements that give you the freedom to zip around from point to point, cutting up enemies along the way, the actual level design is pretty uninspired. There are occasional splashes of interesting architecture across the futuristic version of Tokyo that’s been twisted by the evil power of the Dark Dragon’s husk, but far more often you’ll just be wandering around very bland rooftops, identical looking corridors, and boring city streets. It doesn’t get much better once you’re out of Tokyo, either. You just trade those drab streets for foggy cliffsides, ugly sewers, and samey looking military bases. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a couple of fun travel sequences that break up all of the limb liberating sword slashing, like Sonic-esque rail grinding sections, bits where you have to glide on wind currents to soar over a mountain range, and some sewer surfing, but they’re repeated throughout the campaign with little to no variation or evolution. As a result, they end up feeling more like filler than anything else. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>While the action is pristine, the actual level design is pretty uninspired.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a new sidequest system that allows you to gain some extra currency by completing optional tasks, like finding and defeating secret minibosses, capturing hidden collectible monsters called Gourdies, or just simply defeating a certain number of enemies in a specific area. It’s a nice addition that gives extra incentive to be thorough and not just run past optional fights, even though the drab and exceptionally linear level design doesn’t make it very exciting to actually explore.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My favorite thing to find hidden in a level though are the Purgatory Gates. These are optional challenge rooms with the cool twist of letting you decide how much health you want to attempt them with. The greater the health handicap, the greater the reward. These fights are by far the most intense and most fun challenges available, and I loved pushing myself to try and get through the hardest difficulty and then being handsomely rewarded for the effort. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Mitchell's Top Action Games</h3><p>The best games in my favorite genre</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Bosses have never been a strong suit for the Ninja Gaiden series but, funny enough, have always been a strength of Platinum Games. The mixture of the two seems to have gone about how you would expect, as the bosses in Ninja Gaiden 4 vary wildly in quality. There are a couple of truly great scraps against tough enemies with adrenaline pumping soundtracks that brought to mind some of Metal Gear Rising’s best fights. Meanwhile, others are just underwhelming battles against giant monsters with too much health and some frustrating gimmicks – from bosses that obnoxiously teleport around a large arena whenever you get close, to giant fiends that spawn annoying fodder enemies to distract from their own extremely dangerous attacks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After beating the campaign, you unlock the Master Ninja difficulty, the ability to replay any stage, boss, or unlocked Purgatory Gate as either Yakumo or Ryu, and most substantially, 18 combat trials that feature unique modifiers and even a few enemies that I never encountered in the main game. These combat trials might have you clearing waves of enemies without using your Bloodraven Form or cause your health to tick down continuously, forcing you to balance using your ultimate technique to clear out enemies while also making sure to occasionally pick up the life-restoring orbs that are used to quickly charge it – or a trial might just prevent you from healing all together. I haven’t beaten all of these yet, but I am having a blast going through each of them and look forward to challenging my friends to top my scores on the leaderboards. </p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>When the first 3D <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> came out on Xbox in 2004, I <em>really</em> wanted to play it; though the game looks a little antiquated now, at the time, teenage me thought that ninja protagonist Ryu Hayabusa was cool as hell. But alas, I didn’t have an Xbox, and I don’t think I could have convinced my parents to let me get such a (for the time) violent game. Even as an adult that could buy whatever game I wanted, I never got around to playing the franchise. Twenty-one years later, I’ve finally scratched that itch.</p><p><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> stars a new character named Yakumo instead of Ryu. Yakumo is a total punk; imagine someone with the short, unaffected personality of <em>Final Fantasy</em>’s Cloud Strife but as an extremely capable and acrobatic ninja who always wears a mask and has hair that sweeps across his face. It’s silly, but it works for such an over-the-top action game. And his personality helps me internally justify the way <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> encourages aggressive, in-your-face fighting.</p><p>You have a light and a heavy attack that you can mash to strike your enemies, and well-timed dodges help get you in the right position to keep up your barrage. You can unlock new skills and moves that require certain button combinations, but I almost never consciously used them and usually relied on the standard attacks. As you fight, you’ll also build up energy to be able to switch into a “Ravenbound” mode with stronger attacks that can stagger enemies.</p><p>After you do enough damage to an enemy, they’ll get dismembered and then, with one tap of your heavy attack, you can go in for a powerful finishing move with a satisfyingly gruesome animation. I never got tired of seeing Yakumo turn one of my weapons into a vicious drill and jump on it to kill enemies. While ridiculous, it all makes sense given that the game is co-developed by action game experts Team Ninja and PlatinumGames. At times, I felt like I was playing a <em>Bayonetta</em> game, which is a compliment.</p><p>The absurdity goes beyond the battles, too. When you’re not fighting off waves of enemies, you’ll traverse the game’s levels by running along walls, leaping from poles with a grappling hook, grinding on rails, catching wind currents to fly through the air, and surfing across the water. There’s even a part where you’ll do all that while zipping through interdimensional portals. Between the fights and the traversal, there’s almost always something interesting happening as you’re running around the world, and when you need a break from the action or to restock your items, the in-game shops tend to be placed right where you need them.</p><p>I was constantly flying at enemies, keeping up the pressure with flurries of weapon strikes, and jumping around levels like the <em>coolest ninja ever</em>. There are even parts of the game where <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/07/ninja-gaiden-4-deep-immersive-allure/">you can play as Ryu</a>, who has his own style of play that’s slightly different from Yakumo’s — though I actually liked playing as him less because his heroic personality is so much more boring than Yakumo’s emo vibe.</p><p>Despite the chaotic action, the game has a relatively basic, old-school structure. Generally, you’ll play through a few levels, take on a major boss, acquire a new weapon, and rinse and repeat. There’s no open world, which helps keep things focused, though a few areas give you a tad more leeway to explore. While the back third of the game takes a bit of a step down because of some repeated levels and boss fights, I appreciated how straightforward it all was.</p><p><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> is one of my favorite action games I’ve played in years, and it’s the game I always imagined that the original 3D <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> would be. I didn’t feel like I missed anything by jumping in so late in the franchise. And there’s a lot of great <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> games to play next: I loved this year’s excellent new 2D entry, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/716421/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-review-nintendo-switch-playstation-xbox-pc"><em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em></a>, and to really get some of that old-school 3D vibe, there’s a new <a href="https://teamninja-studio.com/ng2black/us/">remaster of <em>Ninja Gaiden II</em> for modern consoles</a>, too. After two decades of waiting, now I have lots of catching up to do.</p><div><p><sup>Ninja Gaiden 4<em> will be released <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1978173973117501750">on October 20th at 8PM ET</a> on Xbox Series X / S, PS5, and PC.</em></sup></p></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/802755/ninja-gaiden-4-review-xbox-series-x-s-ps5-pc]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In 2006, then-PlayStation CEO Kaz Hirai made one of the most memorable on-stage presentations in video game history, talking his way through a lengthy PSP loading wait by uttering the classic line "Riiiiidge Raaaaacer".</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="It's Ridge Racer!" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eaBUeINW_3s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Part of a wider PlayStation presentation that can charitably be labelled a disaster--<a href="https://kotaku.com/why-was-e3-canceled-when-dates-best-electronic-expo-1704385912" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it also included the PS3's "$599" announcement and the "MASSIVE DAMAGE" stuff</a>--what was at the time seen as painfully cringe, ammunition for countless memes, has in time matured into something that's now seen as more of a heartfelt moment, a glimpse of a man who was CEO because he loved <em>Ridge Racer</em> and had spent a long time working at PlayStation, not because he was a Wall Street psychopath obsessed with making a line go up every quarter.</p><p>Like, it's one thing to have been involved in a press conference gaffe, loads of people have done that and we've forgotten all about it. Few video game executives get to see a whole entry<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaz_Hirai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> on their Wikipedia page dedicated to</a> one:</p><blockquote><p>His real name is "Kazuo(一夫)," but he is commonly known by the shortened version, "Kaz." In Japan, he is also affectionately called "Ridge Hirai(リッジ平井)." This nickname comes from the 2006 E3 event, where, during a PSP presentation, he passionately shouted "Riiiiidge Racer!" while demonstrating the game. He is aware of this nickname and even mentions it in his autobiography.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>You can tell how much it (and the series!) meant to both Hirai and PlayStation that, in honour of both, Sony reportedly commissioned Nike in 2007 to produce a handful of pairs of Air Max 90 360s emblazoned with the line “Ridge Racer” so they could be presented to their CEO as a gift.<a href="https://kotaku.com/nike-thanks-the-playstation-with-24-pairs-of-shoes-5361127" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> These aren't part of the 24 pairs that were reported on in the media in 2009</a>; I'm told they were made just for Hirai, and have only turned up now because one of the pairs are for sale.</p><figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/286704613073" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">msole</a></figcaption></figure><p>Australian sneaker collector MSOLE--<a href="https://www.instagram.com/msolemichael/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whose collection includes stuff like a number of game-worn Jordans</a>, and who has presented at international sneaker conferences--has got his hands on what he says are one of only six pairs ever manufactured, and in procuring them managed to learn a little about them as well.</p><p>He tells me the shoes aren't third-party customs; the tag you see in these images means they were manufactured directly by Nike in a factory in Korea. MSOLE says all six pairs were made in Hirai's size and presented to him as a gift, and that while the former PlayStation CEO kept two pairs, he presented another to a former colleague, while three remaining pairs ended up unaccounted for. Those three are now all in the hands of collectors, with MSOLE owning one and another unnamed person in the USA owning the other two.</p><p>I've reached out to Joe Howley, the man named on the production tag (who was formerly of Nike, and who now works at Under Armor) to see if he could tell me anything else about them, but at time of publishing I haven't heard back.</p><figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/286704613073" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">msole</a></figcaption></figure><p>I, someone who likes to think I've done a <em>lot </em>of video game x sneaker reporting, had never even heard about these shoes until now! And I only heard about them because<a href="https://elmore.design/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Friend Of The Site Andrew Elmore</a> tipped me off to<a href="https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/286704613073" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the eBay auction selling them</a>, with a 'Buy It Now' price of...AUD$15,000 (which is around USD$10,000 at time of publishing).</p><p>That is a <em>lot </em>of money, bordering on 'fuck you' money, but then these are also extremely rare shoes, both in number and in terms of how they were made; they're so rare that this auction is the only result you get for them on Google, making these a commercial sale <em>and </em>a learning opportunity.</p><p>Which is neat! I don't think any of us are in a position to be putting bids on $10,000 sneakers, but getting the chance to learn about an extremely rare and special pair of PlayStation x <em>Ridge Racer</em> Air Maxs (fast approaching their 20th birthday) for the first time after all these years has been cool.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/criterion-mobile-closet-picks-peter-decker-interview-chicago-international-film-festival"><h3>Criterion’s Mobile Closet Wasn’t About The Van—It Was About IRL Friendships We Made Along The (Five-Hour) Way</h3></a><p>Criterion president Peter Becker reflects on how Closet Picks evolved from a spontaneous idea into a beloved ritual among cinephiles for its 40th anniversary roadshow celebration.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/matt-leone-shadow-of-the-colossus-oral-history-aftermath-hours"><h3>A History of Histories</h3></a><p>" I don't think there is always a canonical version of, like, the development story of a game."</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/battlefield-6-campaign-singleplayer-review-impressions"><h3>Battlefield 6’s Campaign Is An Act Of Narrative Cowardice</h3></a><p>The only thing worse than saying something stupid is saying nothing at all</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/nike-playstation-ridge-racer-kaz-hirai]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>In a world of gaming dominated by the ever expanding range of Souls-likes, it can be easy to forget that character action used to be king. High octane Japanese game series like Ninja Gaiden used to dominate consoles, but over the years this iconic Team Ninja franchise has steadily faded into irrelevancy. It’s easy to see why, when Ninja Gaiden 3 managed to cater to neither existing fans or newcomers.&nbsp;Whatever spark and soul that entry lacked, Ninja Gaiden 4 makes up for in spades, and it’s an awesome reminder of why the classic action game will never truly die.</p>
<p><iframe title="NINJA GAIDEN 4 - Master Ninja Gameplay | Tokyo Game Show 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wzqvkh9m8jY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Don’t let the numeral in the title fool you – there isn’t any homework or catching-up you need to do in order to get into Ninja Gaiden 4. Part of that is helped by the fact that our perspective has shifted to Yakumo, a new character and a skilled ninja from the Raven Clan. They’ve lived in the shadow of the Hayabusa Clan for ages, but the actions of that clan have led Yakumo and the Raven Clan to pick up the pieces and jump into the spotlight in order to fulfil an ancient prophecy, even if it goes against the plans of Ninja Gaiden&nbsp;hero Ryu Hayabusa himself.</p>


<p>After some very truncated recapping of the events of the series up until now, Ninja Gaiden 4 tosses you into Yakumo’s journey to end the Black Dragon once and for all. As a novice to the franchise, it’s easy to follow along with what’s happening here because so much of the game is focused, first and foremost, on being cool as hell. You’re a super powered cyber ninja in a post-apocalyptic Tokyo, and I really don’t need much more explaining than that in order to get into the action. It also helps that the cast of characters you interact with are all pretty fun and flashy, like the snarky shrine maiden Seori. Plus, when Yakumo’s path does cross over with Ryu Hayabusa’s, you feel the weight of this moment and get hyped up!</p>


<p>It’s the gameplay that steals the show in Ninja Gaiden 4, though. When it was revealed that this title was a collaboration between Team Ninja and Platinum Games, I could barely contain my excitement. I was pinching myself at the thought of combining the legacies of these two titans of action gaming, and I was absolutely not disappointed. I am blown away by how perfectly Ninja Gaiden 4 manages to blend the depth and unrelenting difficulty of the franchise with the high-octane, over-the-top flash and fun of Platinum Games. It’s all tied together by an onslaught of wild hyper-violence that’s woven throughout the gameplay and the visuals.</p>
<p>Yakumo dishes out light and heavy attacks, but can also expend his Bloodbind Gauge to enter Bloodraven form and deliver especially strong blows. You’ll slowly build this gauge over time, but if you launch a heavy attack when an enemy is dismembered you’ll perform an instant Obliteration attack that rewards you with a good chunk more. It’s a loop of mechanics that reward you with constantly staying on the offensive, but even your defensive tools are all about attacking. In this game, your parry is the attack button – predict an enemy attack and meet it with your own, and you’ll stagger them instantly. Enemies can bust out super-strong attacks that can’t be parried, but guess what? Interrupt those with a Bloodraven attack and you’ll break their stance and stagger them even harder.</p>

<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 is effectively the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/03/17/doom-eternal-review/">Doom Eternal</a> of character action games. The entire combat loop is built around forcing you into a dance where every tool in your arsenal is a piece of offensive art, all looping togetherlike a blood-soaked puzzle. As you progress through the game, you’ll unlock multiple weapons, new attack abilities, and weapon-specific bonus attacks for Yakumo. Playing as Ryu Hayabusa, meanwhile, retains all these mechanics but with a simplified arsenal that blends all the best elements of his attack abilities from prior games. Any time I felt myself stuck on a hard fight, having a wealth of other attack abilities and combo strings to experiment with made it so satisfying to bash my head against that wall over and over until I finally made it through.</p>
<p>It doesn’t have to be quite so hard, though. There’s a wealth of difficulty and accessibility options in Ninja Gaiden 4 that make it easy to fine-tune the experience to meet your skill level and enjoyment. You can swap between base difficulty modes at any time – Hard Mode hurts and even Normal Mode packs a punch, but there’s an easier Hero Mode available that makes a lot of encounters easier without becoming an outright cakewalk. Meanwhile, specific options like auto lock-on behavior, controller remapping, and even a bunch of UI customisation make this one of the most approachable character action games I’ve played. One frustration with no solution was the lack of a truly quick-restart for failed battles. Certain boss fights, side missions and trial encounters had me dying and retrying for ages, and the wait in-between death, loading, and re-entering the arena often frustrated me far more than the difficulty of the fight itself.</p>

<p>Remember that Doom Eternal comparison I made earlier? It extends even deeper into the soundtrack. Every battle and stylish set-piece is paired with energetic music that fits the cyberpunk slaughter vibes perfectly. And in important battles and big boss fights, Ninja Gaiden 4 busts out it’s secret weapon: shredding guitars. The pairing of hyper-violent ninja action with loud, wild guitar is so tapped into the same rule-of-cool energy that made Ninja Gaiden so iconic to start with, and it reminds me of the best of Platinum Games titles, too.</p>
<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 is such a breath of fresh air. Every combat encounter ends with my fingers shaking and my eyes wide, and it’s a thrill that kept me chasing the next one all the way until I finished the game. Unrelenting difficulty combined with jaw-dropping speed and style make for a game that lives up to the pedigree of its franchise, its developers, and the heights of action gaming as a whole.</p>

			<p>2025 has been a killer year for ninjas. Not only have we seen the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-revives-5-of-its-classic-ips-golden-axe-crazy-taxi-jet-set-radio-shinobi-and-streets-of-rage/">resurgence of Shinobi</a> developed by the folks at Lizardcube but another Ninja Gaiden title also dropped over the summer from The Game Kitchen. Now, mere days after <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomonobu-itagaki-creator-dead-or-alive-ninja-gaiden-passed-away-at-58/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the untimely passing of the man behind the series reboot on the original Xbox</a>, it’s time for the first new numbered title in the Ninja Gaiden franchise in fourteen years and the first of the modern series to not feature super ninja Ryu Hayabusa front and center. Can PlatinumGames prove they’ve got a mastery of ninjutsu, or is this one adventure a magic trick gone wrong?</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While Ryu Hayabusa remains a core part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-gamescom-hands-on-preview-a-promising-return/">Ninja Gaiden 4’</a>s narrative, the main focus this time around is on newcomer Yakumo, a rising ninja from the rival Raven Clan. Before Ninja Gaiden 4 opens, it’s a fact that the Dark Dragon is dead (for the third time), felled at the hands of Ryu Hayabusa (again) and its hulking skeletal remains lingering above Tokyo. As supernatural gods are wont to do, the risk of revival is imminent. It’s established early on in the story that this Raven clan has been operating in the shadows nearly as long as the Hayabusa clan, cleaning up after them and clearing a path for the main clan to take all of the glory for success. To quell the possible revival of the Dark Dragon, Yakumo’s initial goal is to slay a blue-eyed priestess to fulfill a prophecy of his clan. However, the pair instead pair up to subvert the prophecy and instead aim to revive the Dark Dragon in hopes of giving one final death and end the cycle of rebirth and destruction. Naturally, this leads to making an enemy of nearly every other ninja clan out there and even Ryu Hayabusa himself.</p>



<p>Without Ryu’s signature Dragon Sword in his arsenal, Yakumo instead relies on a number of other tricks up his short sleeves, starting with a pair of ninja swords and rapidly growing to include a spiral rapier and double-ended staff, among others. Each of these weapons feels dramatically different from one another in combat, some best suited for taking bosses on one-on-one while the likes of the staff are better for crowd control and slaying the dozens of ghost fish that are a staple of annoying Ninja Gaiden players the world over. I would have loved to take the Falcon’s Talons for another walk but every weapon Yakumo acquires fits a certain role in combat without being an all-in-one survival tool.</p>

<p>Yakumo himself isn’t much of an interesting protagonist compared to those who have championed earlier Ninja Gaiden games. He doesn’t speak much, instead blindly following suggestions and goals without question, only for the occasional staredown or sarcastic quip to utter from his lips. Both his fashion sense and mannerisms invoke the edgy Hot Topic teenager going through their goth phase in life, only far more brutal. Yakumo can manifest that angst and anger and channel them into the power of his unique combat style, the Bloodbind Ninjutsu and Bloodraven Form.</p>



<p>As Yakumo attacks, a secondary gauge fills to power his Bloodraven attacks. By holding down L2, he can convert his current weapon into an alternative form or power up his counterattacks. This turns that double-sided staff into a massive hammer with a rocket on the opposite end, while his dual swords can turn into a two-handed sword instead. With how much health a lot of these damage sponge enemies have, not utilizing his Bloodraven form can turn fights into lengthy slogs while even a single attack from an enemy can take off a sizable chunk of life. Further fueling this lust for blood is a mechanic to recover a fraction of health lost by drenching oneself in blood; the downside to this is that even taking a second hit from an enemy before you’ve had a chance to recover often leaves a massive deficit in health that can only be salvaged by using one of the limited healing potions Yakumo carries on him at a time. In far too many fights, I thought I had the edge and could counterattack to win the battle, only to get stopped in my tracks with an annoying pop-up asking if I would like to use the Incense of Rebirth in my inventory and revive on the spot, a sure sign that I screwed something up and died to an unexpected attack.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>What PlatinumGames brings to the table in Ninja Gaiden 4 reinvents the fast-paced combat of the modern series with a number of tropes that have been in their earlier games. Players can deflect oncoming attacks with a quick attack of their own, leading to a third defensive option besides just blocking or dodging away. This is best used for fights where it’s just one-on-one and the player can be able to read and anticipate the attack from a single direction. When surrounded by enemies and attacks coming from all sides, taking a less risky approach is often the best choice (albeit with fights taking much longer without that aggression at play).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Series staple moves that Ryu Hayabusa pioneered, from the Flying Swallow attack in the air to the Guillotine Throw against humanoid enemies, are all part of Yakumo’s stable of moves, provided you spend the coin at one of the local merchants to learn the ways of the super ninja. Unfortunately, Yakumo just doesn’t have the same skill with these moves that Ryu showcased in prior games, so a well-timed Guillotine Throw won’t murder an enemy outright but instead simply throw them outside of the range of Yakumo’s assortment of weapons with only a small amount of damage.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In some ways, the combat is simplified from the series’ last entry, Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor’s Edge. Throws outside of the Guillotine Throw aren’t really part of Yakumo’s skillset and oh-so-many of his fights are dependent on flashy obliteration and instant kills. Most enemies have to be dispatched by pressing the triangle button after they’ve lost a limb, leading to a quick cut-in of Yakumo taking their head off each and every time. It pulls away from the action for a brief moment when the player should instead be focused on trying to dodge an incoming attack that I found these repeated obliteration moves to be somewhat of a distraction from what was otherwise some of PlatinumGames’ best combat to date, although it can also be some of their most challenging and frustrating if you don’t engage with all of the defensive options at Yakumo’s disposal.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While the level design in Ninja Gaiden 4 is fantastic and Yakumo winds up murdering demons across a wide variety of biomes, from the rainy streets of neo futuristic Tokyo at night to snowy temple grounds to laser-filled dance halls, the sense of exploration is limited at best. Far too often, Yakumo runs through a guided path from combat encounter to combat encounter before reaching the boss, but for the few instances where the player can go off the rails and explore down a side path often rewards the player with some sort of side mission or collectible to boost his health. That isn’t to say that the on-rails segments are a poor part of the Ninja Gaiden 4 experience; in fact, it’s far from it. Yakumo can wall run, glide, and even surf like a proper ninja in full PlatinumGames spectacle, but the areas that stop holding the players hand and let them check out an area at their own pace feel few and far between.&nbsp;</p>

</div>
</figure>



<p>Another knock against Ninja Gaiden 4’s level progression is just how many times Yakumo finds himself falling off a ledge or just generally getting distracted from his goal. Early on, one of Yakumo’s chapters ends with him falling through a rotten bridge when he was only mere steps away from his goal of unsealing one of the Dark Dragon’s temples, thus leading into an entire chapter of side diversions just to get back up the mountain to where he once was. PlatinumGames then has the audacity to pull the trick a second time at the end of that chapter, leading into a padded opening act that could have simply been avoided if Yakumo remembered that he’s a ninja that can defy gravity and simply jump. In fact, this trope of getting diverted at the last minute from accomplishing his goal is a common trope in the first half of Ninja Gaiden 4 that one has to wonder if these chapters weren’t simply thrown in to pad the already-extensive runtime and make this sequel feel meatier than it actually was. At least the combat continued to shine through arena after arena of mindless demon spawn all intent on taking Yakumo’s head.&nbsp; When it's all said and done, my playthrough of Ninja Gaiden 4 took just shy of twenty hours to clear just as many chapters. On average, a number of the early chapters lasted around forty minutes each, although that time does include tackling some of the optional challenge arenas with a health handicap to earn a few extra ninja bucks and points to pick up some extra skills for the future. Throw in a mandatory second playthrough on Master Ninja if you're aiming for the platinum trophy and I wouldn't be surprised if most players need a good forty hours to earn every achievement and secure the title of True Ninja.</p>

<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 represents a bold take on the legacy of Ryu Hayabusa and the Dark Dragon with all of the charm and signatures of PlatinumGames throughout. At times, it can be frustrating and even an exercise in patience to become a master ninja and learn to survive an arena unscathed while still retaining the fundamentals of what made the original Xbox trilogy so well renowned. I don’t know what it is about character action games and long-awaited sequels but there’s always something so damn special to them that they’re an instant recommendation, difficulty aside.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>What do you want out of a modern, big-budget, blockbuster video game? Large, detailed environments to explore? Tons of skill trees, crafting systems, and resources to manage? An HBO-worthy story with top-notch voice acting that keeps you playing until the end? <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> does not give a fuck about any of these things.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/ninja-gaiden-4-hands-on-hitstop-difficulty-game-pass-2000623220"><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> is here</a> to serve you up tense, twitchy combo-based action and flashy but simple backdrops for ever more ridiculous boss fights and bloodbaths. Nothing more. Nothing less. It gets that job done with S-tier style and attention to detail. Everything else is…<em>fine</em>. I hope that doesn’t sound like a disappointment.</p>

 <p>It’s not. I’m 10 hours into Team Ninja and Platinum Games’ cyberpunk-infused joint entry in the long-running series and I’ve been loving every no-frills moment. The sequel is out October 20 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (published by Microsoft and available day-one on Game Pass Ultimate) and my full review won’t be out until later this week. I’ll leave more of my nitpicks until then. For now I can confidentially say this game has some real juice.</p>

 <p><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> is the Brazilian steakhouse where the hosts keep plopping down increasingly rich and tasty hunks of meat until you feel completely gorged and then they give you more and you keep going because it’s just that good and also the world will fall to ruin at the hands of a mythic evil dragon if you don’t.</p>

 <p>There’s not a lot of variety. You may occasionally break into a sweaty panic. But plate after plate of bloody brawls and bone-crunching boss fights will arrive and you will not send them back because this is Team Ninja’s house and you will feast until it’s over because who knows, it could be another 13 years until the next <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> arrives.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000637430" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000637430"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000637430">Team Ninja / Microsoft</figcaption></figure> <p>If you haven’t been keeping up, <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> puts you in the shoes of Ryu Hayabusa’s rival Yakumo who wields the Bloodraven Form technique to chain the blood of his enemies into dazzling and devastating combo attacks (you also play as Ryu in some chapters). Yakumo gets access to multiple weapons with different attack patterns and unlockable move sets. There’s even an ultimate meter you can fill up to unleash quick executions.</p>

 <p>Combined with dodges, parries, and an overwhelming number of fighting-game-style aerial maneuvers and attacks, the combat rewards close attention and thoughtful execution. It’s a button-mashing gorefest, except that every button is pressed for a particular reason and if it’s not, you’re probably looking at the game over screen again.</p>

 <p>Every challenge room and boss fight so far has left me feeling satisfied and accomplished in exchange for the effort expended, even when progress slowed to a crawl and it briefly felt like I was banging my head against the wall. <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> is so limited and focused in terms of what it puts in front of you that I found these periods of stalled momentum as cathartic and calming as pushing through to the next chapter.</p> <p>I won’t talk about the story because I’m not finished yet and, well, when has a<em> Ninja Gaiden</em> story ever really mattered that much? There’s a mysterious woman manipulating you into breaking magical seals to purify the ancient dragon and prevent it from returning to haunt neo-Tokyo. The English language dubs are not great so I’m playing with subtitles. The conversations and characters, like the spartan levels you encounter them in, provide the most barebones table setting for a linear series of battles and the occasional 3D <em>Sonic</em>-style platforming section.</p> <p>None of the stuff outside of combat has been all that great in<em> Ninja Gaiden 4</em> so far, so I welcome there being so little of it. This is a game about seeing how long you can keep your health meter unscathed while landing just enough blows to randomly sever an enemy’s limb and open them up to a grisly execution move that sprays blood all over the screen and nets you points toward your high score for the stage. It’s strikingly old-school that way. It’s nice to have you back, <em>Ninja Gaiden</em>.</p>

While Obsidian Entertainment has already established that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/meet-the-outer-worlds-2-companions-whom-you-cant-romance/1100-6534102/" data-ref-id="1100-6534102">its six companion characters can't be romanced</a>, the studio has revealed that they can actually turn on the player if you give them enough of a reason.</p><p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VLPpTh_v8&amp;t=827s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Expansion Pass</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/screw-up-too-hard-in-the-outer-worlds-2-and-your-companions-may-fight-you-to-the-death-because-obsidian-wanted-the-rpgs-cast-to-feel-like-theyre-their-own-people/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>), game directors Matt Singh and Brandon Adler noted that players' decisions can potentially backfire on them by alienating their companions, who may choose to attack or even attempt to kill the player under the right circumstances.</p><p>"One of the things that was really important is, we wanted these characters to feel like they're their own people," Singh said. "They have their own goals, their own motivations, and if the player's aligning with them, that's great. They're going to be there for you. They'll fight alongside you. But if you go against their interests, they're going to have something to say about it. That might break out into a conflict. That might mean they leave you or you have to fight them to the death. But if you do build that relationship with them, they'll be there for you in the end."</p><p>As an example, Adler noted that the companion character Inez is aligned with the Auntie's Choice faction. If players ignore Inez's request to stop killing members of her group, she won't just leave your team, she'll also attack the player at various points.</p><p>However, Adler added that these turns won't happen in a vacuum, and the companion characters will actually warn players about their deteriorating relationships ahead of time with requests or ultimatums. Players will have the option to try to save their relationships, and also suffer the consequences if they choose to do nothing.</p><p>Obsidian recently introduced a Moon Man plushie called a "Couch-Panion," which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-moon-man-plushie-could-be-your-friend-or-kill-you-in-your-sleep/1100-6535451/" data-ref-id="1100-6535451">is the prize for winning a contest</a> running through November 16.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/over-500-steam-next-demos-disclosed-generative-ai-usage</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/over-500-steam-next-fest-demos-disclosed-generative-ai-usage.1329943/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The October Steam Next Fest ends today, and we decided to look into how many upcoming games claim they are using generative AI. Many of these games release in the next few months, which gives us a good current snapshot of where small to mid-size game development is at when it comes to generative AI.</p>

<p>By pulling the information from Steam about which Next Fest titles had enabled the AI Generated Content Disclosure, we discovered that over 500 demos disclosed using AI. The data here is necessarily imperfect, as it only counts the games that have disclosed AI Usage.</p>

<p>As we saw with games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-alters-possible-generative-ai" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="The Alters Players Reckon They've Spotted Some Undisclosed Generative AI Work"><em>The Alters</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2286600/view/503963131223999762" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Statement on AI use in Hotel Barcelona"><em>Hotel Barcelona</em></a>, some games will not disclose it on the Steam page but do use or had used generative AI. In the case of <em>The Alters</em>, their Steam page doesn't disclose that the game previously had generative AI content used in development.</p>

<p>The exact total of games disclosing generative AI was 507 games out of the total 2960 titles in Steam Next Fest. By briefly examining their AI Generated Content Disclosure, we found out that three of them had situations that made us believe they may not have qualified as using generative AI in the making or marketing of their game, giving us a new total of 504 games.</p>

<p>This gave us a percentage of 17.03%, which is close to 1 in 5 games. As mentioned above, this is only a baseline figure, with more games potentially making use of it either in early stages of production or in areas that aren't seen (such as code) and not disclosing it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/packmates.jpg?itok=fv-_4QV1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/packmates.jpg?itok=c6TuNcGI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3171540/Packmates/" rel="nofollow"><em>Packmates</em>&nbsp;</a>used the AI Generated Content Disclosure spot to write "No generative AI content."</figcaption></figure><h2>What Was Generative AI Used For in Steam Next Fest Demos?</h2>

<p>Games had a variety of uses for generative AI in their disclosures, which we haven't yet fully reviewed, but we saw several major areas of use emerge:</p>

<ul><li>Marketing and Steam Store Page Assets&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Art assets in-game (from concept art, to placeholders, to all of the art in a game)</li>
	<li>Audio assets (music, sound effects, voice over)</li>
	<li>Translation</li>
	<li>Coding</li>
	<li>Writing</li>
	<li>Ideation</li>
	<li>In-Game Live Calls</li>
</ul><p>Those are roughly in the order of frequency of usage we saw in the 100 games we examined. There will be a more in-depth report on more games in a future report. There were also a number of games that used AI for creating Steam capsule images, store page pictures, or for translating their store page with no other use of generative AI.</p>

<h2>What Was the Most Popular Demo with Generative AI In Steam Next Fest?</h2>

<p>The most popular game that had an AI generated content disclosure was <em>Cloudheim </em>by Noodle Cat Games. It broke into the top 50 of Steam Next Fest October 2025 most played demos and had a max concurrent user count of 667. Here is what their AI Content disclosure said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our primary use of generative AI is for internal communication: we made a bot called InfoSage which helps us search our documentation, notify others of interesting discussions, and look through recent changes to pinpoint when bugs occurred.</p>

<p>Our developers can choose to use generative AI as part of an iterative exploratory process, but the decision of how and when is left up to individuals, and the final product always reflects the creativity and expression of our own development team.</p>

<p>No people have been replaced by AI. This includes artists and engineers on our team, voice actors, localization, or other roles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>How generative AI will shape our hobby and industry going forward is something that is yet to be determined, and what players are willing to accept will play a huge role in how it is used as well. Keep an eye out for a more in-depth report of AI usage on Steam Next Fest games.</p>

For a myriad of reasons, I can't really write any particular profane curse words here, but an approximation of my feelings on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockpapershotgun.com/games/birdcage">Birdcage</a>, an anime as hell, "sword action <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooting</a> game", it would be something like, "this game is so ******* sick, like what the ****, how the **** can one game be so ******* stylish." I'm sure you can fill in the blanks of what words I wish I could use there, but if you'll allow me, I'd also like to take the time to actually talk about why Birdcage rules so much.
</p>
<p>
Birdcage is an upcoming title from Polygon Bird Games, which consists of just two people: Giannis Milonogiannis, a comic book artist who's worked with big dogs like DC and Marvel, and Barry Topping, the composer behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paradise-killer">Paradise Killer</a>. Milonogiannis is behind all the art from the game, which is just a perfect concoction of moods and influences, coming through tightly in its recently released demo (<strong><em>big flashing lights warning</em></strong>).

<p>
Inspired by '90s arcade games, Birdcage's opening cutscenes feel just as sparse yet tantalising as the best of them. You are the pilot of a ship called the Halycon, with one goal in mind: destroy a new kind of weapon that will "end Earth's reign and birth a new universe, the World-Egg." This is delivered to you in single screen scenes with art that evokes the best JRPG classics - think a sketchier, more pixel arty Breath of Fire 4 cover kind of vibe.
</p><p>
It's the kind of game you can imagine getting an OVA straight-to-VHS adaptation that's worth $300 now and has not been released in high quality, so your only way to watch it is through a crappy rip uploaded to the Internet Archive. The story in the demo is minimal, and there's only six stages apparently, but the restraint exercised makes me curious for more, the best kind of narrative.
</p>
<p>
With your ship, you have a few combat options. You can shoot out a spread of bullets that do less damage but hit more enemies, or you can concentrate them to do more damage, the tradeoff being that you move slower (which turns into a boon in more bullet laden levels). Said ship also has a sword, a point that rules an incredible amount, that can destroy certain bullet types, can be swung around to damage certain ships, or shot out at an enemy. It's all mostly simple, yet tough as hell. You've only got three bits of health, and limited lives, so dodging every bullet is a lot more stressful than you'd think.
</p>
<p>
On top of all that, there's an arcade mode which is just story mode without the story, and score attack where enemies infinitely spawn within a set time limit as you try to rack up some points. Real classic arcade stuff.
</p>
<p>
You can try out the demo for yourself on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2158550/BIRDCAGE/">Steam</a> right now, or alternatively, you can wait until November 18th for the full release.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Lay’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/college-students-float-on-bags-of-potato-chips-1638992763">potato chips</a> are receiving a big rebrand that makes it clear that the popular snack food is made from potatoes. That might seem silly, until you realize that according to the chip maker, nearly half of the people who buy its product didn’t know the chips were made using potatoes. Seriously.</p> <p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.pepsico.com/our-stories/story/from-potato-to-chip-the-next-chapter-of-lays">Lay’s announced plans to “revamp” the “world’s most popular potato chip”</a> and laid out what it intends to do in a press release that revealed the new chip bag design and shared the surprising statistic.</p>

 <p>“There are more than 4,000 registered potato varieties in the world, and only 10 are good enough to become a Lay’s potato chip,” explained Lay’s in a press release that mentions the word potato nearly 30 times. “Lay’s spends up to nine years creating the best potato for farmers to grow that can deliver the perfect crisp, flavor and golden glow when sliced and cooked. The potatoes’ journey from the soil to the shelf is the heart of Lay’s. But here’s the surprising part — 42% of people who enjoy Lay’s don’t realize they’re made with real, farm-grown potatoes.”</p>

 <p>Usually, I find press releases to be filled with exaggerated language and brand hype that I roll my eyes at, but yeah, no, that is indeed surprising. Nearly half of the people who buy and consume Lay’s chips don’t know they are made from…potatoes? It makes me wonder what they thought the chips were made out of and if they even had a guess or were just buying bags of salty and crispy snacks without much thought beyond “It tastes good.”</p>

 <h2>The new Lay’s chip bag</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000637409" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000637409"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000637409">©Lay’s / PepsiCo</figcaption></figure>  <p>So to help address this problem, and also declining sales, the chip maker is rebranding its most famous product. I mean, this doesn’t seem like Lay’s problem to me, but it’s nice they are trying something. You’ll notice that the new bag design has potatoes on it. I mean, the old design <em>literally</em> had a potato transforming into a chip on the front of it, but apparently that wasn’t working. The new bag looks more rustic with wood paneling artwork, and even says, in big black letters, “Made with real potatoes.” Lay’s really wants you all to know that these are potato chips. Lay’s also says it’s removing artificial flavors and colors from its popular potato chip brand in the United States, too. I assume this is connected to U.S. Health Secretary and America’s 14th weirdest maniac, Robert F. Kennedy Jr, and <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-live-rfk-jr-to-announce-phasing-out-of-artificial-food-dyes">his ongoing war against artificial flavors and other chemicals he doesn’t like</a>.</p>

 <p>“The new visual identity celebrates the humble, farm-grown potato — where every Lay’s potato chip starts — and heroes the ingredients that deliver the unmatched flavor consumers have always loved,” explained Alexis Porter, PepsiCo’s Vice President of Marketing, Global Lay’s, in a press release. You can almost hear the desperation from Porter when talking about how these chips are made from potatoes.</p> <p>Will all of this work? Who can say? It does feel like more than ever, the world is slipping into accepted stupidity, while folks seem overall less interested in learning. And if you do try to learn anything, you just end up reading AI-generated summaries filled with nonsense. Or maybe people just assume everything they buy in a store is fake and overly processed plastic pretending to be food. Probably a bit of column A and column B. I’m feeling kind of sad about the future. Seems like the perfect time to curl up on my couch and eat some chips. Wonder what these things are made out of?</p>

              <p>The October 2025 Steam Next Fest <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-free-demos-next-fest-painkiller-reanimal-steam-2000634620">wrapped up today</a> and Valve has revealed the most downloaded demos from the event. Big winners included <em>Heroes of Might and Magic: Olden Era</em>, <em>Everwind</em>, and <em>YAPYAP</em>. If you’ve never heard of any of those, this is your chance to catch up on tomorrow’s hit Steam games before they’re out.</p> <p>Here are the top 10 demo downloads during the latest Steam Next Fest in order of most unique players:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2397300/Half_Sword?snr=1_614_615_nextfestmostplayed_100703"><strong><em>Half Sword</em></strong></a> (medieval swordplay sim)</li> <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3241970?snr=1_614_615_nextfestmostplayed_100703"><strong><em>Heroes of Might and Magic: Olden Era</em></strong></a> (turn-based strategy)</li> <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3834090/YAPYAP/"><strong><em>YAPYAP</em></strong></a> (magic comedy crew-like)</li> <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4021860?snr=1_614_615_nextfestmostplayed_100703"><strong><em>Final Sentence</em></strong></a> (typing battle royale)</li> <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4019420?snr=1_614_615_nextfestmostplayed_100703"><strong><em>Reanimal</em></strong></a> (co-op horror adventure)</li> <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4028270?snr=1_614_615_nextfestmostplayed_100703"><strong><em>Everwind</em></strong></a> (co-op survival RPG)</li> <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2795540/The_Midnight_Walkers?snr=1_614_615_nextfestmostplayed_100703"><strong><em>The Midnight Walkers</em></strong></a> (zombie extraction shooter)</li> <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3810880/THE_CUBE_SAVE_US?snr=1_614_615_nextfestmostplayed_100703"><strong><em>The Cube, Save Us</em></strong></a> (extraction MMO)</li> <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4059420?snr=1_614_615_nextfestmostplayed_100703"><strong><em>Misery</em></strong></a> (post-apocalyptic co-op survival)</li> <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3179350/Long_Drive_North_CoOp_RV_Simulator?snr=1_614_615_nextfestmostplayed_100703"><strong><em>Long Drive North: Co-Op RV Simulator</em></strong></a> (open world survival)</li> </ul> <p>Online co-op and survival sims still reign supreme, though it’s nice to see <em>Heroes of Might and Magic</em> having a mini-breakout moment in 2025. “This is the heroes game I have been waiting for ever since heroes 3,” wrote one Steam reviewer about the demo. I was never an <em>HoMM</em> guy growing up, but I like strategy RPGs and enjoyed what I tried of the Early Access build that came out earlier this month.</p>

 <p>Here are some other games from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfestmostplayed">larger top 50 Next Fest demo list</a> that caught my eye. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2923350/Ultimate_Sheep_Raccoon/"><em>Ultimate Sheep Raccoon</em></a> is a multiplayer PVP <em>Trials</em>-like. Think 2D side-scrolling <em>Mario Kart</em>. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2878450/Master_of_Command/"><em>Master of Command</em></a> is a history buff’s historical strategy game that trades neat graphics for the nitty-gritty detail of regiment customization and supply line management. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3170150"><em>Cairn</em></a> is an open-world atmospheric climbing sim. It looks like the indie version of <em>Breath of the Wild</em> meets <em>Death Stranding</em>. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4040960/Tears_of_Metal_Demo/"><em>Tears of Metal</em></a> is a co-op hack-and-slash roguelike. It’s giving <em>Dynasty Warriors</em> in the art style of <em>Darkest Dungeon</em>. Finally there’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1263240/Skate_Story/"><em>Skate Story</em></a>, a skateboard RPG in which you grind through a shadow realm to liberate tortured souls. I keep hearing great things.</p> <p>The October 2025 Steam Next Fest may be over now, but most of these games still have free demos you can download if you want to check them out and wishlist them ahead of their launch windows. Because as we all know, Steam users don’t already have way too much to play.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Fifteen years ago, when director Guillermo del Toro was scheduled to drop by Criterion’s New York office for a project, a casual email from the social media team sparked an unexpected tradition. On a whim, someone floated the idea of snapping a photo of the director inside their office closet—a quirky little nook where guests on business, as a courtesy, were invited to pick out a couple of films as a parting gift. Knowing how generous the <em>Pan's Labyrinth</em> director was, <a href="https://www.criterion.com/current/author/307-peter-becker?srsltid=AfmBOoo2LTumpnUOL8gzYTRmqIxhIVjHvA-evBpSHF5umLRPavJbqDxd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Peter Becker</a>, Criterion’s president, figured del Toro wouldn’t just be game—he might even let them film the whole thing. Hell, maybe folks on “the Facebook” would get a modest kick out of watching him rummage through their spine-numbered treasure trove of films.</p><p>And sure enough, Guillermo got back to them, saying, “Sure, let’s do it!”</p><p>“He totally understood what we were doing, and he understood why we were doing it.” Becker told me, still sounding amazed nearly two decades later. “He generously went through, picked a whole bunch of stuff in very little time, saying just a few words about each thing he put in his bag.”</p><p>And just like that, what started off as a one-off video of del Toro rifling through a closet of movies served as the blueprint for Criterion’s most beloved ritual: the <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7D89754A5DAD1E8E&amp;si=ENAMR2hDowDvEm0B" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Criterion Closet Picks</a> video series.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Guillermo del Toro - DVD Picks" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/49Al7eYy6sg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Over 300 videos later, Closet Picks has become cinephiles’ version of unboxing therapy meets NPR’s Tiny Desk Concert. Featuring everyone from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tG_cBdvo2c&amp;list=PL7D89754A5DAD1E8E&amp;index=164&amp;pp=iAQB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Willem Dafoe</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUou0rghddc&amp;list=PL7D89754A5DAD1E8E&amp;index=181&amp;pp=iAQB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hideo Kojima</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_rAKw7q6RY&amp;list=PL7D89754A5DAD1E8E&amp;index=215&amp;pp=iAQB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cate Blanchett</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBpffnfc3AI&amp;list=PL7D89754A5DAD1E8E&amp;index=109&amp;pp=iAQB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Janelle Monáe</a>, all whispering sweet nothings about their favorite films while raiding Criterion’s curated stash of classic and contemporary films like kids in a candy store. All the while, putting thousands of viewers onto the next film to queue into their backlog.&nbsp;</p><p>To celebrate those fans, Criterion <a href="https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/8721-on-the-road-with-the-criterion-mobile-closet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">took the closet on the road</a> last year, allowing fans to line up in multiple cities across the United States—as well as Canada for TIFF—to live out their own star-for-a-day fantasy picking out films, posing for a Polaroid, and walking away with their physical media finds like it was 2005.&nbsp;</p><p>For its 40th anniversary, the mobile Criterion Closet made its seventh stop in my hometown of Chicago, just in time for the <a href="https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/8914-next-stop-the-criterion-mobile-closet-at-the-chicago-international-film-festival" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chicago International Film Festival</a>. Naturally, I joined the dedicated Criterion fans waiting in line since 9:30 a.m., despite a light drizzle and a head full of questions for Becker, whom I had bumped into the day before when he broke the bad news that the line had closed hours earlier on the Friday before. At the time, I didn’t realize I was casually chatting with the president of the whole shebang.&nbsp;</p><p>While waiting for my own pilgrimage into the hot commodity mobile closet, I met back up with Becker, who recognized me from the day before, and he agreed to my blog-brained inquiry for an impromptu interview. The first was what even inspired the idea to film people cherry-picking their favorite movies from their closet.&nbsp;</p><p>“We found that some of the best conversations we had with people—even if we had just interviewed them for two hours beforehand—happened in the closet at the very end of their visits,” Becker said. “People are relaxed and they’re looking up and they’re being reminded of movies that they love and it triggers memories.”</p><p>While del Toro had served as the blueprint for what the Criterion Closet Picks are today, Becker told me they were pretty shy about asking more creatives to do a video with them because they didn’t want to create collaborators on the spot for what was ostensibly marketing their products for them.&nbsp;</p><p>“We were pretty sparing about who we asked, so the earliest closet videos are some of the people who were closest to the company—personally, emotionally. People that we can turn to when we’re trying something new,” Becker said.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Bill Hader's DVD Picks" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/348qOuXOAXo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The earliest of Criterion Closet’s visitors included the likes of Emmy award-winning actor Bill Hader and French director <a href="https://youtu.be/s7Jx0Pjq_kQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Agnès Varda</a>. Unlike today’s Criterion Closet format, where the camera stayed in a fixed position as its guests perused the shelves, they were boxed in between on either side of their shoulders and backs. Becker says the old format had metal shelves, and the camera was in the wrong place. Mainly, he didn’t know where to put it while he himself was recording guests raiding their closet. Meanwhile, Becker tried his damnedest hand-holding the camera while trying to get out of people’s way. After a while, the tide turned, and guests started asking Criterion to shoot them browsing their closet.&nbsp;</p><p>“We’ve always aspired for Criterion to be a hub in film culture—a common place that can be shared by filmmakers, audiences, restorers, scholars, and critics,” Becker said. “To be a meeting place for people who are coming to movies for all kinds of different reasons.”</p><p>Becker’s favorite Closet Pick videos are the early ones—mostly because he was behind the camera for them. But his standout moment came when Rose Byrne, fresh from her Criterion closet experience, chatted about it on Late Night with Seth Meyers. The two laughed over the charming absurdity of the fact that it was, true to its name, “just a closet.” For Becker, seeing their shared enthusiasm reflected in everyday fans attending their roadshow was a gratifying reminder that the love of cinema can bridge even the insurmountable gap between stars and audiences.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Rose Byrne on Her Intense Role in If I Had Legs I'd Kick You, Talks Working with Conan O'Brien" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/POoi1rhMZNY?start=347&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>“We honor the filmmakers every day with their work, but the audiences that care about movies the way that we care about movies, sign up for our streaming service, and buy our discs, we couldn’t do this without them,” Becker told me. “So the mobile closet was built as a tribute to them.”</p><p>The mobile Criterion Closet itself was a snug squeeze—about two and a half shoulders wide, which Becker assured attendees was a faithful replica of the genuine article, minus the ceiling height (a concession to van physics). Not that anyone minded. Each time a group would emerge from the back of the van, they did so like Russell Crowe in <em>Gladiator</em>, hoisting their film picks overhead and basking in the cheers from the line like they’d just won the Cannes Palme D’Or in New City’s mall kiosk parking lot.&nbsp;</p><p>Having waited in line for more than five and a half hours, Becker highlighted that the true essence of the mobile Criterion Closet wasn’t the spectacle of the truck (or the 40% discount for attendees)—it was the line itself. For Becker and the Criterion team, bringing the closet to Chicago wasn’t about mimicking the celebrity experience. It was about transforming a queue into a conversation, encouraging spontaneous community. It was about film lovers stepping out from behind their screens, connecting in real time, and forging bonds over a mutual passion for cinema.</p><p>“When we started the mobile closet, we didn’t realize how much the line was going to be the point,” Becker said. “What happens in the Closet videos often is that people are reminded of movies, and often, they’re reminded of who they saw them with, who recommended them to them, or who has always wanted to see this movie they haven’t seen. We really had come to understand that film is a mode of connection, and we hadn’t anticipated the degree to which that was going to be true at this event, too.”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Ayo Edebiri’s Closet Picks" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7LvIlPvrjGk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Because hundreds of people turned out to the event, Criterion folks quickly recognized they couldn’t handle the Closet Picks individually. Instead, they grouped people up. And from there, they unconsciously fostered icebreakers amongst folks who’d be spending hours waiting together to talk about their shared love of films.&nbsp;</p><p>“It gives people permission to talk to each other and compare notes,” Becker said. “The mountain of cinema is enormous. There’s a million pathways, a million trials that people have taken. So it’s a chance for people to compare notes about the things that they’ve discovered&nbsp; on their own journeys—their own adventures as moviegoers—and for us to hear from them too.”&nbsp;</p><p>Proof that the line was the load-bearing half of the magic: my partner and I became fast friends with our queue comrades, Kato and Dan. Between swatting away bees drawn to our collectively enticing shampoo-coffee aura, we immediately swapped Letterboxd and Instagram handles like business cards at a mixer. Over the course of our wait, we strategized our three film pick titles each, with military precision—plus back-up plans in case our top choices got snatched. Deep cuts like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorcerer_(film)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">William Friedkin's <em>Sorcerer</em></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_%26_Basketball" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gina Prince-Bythewood’s <em>Love &amp; Basketball</em></a> earned mutual nods of respect.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Yes, we've already made plans to catch a movie together. <span></span><span>Isaiah Colbert</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the most rewarding parts of the event for Becker was seeing people naturally form groups—be they clusters of three or five—and bond over their favorite films. After spending hours in line together, it became hard for him to tell who had arrived as friends and who had become bosom buddies while waiting in line.&nbsp;</p><p>“There’s a sense of community. I think that’s fairly special—to feel like you’re fostering a sense of community among people. As we get older in life, it’s increasingly rare to find ourselves surrounded by complete strangers with whom we know to a certainty we share a passionate interest,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>He continued: “Everybody here really loves movies in a way that is important enough to them that they're willing to sacrifice some of their precious time and freedom to be here and wait in line. We may all have more in common with these strangers that we're in line with than we do with some of our good friends and relatives, who we love and certainly wouldn't trade them for strangers in line, necessarily. But it is really nice every once in a while to be surrounded by people that you're like, ‘Ah, I see you. I can feel what you're feeling about that film,’ or ‘ I’m grateful for you sharing your experience with me for these movies.’”</p><p>Plus, our collective anguish over Michael Bay’s <em>Armageddon </em>being sold out led to the real jaw-dropping reveal when Becker, keeping folks company while waiting in line, casually informed us that Kato’s would-be pick sparked an internal debate at Criterion HQ over whether it should join its catalogue. Fortunately, Bay maximalism prevailed, and the film proved to be so popular that it vanished within the first half-day of the Criterion Closet roadshow. Womp womp.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="John David Washington and Malcolm Washington’s Closet Picks" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Tc0JZz6hFM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>As a <a href="https://aftermath.site/one-battle-after-another-review-aftercha" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">freshly minted Paul Thomas Anderson devotee</a> and a lifelong evangelist for Kátia Lund and Fernando Meirelles’ 2002 drama film, <em>City of God</em>, I couldn’t leave well enough alone, having reworked my chicken scratch Criterion Closet Picks list and spiralling into mild despair over their absence from Criterion’s 1,200 plus titles, I had to ask: how does Criterion decide which films get invited to the cool kids table?&nbsp;</p><p>“We never wanted to be a housekeeping seal of approval for movies. It’s not that there aren’t great movies that are not a part of the collection. It’s not that every movie in the collection is beloved by every member of the Criterion staff. Film is a very subjective passion, so we’re constantly fielding—from within the staff and from the outside world—people’s passionate pitches for what we should release,” Becker said.&nbsp;</p><p>To give a look under the hood, Becker explained that Criterion has an internal acquisitions team that includes people working on theatrical, disc, and Criterion Channel programming acquisitions, as well as a curatorial advisory board that it calls upon anytime to learn more about a film and determine where it would fit in. This would include getting the lowdown about a film from a culture that staff aren’t well versed in, as well as curating a list of films that fit a certain vein they want to bolster in their library, and tracking down those hidden gems. As such, Becker told me that Criterion has a long list of films that we’re pursuing at any given time in addition to a huge, rolling backlog of movies it already has rights to that it hasn’t gotten around to releasing just yet. This would include films like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Days_and_Nights_in_the_Forest_(film)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Satyajit Ray’s<em> Days and Nights in the Fores</em></a><em>t</em>, which took 11 years for Criterion, in collaboration with <a href="https://www.film-foundation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Martin Scorsese’s Film Foundation</a> and the <a href="https://filmheritagefoundation.co.in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Film Heritage Foundation in India</a>, to combine forces and complete the restoration of the 1920s Indian Bengali melodrama.&nbsp;</p><p>Becker explained that bringing new titles into the Criterion fold can be a years-long process, especially when restorations are involved. Films with poorly preserved elements often require extensive work and patience, making some releases a slow but deliberate labor of love. That being said, some projects culminate quicker than others, as was the case with Sean Baker’s Mikey Madison-led Academy Award-winning film, <a href="https://www.avclub.com/anora-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Anora</em></a>. Which, as Becker recounts, was a film Criterion was working on before it received all the awards because of its admiration for Baker’s work and belief in the film, which accelerated its physical release schedule from Criterion.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Simon Pegg’s Closet Picks" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vIYr2eAlazo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Becker added that Criterion’s selection process isn’t purely curatorial, because it is not just about being able to choose any film at any given time. Securing the rights and locating the necessary materials are just part of the equation. Even when they have the legal clearance, they might have to wait until a filmmaker isn’t busy working on a film to collaborate. Likewise, the path to a release often involves a complex mix of timing, logistics, and having the free time to partner up—all things Becker finds to be the secret sauce to what makes Criterion special.&nbsp;</p><p>“I think that’s part of what makes the whole collection so rich—it doesn’t reflect any single curatorial perspective. But it is the product of a bunch of genuinely engaged people who wholeheartedly discuss what the best use of our time right now would be,” Becker said. “We’re trying to make the best choices we can for an audience that has rich and eclectic tastes. So, we would never dump a whole bunch of releases from one filmmaker, or just because it was from one studio, all at once. We’re always trying to put together a mix of films, mixing up classics, contemporary, silent, sound, black and white, international, Hollywood, [and] independent, all together month after month, creating a varied diet for people.”<br></p><p>When I brought up my dismay that <em>City of God</em> and <em>Magnolia </em>hadn’t yet made it into the Criterion Collection, Becker graciously encouraged fans everywhere to keep sending in suggestions, reminding movie lovers that Criterion still has “plenty of work to do.” With any luck, taking the mobile Criterion Closet on the road will pave the way for long-overlooked gems and cult classics to finally earn their place in its spine-numbered pantheon.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/matt-leone-shadow-of-the-colossus-oral-history-aftermath-hours"><h3>A History of Histories</h3></a><p>" I don't think there is always a canonical version of, like, the development story of a game."</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/battlefield-6-campaign-singleplayer-review-impressions"><h3>Battlefield 6’s Campaign Is An Act Of Narrative Cowardice</h3></a><p>The only thing worse than saying something stupid is saying nothing at all</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/criterion-mobile-closet-picks-peter-decker-interview-chicago-international-film-festival]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Here's what we know.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I've been playing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> on my Switch 2 since it was first released and have loved every minute of it. The game takes place entirely in Lumiose City and I've found that it runs beautifully on the new console. Whether you're catching Pokémon in the wild zones or diving into intense battles, everything looks crisp and gameplay is perfectly smooth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You don't actually need to own a Switch 2 to play Pokémon Legends: Z-A, though. The standard Switch version is now available for $10 less than its Switch 2 counterpart. So if you're a Poké fan who hasn't yet taken the plunge and purchased the latest console, you don't have to miss out on the latest Pokémon adventure. The real question is: How well does the Switch 1 version actually run? IGN had the chance to play the game on both consoles side-by-side and it would seem the older console is quite capable of running the game – with the exception of some frame rate loss. You can check out our comparison below to see for yourself how the two versions of the game stack up against each other.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Should You Upgrade?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Like we noted in our comparison video, the differences between the two versions of the game are noticeable, but not so vast that you really <em>need</em> to upgrade to play the game. If you want the best possible gameplay experience with the sharpest possible visuals, then I'd say it's absolutely worth upgrading to the Switch 2. If you don't want to dish out the $450 for a new console, however, the Switch 1 version of the game will work just fine. The environments will be a little less detailed and some of the Pokémon may look a bit stilted in their movements, but overall the experience will still be fun.</p><div catalogid="f068ae83-e47c-49c5-b680-e7171e09803f" id="225667"><div id="225667" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nintendo Switch 2 - Pokemon Legends: Z-A Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As someone who did upgrade to the Switch 2, I'd say the value in such an upgrade is more about future games than this current in-between period. Nintendo will continue to release <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-upcoming-nintendo-switch-games">upcoming Switch games</a> on both consoles, but eventually the older hardware won't be able to handle the latest releases. This has already been the case for games like Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza, which are both Switch 2 exclusives. And while <em>this</em> Pokémon game is available on both consoles, I can almost guarantee that the next mainline game in the series won't be able to run on the original Switch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This brings some added value to something like the latest <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/nintendo-switch-2/All_Switch_2_Bundles">Switch 2 bundle</a> because it gets you the Switch 2 version of the game at a slight discount when you buy the bundle alongside it. So even though Pokémon Legends: Z-A doesn't necessarily require an upgrade, it's still a potential reason to purchase the next generation console. This is especially true when you consider that Nintendo has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-announces-us-price-rises-for-original-switch-warns-price-rises-for-switch-2-games-and-the-nso-membership-may-be-necessary-in-the-future">already raised the price of the original Switch</a> and warned that the price of the Switch 2 will also likely increase down the line.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">You can always purchase a Switch 2 upgrade later</h3></div><div catalogid="53fafc1c-dc52-4e84-9598-afe719211c50" id="222303"><div id="222303" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon Legends Z-A (Switch 2)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are planning on playing Pokémon Legends: Z-A on the original Switch, it's worth noting that you can choose to purchase the Switch 2 upgrade for the game down the line. If you start playing the Switch 1 version and end up purchasing a Switch 2 later on, all you need to do is purchase the $10 upgrade pack to access better graphics and performance. Considering the cost of the Switch 2 version is only $10 more than the Switch 1 edition, you won't be paying more by taking this route.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Oct 20, 2025 6:37 pm</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/should-you-upgrade-to-a-nintendo-switch-2-to-play-pokemon-legends-z-a]]></content:encoded>

The Nintendo Dual Screen! Or Nintendo DS, as it was actually known. There's a console that has practically no relevance to this site, except for right now, because of a game called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dementium-the-ward">Dementium: The Ward</a>. For those that haven't heard of it, this is one of the incredibly few <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> games available on the handheld console, nowadays a bit of a cult classic because who on earth thought it would be a good idea to do that. It was also pitched as a Silent Hill game, a point we'll come back to because the big thing here is that it's making its way to Steam later this month.
</p>
<p>
Here's the concept: you wake up in a hospital, you've got no memories, and there's nasty monsters you have to defend yourself from. On the original DS, you had to use the touch screen to look around, and you needed to use the D-Pad to move. This obviously sounds like a bit of a tricky control scheme, though it looks like it'll be your standard first-person affair in the PC release. One thing in the DS' favour that will be missing however is that you could also write down notes in a notebook using the touchscreen.

<p>
I do wonder if these changes will rob the game of something. It's not a completely new port, the game is already available on Switch and PS4/PS5, so these changes have already taken place, but I question if the lack of friction from the finicky sounding DS controls makes the experience flatter. Though, I do appreciate that it's generally retained its original visuals. Death to revisionist remasters!
</p><p>
Anyway, that Silent Hill connection! A few years back Jools Watsham, the co-founder of Renegade Kid, developer of Dementium, shared that the studio had <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/27/dementium-the-ward-was-pitched-to-konami-as-a-silent-hill-ds-game">pitched the game to Konami about making it a Silent Hill entry</a>. According to Watsham, Konami were "kind enough to meet with us, but the meeting only lasted a few minutes and ended with their [representative] saying they wouldn't let a team like us handle the Silent Hill license." Rough! But looking at Dementium, even if it is a cult classic, it's probably for the best ultimately.
</p>
<p>
Mostly I think this thing is a neat little curiosity, as it's not very often you see DS games ported off of the console given the complexity of adapting dual screen gameplay. Normally you get remakes like The World Ends With You. In any case, if you're interested in picking up the seasonally appropriate Dementium: The Ward, it's due out later this month on October 27th via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3909960/Dementium_The_Ward/">Steam</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The innovative and fondly remembered <i>FEAR</i> turns 20 this year, having been released on October 18, 2005. The game arrived on PC (and later PS3 and Xbox 360) as a thrilling mix of first-person-shooter gunplay and survival horror, incorporating exhilarating bullet-time mechanics and playing with your sense of reality when you least expected it. It remains a hell of a good time, with smart computer-controlled enemies and a mysterious little girl who will haunt your dreams. Its sequel, <i>Project Origin</i>, is a serviceable 360-era shooter with a…disturbing sexual assault scene at the end. As for <i>FEAR 3</i>, well, I’m sure someone likes it.</p> <p>If you haven’t played these games or have been meaning to add them to your library, you can now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sub/12357/">grab the whole collection on Steam</a> for just over five dollars from now until October 23, 2025, making it a perfect way to jump into these shooter/horror games in time for Halloween.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/monolith-productions-wonder-woman-multiversus-cancel-wb-1851766400">Warner Bros. Cancels <i>Wonder Woman</i> Game And Shuts Down <i>Shadow Of Morder </i>Studio</a></p> <p>Developed by Monolith (<a href="https://kotaku.com/monolith-productions-wonder-woman-multiversus-cancel-wb-1851766400">RIP</a>), <i>FEAR</i> puts you in the role of a “First Encounter Assault Recon” soldier tasked with stopping some out-of-control telepathically controlled soldiers. Along the way, you unravel the mysteries behind some warped experiments involving psychics and cloning.</p>

 <p>The series’ use of bullet time isn’t just about looking cool; it’s a pretty essential tool for overcoming some of the overwhelming forces you’re up against. And while it definitely feels powerful and awesome to use, it isn’t a get-out-of-jail-free card, especially on harder difficulties. You need to be mindful of when and how you use it.</p> <p>The original remains an iconic game of the 2000s era, with a sequel that’s well worth your time if the universe speaks to you. Sadly, <i>FEAR 3</i> (stylized as <i>F3AR</i> 🙄) was a victim of the co-op shovelware trend that was particularly insidious during the 360 era. I do recall a handful of decent moments in some of the levels, but it’s a very skippable game if you’ve had your fill by the end of <i>FEAR 2</i>’s DLC. Normally I wouldn’t advise anyone to buy it, but seeing as the whole series including the DLC is on sale on Steam as a package deal for a little over five bucks, I’d say it’s worth having this one in your collection to get the other, better ones. Say hi to Alma for me.</p>

                <p>Greek mythology has been around for thousands of years and its traditions have inspired artists working in nearly every medium. What brings me joy is that each writer, visual artist, director--or in the case of Hades 2, a team of game developers--can explore a unique vision of the characters and events they choose to highlight. With the sequel to its popular hack-and-slash roguelite Hades, Supergiant Games explores the worlds of Greek gods from the perspective of Melinoe, the princess of the Underworld.</p><p dir="ltr">As the playable protagonist of Hades 2, Melinoe shows players a new side of life in the Underworld. Unlike her brother Zagreus, the young witch didn’t grow up with her family in the main palace. She instead lives in a ramshackle camp on the outskirts of Hades’ domain. The distance between her and her loved ones is palpable, and her only connection to her family is a single drawing enshrined in Melinoe’s make-shift room. The game starts when Melinoe, brooding yet powerful, decides to save her family from the Titan of time, Kronos, and finally close the gap that’s always separated them.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Hades 2 Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Yet Hades 2 is far from the only modern reinterpretation that hones in on the women of Greek mythology, and Melinoe’s plights soon reminded me of another story that follows a Greek goddess and witch: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Circe-Madeline-Miller/dp/0316556327?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Madeline Miller's Circe</a>. Published in 2018, this retelling follows the story of the goddess Circe, a witch who was banished to the island of Aeaea by Zeus. If you’ve read The Odyssey, you might know the character as the duplicitous sorceress who transformed Odysseus’ men into pigs. However, Miller’s book gives the reader the chance to imagine the events from <em>her </em>side of the story.</p><p dir="ltr">If you really like Hades 2--and if you are at all interested in the witches of Greek mythology or reading stories that aren’t only about violent dude-bros starting wars--Circe is required reading. I don’t just say this because it’s easy to read and incredibly entertaining; The book also deepened my appreciation of Hades 2 <em>and</em> helped me understand where the story told in the game could have explored certain themes with more depth.</p><p dir="ltr">In Circe, witchcraft is seen as a threat to the higher gods. Unlike the Olympians, who derive their power from their bloodlines, witchcraft draws its strength from the earth. Any person, god, or goddess can harness this power through constant toil and practice. To become a strong witch, Circe grinds--and I mean this literally because she is constantly using her mortar and pestle to process herbs and flowers--day after day in her kitchen, honing her elixirs. What culminates is a very feminine power--one that grows with the steady housewife-like work of maintaining a garden and pantry.</p><p dir="ltr">Similar to Circe in the novel, Melinoe must toil repeatedly in order to collect herbs and flowers that upgrade her powers and camp. As a player, I too began to feel like a witch as I honed my powers--learning how to play the game better and slowly collecting resources I needed to upgrade my attacks and stats. Still, Melinoe’s journey is quite different from Circe’s. Her main source of power comes from the other Olympians, who upgrade her sorcery with various boons and stat buffs.</p><p dir="ltr">Melinoe is also the daughter of Hades. Thougher father discourages her quest, he still provides her aid in the form of character upgrades and resources. Playing as Melinoe doesn’t feel like navigating the world as an ostracized witch. Instead, every Olympian meets her with a smile or some chipper quip. The great Zeus--a god known for being a perpetrator of sexual violence--greets her with a chuckle and lends her his power at a moment's notice. Melinoe, unlike the goddesses in Circe’s world, gets to choose her suitor.</p><p dir="ltr">Supergiant Games’ take on the story casts a shiny veneer on the world of Greek mythology. This feels odd at points because, as other critics have pointed out, the stories of Greek <a href="https://www.endlessmode.com/video-games/hades-ii/hades-iis-ill-defined-unserious-world-undermines-the-depth-and-power-of-mythology" rel="nofollow ">mythology typically portray the brutal nature of the gods</a>. Still, the overall cheeriness makes sense given Hades 2 is more-or-less a fun dating simulator with compelling hack-and-slash gameplay. But even given that, it made me feel like Supergiant copy-and-pasted its popular formula with a female protagonist without doing the deep work of trying to imagine how a Greek myth might be different when viewed through a women’s perspective.</p><p dir="ltr">In the book, Circe is a lesser god in every sense of the term. She’s not stereotypically attractive compared to other goddesses, so she can’t be married off (which is how her value is defined in the world of the gods). She’s the daughter of a Titan, so she’s considered to be a tier below the Olympians on Mount Olympus. She doesn’t have the inherent raw power of her father Helios, a sun god and who regularly lashes out against her. <a href="https://aftermath.site/hades-2-ending" rel="nofollow ">Unlike Hades 2</a>, Circe is fundamentally a story about transformation--of a woman who finds her own source of power to defy the hierarchy of the gods.</p><p>I don’t think every story about a woman needs to be hard, or marred by some sort of trauma. Hades 2 feels like good, somewhat shallow, fun. I can eat up the gameplay like popcorn and romance hot characters. It's fun to play and I’m glad we have both kinds of stories. But if you want a story that really sinks its teeth into the deep--and very oftentimes difficult--lives Greek witches, then you should definitely give Miller’s Circe a read.</p>

              <p>Some of my favorite games ever are on sale for the Switch right now. You might already own most of these, but I promise most of you will find something worth picking up in the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/sales-and-deals/">eShop</a>‘s latest fire sale.</p> <p>Here’s just a sample:</p> <ul> <li><strong><em>Paradise Killer</em></strong> – $5 (75 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>What The Golf?</em></strong> – $8 (60 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Bomb Rush Cyberfunk</em></strong> – $20 (50 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Moonlighter: Complete Edition</em></strong> – $4.34 (85 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>OlliOlli World</em> </strong>– $5 (75 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Spiritfarer</em></strong> – $4.50 (85 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Disco Elysium</strong> – The Final Cut</em> – $12 (70 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim </em></strong>– $15 (75 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Inscryption</em> </strong>– $7 (65 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Death’s Door</em></strong> – $5 (75 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Digimon Story Cyber Sleuth: Complete Edition</em></strong> – $5 (90 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Unicorn Overlord</em></strong> – $24 (60 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Hotline Miami Collection</em></strong> – $5 (80 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Inside</em></strong> – $2 (90 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Risk of Rain 2</em></strong> – $6.24 (75 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Slay the Spire</em> </strong>– $8.50 (66 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Shin Megami Tensei III Nocturne HD Remaster</em></strong> – $15 (70 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Sonic Frontiers</em></strong> – $18 (70 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Civilization VI</em></strong> – $6 (80 percent off)</li> </ul> <p>A few special shout-outs. If you don’t have <em>Slay the Spire</em>, it’s a top-notch deck-building roguelike that you won’t be able to put down. <em>Risk of Rain 2</em>, a loot shooter roguelike, is a similarly irresistible timesink. <em>Inside</em>, meanwhile, is an excellent cinematic platformer adventure game and, in my opinion at least, one of the best games ever made. It doesn’t get enough credit. Only $2? A steal!</p> <p>Finally, <em>Digimon Cybersleuth</em> is an incredibly meaty JRPG for just $5 (the series latest entry <a href="https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-the-kotaku-review-2000630341">came out this fall</a>), and $15 is a great price for <em>13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim</em>, a wonderfully inventive and surprising visual novel/strategy game mash-up from Vanillaware.</p>

 <h2>The Switch 2 version of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> gets its biggest discount yet</h2> <p>There are actually some decent Switch 2 deals right now, too. They’re nowhere near as good as the ones for games on the OG hardware, but <em>Cyberpunk 2077: The Ultimate Edition</em> in particular is just $40 until November 1. That’s 43 percent off the list price, which isn’t bad at all for a port that only arrived in June. It runs surprisingly well on Switch 2 and is a decent way to catch up on the best sci-fi open-world RPG of the decade (it also supports cross-saves if you already started on another platform).</p> <p>What else is on sale on the Switch 2 at the moment?<em> Sonic X Shadow Generations</em> is just $30 right now (40 percent off) and GOTY contender <em>Split Fiction</em> is just $40 (20 percent off). The Switch 2 port of <em>EA Sports Madden NFL 26</em> isn’t the best but it’s currently $20 off the standard price. So is <em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em>, a very solid lifestyle sim RPG that arrived back with the launch of the Switch 2 earlier this year.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQje3P-QW58" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a video released by Xbox</a>, a world record attempt was made for the largest helicopter video game display flown in Miami Beach, Florida. With the help of Team Ninja’s community manager, Emmanuel “Master” Rodriguez, and rapper Swae Lee, they played Ninja Gaiden 4 in a helicopter. The 26-foot wide display was being flown by another helicopter piloted by Heli-D. It took place 20 m² (215 ft² 40 in²) in the air. Luckily, Guinness World Records bestowed Team Ninja and Xbox <a href="https://x.com/GWR/status/1980266739947499719" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with the world record</a>.</p>



<p>Ninja Gaiden 4, set to launch on Xbox Game Pass, has shown a lot since it’s February reveal. With previews of the title calling it a return to form, fans may be in for quite the treat. While the world record isn’t for it’s sales or gameplay feats, it doesn’t make it any less impressive. On that note, Xbox also has a first-party title, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-outer-worlds-2-review-embargo-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, releasing next week, making for two major titles for the company in October.

                <p>It's been 13 years since Ryu Hayabusa's last solo adventure in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ninja-gaiden-3/" data-ref-id="5000-83053">Ninja Gaiden 3</a>, but the legend returns this week in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ninja-gaiden-4/" data-ref-id="5000-659496">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> alongside a new hero, Yakumo. To promote the game with a stunt worthy of Ryu himself, Team Ninja community manager Emmanuel "Master" Rodriguez and musician Swae Lee took a ride over Miami in a helicopter while Rodriguez played Ninja Gaiden 4 on a large screen held aloft by another helicopter.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQje3P-QW58" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="38">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EQje3P-QW58?start=38" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>According to <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/20/ninja-gaiden-4-helicopter-world-record/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Wire</a>, this stunt set a new Guinness World Record for the largest video game display flown by helicopter. While Rodriguez guided Yakumo through his trials, Lee performed tracks from his record, "Flammable."</p><p>The stunt was inspired by Ninja Gaiden 4's story, which takes place among the skyscrapers of Tokyo, which have been expanded upon and raised even higher because the lower city has been ruined by toxic floodwaters. The Ninja Gaiden games have had high-flying action before, but it's going to another level in this sequel.</p><p>Ninja Gaiden 4 will be released on October 21 for Xbox Series X|S, PC, and PS5, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-release-times-revealed/1100-6535445/" data-ref-id="1100-6535445">the official launch times</a> may come a little earlier depending on where you live.
