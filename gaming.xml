		<p>One of the original team who pushed for the creation of the first Xbox, Seamus Blackley,&nbsp; has suggested that the new CEO, Asha Sharma, has been appointed to see the gradual wind down of the brand – because it’s nothing to do with AI.</p>
<p>“Xbox, like a lot of businesses that aren’t the core AI business, is being sunsetted,” Blackley told <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/what-an-xbox-founder-thinks-of-the-new-xbox-ceo-seamus-blackley-interview/">Gamesbeat</a>. “They don’t say that, but that’s what’s happening. I expect that the new CEO, Asha Sharma, her job is going to be as a palliative care doctor who slides Xbox gently into the night.”</p>


<p>“It just seems really true. I imagine asking somebody if it made sense to put a major motion picture studio into the hands of somebody who didn’t like movies, or a major record label into the hands of somebody who’d never seen a live show. Why would you do that?” he adds.</p>
<p>“The job of all these people is to just gently usher all of these business units into the new world of AI,” he continues. “That’s what you’re seeing here. Whether or not you agree with it, whether you agree with AI having the potential to do that, whether AI will be successful, is a separate matter. But that’s what we’re seeing.”</p>
<p>He also had some views on how the gaming community would react to Sharma’s appointment, first stating the gamers are very tolerant of non-gamers telling them what to believe, but then make it’s clear he is joking, “No, they’re not tolerant of any of these things. That’s the wall she’s about to discover.”</p>

<p>Seamus Blackley is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/seamus-blackley-25733/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currently</a> CEO of Pacific Light &amp; Hologram, a “technology start-up working in stealth mode to realise fully immersive 3D experience.” He also taught the world how to make Sourdough bread using ancient yeast and historical baking methods during the COVID pandemic.</p>
<p>You can read the full interview over on <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/what-an-xbox-founder-thinks-of-the-new-xbox-ceo-seamus-blackley-interview/">Gamesbeat</a>, it’s well worth a read. You can also <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/24/hero-to-net-zero-what-is-phil-spencers-legacy-at-xbox/">read our thoughts about outgoing CEO. Phil Spencer’s legacy here.</a></p>
<p>Do you think Xbox will continue as a brand or get sidelined by Microsoft as the chase AI? Let us know in the comments.</p>

<p>Baldur is described as Odin’s most dangerous weapon. He’s also described as charismatic and razor-sharp with a tongue. He was cursed as a boy with the inability to feel pleasure and physical sensation; he replaced those feelings with anger and bloodlust.</p>

            <guid>1445155</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony has announced the requirements for the PC version of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>, some free DLC, and the performance options for the game.</p>
<p>“Death Stranding 2 for PC offers a range of Graphics Presets from Low to Very High, catering to both budget gaming PC’s and high-end systems,” say Nixxes, who are handling the port. “We’ve also added a Portable preset, aimed at handheld gaming devices, for those Porters who want to “keep on keeping on” while on the go.”</p>



<p>The performance-enhancing options are a special Chinese herb that has been used for millennia, which guarantees at least three extra inches to satisfy…. wait, wrong press release.</p>
<p><em>“The PC edition of Death Stranding 2 launches with support for NVIDIA DLSS 4, AMD FSR 4 and Intel XESS 2. Both upscaling and frame generation options are available for all technologies.”</em></p>

<p><em>“For the first time on PC, you’ll find Pico as an option in Upscale Settings. This “Progressive Image Compositor” is developed by Guerrilla for the Decima engine and is the same upscaling technology that’s used for Death Stranding 2 on PS5. Pico upscaling can be used with all supported graphics cards and can be combined with the various options for frame generation offered in the game.”</em></p>
<p><em>“All upscaling options can be used in combination with Dynamic Resolution Scaling, or with an upscaling quality setting of choice to improve performance. Native AA options are also available for maximum fidelity.”</em></p>
<p>You will also be able to play on ultra-wide screens if you have one, with all of the cut scenes in 21:9 aspect ratio and gameplay in 32:9 ratio.&nbsp; If you do not have an ultra-wide screen monitor you can still play in those resolutions but with some black bars at the top and bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>This mode will also be coming to the PS5 version of the game, and PS5 players will also get the Porter Suit: Link and Patch: Link for free when the game launches on PC.</p>

<p>I reviewed the PS5 version of Death Stranding 2<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/23/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review/"> scoring it 8/10.</a> “Despite repeating huge chunks of Death Stranding 1, almost beat for beat, Kojima pulls it out of the bag in the end,” said I. “The core gameplay loop remains satisfying enough to get you through to the good stuff, but I can’t help but feel disappointed just how similar this game is to its predecessor.”</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-amazon-series-rebel-moons-ed-skrein-will-play-baldur/</link>
            <guid>1445152</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Ed Skrein</strong>, who you might recognize as the main antagonist in the first <strong>Deadpool</strong> movie or as the antagonist in Zack Snyder's ridiculous <strong>Rebel Moon</strong> films has been tapped by <strong>Amazon</strong> and <strong>PlayStation Productions </strong>to play <strong>Baldur</strong> in the upcoming <strong>God of War TV series</strong>.</p>



<p>Skrein is the latest to join the cast, taking up one of the last major characters whose casting had yet to be revealed. We know who is playing <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-show-amazon-prime-ryan-hurst-kratos-cast/">Kratos</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/callum-vinson-will-play-atreus-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-show/">Atreus</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-adds-to-god-of-war-tv-cast-with-alastair-duncan-returning-as-mimir-and-two-new-picks-for-brok-and-sindri/">Brok, Sindri, Mimir</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/severances-olafur-darri-olafsson-tapped-to-play-thor-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/">Thor</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-series-max-parker-heimdall-thor-mimir/">Heimdall</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/warm-bodies-star-teresa-palmer-tapped-to-play-sif-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/">Sif</a>,</strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/broadway-legend-mandy-patinkin-will-play-odin-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/">Odin</a></strong>, and we now know who will be stepping into Baldur's numb feet.</p>



<p>Announced in a new report from <a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/god-of-war-live-action-series-cast-ed-skrein-baldur-1236671517/">Variety</a>, Baldur's casting just leaves <strong>Freya</strong> as the only major character for whom we don't know the casting. Skrein's involvement also keeps the trend of Alastair Duncan (Mimir) and Ryan Hurst (Kratos) as the only actors who were involved in <strong>God of War (2018)</strong> and/or <strong>God of War Ragnarok</strong> that are also involved in this upcoming series. Alastair Duncan is also the only member of the cast to be reprising his role, since Hurst has gone from playing Thor in Ragnarok to playing Kratos in this live-action series.</p>



<p>The show is expected to <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-show-begins-filming-march-2026/">start filming next month</a>, so we'll hopefully have confirmation of who will be stepping into the role of Freya soon. While the rest of the casting choices suggest we shouldn't be expecting <strong>Danielle Bisutti</strong> to be reprising her role, her performance in both games was excellent, and it would certainly go a long way with fans of the games to see her continue with the character she clearly knows so well.</p>



<p>Here's the full cast list so far for Amazon's God of War TV series, led by <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/first-god-of-war-tv-series-details/">Ronald D. Moore</a>:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Ryan Hurst - Kratos</li>



<li>Callum Vinson - Atreus</li>



<li>Alastair Duncan - Mimir</li>



<li>Danny Woodburn - Brok</li>



<li>Jeff Gulka - Sindri</li>



<li>Teresa Palmer - Sif</li>



<li>Ólafur Darri Ólafsson - Thor</li>



<li>Max Parker - Heimdall</li>



<li>Mandy Patinkin - Odin</li>



<li>Ed Skrein - Baldur</li>
</ul>

No other platforms have been listed for the game yet, but I'd be very surprised indeed if we don't see a PC release.</p><p>Insomniac's <em>Wolverine </em>game will share continuity with <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/marvels-spider-man" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5ac0af43-332e-4175-a13f-13885dcdef7e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">both</a> of the studio's <em>Spider-Man </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/marvels-spider-man-2" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4c20da9d-d5d8-4520-b5d4-5d7b0be42289" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">outings</a>, but it'll be a standalone story, so you won't need to have played through either of Peter Parker's adventures in order to enjoy this one.</p><figure role="group">

<p>As the name suggests, the game will cast you as Wolverine, and while it's not an origin story, you won't need to know anything about the character's comic book exploits to play this one.</p><p>The story will revolve around Wolverine searching for "answers about his past", which is a pretty bog-standard setting to plonk Wolverine into, and he'll need to use "brutal claw combat, violent rage and relentless determination" to reach his goal.</p><p>From the gameplay segments we've seen so far, Wolverine will be battling both in his traditional yellow X-Men attire and in a more downhome plaid shirt outfit, and the combat will be suitably brutal as well, with plenty of blood to go around.</p><p>Strangely enough, it shares at least one thing with IO Interactive's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/007-first-light-delayed-may-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e0d84f2a-3cf3-41a8-9a3a-eb43f66bc545" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">upcoming <em>007 First Light</em></a> in that it'll be a globetrotting adventure for our hero as well, taking him to locations as diverse as Tokyo, Canada, and Madripoor, to name but a few.</p>
<p>News of <em>Wolverine</em>'s release date comes hot on the heels of news that Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-shutting-down-bluepoint-games-in-march" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="97877112-5514-4226-8057-9d99ef1d61c1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">will close <em>Demon's Souls </em>and <em>Shadow of the Colossus </em>studio Bluepoint</a>, suggesting that there might be a little more riding on Insomniac's latest than just the studio's reputation.</p><p><em>Marvel's Wolverine </em>launches <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/marvels-wolverine/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">exclusively for PlayStation 5</a> on September 15th (although, again, I'd be very surprised if there's not a PC port of the game waiting somewhere down the line).

            <p>
Remember how literally only two weeks ago, PlayStation held one of their "Look at the State of the Place, You've Made Such a Mess!" presentations? There were plenty of announcements that landed with suitable aplomb, like a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/castlevania-belmonts-curse-sees-dead-cells-devs-bring-back-vampire-whippage-and-konami-say-its-just-the-start-of-a-revival">new Castlevania</a>, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-first-person-walk-around-a-foggy-scottish-town-in-the-90s-silent-hill-townfall-is-certainly-serious-about-instilling-dread">proper look at Silent Hill: Townfall</a>, and a reveal of remakes of the OG three God of War Games. So it strikes me as perhaps a bit odd, and funny, that today Insomniac Games have, with quite little fanfare, confirmed the release date of their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvels-wolverine">Wolverine</a> joint.
</p>
<p>
I'm serious, the studio has literally just released a six second video across its socials which literally just shows the date for four of those. Oh, it's September 15th, this year, sorry, forgot that's the important bits, though for us in PC land this means next to nothing as the game will be a PS5 exclusive at launch. But given that all three of Insomniac's Spider-Man games eventually made their way to PC, we probably safely assume Wolverine will do much the same.

<p>
In terms of when that might be, well, I can make a guess. The first Spider-Man game came out before Sony started their PC porting strategy, but for the second smaller entry, Miles Morales, it took two years to make the jump, and for the full-on sequel the wait was about a year and a half.
</p><p>
It is worth considering the fact that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> is getting a PC release next month, less than a year after its PS5 launch, but Kojima Productions aren't owned by Sony like Insomniac are, so that might make a difference. All of this is to say, we should expect to wait at least roughly a year, if not a bit more.
</p>
<p>
Since its announcement, we honestly haven't seen all that much of the action game in, well, action, apart from a short gameplay trailer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvels-wolverine-at-long-last-gets-a-borderline-uncomfortably-bloody-gameplay-trailer-and-a-ps5-release-window">shown last year</a>. I expect it'll be a good few months before we see anything lengthier, perhaps in a summer showcase, but hey ho, marketing has to do its thing! And I'm sure it'll continue to do its thing when it's our turn to play.

            <guid>1445131</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Steam’s tri-yearly Next Fest, a week-long “celebration” featuring hundreds of new demos from triple-A and indie publishers alike, isn’t quite hitting the same as it used to for the community, due to the ever-growing influx of “slop” and “games that use generative AI and flip assets.” </span></p> <p><span>While this has been an issue for the last handful of Next Fests, Steam users on </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1rd10ws/the_next_fest_has_too_much_ai_slop_and_asset/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>Reddit</span></a><span> are reporting that this time around, they’ve had enough, and are opting to sort through the new games by popularity. For the indie devs banking on the free publicity that Next Fest provides, this seems like an awfully counterproductive use of the event as a whole.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">There are a zillion demos in this Steam Next Fest, and I'm going to be very real…I don't feel very compelled to check out demos with AI art capsules</p> <p>— Bucky | Palworld (@Bucky_cm) <a href="https://twitter.com/Bucky_cm/status/2026122068023226447?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 24, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Of course, the issue here has been exacerbated by the misuse of Valve’s AI disclosure section on Steam. While developers on the Steam storefront are required to admit to the use of AI-generated assets in their games, a quick glance at the latest, non-featured titles in the Next Fest line-up features more than a few suspiciously AI-generated-looking titles, none of which include any sort of AI-disclosure tag on their Steam storefront pages.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000673295" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000673295"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000673295">Valve</figcaption></figure> <p><span>As one user </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1rd10ws/comment/o728gau/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>explains</span></a><span>, they believe this is happening because developers are seemingly never punished for lying about generative AI use. “There is no real penalty so far for not disclosing. Only if you blatantly used like LLM text generation at run time would Valve care and that’s just for legal reasons. For assets etc it’s very much a trust system by Valve, they mostly did it to shut people up.”</span></p>   <p><span>So what’s the solution? According to several commenters, the only way to combat the rising tide of AI-generated games on Steam is to sort by popularity and reviews. However, the irony of sorting by popularity during Next Fest, an event designed to freely advertise indie demos, </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1rd10ws/comment/o72ewb7/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>hasn’t been lost</span></a><span> on the community. “These last few fests I’ve just had to sort by popularity. But I feel like that defeats the purpose of these events if all I’m doing is ‘finding’ the stuff that I would’ve heard about anyway. It’s just too exhausting to filter through.”</span></p>

 <p><span>On the flipside to the issue at hand, there’s an equally terrible problem plaguing a large swathe of indie devs taking part in Next Fest: false-positive AI-generated accusations. In the lead-up to the event, dozens of developers on subreddits such as </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IndieDev/comments/1p72gqo/how_can_we_defend_from_aiallegations/"><span>r/IndieDev</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1pr677z/how_should_devs_handle_curator_reviews_that_make/"><span>r/gamedev</span></a><span> have reported being incorrectly accused of using AI to make their games. Whatever the fix is, it’s clear that the onus here is on Valve, because this new wave of false-positive reporting proves that it’s getting harder and harder for the common man to accurately spot AI-gen’d assets.</span></p>

<p>Asha Sharma responds to concerns over her Xbox gamertag profile and recent social media posts.</p>



<p>Following Phil Spencer’s retirement announcement on Friday, February 20, Asha Sharma was named EVP and CEO of Microsoft Gaming. In an attempt to familiarize herself with the Xbox player base, Sharma <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-xbox-ceo-responds-to-fans-desire-for-console-exclusives/" id="178442">replied to players on Twitter</a>, letting them know that she hears their concerns and wants to recommit to core Xbox players and re-strengthen the brand.</p>



<p>In one of these tweets, she shared her gamertag.<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-ceo-profile-one-month-old-suspicious/" id="178467"> Internet sleuths quickly searched the profile </a>and felt it was artificially boosted to enhance her appearance as a relatable gamer.</p>



<h2 id="h-asha-sharma-didn-t-expect-her-profile-to-become-a-big-deal">Asha Sharma Didn’t Expect Her Profile to Become a Big Deal</h2>



<p>Responding to IGN’s Ryan McCaffrey on Twitter, Sharma claimed that she didn’t expect the gamertag to garner so much attention. </p>



<p>She also responded to concerns that AI, the department at Microsoft she previously worked in, is being used to write her posts, saying she agrees with those who claim that faking her affinity for gaming would be a bad thing.</p>



<p>She says her account had racked up more than 10,000 Gamerscore and played such a wide variety of games because it was a shared account at home. That has since been fixed.</p>



<p>“I also didn’t expect my gamertag to blowup and the reality is more boring. I created it recently to learn and understand this world. I’ve played with my family, and it’s a shared home account across devices (which you can see in the range of games /achievements). Fixed that this weekend and everyone is only playing on their own GTs,” she said before reaffirming that her goal is to return to the roots of Xbox and make the brand stronger for the future.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I agree. Faking would be a terrible idea and wouldn’t work.

<p>One of the games that Asha Sharma’s profile had 100% completed was Firewatch. Sharma has claimed that the game deeply resonated with her, and she wants to make emotionally impactful content like that at Xbox.

<p>Despite being regarded as one of the greatest role-playing games of all time,&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind </em>disappointed some fans upon its release in 2002 because it didn’t match the colossal scope of its predecessor, <em>The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall</em>. Almost immediately, fans began modding the remaining parts of the series’ fictional continent, Tamriel, into the game.</p>
<p>Over 20 years later, thousands of volunteers have collaborated on the mod projects <a href="https://www.tamriel-rebuilt.org/">Tamriel Rebuilt</a> and <a href="https://www.project-tamriel.com/welcome">Project Tamriel</a>, building a space comparable in size to a small country. Such projects often sputter out, but these have endured, thanks in part to a steady stream of small, manageable updates instead of larger, less frequent ones.</p>
<h2>A tale of (at least two) mods</h2>
<p>It’s true that <em>Daggerfall</em> included an entire continent’s worth of content, but it was mostly composed of procedurally generated liminal space. By contrast, <em>Morrowind</em> contained just a single island—not even the entire province after which the game was named. The difference was that it was handcrafted.</p>
<p>Still, a player called “Ender,” stewing in disappointment over <em>Morrowind</em>’s perceived scope, took to an Elder Scrolls forum to propose a collaborative effort to mod the rest of Tamriel into the game. Tamriel Rebuilt was born.</p>
<p>After realizing that re-creating the entire continent was too lofty a goal, the group decided to instead focus on the rest of the <em>Morrowind</em> province alone—but that didn’t last long.</p>
<p>There had been others working toward similar goals. The makers of the fan project “Skyrim: Home of The Nords” were working on putting the province of Skyrim into&nbsp;<em>Morrowind</em>&nbsp;well before that location was officially made the setting of the 2011 sequel <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em>.</p>

<p>Other modders were working on “Project Cyrodilll,” an attempt to put <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em>’s province into <em>Morrowind</em>. In 2015, those two projects combined to form Project Tamriel, reigniting the goal of adding the remaining provinces of Tamriel.</p>
<p>Tamriel Rebuilt and Project Tamriel first became connected when the modders decided to combine their asset repositories into <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44537">Tamriel_Data</a>, but they have since grown closer through their shared developers, training protocols, and tools.</p>

<p>“The entirety of Tamriel is, in our scale, roughly the size of the real-life country of Malta, which is small in real life, but quite big from a human perspective,” said Tiny Plesiosaur, a senior developer who has done mapping and planning for both projects but who spends most of her time on Project Tamriel these days.</p>
<p>Both projects aim to create a cohesive, lore-accurate representation of these realms as they would have looked during the fictional historical period in which <em>Morrowind</em> takes place. So far, they’ve made substantial progress.</p>
<p>One thing in their favor, said Mort, a 13-year veteran quest-designer of Tamriel Rebuilt, is that <em>Morrowind</em> design makes it especially amenable to large-scale modding.</p>
<p>“I’d say the thing that makes <em>Morrowind</em> most conducive to these kinds of projects is no voiced dialogue,” Mort said. “The reason that you see so many quest mods for <em>Morrowind</em>&nbsp;as opposed to <em>Oblivion</em> and <em>Skyrim</em> and even <em>Fallout</em> is that the barrier to make a quest is essentially nothing.”</p>
<p>Frequent, contained public releases also work to their advantage. “I know for a lot of projects, they want to [do a] ‘we’ll release it when it’s done’ kind of thing,” said Mort. “We’ve found that releasing content builds hype, it gives players what they want, and perhaps most importantly, it serves as a proof of life and a fantastic recruitment tool.”</p>

<p>Every time Tamriel Rebuilt pushes a release, he said, the team picks up at least a dozen devs almost immediately. So far, Tamriel Rebuilt has seen nine releases; the most recent is titled “Grasping Fortune.” The next release, “Poison Song,” is expected sometime in 2026 and will include a never-before-seen faction. The most optimistic estimate for when the project will be fully finished is 2035.</p>

<p>Project Tamriel has made most of its progress in Skyrim and Cyrodiil. The release of “Abecean Shores,” the coastal section of Cyrodiil, came in late 2024. Together, the projects have added hundreds of hours of hand-crafted quests, dungeons, and landscapes to a game that was already robust.</p>

<p>Lus said the current timeline for Project Tamriel is a new release for Skyrim and then Cyrodill, followed by either High Rock—a comparatively smaller, peninsula province west of Skyrim—or the desert province of Hammerfell.</p>
<p>For many developers, the point isn’t to see these massive projects in a finished state but to complete the next task and hopefully bring the team closer to the next release.</p>
<h2>A brief history of Tamriel Rebuilt</h2>
<p>Sultan of Rum, a kind of historian for Tamriel Rebuilt, joked that the project was aptly named because of how many times it has been rebuilt—partly because the tools the modders use to build the project have gotten better over time, rendering work done before those advances obsolete.</p>
<p>But even then, Tamriel Rebuilt was more of a Wild West in its infancy: a ragtag bunch of video game enthusiasts working mostly independently and without very much oversight. As the project has become more unified, it has meant a lot of turnover and a fair share of setbacks.</p>
<p>“If you took a satellite picture of the game world in 2005, you’d have essentially a complete province already,” Sultan of Rum said. “But the trouble was that the quality wasn’t good; there was no coherence. The 5 percent of the work to just create a landmass was done, but the management wasn’t there.”</p>
<p>Much of the project’s history has been lost to time as Internet forums disappeared, but Sultan of Rum has been able to piece together some of the growing pains Tamriel Rebuilt has endured. A struggle between the need to centralize and the desire of some modders to remain independent is a recurring theme.</p>
<p>One period is considered a dark age for Tamriel Rebuilt. In the first couple of years, a significant group of modders had been working on a piece of content for the project called “Silgrad Tower,” while the project simultaneously began consolidating to build continuity.</p>

  </div>


<p>There was debate among the modders about where Silgrid Tower should be located and which faction would have controlled it. This eventually led to an acrimonious split between the two groups. “The Silgrid Tower team was eventually put to the choice of either having to delete their work and restart it or, you know, leave the project. So they left the project,” said Sultan of Rum.</p>
<p>He said that much of the conflict has since been scrubbed from the forum archives, and the ordeal led to the deletion of the Tamriel Rebuilt forums, which were hosted by the Silgrid Tower team. This was probably the most drama the project has seen, he said.</p>
<p>There was also a period when the project moved to <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em>’s construction set. “Maybe even a majority of the project jumped onto the [Oblivion] engine to start building out Hammerfell,” said Sultan of Rum. “So for a long time—four years—the sort of focus point of Tamriel Rebuilt was on <em>Oblivion</em> and on the province of Hammerfell, not on the <em>Morrowind</em> part, which of course was the successful one.”</p>
<p>Another event is solemnly referred to as “The Great Self-Decapitation.” Sultan of Rum explained that around 2015, some of the older guard—developers and administrators alike—left the project all at once. The exodus was due to the second scrapping of a large city in development.</p>
<p>“People were hoping that by 2013 it would come out. Literally thousands of hours of human labor were spent creating it in the construction set,” recalled Sultan of Rum. “It just turned out that it was non-viable as a playable space. It wasn’t thought out well enough, it didn’t coalesce into a compelling, playable world. The modders were faced with the prospect of having to throw out just a huge chunk of work.”</p>
<p>That decision sapped a lot of energy from the project, and others on the team began to move away from it as their personal lives became busier. Sultan of Rum said all this has made the project better in the long run. Project leaders soon instituted better planning and management systems that centralized information and preserved institutional knowledge in case longtime developers decide to leave.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
            
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Over the years, they’ve also refined their training practices, which has ultimately led to more developers joining both projects.</p>
<p>“If your goal is to get development done, providing as much detail and tutorializing and onboarding processes, making that as simple as possible is going to get you your best results,” said Mort. “Because, again, if you aren’t gaining devs, you’re losing devs.”</p>
<p>The parameters for onboarding new developers are now clearly defined, with a low barrier to entry focused on competence with the tools. These tests are called <a href="https://www.tamriel-rebuilt.org/content/showcase-guidelines">showcases</a>.</p>
<p>Once the showcase is accepted, developers can begin working on both Tamriel Rebuilt and Project Tamriel, where much of the overlap between the two lies.</p>
<p>Mort added that the gap between a potential developer expressing interest and actively contributing can be as little as a week. This also allows movement between roles—for example, an interior designer training in exterior designing or someone starting in quest design moving elsewhere if it’s not a good fit.</p>
<p>Even more importantly, newer tech has improved the development process. The open source 3D modeling and animation tool Blender has become much friendlier to <em>Morrowind</em> modders, enabling teams to create custom assets more easily.</p>
<p>While this has required retouching some areas of Tamriel Rebuilt, it has also meant quicker turnaround times for custom assets. For Project Tamriel developers, the impact has been greater, as they can now reliably and routinely create assets to better represent Tamriel’s diverse cultures.</p>

<h2>The old informs the new</h2>
<p>The developers are well aware that both projects may still be unfinished 10 years from now, but most are just working toward the next release.</p>
<p>Discussing the project with just a few of the developers, it’s immediately clear how current work will inform future efforts.</p>
<p>For example, LogansGun is an exterior developer who did much of the work on the promotional videos for Tamriel Rebuilt’s last few releases. He joined the project because he wanted to leave his mark on this historical effort and ended up staying much longer than he thought he would.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
            
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>Between work and raising a family, LogansGun often found himself working on Tamriel Rebuilt instead of playing video games, partly because of a childhood love for <em>Morrowind</em> and a desire to make the game more than it was.</p>
<p>“I remember playing it a lot, and it really stuck with me,” LogansGun said. “And it might have been like 5th or 6th grade that I had a friend and we all sat in like a four-student pod, and he would bring the map inside the plastic Xbox disc case. When we had some free time in class, he’d lay it out, and we’d all be looking all over the map of Vvardenfell and all the things that we had explored or wanted to explore.”</p>

<p>Meadhainnigh, a college-aged chemical engineering student, first learned about Tamriel Rebuilt through the promotional video for Grasping Fortune, the project’s most recent update. The roughly three-minute video showcases some of the landscapes, cityscapes, and interiors, the culmination of thousands of hours of work. LogansGun is credited as the creator of that video, which has been used to inspire the next wave of contributors.</p>
<p>“I was thinking, well, this seems like a really cool project, and I just wanted to contribute and feel part of something bigger, and the rest is history, really,” said Meadhainnigh, who is now an asset dev for Project Tamriel. “But I joined the Discord server. I kind of learned the process of the project, and once I felt like I knew what I was going on, I tossed my hat in the ring.”</p>
<p>Meadhainnigh knew very little about development before he joined the project, and he said it’s the first online community he has been a part of. What keeps him going is that community—and to see his and others’ work become a part of a whole.</p>
<p>“We have some really wonderful people who are the old guard that feel like they are the comfortable welders, and they’re all very wise,” he said. “But even in the newest editions, we’re not here because we think that it’s all going to be done within our lifetimes. We like to joke about 2090 and about raising our children to work on the project. We just like to look at the next release, and that tends to be exciting enough to get us going.”</p>

		<p>Sony has announced the release date for the highly anticipated <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvels-wolverine/">Marvel’s Wolverine</a> game, which be created by Spider-Man developers, Insomniac.&nbsp; The game will launch on September 15th, 2026, exclusively on PS5 and was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/16/our-most-wanted-games-of-2026-1-marvels-wolverine/">number one in our “Most Wanted Games of 2026”.</a></p>
<p><iframe title="Marvel's Wolverine - Release Date Reveal" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BMU9iACrRO8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>“In this story, he is on the hunt to uncover the secrets of a dark past that keeps eluding him. Unfortunately, in this world, he’ll have to dig his claws deep to pull any shred of information that may lead to answers. Often, that means shredding into a relentless onslaught of enemies who aim to stop him by any means necessary,” say Insomniac.</p>
<p>Wolverine will, once again, be played by an Australian, this time, it is&nbsp; Liam McIntyre who is putting on the claws.</p>
<p>James “Logan” Howlett requires no introduction. With his trademark claws and superhuman healing factor, he’s the perfect protagonist for a combat-heavy action game, with a rogue’s gallery of villains to slice and dice his way through. For those who remember, 2009’s X-Men Origins video game tie-in was one of the best of its era, though the action genre has changed a lot, especially since the early 2010s.</p>

<p>Marvel’s Wolverine is being directed by Brian Horton (creative director) and Cameron Christian (game director), who were in charge of Spider-Man: Miles Morales and they have&nbsp;enlisted Walt D. Williams as story lead over at Insomniac Games. For those who don’t recognise the name, Williams worked as narrative director on 2012’s controversial <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/spec-ops-the-line/">Spec Ops: The Line</a>.</p>
<p>Why should gamers be excited for this news? Firstly, it underlines Insomniac’s intent to make Marvel’s Wolverine a game with a darker storyline, the developer having previously stated that it was aiming for a more mature tone compared to Marvel’s Spider-Man.</p>
<p>Aside from being a challenging third-person shooter with some interesting quirks, Spec Ops: The Line went rogue with its brutal, mind-being plot. Taking inspiration from Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness (which also heavily influenced Apocalypse Now) the campaign saw three elite operatives infiltrate a ravaged Dubai to thwart a rogue U.S colonel in the midst of a sandstorm. It’s been almost a decade since the game launched on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC, though we still remember the controversial white phosphorous scene as well as the four potential endings.</p>

<figure><a title="Caves of Qud Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162378/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>The legends of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/caves_of_qud">Caves of Qud</a> stretch back into the ancient times, through mists of lore, to a moment of destiny. That’s right – all the way back to 2007, when American team Freehold Games began development on this ambitious roguelike RPG. After a 17-year journey to version 1.0 in 2024, gathering a devoted PC following, this intimidating, systems-heavy cult classic has rolled a new character on Switch.</p>
<p>The game is set in the post-apocalyptic, science-fantasy land of Qud. It’s populated by factions with either allegiances or animosities, ridden with organisms that either tolerate or seek to devour you, and driven by either rich spirituality or advanced technology. The either/ors are key, because whenever you start a run in Qud, it recalculates the decisions that set the whole scenario going. Your quest, as a new adventurer, is simply to get out there and survive in an exceptionally vivid open world.</p>
<figure><a title="Caves of Qud Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162375/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Before setting out, you must choose between two genotypes: mutated humans and true kin. Mutants possess biological traits like a beak or slime glands, while true kin are humans enhanced by cybernetics like night vision or dermal insulation. Mutants are more fleshy and vulnerable at first, with a latent power ready to explode outwards as they level up; the true kin start tough and precise from the early game, but feel more and more dependent on technology as the levels climb. The two options are distinctive and fun.</p>
<p>At this point, though, we need a reality check. “Yes,” you say, “I’ve read that there are three-armed mutants and winged cyborgs and a stunning open world – but I’ve also seen the screenshots! Aren’t we getting a little carried away?”</p>
<p>It’s true that this harks back to an era of astonishingly over-imaginative cover art and flickery ASCII graphics, but the effort to see the wonder in Caves of Qud is only needed for a few minutes. Barely has its stingy tutorial dropped you in at the (very) deep end when the efficient visual style and humour-lined, Hugo-Award-winning scenario reach out and grip you. The pixelated rectangular tiles that sometimes look like they <em>could</em> be ASCII writhe into life as robots and mysterious creatures. The sweeping music and ambient soundscape rouse into epic scores with triumphant melodies and the bustle of thriving towns.</p>

<p>And once you’ve leapt into the world of Qud, what happens? Well, anything, really. You’re free to play as you like, just aiming to survive and become part of its procedurally generated history.</p>
<p>You <em>won’t</em> survive, though. My first achievement was collected by dying. It’s simply called “Welcome to Qud”. And this being a true roguelike, when you see “You died”, that’s your lot. No save points; no meta-progression: back to square one. It’s sad when your level-10 mutant croaks it after several hours’ play, but it’s also just part of their story. Qud is about making stories, and in that regard, it’s excellent.</p>
<p>However, there’s more to Caves of Qud than just regenerated lore and maps. A human spine of authored content runs through the cybernetic flavour text from the algorithms.</p>
<figure><a title="Caves of Qud Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162379/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Firstly, the basic topography of the world map is unchanging. This gives the sense of new progress made each time you restart – it’s the same world, so how long can <em>this</em> character live in it?</p>
<p>Secondly, there is a quest line that’s completely authored. This epic takes you through caves, markets, and townships, hunting artefacts and running rescue missions for droids.</p>
<p>Or does it? Given how much danger is out there in Qud, trying to follow a plot amidst it all is hard work. It’s one thing to lose a dozen hours’ playtime when it’s a throwaway run of survive-until-you-don’t. It’s another to say goodbye to this week’s questing, knowing you’ll need to replay from the start. There’s also a massive difficulty spike – an evil trap from the developers, you might even say – designed, surely, to kick your character’s bucket just as you feel you’ve surmounted the early game.</p>

<p>There’s a grossly unfair dungeon, and given the roguelike rules, you’d better be in the mood to laugh it off and go again. (If you’re like me, you’ll fall for it repeatedly, finally clear it, after <em>many</em> hours, only to discover your character’s tongue has rotted and they cannot talk.)</p>
<p>On the other hand, the ingenious and fan-favourite edge cases of the deep system interactions — melting through walls, falling in love with inanimate objects, <em>becoming</em> formerly inanimate objects — are unlikely to come about without being forced into the dire straits of desperately keeping a run going.</p>
<p>There are additional play modes to address this. Besides “Classic”, there’s “RPG”, which lets you save your game at settlements – not ideal as these are infrequent stops on your quest. Rounding it out is “Wander”, which means most creatures won’t attack you and you gain experience through discovery, not combat.</p>
<figure><a title="Caves of Qud Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162380/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>This is a real tension at the core of Caves of Qud: without the authored content, it would lose the wonder of uncovering a story, but without the roguelike rules, the elaborate mechanics don’t get a chance to play out. None of the available game modes really squares that circle.</p>
<p>However you look at it, though, Qud is massive. The map is expansive, the systems are ornate, and the lore is compelling even before all the generated embellishments. But the interface is <em>small</em>. Text can be enlarged only at the expense of the play area, which itself is most effective when zoomed in. I found a playable balance, but you’ll want to consider your setup: a bigger-screened handheld, a big TV, or a monitor-on-desk scenario would probably be best – the vestiges of Qud’s PC past are clear to see.</p>
<p>The control scheme, meanwhile, is clever – clicking or holding 'ZR' to pass turns becomes the main interaction and it’s satisfying. Given all the behind-the-scenes number-crunching that makes the systems run, load times can drag slightly, and occasionally this translates to sluggish movement as the game gets ready for your next turn, which is usually instantly available.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Caves of Qud has a devoted following for good reason. Its world is vivid despite its graphical style — the wonderful music helping out — and its rapid turn-based gameplay is addictive. The hardcore roguelike approach is brutal but makes each run special. This is at odds with the main thread of an RPG quest, which demands that every run is aimed at the same goal. However, that tension provides an energy that’s hard to resist. It’s compressed a little uneasily onto Switch, but can be made to work.</p>
<p>Maybe not legendary status on Switch, then, but a tale worth passing down to another generation of console players.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I need <em>Marathon</em> vs.<em> Arc Raiders</em> to be the <em>Battlefield</em> vs. <em>Call of Duty</em> of 2026. But which is which? There’s no standalone <em>Zombies Call of Duty</em> game, Activision claims. And another notable March release gets delayed to April. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture.</p> <p>I think it’s time for every gaming CEO to put their gamer cred on the line. The head of Nightdive Studios has played <a href="https://x.com/pripyatbeast/status/2025968715289027064">over 8,500 hours</a> of <em>Dota 2</em>. Anyone willing to come out and admit to beating that? I’ve only got about 2,000 hours in <em>Dota 2</em> and I regret every one of them. But would I do it all over again if given the chance? Also yes.</p>

 <h2><em>Arc Raiders</em> gets defensive about anti-cheat</h2> <p>Yesterday, Bungie’s imminent shooter&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-is-already-improving-on-arc-raiders-in-one-key-area-2000672901">outlined a zero-tolerance policy for cheating</a>, unlike <em>Arc Raiders</em>‘ escalating three-strike rule. In today’s patch notes for its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPaKRV76Tlc">Shrouded Sky update</a>, the current extraction shooter king tried to explain its recent struggles with exploits. “When we shared our last update about tackling unfair play, we didn’t fully convey the complexity and scale of what goes into cheat detection,” the <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/shrouded-sky-patch-notes-1-17-0">development team wrote</a>. “Our defenses operate on multiple levels: some checks are simple and definitive, while others are behavioral and data-driven and evolve over time.”</p> <p>The note went on to try to expand on that complexity and scale. <em>Arc Raiders</em> leverages “broad gameplay telemetry and machine learning techniques” to detect malicious behavior. But these systems are hard to develop and don’t offer “instant certainty” for quick bans the way “blunt software detections” do. Embark Studios says that this is why most of its bans operate on what I might call a cold, warm, hot scale.</p>

 <p>“Strong detections will receive permanent bans right off the bat, while others will receive a temporary suspension and a single chance to correct the behavior,” read the patch notes. But don’t worry! <em>Arc Raiders</em> is “tightening our rules and stepping up enforcement” so that “serious infractions now carry stricter consequences.”&nbsp;A dedicated anti-cheat team is working “tirelessly to keep the game fair.”</p>

 <p>Players will judge for themselves if one extraction shooter feels like it has fewer exploits and instant-kills. It’s nice to see some competition though. Like with <em>Battlefield 6</em> and<em> Black Ops 7</em>, a friendly rivalry forces everyone to up their game.</p> <h2>Activision shuts down standalone <em>Zombies</em> game rumors</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The rumor factory working overtime.

The official <em>Call of Duty</em> account responded by vaguely denying the claims. “The rumor factory working overtime,” it <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/2026038116364992596">wrote</a> (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/this-aint-it-activision-issues-rare-denial-of-standalone-call-of-duty-zombies-report"><em>IGN</em></a>). “This ain’t it.”</p>

 <h2>The studio that made <em>Prototype</em> is back</h2> <p>All some gamers want is a remake of the 2009 action-adventure sandbox <em>Prototype</em>. Well, the developer behind it, Radical Entertainment, has reformed as New Radical Games according to the <a href="https://www.newradical.ca/">studio’s updated website</a>. Microsoft currently owns the IP, so never say never, though I’m not sure going back to the well of a series that ushered in the studio’s closure is a smart move in the ultracompetitive landscape of 2026. Still, bringing back <em>Prototype 3</em>, canceled before Radical became a support studio for <em>Destiny</em>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/1rcru49/comment/o70k5fc/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">would be sick</a>.</p> <h2><em>Mouse: P.I. for Hire</em> slips to April</h2> <p>Originally set to release on March 19, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-recap-xbox-october-showcase-game-pass-fbc-1851675394/6">1930s-style animated noir shooter</a> will arrive on April 16 instead. “As we approach the final stages of development, we want to ensure we are taking the extra time and care needed to make <em>Mouse: P.I.

              <p>Another one of Sony’s 2026 PlayStation 5 exclusives has a release date. Insomniac Games revealed that <em>Marvel’s Wolverine</em> will arrive on September 15. That gives the console’s tentpole first-party release plenty of buffer room, with <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> coming two months later.</p> <p>“Let’s cut to the chase: <em>Marvel’s Wolverine</em> launches September 15, 2026,” the studio <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/insomniac.games/post/3mfmnbgtbbg2x">wrote on social media</a> on Tuesday. The unexpected timing of the release date announcement comes just a couple of weeks after the last PlayStation State of Play showcase in which Wolverine was notably absent.</p>

 <p>As Sony’s first-party pipeline has slowed during the PS5 generation, we’ve been getting about two big single-player PlayStation Studios exclusives a year. 2026 sees <em>Marathon</em> arrive in March followed by <em>Saros</em> in May. <em>Wolverine</em>‘s September release date puts it a month before Sony’s other fall console exclusive, <em>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</em>.</p> <p><em>Wolverine</em> getting a date this early suggests companies are taking Rockstar Games’ renewed commitment to launch<em> GTA 6</em> on November 19 seriously. With two of this fall’s biggest blockbusters now locked in on the calendar, other companies can start slotting in their release dates. Other big games like <em>The Blood of Dawnwalker</em>, <em>Control: Resonant</em>, and <em>Fable</em> are all still currently TBD.</p>

You'll need to have already signed up to the PlayStation beta program to take part (you can <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/beta-program-at-playstation/?" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jump in here</a>, if you haven't already), and seemingly be based within either North America or Europe. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">North American servers will be live from 4pm to 7pm Pacific, while European servers will be up from 7pm to 10pm CET (that's 6pm to 9pm for the UK).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Content available in the playtest includes the hunters Sun, Rem and Axle, as well as two different game modes: the wave-based survival offering Machine Incursion, or the multi-stage dungeon exploration found in Cauldron Descent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It is slightly odd that PlayStation is holding this test the same weekend it is already hosting its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> server slam, but perhaps it believes the pools of players for each will be limited enough — or distinct enough in terms of player taste — that it won't matter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony previously described plans for a "small-scale" closed playtest due at the end of February, alongside a few other details about the game. A tactical three-player co-op action title with a focus on adapting your Hunter for intense missions, the spin-off will also feature a narrative campaign that ties into the wider Horizon universe.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 100 Best PlayStation Games of All Time</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">According to game director Arjan Bak, Horizon Hunters Gathering has a story that "will introduce new mysteries, characters, and threats, but we’re keeping it under wraps for now. What we can say is that Hunters Gathering is fully canon and its story doesn’t stop at launch!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As of yet, there's no word on when that launch might be, or how the game will be monetized when it is ready for launch — whether it will be a premium launch or free-to-play.

            <title><![CDATA[Life Is Strange: Reunion Preview: Like Meeting Up With an Old Friend]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/life-is-strange-reunion-preview-like-meeting-up-with-an-old-friend</link>
            <guid>1445077</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been nearly ten years since we last saw Max and Chloe together in a Life is Strange game. While the other entries in the series that starred other characters have been pretty good – in fact, its most recent entry, Double Exposure, was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review"><u>excellent</u></a> thanks in part to its continuation of the core story of Max Caulfield’s complicated life with her even more complicated best friend Chloe – Life is Strange has nevertheless been missing that one thing that made the original episodic adventure so impactful. Now that the series’ co-protagonist (and sometimes antagonist if you really think about it) is back in the mix, Life is Strange: Reunion looks to not only be the game longtime fans have been waiting over a decade for, it also has the potential to be the strongest entry yet. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Taking place immediately after the events of Double Exposure, Life is Strange: Reunion looks to wrap up Max Caulfield’s time-bending, dimension-hopping adventure by reintroducing the catalyst for the entire series. Chloe is back, and without getting too deep into spoiler territory, she's alive and trying to put the pieces together while Max is simultaneously dealing with the fallout from Double Exposure. While Reunion retains its signature indie sleaze aesthetic and at times eyebrow-raising dialogue (in an endearing way), the storytelling thus far is noticeably better than what we’ve seen from Life is Strange previously. There was a sense of urgency in the roughly two hours I had with the preview version, and I couldn't help but notice how everything had a melancholic vibe to it. The music, character interactions, and general vibe of Reunion makes it obvious that this final chapter in Max’s story is going to be darker and more emotionally charged than anything we’ve seen in a series that explores some pretty grim subjects.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Life is Strange: Reunion Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That being said, it's not all doom and gloom. The visuals are refined such that, to my eyes, a Life is Strange game has never looked better. The facial expressions and performances are excellent, the locations are full of clever environmental storytelling and charm, and every character is designed in a way that's brimming with personality and uniqueness. In my demo I was able to explore Max’s house, the Snapping Turtle, and a new location that reminded me of some of the more grim environments from the original Life is Strange. Conversations with characters felt more real, and while some of the dialogue was cringeworthy, it never took me out of the story like past entries have, and I'm happy to report that in my time with it, nobody said “hella”.</p><p>The world of Reunion feels more alive than ever.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, from some exceptional cues and nostalgic needle drops, the music, which is always a highpoint for the series, is definitely looking to be another highlight in Reunion. There was one needle drop in particular that tugged at my heart strings, and whether this was due to nostalgia or really good song placement (or both), it made me excited to hear what else Reunion has in store for Max and Chloe's latest adventure. The music, visuals, and environmental storytelling suggest that this is Life is Strange firing on all cylinders so far, and the world of Reunion feels more alive than ever.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, presentation isn't everything in Life is Strange, and Reunion takes the series back to its roots with Max’s rewind abilities and Chloe's backtalk choices. While I appreciated the newer dimension-hopping powers in Double Exposure, it was obvious from the get-go with Reunion that bringing back Max’s rewind power is the correct choice; it just felt right for the type of narrative-driven gameplay Life is Strange is known for. The few puzzles I was able to try felt natural and had more challenge than I was expecting. In one instance I had to defuse a room full of explosives before a short timer ran out. Admittedly, I died a few times while trying to find an optimal route between bombs, finding a pair of cutters, and avoiding falling objects. It was refreshing to have to solve a puzzle without it just being another standard <em>find the thing and pick the correct dialogue </em>event. That being said, there were still plenty of instances where I needed to talk to somebody, spectacularly embarrass myself, learn something about them, rewind, and try again. </p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Chloe’s gameplay, on the other hand, is less supernatural and more urgent. Unlike Max, she doesn't have any special powers and instead has to rely on her wits and quick thinking. Paying attention to the surrounding environment and remembering details from Chloe’s observations and conversations is integral here. When Chloe’s backtalk was prompted, I had to quickly make a dialogue choice and earn points over whoever I was being confronted by. If I made the correct choice when confronted by a security guard then I would win the conversation, if I didn't, then things wouldn't go my way. Adding this additional layer to Reunion’s dialogue choices is a breath of fresh air, since playing as Max can sometimes be a little too forgiving. I hope that we see this mechanic used more throughout Reunion, because its potential to force the player to make difficult permanent decisions without the option to magically rewind time could lead to some pretty interesting character outcomes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The series’ dialogue is still a high point here, and I was given the choice to play with a specific set of outcomes from the first Life is Strange. While there is no canon ending to the first game, being able to pick my outcome from 2015 was pretty cool and has me excited to see what other outcomes and consequences the characters will face from that single choice I made a decade ago. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While I only had about two hours with Life is Strange: Reunion, it was clear to me that developer Deck Nine is pulling out all the stops for the long-awaited finale of Max and Chloe’s story. The expanded gameplay, presentation, and overall vibe stands a good chance to become a series high point and hopefully lead to a fitting end to a story that's sat with fans for over a decade.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/life-is-strange-reunion-preview-like-meeting-up-with-an-old-friend]]></content:encoded>
