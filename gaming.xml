            <p>
Royal Mail has revealed a set of stamps featuring familiar faces from the Dungeons &amp; Dragons universe, including Baldur's Gate 3 favourites such as the Mindflayer and Owlbear, which have apparently been personally approved by the King. 
</p>
<p>
Other designs include the Gelatinous Cube, Mimic, Displacer Beast and Vecna, alongside a party of player characters including a tiefling rogue, human bard, halfling cleric, elf fighter, dwarf paladin and dragonborn wizard. 
</p>
<p>
A "presentation pack" with the full set of stamp designs costs £24.40, and ships on 25th July. If you're feeling flush, <a href="https://shop.royalmail.com/special-stamp-issues/dungeons-and-dragons">Royal Mail has a whole shop full of other D&amp;D stamp paraphenalia</a> you can purchase, including three enlarged prints for £150 each.

"Building on Hasbro's existing work with Royal Mail, we're honoured to release this beautiful collection of stamps, officially approved by HM King Charles III, in celebration of the 50th anniversary of the World's Greatest Roleplaying Game," Wizards of the Coast global play lead Dan Rawson said. 
</p>
<p>
"With stunning art from long-time Dungeons &amp; Dragons artist Wayne Reynolds showcasing our adventuring heroes and fearsome creatures, we're sure these items will be treasured by D&amp;D fans and stamp collectors alike."
</p>
<p>
The project is timed to release alongside D&amp;D's 50th anniversary, and comes just as Baldur's Gate 3 begins to wrap up its updates - with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mod-support-in-baldurs-gate-3-will-be-final-handover-moment-to-players-says-larian-ceo">forthcoming patch set to add console modding that will act as a handover point to fans</a> from developer Larian.

            <p>
Nintendo fans keen to find out more details on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-just-uploaded-a-bizarre-horror-game-teaser">yesterday's unexplained horror game teaser Emio</a> believe The Medium and Layers of Fear developer Bloober is behind the project. 
</p>
<p>
There are clues that Bloober is involved in a recently-published interview with company boss Piotr Babieno, fans say.  In it, Babieno discusses a mysterious title "for Nintendo platforms" codenamed "Project M".
</p>
<p>
"Project M, although its budget is significantly smaller than the games we are working on at Bloober Team, is extremely important due to our long-term plans," Babieno told Polish site <a href="https://strefainwestorow.pl/wiadomosci/20240708/bloober-team-nie-widzi-zwiazku-miedzy-koncem-wspolpracy-z-draw-distance-a">Strefa Inwestorow</a>.

</p>
<figcaption>Who is Emio?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbhwwG-QvGQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
"In addition, we are working on it in cooperation with the world's best game creators for Nintendo platforms, so we cannot afford to create just a decent game."
</p>
<p>
Is Project M the mysterious Emio? A developer such as Bloober being on board would seem more likely than this being an internal Nintendo project. And what about that reference to Nintendo platforms, plural? Is this a cross-gen project for Switch and Switch 2? Babieno goes on to note that the project will be fully unveiled later this year.
</p>
<p>
For now, fans have been left to wait for more clues. Eurogamer asked Nintendo for more details on the project yesterday, but is yet to hear back.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/prime-day-gaming-will-gift-suicide-squad-chivalry-2-and-rise-of-the-tomb-raider/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Amazon announced that PC gamers will be able to grab three high-profile games on Prime Day: Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, Chivalry 2, and Rise of the Tomb Raider: 20 Year Celebration. These titles will be available for a limited time only: beginning on July 16 at 12 AM PT / 3 AM ET, Prime users will have 48 hours to claim them. All of them will provide access to the games via the Epic Games Store.</p>
<p>Rocksteady's Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is, of course, by far the most recent game of the trio. Released in February after an extremely long development cycle, the game largely failed to capture interest. Parent company Warner Bros. famously <a href="https://wccftech.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-contributed-to-200-million-lower-ebitda-for-wb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">admitted</a> it contributed to a much lower ($200 million) EBITDA compared to last year, which saw the incredibly successful launch of Hogwarts Legacy, the best-selling game of 2023. That said, the developers are still improving the game and adding new content. Season 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-season-2-is-out-next-week-will-add-mrs-freeze-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was supposed to launch today</a>, but it has since been delayed to July 25. It will add Mrs. Freeze as a playable character, new maps, boss fights, and gear.</p>
<p>Then there's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/chivalry-2-nearly-all-is-fair-in-love-and-war/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chivalry 2</a>, launched by Torn Banner Studios over three years ago. The Canadian studio is still supporting the game, as shown by May's free Regicide update that added an epic new map culminating in a clash of kings, a versatile new polearm, a new campaign pass, new cosmetic customization options, as well as bug fixes and performance improvements.</p>
<p>Lastly, 2016's <a href="http://wccftech.com/review/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-20-year-celebration-review-raiding-the-croft-manor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rise of the Tomb Raider: 20 Year Celebration</a> can be grabbed as well. It's the second installment in the latest Tomb Raider trilogy, and it even features a coop Endurance mode.</p>
<p>These are actually bonus Prime Day games, by the way. The main list is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deceive Inc.</li>
<li>Tearstone: Thieves of the Heart</li>
<li>The Invisible Hand</li>
<li>Forager</li>
<li>Card Shark</li>
<li>Heaven Dust 2</li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/soulstice-chimera-may-cry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Soulstice</a></li>
<li>Wall World</li>
<li>Hitman Absolution</li>
<li>Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood</li>
<li>Call of Juarez</li>
<li>STAR WARS: Knights of the Old Republic II — The Sith Lords</li>
<li>Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX</li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tmnt-shredders-revenge-the-reason-online-netcode-is-important/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge</a></li>
<li>Samurai Bringer</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a href="https://gaming.amazon.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claim</a> all of these today.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-london-downgrade-fallout-4/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-london-will-downgrade-your-version-of-fallout-4-before-it-runs.924495/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-london-downgrade-fallout-4/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Fallout: London is due to be released any day now, with GOG – the platform that’s going to host the super-sized mod – running through QA checks as we speak. Months ago, when Bethesda Game Studios revealed the release date for the Fallout 4 next-gen update, the team working on Fallout: London announced an indefinite postponement of the highly anticipated mod, citing the unpredictability of the upgrade and the inevitable failure of mods as the reason for the delay.</p>



<p>Now, a monumental effort has made Fallout: London ready for release, but there’s a huge catch – to play it, you’ll need to downgrade your version of Fallout 4.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-bye-bye-upgrade">Bye, Bye Upgrade</h2>



<p>Fallout 4’s next-gen update wasn’t everything that fans were hoping for. It’s fair to say it was a sizeable disappointment, and it didn’t change the face of the almost ten-year-old game like many expected it would. It threw mods into disarray, with creators scrambling to update their files to align with the upgraded version of Fallout 4 – and it also caused Fallout: London to be postponed by several weeks.</p>



<p>It has been explained by the Fallout: London team that when you install the mod, you’ll also be installing a ‘downgrader’, which will take your version of Fallout 4 and roll it back to a stable version <strong>before </strong>the next-gen update dropped. That means that you’ll lose some of the key benefits offered by the upgrade in exchange for being able to play Fallout: London. </p>



<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/07/fallout-london-devs-will-downgrade-fallout-4-to-save-their-massive-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Per the team</a>, this is necessary because the upgraded version of Fallout 4 simply ‘isn’t stable’, and if the team has to wait around for it to be ‘fixed’ by Bethesda Game Studios, Fallout: London might never be released. </p>



<p>It’s an awkward blow, but it does mean that Fallout: London can ship as intended through GOG, rather than being cancelled entirely and having years of development efforts written off.</p>

            <p>An Unreal Engine developer has got classic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom">Doom</a> running in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, in a manner of speaking broad enough to justify a series of headlines about it, including my own. Jackson Clayton honoured the proud tradition of getting the 1993 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> to run on things where no Doom should be by porting classic opening stage E1M1, via level editor <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Ultimate_Doom_Builder">Ultimate Doom Builder</a>, into Fortnite’s Unreal editor as a 3D model. Welcome, newcomer Fortnite, to the vaunted halls currently occupied by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-can-play-doom-using-gut-bacteria-but-the-framerate-is-atrocious">gut bacteria</a>,<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/theres-a-new-weirdest-way-to-play-doom-using-rat-neurons-grown-in-a-jar"> jar-grown rat neurons</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-weird-device-to-run-doom-your-lawnmower">lawnmowers</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/now-you-can-play-doom-over-teletext">teletext</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/before-you-brush-your-teeth-tonight-remember-to-install-doom-on-your-electric-toothbrush">electric toothbrushes</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/doom-is-out-now-for-windows-notepad-sort-of">Windows notepad (sort of)</a>, and<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yup-a-pregnancy-test-is-the-weirdest-device-ive-seen-running-doom"> a pregnancy test</a>.</p>

</p></div>

<p>The practical upshot of this is that Clayton is able to use Fornite’s building system in the level. Speaking to <a href="https://kotaku.com/doom-running-inside-fortnite-uefn-how-epic-twitter-fps-1851585177">Kotaku</a>, Clayton says that after porting the level over “it was mostly removing Unreal’s fancy effects to make everything unlit and unfiltered. I used Unreal’s material system to give the Doom Marine [sprite its] choppy spinning effect, and a PostProcess material to pixellate the screen and show the gun.”</p>
<p>The Unreal Editor For Fortnite (UEFF) is ““too high-level” for a one-to-one code translation, says Clayton, so he had to “get creative” to spin up a convincing facade of the FPS grandpappy inside the plucky Battle Royale also-ran. Clayton is also an indie dev, having released games like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2293880/CASTILLO_The_Nine_Circles/">Castillo: The Nine Circles on Steam</a>. Castillo is “Doom-inspired”, says Clayton, so the experience he'd built up helped with this worthy endevaour.</p>
<p>The main motivation behind all this? Clayton simply enjoys a little trolling. “I wanted to put together a video to trick my friends, so I ported the map and created the post-process materials, and they really liked it.”</p>
<p>Wait, wait, I missed one! Doom has also run on a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/doom-can-now-run-on-a-jailbroken-tractor">jailbroken tractor</a>! There’s plenty more on <a href="https://itrunsdoom.tumblr.com/">this Tumblr page</a> if you fancy a bit of rabbit holing. My personal wishlist for the future of bizarre Doom ports include a digital casio watch, a vape, and also a furby somehow, hellish creatures that they are. Although my actual wishlist is just to get <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> running on my normal PC as soon as humanly possible.</p>

The All-Star Edition is priced at $99.99 on all platforms and it includes 100,000 VC and MyTEAM content such as 10 MyTEAM Player Cards (3 guaranteed to be 89 OVR), 3 Diamond Shoe Cards, 3 Takeover Boosts, and 1 Amethyst Coach Card; as well as MyCAREER content, including 150x Skill Boosts (25 Games), 75x Gatorade Boosts (25 Games), Jayson Tatum Cover Jersey, Jayson Tatum Electric Skateboard Skin, and a 2K25 Cover Stars Design T-Shirt.</p>
<p>Finally, the limited availability Hall of Fame Edition is priced at $149.99 on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, which comes with everything mentioned above from the All-Star Edition plus a MyCAREER Vince Carter Cover Jersey, a Season 1 Pro Pass with 4 upfront Pro Pass rewards and a 12-Month NBA League Pass Subscription (which, mind you, won't work in Japan, China, Belarus, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Ivory Coast, Libya, Kosovo, North Korea, Russia, Rwanda, South Sudan, Sudan, Swaziland, or Syria).</p>
<p>The developers at Visual Concepts have promised new MyTEAM modes and, for those on 'Next-Gen' platforms, an added sixth era in MyNBA, a more compact and interactive City, along with the chance to cement their G.O.A.T. status in The W.</p>
<p>However, arguably the biggest change for PC players is that they'll finally be able to enjoy the 'Next-Gen' version with NBA 2K25, which comes with enhanced authenticity and realism powered by ProPLAY technology. The Steam page already lists the full system specs - an SSD will be required.</p>

<p>Shift Up, the developer behind this year’s PS5 exclusive, Stellar Blade, has skyrocketed in South Korea following a monumental IPO that netted $320 million (435 billion won). Per the reports, it’s the single biggest IPO in South Korea by a gaming firm since 2021, when Krafton Inc. secured the record by netting a whopping $3.8 billion.</p>



<p>It’s the second-largest IPO in South Korea in 2024, only being edged out by a Hyundai subsidiary.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-money-bigger-plans">Big Money, Bigger Plans</h2>



<p>In a report <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/game-maker-shift-debuts-south-220000910.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by Bloomberg</a>, it was noted that Shift Up plans to use the funds secured by the IPO (initial public offering)  to ‘diversify its game portfolios’. Until now, the Seoul-based firm has developed and released two key titles: Stellar Blade (2024) and Nikke (2022).</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Stellar Blade was released on the PlayStation 5, scoring strong results despite an air of controversy surrounding the title. On social media, most of the discourse surrounding Stellar Blade was focused on the comely main character, Eve, and the slew of revealing outfits she could wear in the post-apocalyptic title.</p>



<p>Analysts have written that Shift Up’s stock value could rise now that the IPO has been such a success. The company has a ‘high success ratio’ and plenty of opportunities for diversification going forward. One analyst wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The investment case rests on a stellar game development track record, several growth drivers, high profitability, and cash generation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Stellar Blade has mostly come and gone by now, but fans are still clamouring for an expansion or a PC port. It was revealed a while ago that Shift Up is already looking at a potential follow-up title, but that’s a story for another day.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/11/blacksad-under-the-skin-review-2/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>I love a good private detective story. While they vary in quality, you can at least expect twists and turns, with a typically gruff investigator at the centre doling out noir-styled musings. Blacksad: Under The Skin was first released in 2019, but has just released on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, allowing players to revisit a case of murder, corruption, and extortion with some current gen graphical updates.</p>
<p><iframe title="Blacksad: Under the Skin - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_wEKUPYvsKM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Blacksad: Under The Skin is an interactive adventure title, with the gameplay primarily based on talking to characters, gathering clues from scenes, and then deducing what you have collected to come up with theories to work out the case. The case itself all starts with the apparent suicide of boxing gym owner Joe Dunn, who is found hanging above his boxing ring by the cleaning lady. Meanwhile, our near broke private eye John Blacksad is just finishing a case about a cheating husband, who is none too pleased with his life being investigated.</p>


<p>The opening of the game will introduce you to the basics of character interaction and quick time events (QTEs). The latter is primarily used for the times Blacksad gets into fights, though there are a couple of other situations they pop up in. They are mostly fine, but there were moments where the timing seemed to be off with a slight delay between input and action, which could cause fails to execute a move.</p>
<p>For the majority of the game, you will be walking around different locations as Blacksad, after he gets hired by Dunn’s daughter to get to the bottom of her father’s death and the disappearance of the gym’s star boxer. Unsurprisingly, the first port of call is the gym, followed by locations such as a diner, apartments, and offices. In all of these areas, points of interest will pop up for Blacksad to interact with, amongst the huge number of sports collector cards that almost litter every scene.</p>


<p>Points of interest will include everything from quotes painted on a wall, to the large cast of characters that cross your path. There is frustration when it comes to movement and interacting with the environment, since Blacksad walks quite slowly. A jog/sprint button would have been a welcome addition. Points of interest require Blacksad to stand in specific positions, and navigating him to some of those points is cumbersome.</p>
<p>The visuals, including the character designs and models are for the most part very good, though outside of Blacksad, many of the personalities seem to lack real substance, playing more into caricatures. Some are a bit on the nose, yet they all fit into this 1950s anthropomorphic criminal world. The voice acting can vary, with some lines delivered in ways that jar within the context of a scene. In addition, there were times where the mouth movement was slightly out of sync with the audio. Overall though, the voice acting is decently delivered.</p>
<p>The environments meanwhile offer plenty of detail all the way from the minor scuffs on the wall, to reflective surfaces and some truly excellent lighting. There are however noticeable issues that haven’t been ironed out by this refresh, like blurred lettering on some signs, and clothing bunching and failing to react as it should.</p>

<p>Blacksad is fundamentally predicatable, but you’ll enjoy the journey nonetheless. What is not always fun is the deduction. Blacksad gathers clues to piece theories together, theories you likely would have pieced together a while before. In the deduction screen you have to match Blacksad’s thoughts to come up with deductions. What should be obvious connections don’t always work, so at times you’re following some almost unrelated though processes to get a deduction. Outside of deductions, if you make the wrong choices or miss a QTE Blacksad can be killed, but this has very little bearing since the scene loads straight back into the choice or action again, allowing you to undo that mistake.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-fans-play-van-buren/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-fans-can-now-play-the-cancelled-%E2%80%98van-buren%E2%80%99-game.924459/</guid>

<p>If you’ve ever wondered about the ‘original’ Fallout 3 title that was cancelled in 2003 – Van Buren – you’re not alone. This mystical title was supposed to be a follow-up to 1998’s Fallout 2, developed by Black Isle and acting as a sizeable expansion to the already substantial post-apocalyptic universe created by Interplay. </p>



<p>Well, wonder no more. Recently, a new super-sized mod for Fallout 2 was released by a team called PJ Hexer and Co, and it’s dubbed ‘Fallout Yesterday – Van Buren’. Through this mod, you can explore a fan-made recreation of Van Buren inside Fallout 2’s engine, with the game-sized mod having been painstakingly built based on everything we know about the cancelled Fallout game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-go-back-in-time">Go Back in Time</h2>



<p>Van Buren is one of the most talked about topics amongst veterans of the Fallout franchise. Fans coming into the series for the first time following the launch of the Fallout television series will never have heard of it, but it’s an important topic in the overall history of Fallout. In 2003, Van Buren – which was the codename for Fallout 3 – was cancelled, and it wouldn’t be until 2008 that the Fallout 3 we know and love was released by Bethesda Game Studios.</p>



<p>In the new mod that was released just days ago, and updated even more recently, players can explore what Van Buren might have been. Per the description on the mod, it features:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Multiple races, hundreds of new Traits and Perks, items, weapons, gameplay additions, dozens of new locations, 7 different vehicles, and new companions.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout2/mods/91?tab=files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a hefty mod that’s around 5GB in size</a> with all the files being downloaded, but it’s well worth utilising Nexus Mods to get your hands on the best and most faithful recreation of Van Buren I’ve ever seen. Unfortunately, the original game will never see the light of day, but mods like this are keeping the lights on for Fallout historians worldwide, and that’s a beautiful thing.</p>

            <p>
By now, you've probably heard of massive Fallout 4 mod <a href="https://fallout4london.com/">Fallout: London</a>, given the struggles it's faced in the run-up to release. There's one last hurdle for players to overcome, however, with developer Team Folon having now confirmed it'll be necessary to downgrade Fallout 4's next-gen version to play it - a process thankfully being handled by its accompanying installer.
</p>
<p>
Fallout 4's long-promised next-gen update <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-free-next-gen-update-finally-arrives-this-month">finally launched in April</a>, but its arrival caused some major headaches for the Fallout: London team. The mod was originally due to launch on 23rd April, but it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4s-next-gen-update-delays-the-release-of-dlc-sized-fan-mod-fallout-london">delayed</a> after Bethesda announced Fallout 4's next-gen update would arrive two days later - Team Folon admitting it was concerned about potential "complications". And with good reason, it turns out; Team Folon has now confirmed a downgrade from the next-gen version of Fallout 4 will be absolutely necessary to run Fallout: London.
</p>
<p>A downgrader was briefly mentioned in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-says-the-end-is-in-sight-as-testing-gets-underway">statement the developer shared over the weekend</a>, but its inclusion wasn't really detailed at the time. However, in a follow-up message on <a href="https://discord.com/channels/471697060589207572/1234891241184038973/1259924540088123393">Fallout: London's Discord</a> (via <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/07/fallout-london-devs-will-downgrade-fallout-4-to-save-their-massive-mod/">Ars Technica</a>), project lead Dean Carter explained, "At the 11th hour we've discovered that the next-gen [version of Fallout 4], even after updates, isn't stable enough and thus we are now going out on the old version - thus the need for a downgrader."

<p>
Carter added that Bethesda's continuing updates to Fallout 4's next-gen release hasn't helped the London mod's progress at all. "It's been an utter frustration and every setback requires the testing process to restart," he explained. "Which is why we've decided to go with the downgrader route and when the 'next-gen' is sorted, update it for that."
</p>
<p>
Fallout: London will release via GOG (its massive size meant it was too large to host on Nexus Mods), and it's currently going through the company's quality-assurance checks ahead of its arrival. There's no release date for the mod just yet, but a post over the weekend claimed "the end is in sight", with the team seemingly just waiting for GOG to finish its work at this point. "Once they've completed the process of double-checking that Fallout: London and its installer work on all supported machines," it wrote, "we should be good to go."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-is-teasing-an-unsettling-new-horror-game-with-a-creepy-smiling-man<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Nintendo really woke up this morning and chose chaos by dropping a deeply upsetting short teaser for what seems to be a new horror game. We're not sure of the title just yet, but it might be called Emio, or possibly Smiling Man.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>What the heck was that? Nintendo fans are baffled. There are almost no details as to what this "Emio" thing is. Apart from the trailer, the only other info we have is that Nintendo tweeted about it across its U.S., Europe, and Japanese accounts this morning with the hashtag #WhoIsEmio?. There's an <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/switch/emio/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official Nintendo website</a>, too, which just features the creepy dude standing there and occasionally, briefly, changing his expression. And we've confirmed that the kanji in the background of all these teases reads "laughing man" or "smiling man."</p><p>So why is everyone so worked up about this? It's not necessarily that there's anything abnormal about teasing a work of horror like this. Plenty of films and games have played up horror elements by being deliberately vague and sudden in their reveals. But Nintendo is, uh, not exactly known for that kind of thing! It's just out of character for them to surprise drop a trailer for what seems to be an M-rated horror game on a random Wednesday morning with no other context.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>We don't even know who's making Emio. People are speculating that based on the fact that it has an official Nintendo website, this may be a first-party game, which would be even more out of character for Nintendo. That said, a number of individuals have pointed out on social media that noted horror developer Bloober Team <a href="https://strefainwestorow.pl/wiadomosci/20240708/bloober-team-nie-widzi-zwiazku-miedzy-koncem-wspolpracy-z-draw-distance-a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced just two days ago</a> it was working on something called "Project M," which is apparently coming to Nintendo platforms and is expected to be announced this year. Could this be Project M? Or something else entirely?</p><p>Whatever the case, we'll have to wait to find out, but the prospect of a new horror game made by Nintendo, of all companies, is an exciting one to imagine. Until then, we'll have to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/luigis-mansion-2-hd-review">make do with Luigi's Mansion 2 HD</a>.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

<p>Apple recently announced new games coming to Apple Arcade, its gaming subscription service for iPhones, iPads, Macs, Apple TVs, and Vision Pro headsets. The headlining title is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/10/vampire-survivors-a-cheap-minimalistic-indie-game-is-my-game-of-the-year/"><em>Vampire Survivors</em></a>, an indie hit that combined the gameplay of bullet hell shooters and the addictive quality of clickers to become a mega sensation two years ago. Also coming is <em>Temple Run: Legends</em>, an updated take on the popular game from 2011.</p>
<p><em>Vampire Survivors</em> was already available on the App Store, but it was ad-supported, with the option to spend money in-app to get additional content. The Apple Arcade version, dubbed <em>Vampire Survivors+</em>, is more akin to the PC or Xbox versions that don't have ads. Both paid expansions will be included at no additional charge.
</p><p>Meanwhile, <em>Temple Run: Legends</em> is a completely new game (not just a remake of the original <em>Temple Run</em>) that bucks the "endless runner" genre label by breaking its gameplay into individual levels—though there will be some kind of optional endless mode, too.</p>
<p>If you haven't played <em>Vampire Survivors</em> before, it's worth a try. Both titles will launch on August 1.</p>
<h2>Arcade could use some fresher and riskier picks</h2>
<p>These new additions are the most recent in a long line of Apple Arcade titles curated with a risk-averse, only-if-it-is-proven mentality that more or less ensures the subscription service won't get the sorts of surprise breakout hits that draw people to it.</p>
<p>When Apple Arcade launched, its initial lineup was a fascinating mix of casual and indie titles, some of which went on to be popular on other platforms once Arcade's exclusivity ended. However, there were reports early on that Arcade wasn't gaining the traction Apple hoped for, so the company quickly switched gears. It turned to continued, ongoing engagement as the primary metric by which to judge success, which led to a preference for games-as-a-service as opposed to standalone or narrative experiences. And it began primarily releasing games based on established intellectual properties like Hello Kitty or Star Wars, as well as re-releases of games that had already proven their success elsewhere in the App Store.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>Many of those re-releases were more than a decade old, hearkening back to the early days of the App Store when premium titles reigned and free-to-play, games-as-a-service hadn't taken the wheel.</p>
<p>This week, Apple released a new game-as-a-service in a mobile IP from 2011 and a viral indie hit many months after its virality died down. I'm not saying no one is interested in or playing <em>Vampire Survivors</em> now, but imagine how much more it would have driven iPhone owners to Arcade if it had been there when it was first making headlines.</p>
<p>It took only a short time for Apple to shift gears away from its initial strategy of approaching creative new developers that were presenting interesting work at events like IndieCade to leaning only on games that had proven they could be successful, IPs that had proven popular already, or experienced developers who had already made waves on the App Store. Perhaps Apple didn't give that strategy enough of a chance.</p>
<p>What we have now is a safe subscription service that essentially curates the best of what other people have already discovered and (thankfully) strips out ads and microtransactions. That's a nice enough value proposition, especially for the price. But we're unlikely to see breakout hits on Arcade making waves among players, influencers, or the press because, for the most part, Apple is following the headlines with this service, not leading them.</p>
<p>That limits Arcade's place in the landscape a bit, and limits its potential for growth. That doesn't mean it's not a good value for the right kind of player, but it means that those looking to play the next best thing are likely to be looking elsewhere, and by the time something makes it to Arcade, they've moved on to the next trend. Your mileage may vary whether that works for you, but with more competition from other mobile games subscription services, Apple might need to accommodate more kinds of players. A greater balance between proven hits and more experimental or ambitious titles day-and-date with other platforms could help capture both buckets.</p>

            <p>
Riot Games was reportedly developing a Smash Bros. style fighter set in the League of Legends universe, but pulled the plug on the project earlier this year after perceiving Warner Bros' Smash-inspired MultiVersus to have been a commercial failure.
</p>
<p>
That's according to former Washington Post video games and esports editor Mikhail Klimentov, who - writing in his <a href="https://www.readergrev.com/p/riot-games-pool-party-canceled-smash-melee">ReaderGrev newsletter</a> - claims 70-80 Riot employees were working on the Smash-style platform fighter, codenamed Pool Party.
</p>

Citing current and former Riot employees familiar with the  project, Klimentov says Pool Party was initially envisaged as a hardcore fighting game but grew to incorporate party game elements and casual-friendly mechanics as development continued.

Riot executives reportedly saw an opportunity to build and support the game's esports scene, but started getting cold feet after the release of Warner Bros' Smash-style free-to-play fighter MultiVersus. That game's launch is said to have been perceived as a failure by Riot decision makers, prompting the studio to reassess the consumer appetite for a Smash competitor. As a result, it cancelled the development of Pool Party in May this year.
</p>
<p>
Klimentov says approximately half the 70-80 Riot employees working on the project have received offers to be assigned elsewhere in the company, while others are seeking new positions through the company's internal job board.
</p>
<p>
In a statement provided to Klimentov as part of his report, senior comms director Joe Hixson said, "We always have a number of projects in various phases of R&amp;D, and spinning projects up and down happens multiple times a year".
</p>
<p>
Pool Party is not to be confused with Riot's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/league-of-legends-free-to-play-fighter-officially-named-2xko">other League of Legends' fighter</a>, 2XKO. Announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/project-l-will-be-free-to-play-new-champion-detailed">back in August 2022</a> under the name Project L, 2XKO will launch as free-to-play title for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S sometime next year.

But for the PlayStation 5 (and PC) owners who still want a customizable, competitive-focused controller, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wolverine-Wireless-Gaming-Controller-PlayStation-Console/dp/B0BQ1PDR4R?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon has a wildly good early Prime Day deal on the Razer Wolverine V2 Pro</a>, one of the few officially licensed PS5 controllers. Normally $250, you can get the Wolverine V2 Pro for only $165 ahead of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">Prime Day</a>. This is by far the lowest price yet--in fact, we wouldn't be surprised if this is a pricing error that disappears soon.</p><p>Only the black model is eligible for this price, as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wolverine-Wireless-Gaming-Controller-PlayStation-Console/dp/B0BWSLLWF2?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the white version is discounted to $200</a>--which had been the lowest price yet for the Wolverine V2 Pro until today. We started writing this story with the $200 price in mind for both colors, but then the $165 price showed up. Admittedly, the $250 list price is on the high end, but regardless, deals on this controller aren't very common.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4217398-razer-v2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4217398" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4217398-razer-v2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4217398"></a><figcaption>Razer Wolverine V2 Pro</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4217398-razer-v2.jpg"></figure><p>The Wolverine V2 Pro features Razer's mecha-tactile face and shoulder buttons that have shorter actuation distance, an eight-way microswitch D-pad for more accurate gaming, and trigger locks.</p><p>There are also six remappable buttons, interchangeable thumbsticks, and Razer's trademark flair via chroma RGB lighting that snakes its way across the device. With the Razer controller app, which is available on mobile and PC, you can remap inputs and set up custom profiles.</p><p>It's worth noting you don't get the adaptive triggers, haptic feedback, or a built-in speaker--so these omissions should be weighed before going the third-party route.</p><p>Overall, this is a solid controller to consider for competitive gaming in fighting game and first-person shooter genres. Plus, it has offset analog sticks, so if you favor the Xbox controller layout, that's a big plus.</p><p>The Wolverine V2 Pro isn't the only third-party, pro-style controller for PS5.

You can reconfigure the sticks to either be parallel or offset. The Pro BFG comes with a six-button fighting game module, too.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-bloomburrow-value-boosters-introduced-providing-alternative-cheaper<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has revealed a new type of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> booster. As part of their latest set, the tabletop company has introduced <em>Bloomburrow</em> value boosters. These are designed to be cheaper alternatives to collecting <em>Magic</em> cards, and it is a decision that has lead to some friction.</p>
<h2>The <em>Bloomburrow</em> Value Boosters Announcement</h2>
<p>In an official blog post, Wizards of the Coast explains the creation of <em>Bloomburrow</em> Value Boosters. According to the post, value boosters are smaller, lighter boosters. They are designed to be budget-friendly compared to the Play Boosters and Collector Boosters.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bloomburrow-promotional-artwork.jpg?itok=LM8-n2vB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bloomburrow-promotional-artwork.jpg?itok=q2f72NSi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A single Value Booster will contain three commons, two uncommons, one wildcard of any variety, and one card that may be a land, traditional foil, or a Special Guests card. Aside from these values, the post is light on further details, including MSRP or the business decisions that informed the booster's development.</p>
<p>Thankfully, head designer Mark Rosewater held an informal AMA on his personal Tumblr.</p>
<p>One of the questions <a href="https://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/755556573155295232/hey-mark-just-wanted-to-say-that-the-news-about">voiced concern</a> that the <em>Bloomburrow</em> Value Boosters were malicious on WOTC's part, given their decision to remove Draft Boosters and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-introduces-magic-gathering-play-boosters" rel="noopener" target="_blank">introduce Play Boosters</a>. Rosewater responded that Value Boosters is an experiment in providing cheaper booster options for pharmacies, grocery stores, and toy aisles.</p>
<p>This shift in price informs other parts of the Value Boosters. Because it is a low-cost alternative, Value Boosters do not guarantee rare cards. Since Value Boosters are meant for general stores and not dedicated game shops, they cannot be <a href="https://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/755562714280099840/why-not-support-a-draft-format-using-value">used for Draft</a>.</p>
<p>Lastly, Rosewater confirmed that Draft Boosters were dropped because there wasn't a large enough market buying them. And if the <em>Bloomburrow</em> Value Boosters end up the same way, they will be dropped as well.</p>
<p><em>Bloomburrow's</em> Prerelease begins July 26. Those attending this year's GenCon can also experience Bloomburrow events from August 1-4.</p>
