			<p>Five years after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-obsidian-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch</a> of The Outer Worlds, I've finally got my hands on Obsidian's next roleplaying game, Avowed. Microsoft reached out earlier this month with the opportunity of a digital preview event for the press, where we had the opportunity to play a small slice of the game, around two to three hours, starting from the very beginning.</p>
<p>Which, as is often the case with games, begins with a shipwreck. The player character, who can be customized through a fairly in-depth character creation process, is the personal envoy of the Aedyran Emperor, sent to investigate the so-called Dreamscourge plague in the Living Lands, a sizable island located north of the Empire. Players can choose to be either humans or elves (the main races of the Aedyr Empire) and male or female. They're also defined to be Godlike, which means they were touched before birth by one of the gods of Eora, giving them mysterious powers and abilities. Godlike also receive unique facial features that can be customized or even removed, although even if you do remove them completely, the non-player characters will comment on them anyway.</p>
<p>Moreover, players can tweak their attributes from the start, immediately revealing the game's strong RPG roots. Pumping up Might or Intellect isn't just a choice related to combat, either, as you'll often find dialogue options opening up depending on certain attributes. For example, having enough Might could scare away thugs who try to strong-arm you, whereas high Intellect can provide insightful dialogue response options. It's something I have always loved in roleplaying games, and I'm happy to see it appear here.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Avowed_DAWNSHORE_DOCKS_KAI-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Speaking of dialogues, they're rather dynamic in that choosing one option might advance the conversation and lock you out of the others, whereas most games allow the player to simply go back and try every option. Facial animations aren't great, though. I don't know if they're final, but they might be, considering there's less than three months before Avowed launches.</p>
<p>Going back to the story, the shipwreck occurs because the ship the envoy is on suddenly gets bombarded by a nearby fort. Only the envoy and the ship's captain make it out alive and have to find out why exactly a fort of Aedyran soldiers would fire on them. Unsurprisingly, the reason is that the soldiers were infected by the Dreamscourge themselves, slowly turning on each other as chronicled in several notes. Eventually, the player finds the soldier's leader still alive but completely mad; he's effectively the first boss fight in Avowed, and the encounter made me hopeful that Obsidian heeded at least some of the criticism on The Outer Worlds.</p>
<p>My biggest complaint with that game was the underwhelming combat and boss fights. Here, though, both seem thoroughly improved. Combat is definitely more satisfying, both due to improved hit feedback and smoother animations, and it's more challenging, too, at least when played on Hard difficulty. It also features a Skyrim-like dual wielding option that lets you freely mix and match most weapon types, each featuring different damage and stun properties as well as different stamina costs.</p>
<p>In the demo, I checked out greatswords, warhammers, greataxes, dagger and shield, sword and shield, mace and shield, wand and shield, sword and grimoire, and wand and grimoire. Each felt its own thing, and some options are undoubtedly better than others depending on the enemy you're facing. I do, however, have a reservation about grimoires. Whereas wands function more like magic versions of bows with quick or charged zaps, their attacks based on stamina like melee weapons and bows, Grimoire abilities are powered by Essence, the game's version of mana.</p>
<p>This puts it at a distinct disadvantage compared to the other weapons because Essence does not appear to recharge itself over time, like in most RPGs. You'll instead have to chug potions, of which there is not an infinite amount. To compensate, the Grimoire spells should be extremely powerful, but that didn't look the case, at least in this build.</p>

<p>I was also happy to find out that, unlike The Outer Worlds where you had to raise your Inspiration stat to manually use your companion's abilities, this is available right away in Avowed. The only companion in the demo is Kai, an aumaua who deserted from the Rauataian navy and sought a new home in the Living Lands. It's too early to tell, of course, but he's already shaping up to be an interesting character, and his tanking abilities make him useful right away in combat. He's not at all afraid to chime in during dialogues, too, and he's voice-acted by Brandon Keener, who played the beloved Garrus in BioWare's Mass Effect series. One-to-one conversations with companions will only happen in camps, which can be set at specific spots. Camps also feature crafting and enchanting stations to upgrade gear.</p>
<p>Following that boss fight, the envoy makes it back to the main island, accessing the area of Dawnshore. This is where I could explore a bit more freely, and the exploration is highly reminiscent of The Outer Worlds. Don't expect this to be a sprawling open world game by any means, though there will be a few secrets to find here and there. By the way, I would recommend playing in first-person view, as the third-person option felt clunky. You can toggle them via the menu, not in real time as in Bethesda games.</p>
<p>Graphically, for an Unreal Engine 5 game, Avowed looks good but not great, even with all the graphics settings pushed to the max and ray tracing turned on. There seems to be something off about the lighting at times, and the art is also a bit of a mixed bag, though it might grow on the player after some time. The performance is already fairly solid, however, and NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation have already been implemented.</p>
<p>Overall, this hands-on experience definitely left me hopeful and eager for the final version. It's unlikely to be a big success on the scale of Skyrim or Baldur's Gate 3, but it looks like another fun and engaging role-playing game from Obsidian that improves on their previous first-person title. All the worldbuilding work done for the Pillars of Eternity games will certainly pay off, too, both for returning fans of the isometric cRPGs who get to enter Eora from a wholly different perspective and for newcomers who will feel the depth and uniqueness of this fantasy setting.</p>
<p>Avowed launches on February 18, 2025 for PC (Steam, Xbox app, Battle.net, PC Game Pass), Xbox Series S|X (and Xbox Game Pass), and Xbox Cloud Gaming.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://remapradio.com/articles/avowed-preview-xbox/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>Over the past few days, I’ve had the opportunity to explore the opening hours of <em>Avowed</em>, the upcoming fantasy RPG from Obsidian Entertainment, a developer best known for 2010’s <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> and its series of excellent turn-based RPGs in the <em>Pillars of Eternity</em> universe. <em>Avowed</em> arrives early next year on Xbox and PC, and despite the existence of <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em>, this one more closely follows in the footsteps of 2019’s<em> The Outer Worlds</em>, a modest open world-ish sci-fi RPG <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-personal-story-behind-parvati-the-surprise-star-of-the-outer-worlds/?utm_source=wptwitterus"><u>that punched above its weight largely due to excellent writing.&nbsp;</u></a></p><p>Microsoft told me playing through the opening area of <em>Avowed</em> would take about two hours, but taking my time and poking about, my time in the Living Lands was closer to four or five hours. I talk extensively about my time with <em>Avowed</em> on this week’s Remap Radio, but that publishes tomorrow, and in the meantime, I wanted to jot down a couple of quick thoughts with the game.</p><hr><ul><li><strong>Reset your expectations. The game is what you think it is.</strong></li></ul><p>Since it was unveiled, <em>Avowed</em> has felt…<em>off</em>. I can’t put my finger on it. I am the target demo for a game like this <em>and</em> I found <em>The Outer Worlds </em>flawed but worthwhile and charming; <em>Avowed</em> should’ve been a slamdunk pitch. Instead, playing <em>Avowed</em> has affirmed my caution, because the combat is clunky, the world is a little lifeless, and seems, at least at first, to lack the kinds of compelling characters that took <em>The Outer Worlds </em>over the finish line. It’s impossible to make a complete judgment about an RPG based on a few hours with its introductory area, but you gotta start somewhere.</p><ul><li><strong>Crafting the opening to an RPG must be hard, but this one doesn’t work.</strong></li></ul><p>The opening to <em>Skyrim</em> is a meme because it’s <em>awesome</em>, and tosses you into the world in the coolest way possible. I’m not a fantasy person but <em>Skyrim</em> had me by the collar from the jump, and I rushed to start poking and prodding at the world. I’m sympathetic to the notion that an RPG has a difficult job, because it needs to bring you into the world when you’re at your weakest as a character and know very little about the journey ahead. You’re not powerful, you’re not interesting, and you don’t know what you want to do. That could be an opportunity for good writing and clever quests to do the lifting, but I wasn’t able to find them. Instead I spent four hours desperately seeking things to do in the Living Lands’ opening hours that didn’t involve struggling to not die as a magic user, or engaging in shocking amounts of awkward platforming. A world, even one that’s only big-<em>ish</em> like in <em>Avowed</em>, needs to point you towards The Good Stuff.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Stiff and awkward combat can work if the world, story, and characters make up for it.</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>A potentially fatal flaw: quests without consequence, quests without motivation.&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><p><em>Avowed</em> quite obviously does not have the budget or scope of a <em>Skyrim</em>, but again, part of the reason <em>The Outer Worlds</em> worked was because the combat was (arguably) serviceable, while everything else fell into the writing’s lap. I pushed through because the writing compelled me.</p><p>Truth be told, <em>Avowed</em> starts promisingly, with a strangely touching quest where you learn that, in this world, it’s possible to be born with half a soul. You meet such a person, an individual who’s spent their life desperately searching for the other half, but when they do, it turns out their “other half” is a lizard creature whose species has a penchant for violence.&nbsp;</p><p>You’re tasked with clearing (aka killing) the smaller enemies out of her home, before stumbling upon a larger variant trying to communicate with you. You <em>can</em> kill them, but my companion pointed out that maybe this was the (half) soulmate our quest giver was speaking of. Upon reporting back, I firmly suggested that, as odd as this situation might be, they should make the best of it.</p><p>Touched and deeply amused, I fast traveled back to their home, hoping to witness a lovely but awkward conclusion to this story. Instead, nothing happened. That was the end of the quest. All setup, no punchline.&nbsp;</p><p>It was a theme that repeated while exploring <em>Avowed</em>. Once, I cleared a cave of spiders preventing nearby fisherman from doing their jobs, but when the creepy crawlies were dead, no one came to fish. There was no one to thank me. All I had was a little more loot. Where's my impact on the world?</p><p>Or when I stumbled into a rickety shantytown on the outskirts of a great and rich city, figuring I could get up to some mischief—or at least an interesting side quest commenting on the game’s class divides? Instead, a soldier asked me to find four medallions that were hiding nearby. Alas.</p><ul><li><strong>We do not live in a world of RPG scarcity. What itch is <em>Avowed</em> scratching?</strong></li></ul><p>“Launching a game in today's world is as challenging and big an effort as it's ever been,” said Xbox head honcho Phil Spencer <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/phil-spencer-xbox-indiana-jones-call-of-duty?ref=remapradio.com"><u>in a recent interview with <em>Game File</em></u></a>. You can do everything “right,” by which I mean craft a seemingly objectively good game and spend time, money, and effort telling people about it. And it still might fail. There are no guarantees with video games these days, but step one is crafting an identity. Part of my early tepid reaction to <em>Avowed</em> was trying to puzzle out whether my reaction was purely because “hey, it’s not for me.” But upon playing it, I now wonder: is <em>Avowed</em> for anyone?</p><p><em>Avowed</em> would not be the first video game to really get going hours later than it should. It’s a chronic problem with RPGs. I’ll be returning to the Living Lands in 2025. The only difference is that I’ll be walking through the door, digital wand in hand, with a little more skepticism this time.</p>

I am, however improper it might be, going to ignore this principle on this occasion, because after spending at least six hours with the opening section of a preview build of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.link/gawj9hqojtabo&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.link/gawj9hqojtabo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Avowed</em></a></span>, <em>I already absolutely adore this game</em>.</p><p>It’s quite normal for PR companies to spin fantasies around the game they’re sending you, and Microsoft unquestionably did this when sharing this build of <em>Avowed</em> and saying it should last about two hours. I mean, perhaps if someone knew where they were going and refused to deviate on the way, that could be true. I’ve been playing three times that long, still have large sections of the available map in fog, incomplete sidequests, and tough battles I’m determined to win. Beside the main plot, I’ve explored elaborate, labyrinthine spider caves, fought three boss fights, helped a wayward soul find her twin, burgled a dozen houses in a sprawling dockside town, leapt from rooftop to rooftop in pursuit of gull-stolen trinkets, and battled hordes of xaurip beasts for the hell of it. That includes none of the 27 stages of the two main quests. Two hours!</p><figure id="" data-id="0753902f7ebac9d614e9652b964f67a9" data-recommend-id="image://0753902f7ebac9d614e9652b964f67a9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A scene of Dawnshore's port, with large wooden ships and stone buildings." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A scene of Dawnshore's port, with large wooden ships and stone buildings." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0753902f7ebac9d614e9652b964f67a9" data-recommend-id="image://0753902f7ebac9d614e9652b964f67a9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A scene of Dawnshore's port, with large wooden ships and stone buildings." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Avowed</em> is Obsidian’s action-adventure RPG follow-up to its wonderful third-person <em>Pillars of Eternity</em> games. Set a couple of years later, it whisks us off to a new region of Eora called The Living Lands, a rough, pirate-ridden region whose people have heard rumor of the events that took place in the Eastern Reach, but know only snippets of what occurred in the Deadfire. In this way, <em>Avowed</em> is a game that’s rich with background detail for those who played the two isometric RPGs, but extremely welcoming to newcomers for whom all those references are just expository color.</p><p>There is a new plague spreading the lands, called the Dreamscourge. The infected begin to experience terrible dreams which, after a while, bleed into their waking lives, leaving them unable to discern reality, and becoming unintelligible and violent. It also causes fungi to start growing all over their bodies. This is afflicting people, animals, even vegetation, and the leaders of the oh-so civilized Aedyran Empire have sent you, a Godlike (people who are touched by the gods at birth, giving them unique abilities), to the Living Lands as an envoy, to find out more.</p><p>On your journey to an area called Dawnshore, you’re shipwrecked and lose all your crew but for one person, Garryck, a furry blue guy who’s adept with a sword. Washing up on the beach of a small island (let’s call it Tutorial Island), you aim for a stronghold that should be on your side, but seemed to be responsible for the ruining of your ship. On arrival, all you find is carnage, a bloodbath of dead bodies, as if they all turned on each other. Through exploring and engaging with those still alive, you eventually find a way to reach the port of Dawnshore, with an eventual goal of entering the town of Paradis. But before you do, you need to find the ambassador you were meant to meet, who’s gone missing somewhere in the wilds.</p><figure id="" data-id="40f3237ce74b22d2cfaf156b4b353e49" data-recommend-id="image://40f3237ce74b22d2cfaf156b4b353e49" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Battling a skeleton with blue glowing eyes, using a spear." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Battling a skeleton with blue glowing eyes, using a spear." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="40f3237ce74b22d2cfaf156b4b353e49" data-recommend-id="image://40f3237ce74b22d2cfaf156b4b353e49" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Battling a skeleton with blue glowing eyes, using a spear." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Aedyr is unseen (at least so far—this preview is limited to the game’s first main area, Dawnshore) but quickly becomes apparent as analogous for various Earthly empires that believed their civilization superior to those abroad, sending people out to attempt to establish colonies and spread their enlightened ways. (The letter given to you by the Emperor reads, in part, “We grant you the privilege and immunity to dispense our laws as you see fit and to remove all obstacles by any means.”) You, as an Aedyran, and also a Godlike, are therefore quite understandably met with suspicion and sometimes intolerance, as you explore the not-actually-lawless lands. And, this being an Obsidian game, you can lean into your reputation, try to defy it, or just outright not give a shit either way.</p><p>The two companions you meet and explore with on Tutorial Island are very abruptly taken from you on arrival in Dawnshore (both for good narrative reasons), and you’re immediately paired up with Kai, a former soldier from the Rauataian Empire, a rugged and weather-beaten land of blue, scaled people with a (mostly untrue) reputation for being mercenaries. Kai just happens to be a mercenary, but an extremely calm and gentle one, voiced by the mellifluous Brandon Keener—Garrus from the <em>Mass Effect</em> games.</p><figure id="" data-id="9f3cfa07c229e65e859ce695bf7c1f21" data-recommend-id="image://9f3cfa07c229e65e859ce695bf7c1f21" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A generic female character battles a lizardy beast that's wearing very silly armor." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A generic female character battles a lizardy beast that's wearing very silly armor." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9f3cfa07c229e65e859ce695bf7c1f21" data-recommend-id="image://9f3cfa07c229e65e859ce695bf7c1f21" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A generic female character battles a lizardy beast that's wearing very silly armor." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This is all viewed from a first or third-person perspective (and surprisingly, both feel right), in a game that feels <em>chunky</em> in a way RPGs haven’t for too long. It brings back memories of <em>Dark Messiah of Might &amp; Magic</em> and <em>Arx Fatalis</em>, but in a far more elaborately hewn universe. The world around you feels delicately crafted, with you as a powerful force within it. Any fears (or hopes, I suppose) that this might be an Obsidian attempt at a <em>Skyrim</em> can be put aside—<em>Avowed</em> is far more concentrated, less wildly open, a much more focused game.</p><p>However, there’s still a great sense of freedom. This most immediately stood out to me with its classless approach. At the start of the game, there’s a solid (although shamed by <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>’s) character creator that lets you design your Godlike envoy (not that the screenshots here were supplied by Obsidian, and I made someone far more interesting than the generic character shown!), and pick a background archetype that leans into a class (hinting at rogues, wizards, fighters, etc), but this choice actually has far more impact on your conversations than your aptitudes. Instead, as you gather different weapon types, you can experiment as you see fit, dual-wielding most types, and you’re encouraged to have two completely different setups, which you can swap between on the fly. I began with an axe, tried grimoire spellcasting, tested heavy weaponry, and eventually settled on a combination of axe and wand in one loadout, and bow and arrow in the other. You can then plug ability points into these weapon types as you level up, and respec for just a small in-game currency cost.</p><p>It’s also rather pertinent to return to that opening point: perhaps I could have finished this in two hours, but there felt no reason to. I was able to head off in multiple directions, seek out entirely off-script areas, have in-depth chats with characters who play major roles in the plot, and even after finding where the demo build ends, reload and find whole other sections I’d missed. It’s not that overwhelming agoraphobia of an <em>Elder Scrolls</em> game, but nor is it a linear experience by any means.</p><p>On arrival at Dawnshore, I realized that while there was a quest marker somewhere in the far distance, I wasn’t being pointed in any other specific directions. Instead, given the enormous map and vast blank space waiting to be filled in between me and my goal, I was being deliberately left free to explore. I felt liberated to poke about the towns, find routes onto rooftops to see if I could sneak into buildings, and then climb a huge, dilapidated lighthouse Kai pointed out, just because it was there.</p><figure id="" data-id="91b955e5f0f68ed8af98a47073281fcf" data-recommend-id="image://91b955e5f0f68ed8af98a47073281fcf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A sunset view of Dawnshore, with cliffs in the foreground and the lighthouse in the distance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A sunset view of Dawnshore, with cliffs in the foreground and the lighthouse in the distance." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="91b955e5f0f68ed8af98a47073281fcf" data-recommend-id="image://91b955e5f0f68ed8af98a47073281fcf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A sunset view of Dawnshore, with cliffs in the foreground and the lighthouse in the distance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Despite this, perhaps even because of it, the gorgeous world sometimes feels oddly inert around you. You’re equipped with hefty weapons, but unless marked as breakable, wooden crates and all plant life resists your blows. It occasionally has that feeling of an old 1930s cartoon, where anything that was going to move was painted differently than the static backgrounds, except here delineated with glowy markers. Wooden obstacles blocking doors are inexplicably indestructible, and while you can wield fire magic, you can only set something on fire if it’s marked as such.</p><p>Still, you can set fire to all the enemies, and that’s not nothing. Combat is very much what you choose to make of it, I discovered, with options to carefully combine Godlike abilities, pause the action to issue commands to Kai, and then meticulously fire off incapacitating spells before rushing in with a sword. Or, you know, just spam the wand button and glug health potions. Weapon builds really do significantly affect how fights play out, and it’s very much about discovering what works for you, what sort of action-adventure battling you prefer.</p><p>I was also rather delighted by the game’s willingness to let you run away. Even boss encounters, like an onslaught of spider minions before their big mommy comes out, don’t lock you in the cave where they occur. If it’s too much, turn and sprint away! Or use this to your advantage, funnel them to a narrow corridor and pelt them with arrows, shepherd them so you can set fire to as many at once as possible. It really does seem to encourage experimentation, and not fuss about whether you might cheese something if they don’t bolt all the doors.</p><figure id="" data-id="eb8d8a1df71027bdbc6b79df8756de99" data-recommend-id="image://eb8d8a1df71027bdbc6b79df8756de99" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A cat-like character is about to fire an arrow from a bow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A cat-like character is about to fire an arrow from a bow." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="eb8d8a1df71027bdbc6b79df8756de99" data-recommend-id="image://eb8d8a1df71027bdbc6b79df8756de99" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A cat-like character is about to fire an arrow from a bow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s too early to make any calls on the storytelling. This is very much the establishing moments of what’s clearly going to be a large and unfolding tale, and so these opening hours have a lot of heavy lifting to do in terms of getting you up to speed. All the writing is as good as you’d hope from this studio, although at the same time, I can’t say I met any characters I’d regard as especially memorable. Again, this is all set before you even enter the game’s first main city, and Kai—largely by having Garrus’s voice, admittedly—is immediately charming.</p><p>My only real point of concern was what felt like the narrative rushing too quickly to bestow me with the accolades of being so utterly unique, so special and chosen, that are de rigueur for RPG games. I am a Godlike, and as such have cool toadstools growing out of my face—but so do all the plague victims, so that’s not enormously special. Instead, the only action that triggered the solemnly delivered platitudes about my magnitude was telling my early companions I’d heard a voice after touching a stone. I feel like this should earn perhaps a raised eyebrow, maybe even concern, rather than seeing me immediately declared as having Christlike significance. Things calmed down after arriving in Dawnshore, however, where people were more likely to assume me an asshole than their savior. But still, it felt a touch ham-fisted.</p><p>But really, honestly, the only thing that matters is how much I just want to keep playing. I don’t want to be done yet! So much so that even though I’ve technically “finished” this build, cruelly cut off as I entered the city of Paradis, I’ve gone back to explore what’s left. I found a whole new cave dungeon that I’d missed before! I discovered I’d gathered enough items to improve my armor, and am only a couple of one particular plant away from being able to upgrade my wand a second time! I’m determined to squeeze out every last drop of this snippet of the game, and am now infuriated that I have to wait until February 18 to be able to play any further.</p><p><em>Avowed</em> feels rock solid, deep, and hugely cared for. This has “labor of love” oozing out all over, and if it can deliver a story as strong as those in the <em>Pillars of Eternity </em>games, we could have an all-time classic on our hands.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>There's been a question mark over this one for years, but it seems BioWare did once plan to let you import your Hero of Ferelden, your Grey Warden protagonist from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-origins">Dragon Age: Origins</a>, into <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-inquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a>. It was only at the last minute that the studio cut the feature and swapped a Grey Warden character called Stroud in their place.</p>
<p>In Inquisition, there's a pivotal mission near the end - Here Lies the Abyss - where you get a chance to meet protagonists from previous games. You meet your Hawke from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-ii">Dragon Age 2</a>, and then you get the chance to meet one of three Grey Warden characters from Dragon Age: Origins - and it's here the game was supposed to let you meet your Hero of Ferelden. But it didn't - this is where Stroud was swapped in instead.</p>
<p>"Here's the thing about honouring previous game choices from a design perspective: it's a sucker's game," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/davidgaider.bsky.social/post/3lbfwpwi6ns22">wrote Gaider on Bluesky</a>. "What many fans picture, when you mention it, is divergent *plot* - the story changes path based on those major choices. How exciting!</p>
<p>"But you will never be able to deliver divergent plot."</p>

<p>"It's a question of resources, and there's never enough to go around.</p>
<p>"Here Lies the Abyss in DAI was about as good as it gets," he added, "and even that was a far cry from how I originally pictured it (hello last-minute insert of Stroud when a DAO Warden import got cut)."</p><p>Gaider's Bluesky thread came about as an addendum, of sorts, to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-developer-cast-farscape-star-as-morrigan-after-hearing-her-beat-poet-rendition-of-noughties-rap-banger">yesterday's story about the origins of Morrigan's character</a> and the voice actor cast to play her. The primary focus of the addendum concerns Morrigan's child in the game, Kieran, AKA the Old God Baby. He does appear in Inquisition but this was another choice from Dragon Age: Origins that gave Gaider a headache.</p>

<p>Remember, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-knew-the-deepest-secrets-of-dragon-age-lore-20-years-ago-and-locked-it-away-in-an-uber-plot-doc">BioWare didn't know there would be a Dragon Age 2 when it was making Dragon Age: Origins</a>, let alone a Dragon Age 3 (Inquisition), so it didn't plan these things in advance. It did a bunch of things in Origins it turns out were incredibly hard to fulfil later on.</p>
<p>The Old God Baby is a big deal... <em>if</em> it happened in your game. The soul of the Archdemon you defeat - a corrupted Old God - is transferred into the baby that you and Morrigan, or Morrigan and another character, conceive on the eve of the final battle. Already, then, there are permutations in who the father could be, so who should canon-Kieran look like?</p><p>"It was a decision from *two games ago* that only a small minority (hello telemetry) would even choose," said Gaider. "To the rest, they probably neither knew about it nor cared... so how many resources could you invest? To do what? Set up an even bigger divergence for the NEXT game?"</p>
<p>The solution came when Gaider made the scene more about Morrigan and less about Kieran, a character the players didn't know. "Thus began a feverish three days where I wrote probably the most complicated scene of my career: Morrigan's reckoning with Flemeth in DAI and the fallout after," he said. "Three different versions (OGB Kieran, non-OGB Kieran, and no Kieran), each with branching for other choices (like the Well of Sorrows)."</p>
<p>It was a scene that resonated with Morrigan actor Claudia Black, who'd had a child of her own not long after Dragon Age: Origins had come out. In fact, she would later have her own child play the role of Kieran in the scene. "Claudia was in the booth, gently coaching him through his lines," Gaider said, "and I think that was the first moment I felt I'd done the right thing."</p>
<p>Gaider, incidentally, did not work on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> at all - a game that sidesteps a lot of the issues Inquisition faced by letting you customise an Inquisitor during character creation, and then outlining only three of the biggest choices they made. It does not - as previous Dragon Ages did - use the web-based Dragon Age Keep database, which tracked a multitude of decisions from the older games.</p>

			<p>In my STALKER 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a>, I mentioned how the game's balance is currently causing frustration for the player:</p>
<p><em>When you're hit in STALKER 2, there's a decent chance you'll not only lose health (which does not regenerate on its own), but you'll also start bleeding. While medkits restore health, you need bandages to stem the bleeding. Similarly, you need to bring food and drinks, anti-rads, and enough ammunition whenever you venture out of the safe zones. You'll want to stock up on all these things because there is no fast travel in this game, and there's no telling when you might need them while roaming the ever-dangerous Zone. However, everything has its own weight; even quest items have weight, and the more you carry, the quicker the stamina drops.</em></p>
<p><em>While that is perfectly understandable within the context of the game's design, I feel that it is absolutely overtuned and ends up being too penalizing. Even when the inventory's weight is in the green range, it only takes a little sprint to deplete the stamina, leading to fairly slow and long treks to travel across the map. I literally wished there was some kind of auto-run functionality, as you're just pushing the forward button for minutes at a time on certain occasions with nothing else to do. A modular approach to difficulty, which is becoming more common in recent game releases, would have been preferable to set the challenge level of combat, travel, injuries and survival separately depending on the player's preferences.</em></p>
<p><em>There's more. The equipment's durability depletes over time, as you'd expect given the realistic theme. Tech NPCs can repair them in the safe zones, provided you've got enough coupons to spare. The problem is that, in some cases, the cost is simply outrageous. I had found an extremely effective armor suit that was worth over 20K coupons. However, when I went to repair it, I was appalled by the NPC requesting 70K coupons - far more than I had available. When repairing something costs over three times its worth, you know something's wrong. I also believe that the side missions could be more rewarding at handing coupons; you don't loot coupons from fallen foes, as they are transmitted digitally to your PDA. You could gather items and then sell them, but there's the little problem mentioned above with taking on too much weight. In short, the economy needs a balance pass, too.</em></p>
<p>Later in the review, I mentioned that either GSC Game World or modders would have to take care of the problem. It looks like the modders already did, albeit in a perhaps excessive fashion. Mere hours after the launch, Nexus Mods user Ronon_Dex_6 <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uploaded</a> a mod that provides unlimited carry weight for the player. This works through Cheat Engine, so it's essentially a hack, and it certainly kind of undermines the harsh journey the player is meant to go through. However, it is a temporary solution for those who cannot bear the system as-is, while a better fix can be provided by the developers or by a more elegant mod.</p>
<p>There's also another <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/26" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mod</a> that removes weapon durability loss. This is achieved by manually tweaking the durabilitydamagepershot value to 0.0 in the PlayerWeaponSettingsPrototypes.cfg file. Many more mods will undoubtedly be released for STALKER 2. The development team <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-getting-hardware-rt-cross-platform-mods-and-multiplayer-post-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plans</a> to release official tools that will allow fans to create cross-platform mods that work on consoles, too. We'll keep you informed of all the most interesting mods as they appear.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-is-increasing-its-battle-pass-price-in-december/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Starting December 1, the price of the Fortnite Battle Royale Battle Pass will increase to 1,000 V-Bucks, up from 950 V-Bucks. However, the real money cost of V-Bucks will stay the same. Players can still earn V-Bucks by progressing through the Battle Pass tiers. In addition, the price of the 25 Battle Pass Reward Bundle has been reduced from 1,850 V-Bucks to 1,800 V-Bucks.</p>



<p>Fortnite is making <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-crew-will-include-the-battle-pass-lego-pass-music-pass-and-more-starting-in-december" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several changes</a> to its Crew Subscription, along with increasing the Battle Pass price. Starting December 1, the Fortnite Crew will include the Music Pass and LEGO Pass at no additional cost, along with the existing benefits (Battle Royale Battle Pass, 1,000 V-Bucks, monthly Crew Pack outfits, and the bonus benefits of Crew Pack outfit styles, Rocket League’s Rocket Pass Premium). New Passes like the Fortnite OG Pass will also be added to the Crew Subscription.</p>



<p>Players who cancel their Fortnite Crew subscription can still claim premium rewards from the Battle Pass until the end of their billing cycle, but not for the remainder of the Battle Pass duration. Those who remain actively subscribed will not notice any changes in the system. Additionally, players who purchase the Battle Pass, LEGO Pass, or Music Pass separately from Fortnite Crew will still have the opportunity to unlock and claim premium rewards.</p>

                <p>One year after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-is-bringing-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-to-mobile-devices-next-month/1100-6519544/" data-ref-id="1100-6519544">Netflix brought Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy</a> to its growing mobile-gaming library, two of those games are set to leave the service. Netflix has warned users that they will only have until December 13 to play Grand Theft Auto 3 - The Definitive Edition and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City - The Definitive Edition.</p><p>While GTA 3 and Vice City are both set to leave the service, it seems like San Andreas is staying on Netflix for a while longer, with the game not displaying the same "Leaving Soon" card as the other two. According to <a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/leaving-soon/grand-theft-auto-iii-and-vice-city-leaving-netflix-games-in-december-2024/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">What's On Netflix</a>, the GTA games were some of the most downloaded in Netflix's library, with San Andreas easily the most popular of the three.</p><p>The GTA Trilogy's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-3-vice-city-and-san-andreas-now-available-free-through-netflix/1100-6519956/" data-ref-id="1100-6519956">exclusive Netflix mobile release</a> was based on Grove Street Games' remasters for console and PC, but included a number of extra quality-of-life improvements, including a popular "Classic Lighting" mode. Their removal from Netflix comes just after the console and PC remasters received a major update, which added the Classic Lighting mode and other improvements from the mobile editions.</p><p>Netflix subscribers who want to continue playing the mobile versions of GTA 3 and Vice City after December 13 will have to purchase the games outright from the Google Play Store or iOS App Store.</p><p>While movie and TV titles cycle on and off Netflix all the time, this is the first major removal for Netflix's game catalogue, and suggests that not all the titles in the gaming library are there to stay. "Just like with series and film, games will be removed from Netflix as licenses expire," a Netflix representative confirmed. "Players will notice a 'Leaving Soon' badge and be notified by the app itself well in advance of removal."</p>

The ranked competition will reward exclusive cosmetic items to those who reach certain milestones, including an exclusive champion skin that will be awarded only to the player who comes out on top at the end of the season.</p><p>Separate to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-season-1-rank-reset-explained/1100-6527765/" data-ref-id="1100-6527765">Black Ops 6's Prestige ranks</a>, Ranked Play is designed for the most dedicated players who want to play multiplayer matches with the same settings, maps, modes, and weapon restrictions as COD's official esports league. In order to qualify for Ranked Play, players first have to log 50 wins in match-made multiplayer games to unlock access to the ultra-competitive mode. All wins logged since the game was released count towards this, even if the games were played before the start of Season 1.</p><p>Ranked Play has changed a little from previous COD titles, with the ranking system being simplified. In Black Ops 6, players will work through eight ranks: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Crimson, Iridescent, and Top 250. Progress through the ranks can be made by earning Skill Rating (SR), which can also be lost by losing a match.</p><p>The rewards on offer for Ranked players include a number of Ranked Skins for the Competitor operator, which are unlocked starting at Gold rank. These skins will be unlocked as soon as you achieve a new rank, rather than being rewarded at the end of the season--with the exception of the Top 250 and overall Champion skins. The peak reward, which is set to be one of the most exclusive skins in Black Ops 6, is the Champion skin, resembling a flaming, crowned, skull-headed operator.</p><p>Other rewards can be unlocked by reaching certain milestones in Ranked Play, and include the Ranked Competitor Skin, Knife Blueprint, a Frag Grenade Skin, a win-tracking Gunscreen, and more. Each season will also come with its own set of unique seasonal rewards that will only be available to earn during that season.</p><p>Cross-play is mandatory for Ranked Play, meaning console players have the potential to be matched against PC players in all matches. This decision hasn't been popular with fans, with many requesting the option to disable cross-play for the hyper-competitive mode.</p><p>If you're looking at getting competitive in Black Ops 6, check out our guide to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-mp-weapon-loadouts/2900-5960/" data-ref-id="2900-5960">best MP weapon loadouts</a> for Season 1.</p>

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-is-now-selling-digital-shoes-for-your-character-skin-with-nike-air-jordans-costing-around-7</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-is-now-selling-digital-shoes-for-your-character-skin-with-nike-air-jordans-costing-around-%C2%A37.1041639/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-is-now-selling-digital-shoes-for-your-character-skin-with-nike-air-jordans-costing-around-7<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> has a new type of cosmetic option for its characters - Kicks - which are, in a nutshell, shoes. 
</p>
<p>
The first pair of Kicks has been viewable within Fortnite since the start of its current Chapter 2 Remix season - a pair of Air Jordan 1 Retro High OG 'Black Toe Reimagined' trainers, which you can unlock as part of the current battle pass. 
</p>
<p>
As of today, however, Kicks are now equippable by (many, though not all) Fortnite character skins. A range of other shoes - sorry, Kicks - are also available to buy. 
</p>
<p>
Starting today, you can buy:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Nike Cortez Leather OG - 800 V-Bucks</li>
<li>Nike Air Foamposite One 'Galaxy' - 1000 V-Bucks</li>
<li>Nike Shox R4 'Comet Red' - 1000 V-Bucks</li>
<li>Chomp Stompers - 600 V-Bucks</li>
</ul>

<p>
And from tomorrow, you can buy:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Air Jordan 3 Retro 'Palomino'- 800 V-Bucks</li>
<li>Air Jordan 3 'Black Cement-Gray' - 1000 V-Bucks</li>
<li>Air Jordan 11 'Black/Gym Red' - 1000 V-Bucks</li>
<li>Air Jordan 4 Retro 'Manila' - 1000 V-Bucks</li>
</ul>

<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/fortnite-kicks-air-jordan-3-black-cement-gray-1920x1080-e46f11de083d.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>

</figure>
<p>I really like the Chomp Stompers - those shark slippers which only cost 600 V-Bucks (around £3-ish?) As a Fortnite-original design, these are cheaper than the other options. There's no way I'm paying 1000 V-Bucks - the price of a battle pass - for anything else.</p>
<p>
Fortnite maker Epic Games says Kicks are currently compatible with over 500 Fortnite skins, with 95 percent of the game's skin library set to be compatible by the spring of next year. 
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-permanent-og-mode-will-have-its-own-battle-pass">Fortnite revealed a shake-up to its battle pass system</a> and the introduction of another separate battle pass for its upcoming, permanent edition of the game's original map: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-reviving-original-map-as-permanent-addition-featuring-multiple-classic-seasons">Fortnite OG</a>.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/21/please-square-enix-five-games-that-need-the-hd-2d-treatment/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/please-square-enix-%E2%80%93-five-games-that-need-the-hd-2d-treatment.1041612/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/21/please-square-enix-five-games-that-need-the-hd-2d-treatment/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>We shouldn’t be surprised to discover that a good game from the past is still a good game today, but with the huge success of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/13/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-review/">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a>, there’s further proof of concept that the corporate heads over at Squeenix will be paying attention to. While we’ve seen wonderful remakes of games like Star Ocean and Live A Live in the past couple of years, there’s still plenty of grist to this digital mill, so, we’ve had a good think, and come up with five other games that are begging for the HD-2D treatment.</p>
<h2>Final Fantasy VI</h2>
<p>With the producer of Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake saying that he’d love to do this one next, it feels as though this is a thing waiting to happen. Final Fantasy VI is one of the most important releases in the franchise, its release on the SNES paving the way for many gamer’s induction into the series’ fandom, and putting in place some of the series most iconic characters, including the villainous Kefka,</p>



<p>VI was the last Final Fantasy to use a pixel art-style, but it benefits from the improvement in mechanics and storytelling over its predecessors. Sure, we’ve just had the pixel remasters to help preserve this in its original form, but surely this will be the next HD-2D game.</p>
<h2>Final Fantasy Tactics</h2>
<p>Given that Square Enix ‘own’ the idea of the HD-2D remake, it makes sense to plough the Final Fantasy furrow further, and where better to take it than with Final Fantasy Tactics? In a sense, we’ve seen something of what it could look like in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/03/04/triangle-strategy-review-nintendo-switch/">Triangle Strategy</a>, but Final Fantasy Tactics has sat weirdly dormant amongst the catalogue despite being one of the most iconic and important releases in the Final Fantasy canon.</p>


<p>This strategy game’s in-depth job system, amazing tactical gameplay and memorable characters should surely set it out for a remake or remaster, and HD-2D seems like the perfect way to do that. There are already <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1de4kcu/the_recent_midori_leak_about_visions_of_mana/l8aa74v/">reports and rumours of a remake in the works</a>…</p>
<h2>Chrono Trigger</h2>
<p>Chrono Trigger was the first release in the Chrono series, and though it’s lain mostly dormant since the late 90s, Square Enix have rolled out steady re-releases of this game – heck, I can play it on my Apple TV. Its continued to garner interest because it remains an incredible JRPG, and features the work of a dream team of iconic Japanese creators, Hironobu Sakaguchi, creator of the Final Fantasy series, Yuji Horii, creator of the Dragon Quest series and Akira Toriyama, character designer for Dragon Quest and author of both Dragon Ball and Sand Land. Add to that Takashi Tokita, Kazuhiko Aoki and Masato Kato, and this game’s development team was absolutely stacked.</p>

<p>It’s a literal powerhouse of a design team, and Chrono Trigger bears the hallmarks of all their input, with fantastic storytelling, enjoyable gameplay mechanics, and instantly recognisable characters. Much like Final Fantasy Tactics, it’s a series that’s mostly lain dormant, and is thoroughly ready for a return to our screens, not least because Live A Live had the HD-2D treatment a couple years ago.</p>
<h2>Xenogears</h2>
<p>This would be the pinnacle of HD-2D remakes, at least for me, as the foundation stone in the Xenosaga and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/05/27/xenoblade-chronicles-definitive-edition-review-future-connected-switch/">Xenoblade Chronicles</a> series. Originally released in 1998 on PlayStation, it’s strange that its never been returned to as it sits well within the canon of Square’s JRPG heyday.</p>

<p>There’s Active Time Battles, mecha suits, a storyline that draws on both Star Wars and the Bible, and an amazing soundtrack from Yasunori Mitsuda, and its just an incredible piece of RPG history. The fact that it already mixes 2D and 3D visuals means that, structurally at least, it would need less reworking than some of the other suggestions in this list.</p>
<p>It never reached Europe, so that lack of localisation is rumoured to play a major part in why it hasn’t returned. Surely though, the time is now, particularly with the Xenoblade Chronicles series riding high, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/29/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-removes-one-more-reason-to-keep-your-wii-u-in-march/">Chronicles X finding its way to the Nintendo Switch in 2025</a>.</p>
<h2>The Legend of Zelda</h2>
<p>OK, we’re breaking out of Square Enix land for this one, but Nintendo has been one of their most reliable partners, the Switch exclusive <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/07/26/octopath-traveler-review/">Octopath Traveler</a> founding the HD-2D style. Nintendo has traditionally been incredibly protective of their IP, but they’re less averse to partnering with other developers these days, and Square were the founding partners for Super Mario RPG and everything that came since. Sure, they went on a break over some CDs, but that’s ancient history now.</p>

<p>Alongside many other games on this list, The original The Legend of Zelda has been re-released across multiple generations of console, but it’s never been remade or remastered. Now, that could be because Nintendo feels its showing its age as a game, or that they just couldn’t settle on the right way to bring it back up to date. They could give it to Grezzo for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/19/links-awakening-switch-review-the-legend-of-zelda-remake/">Link’s Awakening</a> treatment, but Square Enix’s HD-2D style feels like it would be a perfect match for the earliest Legend of Zelda game and its 8-bit visuals, and it could form an ideal window into the history of the series, while bringing it bang up-to-date.</p>
<h2>Anything from the Squeenix back catalogue</h2>
<p>Square Enix are always looking for an angle – &nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/03/square-enix-confirm-multiple-block-chain-games-in-development-rather-quieter-on-nfts/">like their whole NFT and blockchain nonsense</a> – but while remakes are the safe best, the hip and cool thing these days is actually the demake. Who’s to say that Square Enix couldn’t down-rez some of their more modern games and franchises?</p>

<p>As daft as this might sound, I do actually quite fancy blowing things up with a pixelated Rico Rodriguez in Just Cause HD-2D or some hack and slash pixelated action in Drakengard HD-2D? And while they might have sold off Crystal Dynamics, they kept a hold of their most important game series in the divorce. What about an HD-2D reworking of Gex after next year’s 3D re-release?!&nbsp;OK, maybe that’s a step too far. I should stop now before we revive the <a href="https://kaneandlynch.fandom.com/wiki/Kane_%26_Lynch:_Dead_Men_(Mobile)">Kane &amp; Lynch: Dead Men mobile game</a>…</p>
<p>What other games would you like to see get the HD-2D treatment?</p>

<p>Fortnite leakers have revealed that a Juice WRLD update has been confirmed for tomorrow. A lot of the content expected in this update has also leaked beforehand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reliable Fortnite leakers <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1859354951140421781" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ShiinaBR</a> and <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1859293173249364194" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HYPEX</a> have provided players with several details about the Juice WRLD update. We now know that Juice WRLD is receiving multiple skins, a POI, a weapon, emotes and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Starting with the skins, Juice WRLD will seemingly have <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1859311479234896116" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">two skins</a> in Fortnite; one of them will be a cell-shaded version and will be free for all players to claim. Regarding the new POI, Juice WRLD will have an <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1859529420693713347" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in-game tribute</a> where players can spot the late artist next to the battle royale map.

<p>Juice WRLD will receive an <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1859526187837456669" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Exotic Chug Cannon</a> as the new weapon in this update.

This emote will have players dancing to the artist’s popular song while mimicking his moves. The other <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1859354951140421781" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">two emotes</a> haven’t been revealed, but we know one will be with Eminem, and the other will feature Juice WRLD’s unreleased music.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Creators and consumers are tangling with the use of generative AI in everything from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ms-flight-sim-24-dev-on-why-the-game-needed-to-use-machine-learning-and-ai/1100-6527889/" data-ref-id="1100-6527889">games</a> to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-ai-made-secret-invasion-opening-prompts-response-from-studio-after-backlash/1100-6515426/" data-ref-id="1100-6515426">TV-show opening sequences</a>, and the sentiment on AI seems to be shifting. To help consumers make decisions about which games to buy, game storefront Itch.io now requires all creators to disclose the use of generative AI in games, Itch.io founder Leaf Corcoran announced in a <a href="https://itch.io/t/4309690/generative-ai-disclosure-tagging" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">forum post to the site</a>.</p><p>The text of the post itself is fairly straightforward, directed primarily at the creators who will have to disclose this information.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4403080-ai-generated-itch.png" data-ref-id="1300-4403080" data-ratio="0.47015610651974" data-width="1089" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4403080-ai-generated-itch.png" data-ref-id="1300-4403080"></a><figcaption>Itch.io's generative-AI disclosure</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4403080-ai-generated-itch.png"></figure><p>"We’ve deployed a new field to project edit pages called 'Generative AI disclosure.' This field asks if your project contains the results of generative AI. If you select yes, then we also ask what kinds of generative AI you utilize, including Graphics, Sound, Text &amp; Dialog, and Code," Corcoran wrote. Selecting Yes will give your project an "AI Generated" tag, while selecting No will give it a "No AI" tag.</p><p>Importantly, though, Corcoran notes that "Assets comprised of generative AI (even if modified afterwards) that are not tagged will no longer be eligible for indexing on [Itch.io's] browse pages." The project won't be removed, but will not show up when browsing, and must be discovered through search or a direct link.</p><p>Corcoran is careful not to make a moral judgment of the use of AI, and Itch.io's Content Creator Quality Guidelines state that "we are strictly enforcing disclosure for all game asset pages due to legal ambiguity around rights associated with Generative AI content."</p><p>As Itch takes this measure, many game developers and publishers are moving to clarify their stances on the technology, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remedy-clarifies-its-stance-on-using-ai-in-games/1100-6527867/" data-ref-id="1100-6527867">Remedy</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ms-flight-sim-24-dev-on-why-the-game-needed-to-use-machine-learning-and-ai/1100-6527889/" data-ref-id="1100-6527889">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-executive-promotes-ai-game-development-shortly-after-huge-layoffs/1100-6527567/" data-ref-id="1100-6527567">Netflix</a>, and others.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse revealed that the game's average daily peak concurrents are up by a not-to-be-sniffed-at three percent this year over last year, when Baldur's Gate 3 launched.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, its average daily active users are up by a more substantial 20 percent over last year. "If you zoom out on our sales chart it looks like the heartbeat of a happy little guy," Douse wrote on social media platform X.</p>

<p>These increases, Douse has implied, are thanks to mods (they are "very good", in his words).</p>
<p>Back in October, Larian celebrated 50m mod downloads since it released Patch 7 (which<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-out-next-week-on-pc-bringing-modding-support-and-more-evil-endings"> introduced mod-support to the fantasy role playing game</a>). At this same time, the developer said 10k of those mod downloads were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-modders-really-want-to-change-withers-name-to-bone-daddy">players changing Baldur's Gate 3's mysterious Undead entity Withers' name to Bone Daddy</a><em>.</em></p>

<p>In June, Larian head Swen Vincke stated Baldur's Gate 3's official mod support would be a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mod-support-in-baldurs-gate-3-will-be-final-handover-moment-to-players-says-larian-ceo">handover moment to players</a>, though the studio will continue to provide updates afterwards.</p>
<p>As for what's next, Larian previously confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-developer-initially-started-work-on-a-follow-up-as-it-was-the-obvious-thing">Balder's Gate 4 was briefly toyed with</a> before the studio decided to try something new instead. The developer is yet to formally reveal its next project, it has confirmed two games are currently in the works - both of which will be based on its own IPs and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-studio-confirms-two-new-projects-will-be-our-best-work-ever">described as the studio's "best work ever"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Manchester will get a Pac-Man Live Experience where contestants run around a virtual maze under the watchful eye of the "Pac-Master", a "lively gameshow host". 
</p>
<p>
Set to open at Manchester's Arcade Arena on 22nd March 2025, the offering is described by its creators as a "multi-sensory adventure, seamlessly blending the real world with augmented reality". It's being put together by Little Lion Entertainment, which previously worked on live experiences for The Crystal Maze Live Experience and Tomb Raider.
</p>
<p>
Images show contestants making their way around a maze projected onto the floor, while the series' classic ghosts patrol around them. 
</p>
<p>
"Using a combination of cutting-edge wearable technology, projection mapping and augmented reality, you will be transported into the world of Pac-Man," the event's website promises. "No headsets needed!"
</p>
<p>
Tickets are available now, in 30-minute slots, at Early Bird pricing. Adult tickets are £25. Child tickets are also £25. There's no word yet on how much the experience will cost once Early Bird pricing ends.
</p>
<p>
The experience is played in teams of eight, with two mazes operating concurrently. The full experience lasts 50 minutes, of which you should expect to spend around 30 minutes playing (though presumably less if the ghosts catch you).

<a href="https://www.pacmanlive.co.uk/">Pac-Man Live Experience's website</a> warns this is a "physical activity", and players are "likely to get warm". 
</p>
<p>
"This is an active experience where you'll be moving, dashing and chomping your way to victory," it states. "It's normal to work up a sweat during your adventure, so come prepared."
</p>
<p>
The website's FAQ notes that drinking alcohol is allowed before playing but that anyone deemed too intoxicated would be refused entry "as this is an active, physical experience that requires coordination and awareness for your safety".
</p>
<p>
Fancy dress is permitted, however, "as long as it does not restrict your movement or ability to wear the PAC-Vest".
</p>
<p>
Here's hoping this offering is fun on a level of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-londons-star-trek-inspired-bridge-command-an-interactive-gaming-experience-powered-by-smart-tech-and-role-playing">Star Trek-inspired Bridge Command live experience</a> in London that Jim and I recently visited, and less like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/glasgows-infamous-willy-wonka-experience-lives-on-through-the-sims-4">Glasgow's Willy Wonka experience</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-pssr-upscaler-not-good-4k/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR upscaler still has a long way to go to match NVIDIA DLSS and even AMD FSR 2 in some scenarios, especially in games with low internal resolution like Alan Wake 2, which don't make the upscaler a good fit for 4K resolution in its current state.</p>
<p>Digital Foundry recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DFClipsChannel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compared</a> Alan Wake 2 running on PlayStation 5 Pro in Performance Mode using PSSR and on PC using NVIDIA DLSS at the ultra performance setting and the same internal resolution - 864p. Generally, with PSSR, the image doesn't exactly look like 4K resolution as PSSR fails to bring very small detail to the image, unlike DLSS, which does a much better job at the same internal resolution and the same settings. In addition, the image on PS5 Pro looks very soft and unstable, with visible noise and shimmering even with a static image, which makes it even worse than AMD FSR 2 in this particular scenario.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro upscaler also leaves something to be desired compared to both NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FSR 2 with effects like SSAO, SSR, and volumetrics, as seen in the fog example where it is clearly shimmering with PSSR. As such, the upscaler in its current state is not only inferior to NVIDIA DLSS, but only manages to trade blows with AMD FSR 2, looking better in motion but not as much in other scenarios. Still, looking at what NVIDIA achieved with DLSS since its release, the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution should definitely become much better in the future, as a developer suggested <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-bad-pssr-older-version/">earlier this week.</a></p>
<p><iframe title="Alan Wake 2: PSSR vs DLSS at Matched 864p Base Resolution" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oxPgok_ZRAs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Digital Foundry also examined the new Alan Wake 2 ray tracing features created specifically for the PlayStation 5 Pro version, comparing them to the low RT setting in the PC version, which lacks equivalent settings. Unsurprisingly, the console effects are considerably worse than those on PC, so there's still a long way to go to have a proper ray-traced experience on a console.</p>

            <p>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl released yesterday, and has since seen a strong number of players jumping into The Zone over on Steam.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, its all-time player peak on Valve's platform is 113,587. Meanwhile, it has 71,497 players making their way through the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone at this very moment in time.</p>
<p>These numbers are perhaps not too surprising, given Stalker 2 was one of Steam's most wishlisted titles up until its debut. However, even with a strong wishlist, reviews of the game have pointed out that it has been released with a number of glaring technical issues. These issues are one of the reasons <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wheres-our-stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">Eurogamer's own Stalker 2 review isn't on the site just yet</a>.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-dev-acknowledges-rough-edges-says-its-monitoring-feedback">Stalker 2 team addressed these issues and acknowledged the game "may" have some "rough edges"</a> now that it is out. The studio has assured its players it will address any niggles that arise in the game, as and when it is able.</p><p>Many users have been forgiving of these issues, however, given the road developer GSC has had to take to get Stalker 2 released at all. Since 2022, GSC has delayed Stalker 2 several times due to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-on-hold-ukraine-based-developer-confirms">Russia's invasion of Ukraine</a>. This has seen the studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-developer-reportedly-moving-to-prague-to-finish-game">relocate staff</a> to safely finish the project elsewhere, while others <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-harrowing-update-from-gsc-game-world-the-stalker-2-developer-based-in-ukraine">joined Ukraine's armed forces</a>, and dealt with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-dev-says-russian-hackers-have-leaked-test-build-online-asks-fans-not-to-share">Russian hackers who leaked test builds</a>.</p>
<p>Stalker 2 currency sits with a 'Very Positive' review average on Steam. "Stalker 2 is nothing short of a miracle," reads one user review.</p>

Dragon Age: The Veilguard has launched to "solid" sales in the UK, though has numbers of "nearly 21 percent lower" than <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a>: Rebirth across Europe. 
</p>
<p>
That's according to European sales data analysed by Eurogamer sister site <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/european-video-game-sales-jumped-12-in-october-on-the-back-of-blockbuster-launches-european-monthly-charts">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, which noted that Dragon Age: The Veilguard had been the continent's seventh biggest launch of October, after arriving on the 31st.
</p>
<p>
Over on Steam, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-off-to-solid-start-on-steam">Dragon Age: The Veilguard launched to a peak of 70,414 players</a>, setting a new record for a single-player game published by EA, previously held by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-jedi-survivor">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a>. It's all-time peak is now 89,418, with around 23,000 people playing in the last 24 hours.

<p>
Steam reviews, which require users to own and have played the game, sit with a Mostly Positive rating. But on Metacritic, The Veilguard still sits with Generally Unfavourable rating, in contrast to its average score by critics. 
</p>
<p>
In a statement to Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metacritic-responds-after-dragon-age-the-veilguard-review-bombing">acknowledging the backlash to Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> on its site, a spokesperson for Metacritic parent company Fandom said its site was a "place of belonging for all fans".
</p>
<p>
"We take online trust and safety very seriously across all our sites including Metacritic," the spokesperson said. "Metacritic has a moderation system in place to track violations of our terms of use. Our team reviews each and every report of abuse (including but not limited to racist, sexist, homophobic, insults to other users, etc) and if violations occur, the reviews are removed."

            <p>The publishing rights to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shenmue-3">Shenmue 3</a> have transferred from Ys Net to ININ Games, sparking hope of a future multiplatform release.</p>
<p>Ys Net was founded by former Sega developer and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shenmue">Shenmue</a> creator Yu Suzuki, initially to produce Shenmue 3. At release, the game was exclusive to PS4 and the Epic Games Store (for its first year). Even now, the game is only available on PS4 and PC (Epic and Steam).</p>
<p>Enter ININ Games, then, a German publisher focused on remakes and re-releases of Japanese games.</p>

<p>In fact, ININ Games published the console and PC versions of Suzuki's most recent game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/air-twister-review-yu-suzukis-space-harrier-successor-is-a-compelling-curio-rather-than-a-classic">arcade shooter Air Twister</a>, originally released exclusively on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/apple-arcade">Apple Arcade</a>.</p>
<p>This new publishing deal has therefore raised hope among Shenmue fans it could be released on other platforms, Xbox and Switch specifically.</p>
<p>Indeed, a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E8u6GL-k0QVeUeDzSSJ2RHZrgtKOvtqu/view">press release</a> states ININ Games is "excited to shepherd Shenmue 3 into its next phase" and the two companies will "honour the series' legacy while ensuring its accessibility to even more fans around the world".</p>
<p>Presumably, that includes its availability on multiple platforms.</p>
<p>ININ's releases include the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/wonder-boy-asha-in-monster-world">Wonder Boy: Asha in Monster World</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/space-invaders">Space Invaders</a> Forever, the Taito Milestones series, and Shadow of the Ninja - Reborn.</p>
<p>Shenmue 3 received a mixed response on its release, though our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shenmue-3-review-a-faithful-follow-up-to-an-all-time-classic">Eurogamer review</a> was certainly positive. "Yes, Shenmue 3 can look and play like a Dreamcast game," it reads. "But it looks and plays like a Dreamcast game that's as off-kilter, maddening, magical and majestic as the Shenmue and its sequel, both all-time classics. I think there's good reason to rejoice in that."</p>
<p>Fans, meanwhile, are eager for a fourth game to continue the Shenmue story. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shenmue-fans-rent-times-square-billboard-campaigning-for-fourth-game">one group of fans even rented billboards in Times Square</a> as part of their campaign.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This was obviously not missed by prospective pilots.</p>
<p>The team is now doing what it can to combat this particular issue, and has increased its server capacity (it has not, at this time, said by how much). Some ongoing issues still remain, however, and our own Matt Wales has just informed me the game is still barely playable for him.</p>

<p>"This is not the launch experience we want for our players and want to apologise to the community," the Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 team wrote in a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2537590/discussions/12/4626980689722555684/">Steam update</a>. "We will continue to work around the clock with our partners and will provide updates until the issues are resolved."</p><p>As Matt reported earlier this week, Asobo's latest iteration of Flight Simulator <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-struggles-to-get-off-the-ground-as-players-battle-launch-day-server-woes">got off to a shaky start</a>, with launch day - in an almost exact repeat of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-2020">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020</a>'s release - seeing players experience stalled downloads, lengthy queues, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftFlightSim/comments/1gvkhry/msfs_2024_is_awesome/?rdt=64509">a number of in-game glitches</a>. The developer went on to blame the game's launch woes on "the server responsible for handling data requests [getting] overloaded, causing delays and errors".</p>

<p>"I called my friend, the CEO.

That dwarfs the Steam peak concurrent player count of all the other S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games, including 2007’s S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 also launched on Xbox Series X and S and straight into Game Pass, so its combined peak concurrent player count will be much larger than what we’ve seen on Steam (Microsoft does not make its player numbers public). The expectation is that its player count will continue to grow as S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 heads into its first weekend on sale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also has a ‘very positive’ user review rating on Steam, despite suffering from various bugs detailed in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">IGN’s S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl Review in Progress</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">GSC Game World has told fans it plans to address these bugs with a series of patches. “S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 is a massive game,” the developer said. “We understand that in such a game, there may still be rough edges: we literally haven't released anything of this scale before. We’re absolutely committed to being here, monitoring your feedback, and quickly fixing any issues that need our attention.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In the first days after release, we’ll be working with hotfixes, rolling them out as precisely as possible, but as frequently as we can. Then, we’ll switch to larger updates that include constant improvements.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Free in-game content is also coming to the game. Expect more on that when GSC Game World shares its roadmap later in December. “We have big plans for the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. universe,” the developer added. “In a way, today is both a return and the beginning of a grand new journey.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To help you survive in the Zone, we've got a list of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/stalker-2/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks">Essential Stalker 2 Tips and Tricks</a>, plus a guide on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/stalker-2/Things_to_Do_First_in_Stalker_2">Things to Do First in Stalker 2</a> to help you through the early game, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/stalker-2/Things_Stalker_2_Doesn%27t_Tell_You">Things Stalker 2 Doesn't Tell You</a> - everything we wish we knew before we started playing.

GSC Game World said at the time that the extra two months would give the developers the chance to fix "unexpected anomalies," aka bugs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GSC Game World has also been vocal about the challenges the studio faced getting S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 up to scratch after a mixed reaction to its debut public showing last year. At gamescom 2023, GSC Game World addressed what some had called <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-devs-discuss-imperfect-gamescom-2023-demo-address-downgrade-debate"><u>a “downgrade” sparked by S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2’s then latest gameplay trailer</u></a>. At the time, GSC Game World told IGN it was still targeting a visual quality and level of polish suggested by S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2’s eye-catching 2021 trailer despite <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-stalker-2-developers-say-the-war-in-ukraine-russian-hackers-and-death-threats-wont-break-them"><u>the horrendous conditions suffered by the staff amid the war with Russia</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>It's been a year of change for UK high street stalwart GAME, with impacts felt by the chain's loyal customers and long-term staff alike.</p>
<p>In January, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-retailer-game-to-cease-video-game-trade-ins-staff-say">Eurogamer broke the news that the brand would end its long-running trade-in scheme</a> and the sale of pre-owned games, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-staff-discovered-zero-hours-contracts-move-via-mass-microsoft-teams-calls">some staff were moved onto new zero-hour contracts</a>. This summer, we reported on a flurry of further changes, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-shutting-reward-scheme-next-month-and-you-should-use-any-remaining-credit-while-you-can-still-can">the closure of GAME's membership programme</a> and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-to-end-in-store-pre-orders">ending of in-store pre-orders for new releases</a>, as GAME's technical systems were "upgraded" to those of its parent company, Frasers Group.</p>
<p>This autumn, further effects of that change became apparent, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-acknowledges-website-issues-as-customers-await-missing-pre-orders">GAME customers struggled with online pre-orders</a> and faced confusion over deliveries - most notably including the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> Steelbook. And throughout this year, dozens more GAME shops have closed on the high street, replaced by concessions in other stores such as Sports Direct.</p>
<p>As 2024 comes to a close, we've spoken with shop floor staff, managers and those close to GAME's head office for more detail on where the company is currently, and an explanation for why the issues customers have faced over the past few months have been so persistent. All wished to remain anonymous for the sake of their careers.</p>
<p>Eurogamer contacted Frasers Group for comment on this report, as it has done with its reporting previously, but once again did not receive a response.</p>
<h2>"We have lost 78 percent of GAME head office staff"</h2>
<p>"When Frasers Group took over GAME, they had their own departments that deal with marketing and logistics making sure stuff goes out on time," someone with knowledge of GAME's head office told me. "But then Frasers Group sat down and said 'why do we need two of everything?'"</p><p>This year has seen layoffs and redundancies across the chain, from shop staff who have been moved to zero hours contracts or offered work elsewhere - such as in Sports Direct stores. Others have simply been told they are no longer required, including a widespread loss of area managers over the past couple of months, as well as the bulk of GAME's previous head office staff.</p>
<p>"They made area managers redundant, eliminating some very loyal staff members - up to 20 years with the company in some cases," a current employee said. "This means store managers now talk to and are managed by someone in head office - the same head office which has also had redundancies and been reduced significantly."</p>
<p>"Since the full integration with Fraser group on 1st August we have lost 78 percent of GAME head office staff," another employee said. "It was triple digits and now in the 20s," another person confirmed. "Of course, we are now suffering the effects of that."</p>
<p>On a shopfloor level, staff say Frasers Group sees redundancies as a way to cut GAME's wage bill while simultaneously investing in more staff for Sports Direct - "the brand they really care about, the more profitable business", one staff member told me. Eurogamer is aware of staff who have quit because they did not wish to be moved from a video games specialist store to selling sportswear and trainers, and others who were only offered nominal shifts, such as just three hours on a Saturday, under new zero hours contracts.</p>
<h2>"There's just been stock issues with every new release"</h2>
<p>The loss of head office staff and those experienced in the video games business has affected the delivery of games to stores, multiple staff say. "The Frasers Group ordering and logistics managers are not doing enough to meet release dates," one person said. "They're just ordering stuff whenever." While the launch of Silent Hill 2 made headlines, GAME staff say that, with few exceptions, the majority of game releases are not arriving on time. "There's just been stock issues with every new release," a staff member said. "Anything that hasn't been EA Sports FC or Call of Duty has been late arriving, or not arrived at all. And if we do get it, maybe we get a handful of copies. I've genuinely been sending more people away than serving. We did get a few <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> consoles in, but only half what we were told we would receive."</p><p>"It appears on the surface to all of us that yes, whoever is in the GAME head office now does not understand what a game specialist is," another staff member said. "The last delivery we had at our store, there were no new releases, no games, no accessories - instead we received 136 Zendaya action figures."</p>
<p>Eurogamer recently reported on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/now-games-bungled-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-pre-orders-too">customers waiting days to receive Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 copies they had pre-ordered</a>, after GAME previously claimed customers would be available to "pick up and play" the game with an added Steelbook on the day of release. In reality, the game's launch brought an update from the chain that it was aware some orders were still "processing", with no word on how long the delay would last.</p>
<p>"My store got five copies of COD, one of the biggest launches of the year," one source said. "How can you make money on five copies? New copies cost a lot and you don't make much, £6-£12 depending on how much they're marked up. If you have someone working eight, 10 hours a day, you have to sell a lot to make their wages.</p>
<p>"I recently saw six or seven people come in within about half an hour to buy a game that came out that day, only to be told GAME didn't have it. 'What do you mean, it came out today, I pre-ordered it?' they'd say. We just have to tell them we don't have it in, and I'm really sorry. All of them left without the stuff they'd already paid for, on the day of the release. And you know how people who play video games are. We're compulsive buyers. The number of people who are then like 'well cancel my pre-order, I'll buy it from Smyths'. And then they don't come in ever again."</p>
<h2>"Honestly at this point we would not be surprised"</h2>
<p>The Call of Duty snafu came just weeks after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-pre-order-customers-left-in-limbo-as-metaphor-and-silent-hill-2-launches-loom">GAME shipped Silent Hill 2 copies late</a> and then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-game-pre-order-customers-receive-copies-but-for-wrong-edition">left customers without the game's accompanying Steelbook</a>, which the chain simply said had been delayed, with no apology or further reason given. Eurogamer asked GAME staff what had happened there, and heard a persistent rumour that the person now ordering the chain's stock had been unaware of how to process it properly. </p><p>"When you have Steelbook editions, you order 50 copies of the game. You also order 50 Steelbooks," a person close to GAME's head office said. "I was told the person at Frasers Group who is now in charge for ordering stock for GAME simply didn't click that they wanted the Steelbook too. They just ordered 40k copies of the game but didn't select the Steelbook. It was only when area managers - some that were still there - said 'you just haven't ordered it' [that Frasers Group realised]. And at first they were like 'what do you mean, I have ordered it'. And they said 'no, for special editions you have to order it under special offers'."</p>
<p>"The Silent Hill 2 Steelbook we have heard several different excuses for," another GAME staff member told me. "The one that comes up the most is since the switch over to Fraser Group systems, all pre-order information was lost into the ether on pre-orders made before 1st August. So information on which stores needed allocations was gone. Then they randomly sent more than required to certain stores and some stores like ours who had pre-orders received none. Another store in my area only had 10 pre-orders but received 37 Steelbooks. So all available Steelbooks ended up at a select few stores."</p>
<p>"There are internal rumours," said a third staff member, "honestly at this point we would not be surprised if it were the truth."</p>
<h2>"Frasers Group doesn't know what to send out, where to send it to"</h2>
<p>Eurogamer has repeatedly heard of issues behind the scenes since GAME moved over to Frasers Group systems this summer, and indeed this is the reason behind many of the chain's various schemes, such as GAME Rewards and GAME Wallet, no longer being supported.</p><p>"They don't even have the sales data," one person close to head office said, "because all of the point of sale and stock managing systems have been ripped apart and converted over to the Frasers Group, or the people who knew this stuff are being made redundant. Frasers Group has no background in games, they have no affinity, no passion for it.  They can't look back at 10-15 years of sales history because it's been deleted.</p>
<p>"My local store, they haven't had Switch Pro controllers in for months," they continued. "Personally I got mine from CEX, saved £20. But some people want them from GAME and they're not being sent. There are warehouses up and down the country filled to the brim with stock because the Frasers Group doesn't know what to send out, where to send it to."</p>
<p>Staff say they don't believe anything will change until Frasers Group acknowledges GAME's current issues - and that this doesn't seem likely, as the company's focus on cutting costs and staff continues. Some even believe the only explanation for the changes is a form of self-sabotage, they told me.</p>
<p>"The general feeling amongst staff has been that the poor decisions, the firing of almost all the knowledgeable staff and now the low stock with absolutely zero communication of the issues from head office can only be a deliberate, calculated attempt to run the company into the ground," one employee said. "If it's not deliberate, it's total incompetence or desperate cost-saving measures that will only be detrimental to profits in the long run."</p>
<p>"I don't think they know they're doing a bad job," another said. "They think they're saving loads of money, still doing well, customers are still coming back. Well, they're not listening to anyone."</p>
