		<p>A bit update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> is here, with version 1.2.0 of the hit <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> kart racer making a few positive changes for the game’s balance and progression.</p>
<p>Key features include that the 150cc AI has been made a smidgeon less aggressive, with a common complaint being about how difficult it is to achieve a three star rating in Grand Prix and Knockout Tour races. There’s also a change for online multiplayer course selection, where traditional three-lap races will appear more frequently for players to choose – Nintendo previously reduced their prevalence because everyone was constantly choosing these over the point-to-point races that have become the open world racer’s bread and butter.</p>


<p>For completionists, there’s further good news as the Free Roam map will now indicate that you’ve gathered all of the P switches, ? panels and Peach Medallions by changing the colour of the number.</p>
<p>Aside from that, there’s a little bit of balancing here, a few bug fixes there, as Nintendo continue to finetune the game that millions are now playing.</p>
<p>Here’s the full patch notes for Mario Kart World Version 1.2.0:</p>

<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In the “VS Race” of “Single Player”, added “No COM” to the COM rules.</li>
<li>In the “VS Race” of “Single Player” and “Multiplayer”, added “Mushrooms only” to the item rules.</li>
<li>You can now choose “View Replay” after downloading ghost data in “Time Trials”.</li>
<li>You can now choose whom to watch when spectating in “Knockout Tour” and “Balloon Battle” in “Online Play”, “Wireless Play”, and “LAN Play”.</li>
<li>You can now see the waiting time until the next race or battle starts in “Online Play”, “Wireless Play”, and “LAN Play”.</li>
<li>When using CameraPlay in “Multiplayer” and “Online Play”, the game will now remember the camera cursor position and size until the player closes the game.
<ul>
<li>If you change the number of people playing, the cursor position and size will return to their original settings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On the “Free Roam” map, when you gather all of the P Switches, ? Panels, and Peach Medallions, the colors of the various numbers will now change.</li>
<li>Made COM weaker in everything other than “Battle”.</li>
<li>Made homing of Boomerang weaker.</li>
<li>Decreased the probability of getting a Triple Dash Mushroom in the low position, whenever the item rules in a race are anything other than “Frantic”.</li>
<li>Changed it so order of getting ? Block is higher than in the past, whenever the item rules in a race are anything other than “Frantic”.</li>
<li>Made it so there is a wheel spinning animation if the player presses the A button (acceleration) too early when starting a race while driving.
<ul>

<li>Fixed an issue where the player would get caught on the back of a leaf when using a Bullet Bill in “Acorn Heights”.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the player would not be able to slip through a vase that is placed on the road in “Shy Guy Bazaar”, when using a Boo.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the player would slip through the ceiling in “Dry Bones Burnout”.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the player would sometimes hit a fence when throwing a red shell on the first turn in “Moo Moo Meadows”.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where one part of the effects that take place for the bridge transforming when heading toward “Rainbow Road” did not display.</li>

<figure><a title="Yomawari" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e4627021c6556/yomawari.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: NIS America</em></figcaption></figure><p>We're all on tenterhooks awaiting news of a Nintendo Direct that may never arrive, and publisher NIS has only upped the speculation after it accidentally lifted the lid on a new Switch 2 game before swiftly deleting the announcement post.</p>
<p>As brought to our attention on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/">r/GamingLeaksAndRumours</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1md0f07/nis_announced_a_new_2026_game_for_ns2nswps5pc/">Reddit</a> forum by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Joseki100/">Joseki100</a>, the Japanese NIS Twitter account was briefly home to the reveal of a new farming game in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/yomawari_the_long_night_collection">Yomawari</a> series, accompanied by a 30th July 2026 release date. The post was swiftly removed, but not before more than a handful of people had nabbed a screenshot (you'll find it below, shared to BlueSky by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/knoebel.bsky.social">Knoebel</a>).</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067yovlgt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Running the reveal through Google Translate, this one appears to be called '<strong>The Garden of Honolulu</strong>', and seemingly boasts the same chibi art style as we'd expect from a Yomawari game. Naturally, we won't know anything for sure until the game is revealed properly (as in, for more than a few minutes), but hey, at least the key art looks cute.</p>

<p>Now, as many have pointed out on Reddit, the game does <em>feel</em> like a Direct announcement, one that was potentially scheduled too early and accidentally let slip before anything was made official. There have been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/prominent-youtuber-doubles-down-on-belief-that-a-nintendo-direct-is-due-this-month">rumblings of a July presentation</a> for a good few weeks now, and there are only two days left to fit in that window, so don your tinfoil hat as you will.</p>
<p>Whether it ends up being a sign of an upcoming Direct or not, it looks like we'll have another cute farming sim on our hands next summer. You can never have too many of those, right?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/devil-may-cry-v-devil-trigger-pulled/">Devil May Cry 5</a> was CAPCOM's best-selling game for the first quarter of the current fiscal year, boosted by the Netflix anime show's launch in April.</p>



<p>In its report for Q1 FY2026, the Japanese publisher confirmed that the fifth entry in the series sold 1,782,000 units in April-June 2025, the only game by the publisher to achieve more than 1 million sales in the quarter. Street Fighter 6 is also reported to have been doing well, and thanks to the Nintendo Switch 2 release, the latest entry in the legendary fighting game series has now surpassed five million units.</p>



<p>Looking at the report's Unit Sales ranking, it's impossible not to notice how <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> hasn't performed all that well. The game only sold 477,000 units in the first quarter of the fiscal year, a sheer drop from the high sales reported in its launch window and barely surpassing Monster Hunter Rise. Hopefully, the development team will be able to turn things around and address the issues that have been putting off many players.</p>



<p>Besides confirming Devil May Cry 5's solid performance in the first quarter of the current fiscal year, CAPCOM has also reported significant growth, with net sales increasing by 53.7% year-on-year to ¥45,502 million, operating profit increasing by 90.8% to ¥24,597 million, and profit attributable to owners of the parent increasing by 72.8% to ¥17,238 million. Impressive results, considering the publisher hasn't released any major titles in the quarter.</p>



<p>As a longtime fan of the series, I am happy to learn that Devil May Cry 5 is doing great on the market so many years after its release., showing CAPCOM how there's still a strong interest in Dante, Vergil and Nero's story. Hopefully, it won't take long to see another entry in the series, although longtime series director Hideaki Itsuno leaving CAPCOM<a href="https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-dragons-dogma-series-director-hideaki-itsuno-is-leaving-capcom/"> last year </a>likely impacted whatever the publisher is planning for the series.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pokemon-tcg-pocket-immersive-ho-oh-card-pulled-over-production-issue.1256943/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has pulled a new immersive&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em> card depicting Generation II Pokemon Ho-Oh, citing a "production issue" and pledging to conduct a "broader investigation" into the ways in which it commissions artwork.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/uk/pokemon-news/notice-regarding-new-illustrations" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>website, the company says that the card in question has been "replaced with a temporary placeholder", as has its Lugia counterpart (although the issue doesn't appear to apply to the Lugia card as well).</p>

<p>Just in case you're in the dark on this one, Redditor SPARKisnumber1 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1mc1y2b/leaked_hooh_immersive_art_seemingly_plagiarized/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">posted a Reddit thread</a> yesterday alleging that artwork for an immersive Ho-Oh card for the latest&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>expansion&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wisdom-of-sea-and-sky-expansion" rel="nofollow">Wisdom of Sea and Sky</a>&nbsp;</em>was plagiarized from a 2021 fanart piece.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-ho-oh-lugia.jpg?itok=JwCokNKF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-ho-oh-lugia.jpg?itok=eWp07F3p 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>has pulled a Ho-Oh card over a "production issue" (although not the one shown here; that's just for illustrative purposes).</figcaption></figure><p>According to The Pokemon Company, the artist who drew the card in question, Sie Nanahara, was given "incorrect materials as official documents", so it sounds as though the company gave her the aforementioned fanart and essentially told her to copy or trace it.</p>

<p>However, without further official details, all we can do on that front is speculate. What we do know is that the Ho-Oh card is no longer in the game (although The Pokemon Company stops short of admitting plagiarism, of course), and it will be replaced with new art "as soon as it's ready".</p>

<p>Additionally, the company says it will conduct "a broader investigation to ensure no similar issues exist elsewhere in the game", so if there is any other plagiarised art based on fan work in&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>, it'll likely be found and replaced soon.</p>

<p>Let's hope that's not the case, though. I'm sure The Pokemon Company doesn't want to end up in a similar situation to&nbsp;<em><a href="https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1671927000498597888" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Destiny 2</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-marathon-art-stolen" rel="nofollow">Marathon</a>&nbsp;</em>developer Bungie when it comes to plagiarized art.</p>




<p>We'll have to wait and see how this situation develops, but in the meantime,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>'s new&nbsp;<em>Wisdom of Sea and Sky&nbsp;</em>expansion is out now on both Android and iOS.</p>

                <p>The International Game Developers Association (IGDA) has released a statement condemning the recent crackdown on games featuring adult themes on PC storefronts, calling for "greater transparency and fairness" in the moderation of adult games. The statement comes after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steams-updated-guidelines-allow-banks-to-enforce-standards-on-adult-only-content/1100-6533253/" data-ref-id="1100-6533253">both Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/itch-io-joins-steam-in-recent-push-to-ban-adult-games/1100-6533423/" data-ref-id="1100-6533423">Itch.io caved</a> to pressure from payment processors--themselves targeted by anti-porn lobby group Collective Shout--and abruptly delisted or deindexed a number of games with adult themes.</p><p>While IGDA stresses that it is not defending the circulation of harmful material--which many of the delisted games would certainly qualify as--it says that the current enforcement of these policies is vague and lacks transparency, leading to "delisting and deplatforming legal, consensual, and ethically developed games, especially from LGBTQ+ and marginalized creators."</p><p>"Developers report games being delisted or hidden despite prior approval or longstanding presence on these platforms," the statement says. "The lack of transparency around enforcement criteria, sudden shifts in policy, and an absence of appeal pathways leave creators with no clear path to compliance or recourse."</p><p>"Further reports suggest that recent policy changes are driven in large part by pressure from payment processors like Visa, Mastercard, and others, who may threaten to withhold payment processing services from platforms hosting adult content," IDGA continues. "As a result, financial institutions are now influencing which stories can be told and sold in games, with minimal transparency or public accountability."</p><p>IDGA is calling for clearer guidelines from both platforms and payment processors to "distinguish prohibited content from lawful adult expression," saying it's important that games as an artistic medium can tell stories about "intimacy, pleasure, trauma, or identity."</p><p>IGDA is also calling on platforms to provide clearer communication and specific reasons to affected devs, including "structured appeals and revision pathways" when a game is found to be potentially in breach. It also recommends the formation of advisory panels made up of experts and marginalized creators, as well as regular transparency reports on what enforcement actions have been taken.</p><p>"This issue is not just about adult content. It is about developer rights, artistic freedom, and the sustainability of diverse creative work in games," the statement concludes. IGDA's statement calls on platforms, payment processors, and games industry leaders to come together in meaningful conversation on the issue.</p><p>The organization also provides contact details for Visa and Mastercard, urging people to get in touch with the major payment processors to make their concerns around financial censorship heard--and gamers have been doing just that.

                <p>A big new update for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/">Mario Kart World</a> is here, bringing with it several smaller but likely welcome tweaks, alongside a change sought after by many. In the <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68580/~/how-to-update-mario-kart-world" rel="nofollow ">patch notes</a> for version 1.2.0 of the game, which is available to download now, Nintendo noted that it has "increased the frequency of lap-type courses appearing in the selection when choosing the next course in 'VS Race' and wireless races." This has been a point of frustration for players, as many prefer to do a standard three-lap race as opposed to the new game's intermission races.</p><p dir="ltr">An <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-latest-mario-kart-world-patch-is-driving-players-up-a-wall-in-a-bad-way/1100-6532749/">update last month</a> even made it harder to do three-lap races, so this tweak to make them more common again will probably go down well (as long as the likelihood of getting three-lap races has received a significant boost, anyway). In terms of other notable changes, while playing in free roam, when you manage to get all of the P Switches, ? Panels, and Peach Medallions, the "colors of the various numbers will now change." NPCs are also weaker in every mode apart from Battle, and those of you who rely on Triple Dash Mushrooms in a low position will be disappointed to know that the chance of getting that item has been decreased.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Nintendo has listened to community feedback, and with its latest <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> update has "increased the frequency" of lap-type courses appearing on the selection screen when choosing the next course in both Vs Race and wireless races.</p>
<p>Why is this especially of note? Well, back in June, Nintendo made it more difficult for Mario Kart World racers to play lap-only tracks in the game's multiplayer modes. This led to a certain amount of outcry from players, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-updates-random-online-selection-but-what-fans-really-want-is-a-classic-mode">some even going as far as to say Nintendo had "killed" online versus in Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>"They saw players clamoring for a more traditional online mode and did... the exact opposite of what they wanted," one commentator said at the time.</p>

<p>However, Nintendo evidently heard those cries, and a new update known as Ver. 1.2.0 will now increase the frequency of those more traditional Mario Kart lap-type courses in World.</p>
<p>"NINTENDO LISTENED!!!!!!!" one very enthusiastic <a href="https://x.com/ItzVCiPz/status/1950375720716222751">social media user</a> wrote following the most recent Mario Kart World update. "Did Nintendo just [save] Mario Kart World?!!!" <a href="https://x.com/Rodjr129/status/1950370313616969952">another asked</a>.</p>
<p>Nintendo has also made Mario Kart World's homing Boomerang weaker with this update, and decreased the probability of a racer getting hold of a Triple Dash Mushroom when in a low position, "whenever the item rules in a race are anything other than 'Frantic'."</p>
<p>As well as that, the team has added a Mushrooms only option for VS races, and much more. You can check out the <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68580/~/how-to-update-mario-kart-world">full Mario Kart World patch notes via Nintendo here</a>.</p>
<p>If you are still on the fence about giving Mario Kart World a spin, be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-review">sure to check out Eurogamer's review</a>, where our Tom said how the game "offers neat twists on the classic Mario Kart formula", calling it all "entertaining, snackable, fun".</p>

<p>Elsewhere in Nintendo news, the company recently gave us a look at its Lego Game Boy model, which it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-taps-into-nostalgia-with-1980s-inspired-lego-game-boy-trailer">showed off with an 80s-infused trailer laced with nostalgia</a>.

			<p>Electronic Arts (EA) reported its Q1 2026 financial results a few hours ago, beating expectations with a revenue of $1.3 billion (+4.84% over the estimates and 3% more than last year). This is certainly a great setup for the publisher ahead of highly anticipated game launches, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-release-date-indirectly-confirmed-official-website/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/skate-launches-in-early-access-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">skate</a>, and The Sims through <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sims-next-gen-project-rene-revealed-customization-cross-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project Rene</a>. Will EA join other publishers <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-is-worth-the-80-price-of-admission-says-nintendo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like Nintendo</a> in raising game prices beyond $70, though?</p>



<p>It doesn't seem like that's happening, at least for the time being. In the ensuing Q&amp;A with investors, EA CEO Andrew Wilson said (excerpt from <a href="https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-electronic-arts-q1-2026-beats-eps-estimates-93CH-4158698" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Investing.com</a>):</p>



<p><em>We’re not looking to make any changes on pricing at this stage, but that’s in the construct of we already offer a fairly broad pricing scheme across our various products. When you think about everything from free to play through to our premium products and our deluxe editions, our orientation is always to capture the full spectrum of pricing so that we can serve players in the best way possible and offer them the greatest value. We’ll continue to look at opportunities to deliver great value to our players through various pricing schemes over the course of time, but no dramatic changes planned yet.</em></p>



<p>That's great news for gamers interested in games such as Battlefield 6. It may be a conscious decision on EA's part. The publisher is looking to attract <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-targeting-100-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a big audience</a> for this new installment in the military shooter franchise, after all, and setting a price that many consumers are not comfortable with would be counterproductive.</p>



<p>EA has set the multiplayer reveal <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for tomorrow</a>. Livestreamed events will take place in Los Angeles, Berlin, Paris, and London and kick off at 11:30 AM Pacific Time. We'll have our own Kai Tatsumoto in Los Angeles to play the game and report his first impressions.</p>

        <p>Yes, every Peak headline I write will contain the same pun</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Well, after a prolonged period of teasing, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peak">Peak</a> developers Aggro Crab and Landfall Games look to have bitten the human bullet. Nestled among the notes for the climbing game's latest patch are the words "added cannibalism".</p>
<p>It's not enough that you can mod Peak so that you and your buddies will be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peak-modders-are-delivering-peak-modding-heres-one-that-fills-your-game-with-the-skeletons-of-dead-players">surrounded by the corpses of fallen climbers</a> as you attempt to do an Edmund Hillary. The folks behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/another-crabs-treasure">Another Crab's Treasure</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/content-warning">Content Warning</a> want you to casually nibble on your colleagues on the way.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Fine," the devs wrote on the smouldering remains of the Tweeter as they deployed patch 1.10.a, which allows you to eat people. The notes don't provide any more details as to how this cannibalism works, but I assume you just walk up to a fellow mountaineer, politely ask permission, and then start munching away.</p>
<p>Maybe don't start with the feet. That advice isn't based on any previous experiences I've had in real life, I assure you. Looking <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/aggrocrabgames.bsky.social/post/3luil6jpkzs2a">directly into their eyes</a> as you devour their elbows probably isn't a good idea either.</p> <div>

</span>
</p></div>
<p>Aside from the whole eating people thing, this Peak patch adds in a new setting called "Climbing Extra Field Of View", which lets you control how the FOV changes as you climb, and a push to mute button that I was going to accuse of being a means by which to silence cannibalism objectors until I realised it works like reverse push to talk. Polish and Turkish language support has also arrived.</p>
<p>Fittingly for a cannibalism update, a few food and cooking-related balancing tweaks have been made, including one that stops well-done snacks from being de-buffed if you stash them away for later.</p>
<p>Beyond that, there are a bunch of bug and performance fixes, with the devs having dealt with some wildflowers and temporarily disabled the Napberry plant in a bid to help things run better. They've also had a go at nixing a bug that leads you to take a "significant amount of fall damage when falling a short distance", but it seems their temporary solution has only addressed instances of this that involve "sliding down while holding the wall", so efforts are ongoing.</p>
<p>Digest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3527290/view/498327923676161391">the full notes</a> if you want the rest. Well, unless you're saving space for a buddy you plan to devour on the way to the summit.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peak-cannibalism-is-delivered-by-the-co-op-climbers-latest-patch]]></content:encoded>

However, Wilson said on the call that $80 prices hadn’t been factored into any of EA’s projected earnings through March 2026.

Seventy will get you the very basic version of the game, without a season pass, DLC, etc, and it’ll make sure to let you know what a pedestrian person you are as you choose it. Fortunately, there’s the far smarter option of never pre-ordering anything, because <em>it’s a scam</em>.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-price-70-80-ea-preorder-black-ops-7-1851787292]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>VALORANT, the competitive first-person shooter developed by Riot Games, was recently <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/valorant-patch-notes-11-02/">updated</a> to Unreal Engine 5.3, and, for once, the engine delivers better performance than its predecessor.</p>



<p>A new comparison video shared by MxBenchmarkPC puts the game running in Unreal Engine 4 and in Unreal Engine 5.3 side by side on a system powered by an RTX 4070 GPU, highlighting how the UE5.3 version of the game generally runs at higher framerates. Visuals, on the other hand, are almost identical, with only some marginal improvements, which was expected, considering the developer's statements before the patch went live and the competitive nature of the game. The new version of the game also shows an increase in CPU load, RAM and VRAM usage, which may impact some low-end machines, although no report has been shared regarding any massive performance issue on such systems.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>It's almost unbelievable to see a game powered by Unreal Engine 5 run so smoothly, without its known stuttering issues. Epic is well aware of these issues, and Software Engineer Ari Arnbjörnsson recently hosted a talk aptly named T<a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-declares-great-hitch-hunt-rid-games-stutters/">he Great Hitch Hunt</a> during Unreal Fest 2025, highlighting the causes of the widespread stuttering issues and providing some advice to developers to minimize the issues.</p>



<p>One of the latest games powered by Unreal Engine 5 is the soulslike WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers. Although far from being one of the UE5 games with the worst performance to date, the experience crafted by Leenzee Games still leaves something to be desired from a technical standpoint, as even a powerful GPU like my RTX 4080 needed Frame Generation to hit 60 frames per second at 4K resolution. You can learn more about these performance issues, which the development studios is currently working to improve, by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wuchang-fallen-feathers-unleash-the-madness/">review.</a></p>

			<p>A new Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 patch has gone live today, introducing many improvements and new features, including Frame Generation support on PC.</p>



<p>One of the biggest additions featured in the v1.4.0 patch is the introduction of NVIDIA DLSS and Intel XeSS Frame Generation and Low Latency support, which allow users with compatible GPUs to enjoy smoother gameplay with lower input lag. The new patch also packs plenty of quality of life improvements, including a Battle Retry option allowing players to quickly retry after losing a battle, a Lumina Cost Display which clearly displays the Lumina cost of each ability in the Pictos menu, an Autoplay dialogue option outside cutscenes, and separate volume sliders to adjust music volume for exploration and combat.</p>



<p>The new Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 patch also features some balance changes, a few bug fixes and some visual polish improvements across multiple areas. You can learn more about these fixes by checking out the full patch notes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1903340/view/499454457318211676?l=english">here.</a></p>



<p>Even without the welcome improvements above, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was a more than worthy RPG to experience at launch, thanks to its great character and story and an involving turn-based combat system.

<p>The update was orginally set to go out today, July 30th, but will now go out tomorrow, July 31st. The tsunami warning that's led developers FromSoftware to have to switch up their plans is one of many consequences of a massive earthquake off the coast of Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula.</p>

Addressing the situation, The Pokémon Company said it "deeply apologize[d] for any inconvenience" and was now conducting a review of all other cards, to ensure no other designs were at fault.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"To our community, thank you for your continued support and passion for Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket," The Pokémon Company <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/notice-regarding-new-illustrations" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a>. "We want to share an important update regarding the upcoming expansion, Wisdom of Sea and Sky. It has come to our attention that there was a production issue regarding the illustration of Ho-Oh featured in the immersive card artwork for Ho-Oh EX (3-Star) and Lugia EX (3-Star).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"After internal review, we discovered that the card production team provided incorrect materials as official documents to the illustrator commissioned to create these cards.

It doesn't look great.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Holy cow guys I can’t believe I opened this in Pokemon TCG pocket 🤯 <a href="https://t.co/3st3ILATSW" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/3st3ILATSW</a></p>— Poli (@ProfPoliwag) <a href="https://twitter.com/ProfPoliwag/status/1950448109042962439?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 30, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Yesterday's controversy, which came after the Wisdom of Sea and Sky's card designs were datamined and examined online, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-claims-pokmon-tcg-pocket-features-a-design-traced-from-fan-art-creators-point-out-that-pokmons-legal-terms-likely-allow-the-company-to-monetise-any-fan-made-content-it-wants">sparked a wider discussion over the Pokémon's legal terms for fanart</a> — which appear to suggest the company could, if it wanted, do whatever it liked with fan-made designs. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's action strongly suggests that while The Pokémon Company may legally be able to argue it can use fan designs, it in practice does not want to typically do so, or leave fans thinking it now sees fanart as fair game for its commercial use.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"To all our players who have been looking forward to this expansion, and to the talented illustrators who bring the Pokémon world to life, we deeply apologize for any inconvenience this has caused," The Pokémon Company continued. "We take this matter very seriously and are committed to strengthening our quality control processes to prevent this from happening again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Thank you for your understanding, patience, and continued support of Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket.

"From that point on, the studio’s management and the working conditions of its employees were brought under the direct control of the group.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Following our acquisition, and after two years of continued development adapting to tight time and resource constraints, the Aheartfulofgames team delivered </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The project was completed on schedule and without production issues. After launching in October 2024, the game met the commercial expectations set by Outright."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Following the release of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, however, the team claims they were essentially put out to pasture by their parent company. They allege that Outright, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.emkcapital.com/news/emk-acquires-majority-stake-in-outright-games-ltd">which is backed by UK-based private equity firm EMK Capital</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, neglected to provide work to the studio to justify an impending closure.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-igda-calls-wave-of-adult-game-delistings-a-form-of-creative-suppression-" target="_self" data-discover="true">The IGDA calls wave of adult game delistings a form of 'creative suppression'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They say the studio was quickly ostracised after Outright appointed Robin Flodin as its new CEO in October 2024—a move they claim "marked a turning point in company management, leading to a shift in strategic priorities that, from our perspective, signalled a consistent lack of interest and minimal engagement from Outright regarding its responsibilities to our studio."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It became increasingly clear to teams across the group that the new leadership was prioritizing low-cost, fast-turnaround projects, a strategy which tends to lead to lower quality outputs and a deterioration in working conditions," they add.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Aheartfulofgames claims it repeatedly attempted to spin up projects over the past 12 months, but that Outright quashed those plans without explanation—even when pitches were "positively received" by prospective licensors. In addition, the team alleges that Outright prevented them from assisting the company's other internal studios with their projects, with the firm instead choosing to outsource that work.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-details-how-uk-online-safety-act-will-impact-xbox-players" target="_self" data-discover="true">Microsoft details how UK Online Safety Act will impact Xbox players</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We received requests from Outright UK to support a project being developed by their internal team. Despite reportedly having outsourcing contractors involved, the project seemed to be falling short of expectations. To our knowledge, this internal team remains active and fully staffed," continues the statement.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Over the course of these months, the frequency and scope of internal communications from Outright to Aheartfulofgames progressively diminished, culminating in May 2025, when our studio was explicitly excluded from a corporate group meeting."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;They thought they were going to reap a lot more than they are reaping now&quot;">"They thought they were going to reap a lot more than they are reaping now"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Aheartfulofgames says Outright justified the closure on the grounds of "productive causes," but reiterates its claim that it was actively prevented from taking on new projects. It adds that Outright continues to produce titles at a steady pace, but has instead turned to working with outsourcing studios such as Casual Brothers, Ardmand Games, 3DClouds, and PHL Collective instead of providing its internal teams with work.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Outright chose to outsource development of these projects to third parties while our team remained available, working and receiving salaries, a decision for which no economic rationale has been provided," it adds.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sony-files-lawsuit-against-tencent-for-allegedly-cloning-horizon-series" target="_self" data-discover="true">Sony files lawsuit against Tencent for allegedly cloning Horizon series</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Our operational capacity would have allowed us to take on one of these projects in parallel with our ongoing work, thereby making better use of resources while continuing to develop strategic and creative proposals aimed at securing more ambitious opportunities for Outright. Although we received, and proactively submitted several initial licence pitches, as mentioned above, none were formalised by Outright."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking to Game Developer about the situation, three current Aheartfulofgames employees—who chose to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal—explain Outright's acquisition of the studio initially seemed like a blessing. They say the company immediately pledged to expand the dev team—and quickly made good on that promise—while also outlining a plan to have Aheartfulofgames progressively work on bigger and more expansive licensed titles.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One source explains the deal appeared to provide the team with "safety and stability" in the wake of the pandemic, and admits there was plenty of optimism following the move.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"They came to us with promises, not only of bigger and better licenses, but also growth within the company. They made us believe they had a plan," adds another source. "They gave our managers some sense of calm after three years of very difficult times—you know, after spending years trying to close deals during the pandemic."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On paper, then, the deal was simple: Outright would keep the work flowing in Aheartfulofgames' direction, and the Spanish studio would continue to produce licensed titles that would enable its parent company to bolster its reputation and footprint.&nbsp; The reality, it seems, failed to deliver on that promise.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Following the appointment of Flodin as CEO last year, one source explains the situation became increasingly "unstable" with pitches being turned down without reason. The sense, according to those we spoke with, is that Outright wanted to move in a new strategic direction towards cheaper projects and licenses. "That isn't what they promised to us," says one source. "So suddenly we became a liability."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They say the decision to shutter Aheartfulofgames was verbally communicated during an internal meeting in July. At the time of writing, the studio is slated to be shuttered in mid-August.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Employees are now fighting for their livelihoods. All three sources explain they have been in negotiations with Outright in a bid to find an alternative route forward. They say they have tabled a number of proposals including a relocation plan and partial layoffs, all of which have been rejected by Outright. They claim their parent company isn't interested in negotiating about anything other than the severance packages that will ultimately result in 28 people losing their jobs.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It feels like they have their mind set on closing us at any cost," says one source. "They tell us we are just not competitive enough, but we were being super competitive when we finished </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—and suddenly, the moment we stopped working on that project, we became uncompetitive," they continue. "We couldn't be afforded another project. Not small projects or large projects. Suddenly no project fits our [studio] size."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One source says it feels as if the decision to shutter Aheartfulofgames was made by looking at numbers on an Excel sheet in a bid to figure out how to make even more money for management and investors.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"In the end, to them, it's just about money. About getting more profit. I think it's bad for the industry in general and our creative world that this is happening all over the world," they add.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Emotionally, it has taken a huge toll. We have a really good team. We were working in really good conditions. Our studio managers were always trying to be fair [...] and it's really sad to lose something that was working well. Especially because we were trying to make games that weren't just about making money, but also about doing creative things and giving people in the team the ability to take part in creative decisions. For all of us it has been hard to lose that."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the end, one source explains the closure appears to be a cynical decision made to appease investors who perhaps expected to prosper more off the back of a perceived game industry gold rush.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"They thought they were going to reap a lot more than they are reaping now," they say. "And they have made it clear this isn't an economic decision, but the economic context provides them an explanation for what they are doing—but they are not losing money, they're gaining less."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer has reached out to Outright Games for comment.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

However, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gzmkjjj03o&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gzmkjjj03o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we are in the remarkably fortunate situation</a></span> where—so far at least—there has been no loss of life, nor any significant reports of harm. It’s still possible that large waves could affect a huge number of countries, as far afield as China, New Zealand and Peru, and 13-foot waves have affected parts of Russia. However, even tsunamis have, so far, been minor. Despite this, evacuations are vital, with reports that waves <em>could</em> reach 10 feet in Japan. As such, <em>Elden Ring</em> developers FromSoftware have left their offices and canceled July 31's planned release of Patch 1.02.</p><p>“Due to the tsunami warning following the earthquake near the Kamchatka Peninsula,” reads FromSoft’s statement, “we have decided to postpone the distribution of the ‘<em>ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN</em>’ Patch 1.02, which was scheduled for today to tomorrow, July 31 (Thursday) after 10:00CEST / 1:00 PDT.”</p><p>Duo Mode was due to add the ability to play <em>Nightreign</em> in pairs, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-mode-option-patch-1-02-ps5-1851786981&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-mode-option-patch-1-02-ps5-1851786981">a feature fans have been begging for since the game’s release</a></span>. The game was launched designed to be played in groups of three, which is an unusual group size for multiplayer gaming, and clearly far harder to pull together than just partnering up. The lack of a two-player mode felt even more strange, though, given you could also play solo. Two days after the game came out, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-mod-seamless-coop-pc-1851783200&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-mod-seamless-coop-pc-1851783200">a modder created an unofficial two-player option</a></span>, demonstrating it was certainly possible. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-director-says-duos-were-kind-of-overlooked-and-neglected-as-main-focus-was-on-3-players&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-director-says-duos-were-kind-of-overlooked-and-neglected-as-main-focus-was-on-3-players" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FromSoftware said at the time</a></span> that not including duos was rather oddly “overlooked during development,” and that the game had only been balanced for three-player play.

            <p>The team at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> - that is to say, the wildly popular trading card mobile game - has released a statement apologising to its community following a report that highlighted a piece of fan artwork which had been copied to create a card, saying it was provided "incorrect reference materials".</p>
<p>Earlier this week, a Pokémon fan artist posted some comparison images of their own artwork of Legendary bird Ho-Oh next to an image of an upcoming card from Pokémon TCG Pocket's 2025 expansion, which had been datamined. This datamined card showed the Pokémon in the same pose as the fan artwork, with others surmising that the image had been traced (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-claims-pokmon-tcg-pocket-features-a-design-traced-from-fan-art-creators-point-out-that-pokmons-legal-terms-likely-allow-the-company-to-monetise-any-fan-made-content-it-wants">IGN</a>).</p><p>

You can see the two images below, with the fan art on the right:

<p>Now, the Pokémon TCG Pocket team has released a statement about its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-trading-card-pocket-gets-new-johto-themed-packs-alongside-trading-update">upcoming expansion Wisdom of Sea and Sky</a>, writing:</p>
<p>"It has come to our attention that there was a production issue regarding the illusion of Ho-Oh featured in the immersive card artwork for Ho-Oh EX (3-star) and Lagia EX (3-star).</p>
<p>"After internal review, we discovered that the card production team provided incorrect reference materials as official documents to the illustrator commissioned to create these cards."</p>

<p>As such, the developer has said it will now replace these cards with placeholders for the time being, while it works to provide new artwork as soon as it is able. It will also conduct further investigations "to ensure no similar issues" are present elsewhere within the game itself.</p>
<p>"To all our players who have been looking forward to this expansion, and to the talented illustrators who bring the Pokémon world to life, we deeply apologise for any inconvenience this has caused," the developer wrote. "We take this matter very seriously and are committed to strengthening our quality control process to prevent this from happening again."</p>
<p>The Pokémon TCG Pocket developer closed by thanking its community for their understanding and patience, as well as the continued support. "We remain dedicated to delivering an experience that you can enjoy," it said.</p>

            <p>There are some mods that you need to read up on before you understand why you might want to give them a whirl. There are some mods with which that process can be accomplished via a single GIF. A new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a> work that makes it possible to hilariously reduce the contents of Cyrodiil's cities to chunks of flying rubble just by slapping buildings with spells is firmly in the latter camp.</p>
<p>Before you get too worried about the karmic balance of the modding wizard powerful enough to make this sort of wanton destruction possible, it's worth bearing in mind that they've previously given players <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-gets-fallout-4-style-building-from-modder-who-wants-to-collaborate-on-a-full-settlement-system">the ability to build new homes</a> any displaced citizens could probably move into.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Prolific Oblivimaster tweaker MadAborModding, whom <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-modder-delivering-fallout-4-style-settlement-building-reckons-the-game-could-still-usher-in-a-modding-renaissance">we interviewed about his work earlier this month</a>, has clearly been busy since that point. His latest mod, as its name on Nexus Mods yells in all caps, lets you <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4943?tab=description">DESTROY BUILDINGS</a>. I usually like text to keep the hollering to a minimum, but honestly I think he's earned it here.</p>
<p>As the GIFs on the mod page and the below showcase video from Reddit show off, the modder's developed a means of getting Oblivion Remastered's buildings to hilariously explode into bits when you fire spells at them. It's glorious. Well, unless you're an NPC living in some stone tower that's just been uprooted and sent spinning into the sky.</p>
<p>"This is only possible because of Unreal, the creation engine in any other Bethesda game wouldn't let you do this," the building batterer wrote in the thread below the video, "But in unreal, all you gotta do is flip a few true/false flags."</p> 
<p>Don't worry, though, the effects of any impromptu demolition you get up to aren't permanent, with everything resetting to normal when you next hit a loading screen. On one hand, that's maybe disappointing if you're eyeing up a playthrough in which, to paraphrase Walter White, you are the Oblivion Crisis. Though, given how much lobbing staircases into the stratosphere would inconvenience the story, I reckon MadAborModding's right to pitch this as temporary fun.</p>
<p>That said, he sounds like he's far from done working on it. Future plans include giving buildings their own health stats and a visible health bar, as well as letting you hack chunks out of them with non-magical attacks. That'd bring the mod closer to a full-blown house fighting experience, something I didn't know I wanted in Oblivion, but now definitely do.</p>
<p>The option to limit the destruction to specific areas of the game is also in the works. As of right now, the mod comes with its own optional tweaking menu thanks to <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4810">Mad Mod Config Menu</a>, in case you fancy messing with the explosion radius or enabling anti-gravity.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving the mod a go, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/32">UE4SS</a> is a hard requirement. I wish your hardware the best in coping with the amount of fireplaces that're about to be whizzing around the Imperial province.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-mod-delivers-tamrielic-teardown-by-letting-you-blow-buildings-to-bits-with-plans-for-full-blown-house-fighting]]></content:encoded>

As a result, both cards have been replaced with a temporary placeholder that the team is actively working to replace with new artwork as soon as it’s ready.”</p><p>It sounds like well-loved illustrator Sie Nanahara was provided references either by Creatures Inc (the team behind <em>PTCG</em> art) or DeNA (the developers of this app) that included fan-made art, rather than previous official Pokémon artworks. This explanation lifts responsibility from the artist which—as we’d suggested previously—would have been a very surprising move by a very established creator. </p><p>“Immersive cards” are the animated collectibles that appear in every set of the digital card game. They are one of the top selling-points of the app, offering magical cards that play out beautiful animated sequences when clicked on.

However, given the Ho-Oh and Lugia cards are animated, these will take vastly longer to create, often requiring enormous artworks for the camera to pan around, or complex 3D animations.

When “played” it just shows a black rectangle.</p><p>So far, I’ve not seen any accusations made regarding the Lugia immersive card, although suspect that it’s been removed at the same time as a precaution. While no blame is being placed on the artist, it makes sense to be concerned that the same issues could have arisen for both cards given they came from the same creator.</p><p>The Chinese artist whose work was copied has <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/lanjiujiu/status/1950436692789514610&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/lanjiujiu/status/1950436692789514610" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted a statement</a></span> regarding the issue as well, albeit an ambiguous one, referring to a past commission but not who commissioned the work. “I solely delivered commissioned 2D artwork,” he says in his own translation, “with no involvement in subsequent model production, sales, or profit sharing.

            <p>Despite reports to the contrary, it doesn't look like Battlefield 6 will cost $80 after all, as publisher EA is shunning the move to that kind of pricing for its games, at least for the time being.</p>
<p>Following EA's <a href="https://ir.ea.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx">latest financial report</a>, CEO Andrew Wilson took part in an earnings call with investors, where the company exec was asked about other publishers releasing $80 games, like Nintendo did with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>"We're not looking to make any changes on pricing at this stage," Wilson replied, adding EA already offers "a fairly broad pricing scheme across our various products" (transcribed by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-ceo-says-no-80-games-for-now-were-not-looking-to-make-any-changes-at-this-stage">IGN</a>).</p>
<p>Continuing, Wilson said: "When you think about everything from free-to-play through to our premium products and deluxe editions, our orientation is always to capture the full spectrum of pricing so that we can serve players in the best way possible and offer them the greatest value.</p>
<p>"We'll continue to look at opportunities to deliver great value to our players through various pricing schemes over the course of time, but no dramatic changes planned yet."</p>
<p>During the same call, it was confirmed that EA had not factored in any price changes to its  current fiscal year earnings guidance, meaning games releasing prior to March 2026 aren't expected to retail for $80. That includes Battlefield 6, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-details-including-an-october-release-date-leak-ahead-of-official-reveal">which was recently suggested to be releasing with an $80 price tag attached</a>.</p>
<p>The conversation around game pricing has been more prevalent in recent times. Earlier this year, Gearbox's Randy Pitchford made waves when he suggested that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/80-for-borderlands-4-too-costly-randy-pitchford-says-if-youre-a-real-fan-youll-find-a-way-to-make-it-happen">if you were a true fan you would purchase Borderlands 4 whatever the price may be</a>. This comment was met with backlash, so the Gearbox exec then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4s-randy-pitchford-seeks-to-justify-80-real-fans-comment">attempted to justify his comments with a video</a> shared on social media. Here, he admitted he did not know how much Borderlands 4 would cost. More recently, we found out Borderlands 4 will actually sell for $70, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/randy-pitchford-stoked-about-borderlands-4s-70-price-point-confirms-tonne-of-dlc-on-the-way">Pitchford is "stoked" about that</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, just last week, Microsoft walked back on its previous decision to hike the price of its new first-party Xbox games up to $80 this 'holiday season', saying <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-bullishly-hiking-xbox-games-to-80-microsoft-confirms-u-turn-starting-with-the-outer-worlds-2">it's sticking to a lower price point "in line with current market conditions"</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-may-not-be-80-after-all-as-ea-shuns-higher-priced-games-for-now]]></content:encoded>
