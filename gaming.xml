			<p>2024 was a year to remember for roleplaying games, and 2025 is looking to be no different. Whether you are looking into getting into a new series featuring a brand-new world, returning to a well-known universe, experiencing a well-known universe from another perspective, or enjoying a classic game with improved visuals and new quality-of-life features, the next 12 months will not fail to provide exactly what you are looking for.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Most Anticipated Games of 2025: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-fighting-games-of-2025-off-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-action-games-of-2025-excellence-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Action</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-indie-games-of-2025-retro-and-vibrancy/">Indie</a></em></p>
<h2>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II (February 4 - PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Kingdom-Come-Deliverance-2.png"></a></figure>

<p>The original Kingdom Come: Deliverance was almost a bolt from the blue. Developed by a relatively small team, the game set in 15th-century Bohemia, starring the young blacksmith apprentice Henry from Skalitz, is still to this day one of the most immersive roleplaying games ever released. Very few games managed to make players feel like they were indeed living in a medieval European kingdom as much as the game developed by Warhorse Studios did.</p>
<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II will not revolutionize the formula of its predecessor, but this should be fine for the vast majority of fans, as the second entry in the series will turn every feature of its predecessor up to eleven, offering a lot more different ways to complete quests, better NPCs reactions to Henry's actions, an improved combat system and much more. With a game world twice as large as that of its predecessor, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II will provide plenty of content for players to get lost once again in 15th-century Bohemia and help Henry better shape his future and his destiny. Read our first impressions from a press preview <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Avowed (February 18 - PC, Xbox Series X|S)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Avowed_Wallpaper_3840x2160-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Obsidian Entertainment is a developer that needs no introduction, as it is the studio behind some of the best RPGs ever released, including the celebrated classics Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II, Fallout: New Vegas, and the Pillars of Eternity series, which, together with a few other games, rejuvenated the top-down roleplaying games that were seemingly being left behind in the early 2010s.</p>
<p>Instead of releasing a third entry in the series, Obsidian decided to expand the world of Pillars of Eternity with Avowed, a project that was pitched as the studio's take on the Skyrim formula but eventually became more in line with what the studio always offered: a more focused game with a smaller scope and heavier emphasis on story and characters. While the world may be smaller compared to other roleplaying games, Avowed will still offer plenty of opportunities to have fun as the player investigates the Dream Scourge plague that is scouring the Living Lands as an envoy of the Aedyr Empire, thanks to multiple recruitable companions, a combat system that will incentivize combining magic spells with weapon attacks, plenty of skills to learn and tons of different locations to explore. Our first hands-on with the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-hands-on-preview-eora-from-a-whole-new-perspective/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very promising</a>.</p>
<h2>Elden Ring Nightreign (2025 - PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ELDENRING_NIGHTREIGN_Key_Art-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>By all accounts, Elden Ring was a massive success for FromSoftware. The open-world take on the Souls series formula captivated fans all over the world, and the excellent Shadow of the Erdtree expansion didn't sate their hunger for more adventures in The Lands Between. No one, however, would have thought that their next journey to those lands would be with Elden Ring Nightreign.</p>
<p>The new entry in the series will be a slightly different game than its predecessor, twisting its hardcore action roleplaying game formula with co-op mechanics and procedurally generated locations where up to three players will have to survive for three days and prepare for a massive boss battle while the playable area gets shrunk every time a minor boss is defeated. This battle royale-meets-co-op-meets-roguelite-meets-Monster Hunter experience sounds incredibly exciting on paper, and knowing FromSoftware, there's no doubt that they will be more than up to the challenge of expanding the experience of the original game in a rather unexpected way.</p>
<h2>Fable (2025 - PC, Xbox Series X|S)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/fable_logo_trailer-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Despite having been announced a while back, there isn't a lot we know about Fable, the next entry in the series since the Kinect game Fable: The Journey, released in 2012. Still, the game is among the most anticipated role-playing games <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-new-gorgeous-trailer-finally-shows-actual-gameplay-launches-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launching this year</a> for the simple reason that it is more Fable!</p>
<p>From the little we have seen so far, Playground Games will not deviate much from the formula seen in the first three entries in the series developed by the now-defunct Lionhead Studios, as the game will still be set in the luscious fantasy world of Albion, where nature and magic live in perfect harmony, where people talk with an unmistakable Shakespearean flourish, and where villains constantly attempt to disrupt peace and order to further their own nefarious ends. As the series has always been about becoming the hero, it will be very interesting to see how the morality system will return and if the player can decide to become not the paladin Albion needs, but a dark knight that still achieves salvation, but with less savory methods. A lot more will inevitably revealed throughout 2025, and we'll make sure to keep you informed of all the latest info.</p>
<h2>Monster Hunter Wilds (February 28 - PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Monster-Hunter-Wilds-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Monster Hunter Rise is among the most successful entries in the series, but those who got into CAPCOM's franchise with Monster Hunter World were looking for something more than the condensed, combat-centered experience the game offered. These hunters will get what they are looking for this year with the biggest entry in the series to date.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is not looking to reinvent the wheel in any way, but if the open beta is any indication, the game will offer a little bit for every sort of player, no matter what they are looking for. With huge open-world maps to explore teeming with life and danger, including different weather conditions that can massively affect hunts, massive monsters to take down using any of the 14 weapon types available, a huge number of craftable gear coming with skills to create unique builds, and new gameplay mechanics, which include the ability to bring two weapons and Focus Mode that will allow players to better target monster parts to disable certain attacks and obtain specific materials no matter the weapon they are using, Monster Hunter Wilds is setting out to be yet another landmark release in a series whose popularity is set to skyrocket once again, as we've glimpsed in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gamescom-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preview</a>.</p>

<hr><h2>Third Place -&nbsp;Destiny 2</h2>



<p>Developer: Bungie | Release Date: September 6th, 2017</p>

<p>Written by Tyler Chancey</p>

<p><em>Destiny 2</em> has reached a new era. After ten years of being the series that popularized the live service shooter, its current state is less a complete fall and more of a denouement. The main story regarding The Witness has been resolved, but there are still lingering story threads being set up by Bungie's team. Threads that are potentially less cosmic in scope.</p>

<p>Players have been given the most tools to explore the combat sandbox to date. Weapons with the most exotic support mods. Prismatic subclasses allowing for greater player expression. It is a gameplay loop the fanbase has become intimately familiar with, for better or for worse.</p>

<p>The state of the game is a far cry from where it started. But this year, Bungie can officially say that their decade-long story came to its conclusion</p>

<h2>Second Place - Fortnite</h2>



<p>Developer: Epic Games | Release Date: September 26th, 2017</p>

<p>Written by Blair Bishop</p>

<p>Three things in life are certain: Death, taxes, and <em>Fortnite</em>. As Epic continues to embellish and reinforce the creative aspects of what’s possible inside their game, what’s spawned is now a nearly-endless cavalcade of combat game modes, quirky reenactions of multiplayer hits like <em>Phasmophobia </em>and <em>Battlefield</em>, and it’s breathtaking to watch.</p>

<p>That isn’t to detract from its primetime Battle Royale mode, however, which continues to shake up and modify the formula in many different ways. With the re-introduction of <em>Fortnite</em>’s OG island towards the end of the year, it’s clear that Epic are looking to recognize the history of the game that brought them to the peak, and has continued to since 2017.</p>

<h2>Winner - Helldivers 2</h2>



<p>Developer: Arrowhead Game Studios | Release Date: February 8th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Dan Rockwood</p>

<p>When <em>Helldivers 2</em> dropped last February, it offered an impressive array of gameplay options with two battle passes (Warbonds), countless ship and stratagem options, and a wide assortment of maps on two fronts with a variety of mission objectives. Now, nearly a year later, the game has expanded multiple times, cementing its legacy from just another live service game to one of the most iconic titles of 2024.</p>

<p>Though there were issues along the way, like nerfing fire weaponry immediately ahead of releasing the Freedom's Flame Warbond, or requiring Steam players to create and link a PlayStation Network account, these have been largely rectified through patches, indicating to players that Arrowhead Game Studios is listening to their needs.</p>

<p>Today,<em> Helldivers 2</em> offers many more options for new and returning players. There's now a whole new enemy added to the frontlines: the Illuminate alien race, new planets to fight on, vehicles to commandeer, and multiple new warbonds that offer unlockable weapons, armor, and more. With so many changes that helped improve the game throughout 2024, it's exciting to see what the next year will bring.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fortune's Run Development Halted as Developer Sentenced to Prison]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortunes-run-developer-prison</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortunes-run-development-halted-as-developer-sentenced-to-prison.1082796/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortunes-run-developer-prison<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Development on sci-fi immersive sim FPS&nbsp;<em>Fortune's Run&nbsp;</em>is being halted, and it's because the developer has been sentenced to three years in prison. Yes, you read that right.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1692240/view/532087801681805318" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news update on Steam</a>, developer Dizzie, who is now "the sole developer" of&nbsp;<em>Fortune's Run</em>, shares that they've been "sentenced to prison for the next three years", describing the sentencing as "a long story".</p>

<p>According to Dizzie, they've been going through the legal process for their case all the time that they've been working on&nbsp;<em>Fortune's Run</em>. They say that they were "a very violent person" and that they "hurt a lot of people in [their life]".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortunes-run-development-stopped-dev-prison-punch.jpg?itok=MBQpS2KX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortunes-run-development-stopped-dev-prison-punch.jpg?itok=beU8Mmhl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Development on&nbsp;<em>Fortune's Run&nbsp;</em>has been halted for the foreseeable future.</figcaption></figure><p>Cryptically, Dizzie says that "the other developer" on&nbsp;<em>Fortune's Run&nbsp;</em>has left the project, stating that after she recovered from "botched surgery", she decided she no longer wanted to work as a game developer.</p>

<p>Dizzie says that their case doesn't relate to&nbsp;<em>Fortune's Run</em>'s other developer, Arachne, who is - or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1692240/view/4234028300480496465" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">was, at one point</a> - Dizzie's wife. They also say that their crime is not a "sex crime", but that they're not going to go into specific charges, simply stating that what they did was "wrong".</p>

<p>Before Dizzie's incarceration, however, they have released a major update for&nbsp;<em>Fortune's Run&nbsp;</em>that contains plenty of new story content and gameplay changes. It will invalidate previous save files, though, so you'll have to start a new game if you want to experience it.</p>

<p>You can read the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1692240/view/532087801681805320" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">patch notes for that update right here</a>. Naturally, owing to Dizzie's prison sentence, it may be quite a while before another update for the game is released.</p>




<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Fortune's Run&nbsp;</em>is, it's an immersive sim-style shooter inspired by the likes of&nbsp;<em>Deus Ex&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>EYE: Divine Cybermancy</em>. It also features what the devs call "the campy tone of space operas and titles like&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid</em>".</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Fortune's Run&nbsp;</em>right now on PC <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1692240/Fortunes_Run/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">via Steam Early Access</a>. Again, though, it's probably going to be quite some time before any more content is added to the game, so bear that in mind before you make a purchase.</p>

<p>A Nintendo Switch 2 announcement feels imminent if rumors and leaks are to be believed. Every passing day feels like an excruciating wait for Nintendo fans, so we’ve collated every possible detail including the latest rumors, leaks, and Switch 2 speculation—including a potential Nintendo Direct in January 2025.</p>



<p>March 3, 2017, was a landmark day in the annals of gaming history. It was the official launch of the Nintendo Switch. A money-making phenomenon that has allegedly sold close to (if not more than) <strong>150 million units</strong>. The OG Switch has printed money for Nintendo, and after eight years, it’s about time we got its successor—the long-awaited <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/we-desperately-need-the-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 in 2025</a>.</p>



<p>Rumors and gossip have circulated for months about when its announcement could be. 2025 has picked up where 2024 left off, only, the speculation has intensified one millionfold. The Nintendo Switch 2’s announcement feels closer than ever, and evidence supports this.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-nintendo-switch-2-announcement-date">Do we Know the Nintendo Switch 2 Announcement Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>What a line-up. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No official date has been officially or unofficially announced yet regarding the Nintendo Switch 2 announcement, but it’s believed it could arrive on Thursday, January 16.</strong></p>



<p>Nintendo hasn’t confirmed the existence of the console, but it has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-acknowledges-recent-nintendo-switch-2-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acknowledged the Switch 2 leaks</a>. The company’s response was in retaliation to alleged <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-joy-cons-have-seemingly-surfaced-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Cons surfacing</a>. </p>



<p>Nintendo has previously said the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 will be announced before April 2025</a>. Everything feels like it’s dovetailing nicely, and the rumors are only the beginning.</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-direct-january-2025-rumors-amp-leaks">Nintendo Direct January 2025 Rumors &amp; Leaks</h2>



<p><strong>A January 2025 Nintendo Direct could be on the cards with the showcase happening as early as the week of January 13.</strong></p>



<p>As of writing, this means the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-be-revealed-this-week-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 is being announced this week</a>! This is the biggest <em>take with a pinch of salt</em> imaginable, but the source is a reliable one. YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NatetheHate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nate the Hate</a> says the console is going to be shown off, along with a reveal trailer.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Nate also says the Direct will “<strong>focus almost exclusively on the console itself</strong>” and is saving software reveals and information for a later date.</p>



<p>Again, <strong>January 16</strong> is being outed as the crucial date, but we’ll update you as and when we get new information or leaks.</p>

<p>2025 could be a big year for Nintendo Switch 2 games, and possible launch-day software includes <strong>Metroid Prime 4</strong>, <strong>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</strong>, and <strong>classic Xbox titles</strong> too.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-metroid-prime-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metroid Prime 4 Beyond</a> seems like a logical choice to help shift units at launch.

<p>Arrowhead Game Studios CEO has recently stated that he would like to see A-list actors “get violently killed” in the upcoming Helldivers movie.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted on the r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1i1sa6p/arrowhead_ceo_on_actors_for_the_helldivers_movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Helldivers</a> subreddit (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/helldivers-2-movie-arrowhead-wants-hollywood-stars-die-opening-montage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>), the Helldivers 2 community has been discussing the upcoming movie in its official Discord channel, where the CEO, Shams Jorjani, recently shared some interesting thoughts. When asked whether the team knows details about the upcoming film, Jorjani responded that they do have some information, as the production keeps them “in the loop.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jorjani was also asked whether A-list actors like “Chris Pratt” will be featured in the upcoming Helldivers movie. He replied that the whole team is “hoping for as many A-list actors as possible—as long as they all get killed violently immediately.” </p>



<p>The essence of Helldivers 2 comes from giving your life for democracy, and the developers want this same form of hilarious self-sacrifice to be relayed in the movie, too.&nbsp;Players have already started making their predictions in the comment section, hoping to see the likes of Sean Bean, Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Tom Holland and more get killed. Fans also don’t mind joining in as nameless actors if they get the opportunity to be mowed down by friendly fire. </p>



<p>On the topic of the Helldivers movie, the creative director also revealed Arrowhead’s involvement in the upcoming film, explaining that they are unaware of what it takes to make a movie and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-director-talks-about-their-involvement-with-the-upcoming-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“don’t, and shouldn’t, have the final say.”</a></p>



<p>In other news, Helldivers 2 developers have already begun fleshing out the ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-dev-next-game-concept/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high concept’ for the team’s next game</a>. Also, the title was Insider Gaming Community’s&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-best-multiplayer-game-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Best Multiplayer Game” of 2024</a>.

                <p>Microsoft reportedly considered completely shutting down Xbox in 2021, prior to its acquisition of ZeniMax and Activision Blizzard.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsofts-gaming-business-falls-short-despite-activision" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Information</a>, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly had the choice in 2021 of winding down Xbox, or acquiring more studios to drive Game Pass subscriptions. He chose the latter, purchasing both ZeniMax for $7 billion in 2021 and Activision Blizzard for $75.4 billion in 2023.</p><p>Some big-name studios have also reportedly have not been swayed by Xbox Game Pass, which doesn't bode well for Microsoft's internal target numbers. Prior to its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Microsoft reportedly wanted to hit 100 million Game Pass subscribers by 2030, which would mean tripling its current base in five years. However, Microsoft has reportedly been unable to hit Game Pass internal growth targets in the past two years.</p><p>Microsoft also reportedly wanted other developers to rent its Azure servers after the Activision acquisition. Ironically, Activision reportedly still rents Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services while using its own servers for development, instead of utilizing Azure.</p><p>Since the launch of Xbox Series X|S, Microsoft has seen some ups and downs, including the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-shutting-down-four-studios-including-arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks/1100-6523227/" data-ref-id="1100-6523227">closure of four of its own ZeniMax studios</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cuts-650-more-gaming-jobs-but-no-studios-closed-or-games-canceled/1100-6526439/" data-ref-id="1100-6526439">lay offs</a> last year. While many developers participate in putting their games on Game Pass, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick said back in 2022 that it doesn't make sense to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-launching-new-games-into-a-subscription-service-like-game-pass-makes-no-sense/1100-6509015/" data-ref-id="1100-6509015">put new releases into the service on launch day</a>.</p>

                <p>A new report may contain fresh clues about the apparent partnership between Ubisoft and Tencent, Ubisoft's fortunes continue to slide and the company looks for a way forward.</p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-15/tencent-guillemot-family-are-said-to-mull-ubisoft-asset-venture" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a> reported that Ubisoft and Tencent are considering, among other options, "creating a new venture" that could include "certain Ubisoft assets." The overall aim is to improve the company's value, sources said. The two companies are now "evaluating which assets to include in a new entity and their valuation," the report said, citing anonymous sources.</p><p>Should a deal come together, Tencent could "gain more control over" some of Ubisoft's franchises, the report said, adding that Tencent would also benefit from improving its own business results outside of China.</p><p>Sources told Bloomberg that no final decisions have been made and that conversations remain ongoing. None of this should be surprising, either, as Ubisoft said on January 9 that it had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-refuses-to-comment-on-tencent-rumors-but-says-its-exploring-options-to-maximize-value/1100-6528718/" data-ref-id="1100-6528718">appointed advisors to examine opportunities for Ubisoft to maximize the value of its company</a> through a variety of possible business maneuvers. In a conference call, though, Ubisoft declined to comment on the reported Tencent discussions, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-reportedly-considering-a-major-change-to-its-structure/1100-6526909/" data-ref-id="1100-6526909">date back many months.</a></p><p>A spokesperson for Tencent declined to comment when approached by Bloomberg, while a representative for Ubisoft pointed to the January 9 announcement.</p><p>During a conference call, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said he sees "several potential paths" for the company and its franchises going forward to maximize shareholder value. It was previously reported that Ubisoft was considering numerous different possibilities for its future, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-reportedly-considering-a-major-change-to-its-structure/1100-6526909/" data-ref-id="1100-6526909">selling to Tencent.</a></p><p>On the call, Ubisoft declined to comment on the report of the company potentially selling to Tencent, but management said it is "exploring different options," adding, "We can't say more."</p><p>Ubisoft's share price rose on January 15, following the publication of Bloomberg's report. This came after periods of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-stock-sinks-to-10-year-low-as-star-wars-outlaws-underperforms/1100-6526262/" data-ref-id="1100-6526262">consistent declines.</a> Ubisoft recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-to-march-20/1100-6528717/" data-ref-id="1100-6528717">delayed its next big game, Assassin's Creed Shadows, to March.</a></p><p>In related news, the Biden administration recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/us-blacklists-tencent-over-alleged-ties-with-chinese-military/1100-6528668/" data-ref-id="1100-6528668">added Tencent to a list of companies affiliated with the Chinese military.</a> Tencent said the US government "clearly" made a mistake, going on to deny that it is a military company or supplier for the Chinese government.</p>

			<p>The Decima Engine, the game engine developed by Guerrilla Games that powers the Horizon series as well as the original Death Stranding and its upcoming sequel, could be used by other PlayStation Studios titles in the future, according to some recent findings.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://twistedvoxel.com/playstation-studios-embrace-decima-engine-guerrilla-expands-dev-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twisted Voxel</a>, Guerrilla Games Senior Producer Astrid Huntjens is listing on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/astridhuntjens/?originalSubdomain=nl">LinkedIn</a> among experiences at the studio, the management of communication and relations with other Sony studios interested in or using the Decima Engine, essentially confirming how Guerrilla has already expanded the support it can provide to other studios.</p>
<p>At the time, it is unknown which other games could be using the Horizon series Decima Engine, but there's a good chance Bend Studio's unannounced next project could be among them. On <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-seymour-019b0b93/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn,</a> former Senior Game Designer at Bend Studio Mathew Seymour, who was involved in the development of the unannounced game until their departure from the studio last year, mentioned the Decime Engine among the tools used for the project, strongly suggesting that it will indeed use Guerrilla's game engine.</p>
<p>The aforementioned Death Stranding 2: On the Beach will be the next game using the Horizon series Decima Engine, and although we haven't seen much of the game in action so far, there's no denying that what we have seen looks <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-looks-even-crazier-than-the-first-one-in-the-new-tgs-2024-footage/">extremely impressive</a>. The latest iteration of the engine can also be seen in action in <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-greatly-enhanced-visuals-performance/">Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered,</a> which launched a few months back on PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>

<p>The event will allow guests to "discover incredible marine life alongside some of the game's characters" as they explore the 'Sea Life Islands', meet Tom Nook and Isabelle, and collect character stamps.</p>
<p>There will also be a fossil dig to reveal the ancestors of marine life, as well as a search for Gulliver who washed up on the island's beaches.</p>

<p>However, it appears other aquariums in the UK - including Scotland - aren't included.</p>
<p>Animal Crossing: New Horizons has of course proven exceptionally popular since its release on Switch in 2020. By 2022 it had become the<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/animal-crossing-new-horizons-now-the-best-selling-game-ever-in-japan"> best-selling game ever in Japan</a>.</p>

<hr><h2>Third Place -&nbsp;Destiny 2: The Final Shape</h2>



<p>Developer: Bungie | Release Date: June 4th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Tyler Chancey</p>

<p>Bungie's Light and Darkness saga concluded this year with<em> Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em>. This finale managed to end their space opera tale and deliver the most robust expansion ever to the game.</p>

<p>The Pale Heart location is a stellar showcase of Bungie's impeccable art direction, presenting familiar locations twisted into grotesque corrupted shapes. The story campaign managed a strong blend of pitched gunbattles, haunting imagery, and powerful character moments.</p>

<p>Its fundamental game design reached a zenith with the introduction of Prismatic subclasses and its most challenging Raid to date, Salvation's Edge.</p>

<p><em>Destiny 2: The Final Shap</em>e reminded the world of Bungie's talent and dedication. For an entire generation, this expansion will be what they remember when they imagine what this studio is capable of.</p>

<h2>Second Place - Alan Wake II: The Lake House</h2>



<p>Developer: Remedy Entertainment | Release Date: October 22nd, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Tyler Chancey</p>

<p>While light on runtime, <em>Alan Wake 2: The Lake House</em> continues the atmosphere and overarching themes of the original game. Blending the reality-bending surreality of a world at the whims of Alan's creative process with the sterile procedural office culture of the Federal Bureau of Control.</p>

<p>The level design also manages a similar mix, combining the key-hunting navigation of <em>Control </em>with the meticulous dangerous monster encounters of <em>Alan Wake 2</em>. This is punctuated perfectly with the introduction of the new painted enemies.</p>

<p>In two short hours, <em>Alan Wake 2: The Lake House</em> expands the possibilities of the Remedy Connected Universe and alludes to the nightmares and thrills that we may see in the next title</p>

<h2>Winner - Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</h2>



<p>Developer: FromSoftware | Release Date: June 21st, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Joseph Allen</p>

<p><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em> is longer, more involved, and more rewarding than many full-length games.</p>

<p>Given the huge success of the base game, director Hidetaka Miyazaki and his studio FromSoftware could have just indulged in a victory lap, but that’s never been their style, and <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> is arguably even more ambitious than the foundations upon which it’s built.</p>

<p>This expansion packs in some of <em>Elden Ring</em>’s most beautiful (and horrifying) sights, from ruined, flooded castle courtyards to caves embedded with giant coffins and gorgeous fields full of delicate blue flowers in bloom.</p>

<p>The story you’ll discover as you explore those locations is characteristically obscure, but Miyazaki and company know that if you’re invested in <em>Elden Ring</em> enough to reach the point you need to in order to access <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, you’re in it for the long haul.</p>

<p>It’s that attitude that also allows FromSoftware to craft some of the most involved, satisfying, and occasionally maddening bosses they’ve ever put forth in one of their signature Soulslike action RPGs.</p>

<p>It’s best to know as little as possible about <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s gauntlet of boss encounters before playing, so if you’ve yet to experience this near-masterpiece, I won’t go into detail. Suffice it to say that if, for some reason, you thought <em>Elden Ring</em> went too easy on you, <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> will give you the run for your money you want.</p>

<p>Like all of FromSoftware’s work, it’s not perfect, but <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> cements the studio’s legacy as an art-driven collective looking to engage and inspire you with its work rather than simply to help you kill time.</p>
</div><div><p><span><div>
       
    <p>There's no I in TEAM!! We're all on the case, and this is how you know it :)</p>

While Ubisoft released updates to Viking era England-set Valhalla and Ancient Egypt-set Origins, Ancient Greece-set Odyssey is still without a fix.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Hello everyone, we have just deployed a new title update for Assassin's Creed Valhalla," Ubisoft said on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2208920/Assassins_Creed_Valhalla/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam page</a>, alongside a similar one on Origins'.

It's a long story, but I've lived a very different life before I was a game developer, and I wasn't living very well. My case is about five years old now, I have been going through the legal process the whole time I've been working on this. I have finally been found guilty and sentenced, and I'm going away next month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's a shame, but it's the consequences of my actions. I was a very violent person and I hurt a lot of people in my life. Unfortunately, the sentence isn't going to help with that at all, but I guess we all know that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So the game isn't totally dead, but unfortunately due to even further bad things happening, it's unclear what will happen.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortune's Run launched in early access form on Steam in September 2023 and met with a "very positive" user review rating. Its blend of quick-fire first-person shooter elements with immersive sim mechanics inspired by the likes of Deus Ex and Thief caught the attention of <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/amid-a-legendary-autumn-for-pc-gaming-a-team-of-three-developers-quietly-released-one-of-the-best-shooters-you-can-play-right-now-into-early-access/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PC Gamer</a>, which called Fortune's Run "one of the best shooters you can play right now." Dizzie was one of just two developers working on the game, the other being her wife, Arachne, although she recently left the project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dizzie refused to reveal the exact nature of the sentence or the charges, but insisted she did not commit “a sex crime.” “What I did was wrong and that's all you need to know,” Dizzie added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dizzie also told Fortune’s Run fans that the case dates from “before I met the other dev,” which is a reference to Arachne. “She is not related to it in any way,” Dizzie added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It appears to be the case that Arachne left the project following a significant surgery last summer. “Like I said, the other dev was recovering from a botched surgery,” Dizzie said. “If you want to accuse me of something, accuse me of stressing her out with my legal problems and my crazy work schedule.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The other developer has left the project,” Dizzie’s message continued. “Once she recovered, she decided that she was no longer interested in game development. She was in charge of [quality assurance] and a few level segments, all of which [have] been abandoned and I've been forced to get by on my own for the past while. It's been very difficult to do alone but I actually managed, by basically not sleeping, to complete all of the work in time so that it could be released before I'm sent away.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you’d expect, the prison sentence puts an end to Fortune’s Run development, although Dizzie insisted it will begin again upon release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Since we [Dizzie and Arachne] decided to part ways, development will be completely interrupted until I'm released,” Dizzie said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I know many of you will be upset and disappointed but please understand that there's absolutely nothing I can do. These wheels were in motion long before I started making this game and it's just been slowly unraveling in my face the whole time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I want to underline that I'm no longer in financial dire straits since our game actually sold okay, so I should be able to afford rent once I get out, so there's a chance that if you wait a few years I'll be able to cap off the release. In fact, there's not very much content left to work on; I've been making stubs and prototypes of the missing levels in my spare time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I am extremely passionate about this stuff and I'm never going to stop making games. I'd like to finish this one, but I don't know what will happen. I'm going to do my best, because I love this game and I want to finish it. Seriously, I just want to finish it. Finish it already, Dizzie!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1692240/view/532087801681805320" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a separate post on Steam</a>, Dizzie published patch notes for a new Fortune’s Run update and mentioned an upcoming post that will detail work set to take place next month before her prison sentence begins.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>Less than a year after it launched, the story of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League has been concluded with the game's final update. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-seasonal-updates-ending-with-offline-mode-coming-soon/1100-6528327/">Along with an offline mode</a>, several new Libra-themed weapons, and tweaks, Episode 8: Balance closes the curtain on this incarnation of Task Force X and quickly wraps up the story with a brief animatic.

It turns out that Batman had planned for Harley Quinn and the gang to murder their doppelgangers all along, as while the Suicide Squad was causing chaos in Metropolis, the Dark Knight was working in the shadows to sabotage Brainiac and his multiversal counterparts.</p><p>Basically, every Justice League member is just fine--except for Wonder Woman--and with Brainiac stopped, the team is focused on saving Metropolis and the other dimensions that fell to Brainiac. As for the Suicide Squad? Thanks to their allies Hack, Lawless, and Toyman, the gang has embarked on a road trip across the Elseworlds multiverse, leaving the Arkhamverse behind. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suicide-squad-spoiler-not-going-over-well-with-dc-fans/1100-6520732/">Batman's controversial death</a> has been erased and the ambitious Brainiac saga has been wrapped up, closing the curtain on the game.</p><p>Released in February 2024, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-has-fallen-short-of-expectations-warner-bros-discovery-says/1100-6521318/">didn't live up to Warner Bros.

In comparison, NetEase's free-to-play Marvel Rivals has done very well so far, as it currently has a high number of players regularly engaged in the Overwatch-like game.</p><p>As for the future of games based on DC Comics, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warner-bros-games-wants-to-give-other-studios-a-chance-on-its-franchises/1100-6525635/">last year Warner Bros. Discovery revealed plans to license its IP out to third-party studios</a> and there are rumors that Suicide Squad developer Rocksteady is returning to its single-player roots with a new Arkham game.</p><p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suicide-squad-developer-let-go-of-more-employees-at-the-end-of-2024-report/1100-6528674/">the studio has reportedly let go of several employees</a> due to poor sales of Suicide Squad, impacting members of its programming, art, and quality-assurance teams.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a>'s credits are missing the original game's development staff.</p>
<p>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD is a remaster of 2010's Wii release, which was developed by Retro Studios and published by Nintendo. However, Retro Studios is not the team behind the upcoming remaster, with porting duties instead being handled by Forever Entertainment.</p>
<p>In the new game's credits, Forever Entertainment is front and centre, however Nintendo has omitted the original development team from the credits. Instead, the credits simply state the HD remaster was "based on the work of the original development staff", as you can see in the images below (thanks, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/retro-staff-credits-removed-from-donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-forever-entertainment-confirmed-as-devs">Nintendo Life</a>).</p>

<p>This is not the first time an original game's staff have been left out of the credits by Nintendo. The same thing happened in 2023, when former Retro Studios engineer Zoid Kirsch said he was "let down" by the lack of individual credits in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-remastered">Metroid Prime Remastered</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/external-translators-hired-for-nintendo-projects-bemoan-lack-of-credit-in-almost-every-big-title">translators contracted from firms outside of Nintendo voiced their disappointment at not being credited for work on high-profile games</a>, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-rpg">Super Mario RPG</a>.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has reached out to Nintendo to find out what its current policy is for a game's credits.</p>

            <p>Retro immersive-sim Fortune's Run has had its early access development paused due to its sole developer being sentenced to prison.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1692240/announcements/detail/532087801681805319">update on Steam</a>, developer Dizzie explained why the game's other developer left the project and admitted to being sentenced to three years in prison, meaning development is "imploding".</p>
<p>Dizzie doesn't explain the nature of the crime, though the developer "lived a very different life" prior to working on this project. The post does specify, though, that the crime was not sexual in nature and the other developer was not involved.</p>

<p>"I've been sentenced to prison for the next three years," wrote Dizzie. "It's a long story, but I've lived a very different life before I was a game developer, and I wasn't living very well. My case is about five years old now, I have been going through the legal process the whole time I've been working on this.</p><p>"I have finally been found guilty and sentenced, and I'm going away next month. It's a shame, but it's the consequences of my actions. I was a very violent person and I hurt a lot of people in my life."</p>
<p>The developer said the game "isn't totally dead" but "it's unclear what will happen".</p>
<p>And without the other developer, development on Fortune's Run will be "completely interrupted" until Dizzie is released. She left the project after recovering from a botched surgery, Dizzie explained. "If you want to accuse me of something, accuse me of stressing her out with my legal problems and my crazy work schedule," said Dizzie.</p>
<p>The post continues: "I know many of you will be upset and disappointed but please understand that there's absolutely nothing I can do, these wheels were in motion long before I started making this game and it's just been slowly unraveling in my face the whole time."</p><p>Due to game sales, Dizzie will be able to afford rent once released, so there's a chance the game could be completed. "I am extremely passionate about this stuff and I'm never going to stop making games. I'd like to finish this one, but I don't know what will happen," said Dizzie.</p>
<p>The post comes alongside a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1692240/view/532087801681805320">new major update</a> to Fortune's Run as part of its early access.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-founding-family-and-tencent-are-considering-a-new-venture-using-some-of-ubisofts-assets/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Guillemot family and Tencent Holdings Ltd. are considering starting a new venture using some of the Ubisoft assets, according to a new report.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-15/tencent-guillemot-family-are-said-to-mull-ubisoft-asset-venture?leadSource=uverify%20wall&amp;embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a>, the two parties are evaluating which assets to include in this new venture and their valuation. If it goes through, this deal would allow Tencent to own a stake in this venture, gain more control of some of Ubisoft's properties, and boost its presence in the video games market outside China considerably. The Guillemot family, on the other hand, would be able to retain control of Ubisoft.</p>
<p>As these deliberations are private, neither Tencent nor Ubisoft have confirmed if the possibility of a new venture is real. A representative for the Chinese company declined to comment on the matter, while a Ubisoft representative only referred to the recent appointment of advisors to review and pursue various options to boost the company's value. As these talks seem to be ongoing, nothing has been decided yet, and it's likely nothing will be decided until some time after the release of Assassin's Creed Shadows, which was recently delayed once again.</p>
<p>Given how much seems to be riding on Assassin's Creed Shadows' success, it was not surprising to learn last week that the game was delayed to<a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-to-march-20-while-ubisoft-appoints-advisors-to-review-potential-company-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> March 20th</a>. Being the most ambitious entry in the series to date, Ubisoft co-founder Yves Guillemot said an additional month of development time will allow the involved studios to incorporate the player feedback gathered over the past three months, fully deliver on the game's potential, and finish the year on a strong note.</p>

Reporting results for the first half of its financial year ending December 1, 2024, Games Workshop CEO Kevin Rountree hailed the success of Space Marine 2, which contributed significant royalty revenue to the business.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, licensing revenue from royalty income increased in the period by a whopping £18 million (approx. $21.9 million) to £30.1 million (approx. $36.7 million).

Established games continue to contribute, alongside royalty income earned following the success of Space Marine 2. We recognise that successes like these for Warhammer are not a given in the world of video games. Clearly we are looking for the next one. We remain cautious when forecasting royalty income.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">So, where could this big Warhammer video game hit come from?

            <p>
The current sole creator of immersive sim-shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fortunes-run">Fortune's Run</a> has abruptly announced that the project will be going on hiatus, because they are going to jail. Team Fortune's lead developer, Dizzie, has been handed a three year sentence for a "violent crime", following around five years of legal proceedings. The other developer, Arachne, recently left game development after recovering from a mishandled surgical procedure last year. According to Dizzie, her departure doesn't have anything to do with the aforesaid violent crime, which pre-dates their relationship.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The news comes in the form of a developer Steam post that accompanies what may prove to be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1692240/view/532087801681805320?l=english">the final Fortune's Run update</a>. "It's a long story, but I've lived a very different life before I was a game developer, and I wasn't living very well," Dizzie writes. "My case is about 5 years old now, I have been going through the legal process the whole time I've been working on this. 
</p>
<p>
"I have finally been found guilty and sentenced, and I'm going away next month. It's a shame, but it's the consequences of my actions. I was a very violent person and I hurt a lot of people in my life. Unfortunately, the sentence isn't going to help with that at all, but I guess we all know that." The post doesn't specify the violent crime, beyond qualifying that it wasn't sexual in nature. 
</p>
<p>
As for Arachne's departure, Dizzie adds that "my case dates from before I met the other dev" and that "she is not related to it in any way". For context, Dizzie <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1692240/view/4234028300480496465">blogged about Arachne's hospitalisation in July last year</a>. "If you want to accuse me of something, accuse me of stressing her out with my legal problems and my crazy work schedule," today's Steam post adds.
</p><p>
Arachne had been in charge of Fortune Run's QA and "a few level segments". Following her surgical procedure, Dizzie has been working on the game solo, trying to finish as much as possible before beginning their period of incarceration (it's not clear when, exactly, the sentence was given). "It's been very difficult to do alone but I actually managed, by basically not sleeping, to complete all of the work in time so that it could be released before I'm sent away," the post adds.
</p>
<p>
"Since [Arachne and I] decided to part ways, development will be completely interrupted until I'm released," it continues. "I know many of you will be upset and disappointed but please understand that there's absolutely nothing I can do, these wheels were in motion long before I started making this game and it's just been slowly unraveling in my face the whole time." 
</p>
<p>
Existing sales of Fortune's Run have been strong enough that Dizzie should be able to afford rent after they're released from prison, and there's "a chance" they'll be able to resume development of Fortune's Run. "In fact, there's not very much content left to work on, I've been making stubs and prototypes of the missing levels in my spare time," the post continues. "I am extremely passionate about this stuff and I'm never going to stop making games. I'd like to finish this one, but I don't know what will happen."

            <p>An attorney for Nintendo has discussed the company's stance on emulation and what it considers to be illegal, according to Japanese law.</p>
<p>Koji Nishiura, patent attorney and deputy general manager of Nintendo's intellectual property department, spoke on behalf of the company at a joint lecture on "The Importance of Intellectual Property Rights in the Game Industry", which was hosted by Japan's Association of Copyright for Computer Software at the Tokyo eSports Festa 2025 (<a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/kikakuthetower/250112a#i-2">Denfaminicogamer</a>, via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendos-attorney-weighs-in-on-what-makes-emulators-illegal/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p>"To begin with, are emulators illegal or not?" posed Nishiura. "This is a point often debated. While you can't immediately claim that an emulator is illegal in itself, it can become illegal depending on how it's used."</p>

<p>One example of illegal use is if an emulator copies a programme belonging to the game device it's imitating, which would be copyright infringement.</p>
<p>Another is if an emulator can disable security mechanisms like encryption (or "technical protection measures", as they're legally known), which would violate Japan's Unfair Competition Prevention Act. Nishiura added that outside of Japan this would be stipulated in copyright law.</p>
<p>Nishiura specified this point is why Nintendo has filed lawsuits and issued warnings over several Switch emulators, due to disabling Nintendo's "technical protection measures".</p>
<p>A further violation would be if an emulator contains links to sources to download pirated games, what's known as a "reach app" in Japanese law and is considered a copyright infringement.</p>
<p>Nishiura also emphasised the use of emulators is a problem for all developers making software for Nintendo devices, which is why the company is strengthening measures against such illegal tools.</p>
<p>Just last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-switch-emulator-creator-for-facilitating-piracy-at-a-colossal-scale">Nintendo sued the creators of Switch emulator Yuzu</a> as it claimed over a million copies of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> were pirated ahead of release. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-emulator-yuzu-shuts-down-as-creator-agrees-to-pay-nintendo-24m">Yuzu was then shut down</a> by its developers Tropical Haze and agreed to pay Nintendo $2.4m.</p><p>Also last year, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-emulator-pizza-emulators-pulls-its-apps-from-google-play-store">Game Boy emulator Pizza Emulators</a> was pulled from the Google Play store, though there was no mention of a Nintendo settlement. A month later, another Nintendo emulator - the Delta app - was the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-game-emulator-currently-top-free-download-on-iphone-app-store">top free download on the iPhone App Store</a> and it remains available today.</p>
<p>In further Nintendo news, the company has also requested players not use "unauthorised services" to access online services.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/will-tiktok-be-banned-us-and-when/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>TikTok is in a precious position at present. It sits on a precipice, with the United States government attempting to shut down the application’s operations in the country. It would be a monumental blow to the application owner, ByteDance, and it all stems from the organisation being headquartered in Beijing, China.</p>



<p>Will TikTok be banned in the US? In the middle of January, the Supreme Court will determine whether the application will receive a blanket ban in the nation, but many things can happen before then to prevent that.</p>



<p>Find out in this guide if TikTok will be banned and when that might happen, plus learn about some alternatives.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-tiktok-getting-banned-in-the-us">Is TikTok Getting Banned in the US?</h2>



<p>The United States Supreme Court is attempting to ban TikTok <strong>unless </strong>the platform breaks away from Chinese ownership. By way of a resolution, an American company or entity could purchase a portion of the platform to run it from the United States, which would keep everything running as normal.</p>



<p>A few months back, the likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bobby-kotick-buy-tiktok/">Bobby Kotick were rumoured</a> to be interested in purchasing the site, and recently, MrBeast’s name came up in the discussion. It could even be someone like Elon Musk who might save TikTok from being banned in the US.</p>



<p>Last year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/president-joe-biden-signs-bill-to-ban-tiktok-in-united-states/">Joe Biden signed a bill</a> that would see TikTok banned in January 2025 if it wasn’t divested away from the Chinese owners.</p>



<p><strong>The due date for the final decision (and ultimate action) is January 19. If nobody secures TikTok’s US operations by then, the application will be banned nationwide. As nobody has stepped forward to claim or save TikTok just yet, it looks like the ban will go ahead.</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-what-happens-if-tiktok-is-banned">What Happens if TikTok is Banned?</h2>



<p>Most likely, the Supreme Court will order app store operators such as Google and Apple to remove TikTok from their storefronts, making it near-impossible to download the application on devices.</p>



<p>Also, internet service providers will be required to place blocks on the desktop version of the site, further restricting access. This could also apply to cellphone network carriers.</p>



<p>If you’re using a VPN, you may be able to still access TikTok. A VPN allows you to ‘spoof’ your location, making it seem as though you’re in another country or region, which is the most effective way to bypass geoblocking measures.</p>



<p>Ultimately, if TikTok is ‘hard banned’ in the United States, many content creators who rely on the app for a revenue stream will be massively impacted.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-donald-trump-save-tiktok">Will Donald Trump Save TikTok?</h2>



<p>Once upon a time, Donald Trump was hellbent on shutting down TikTok, but as underwent his political campaign for election into the presidency in 2024, he doubled back on that decision. </p>



<p>It became a belief that Donald Trump would halt the US TikTok ban, which he has the power to do once he has entered office. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, he will be sworn in as the United States President on January 20, one day <strong>after </strong>the ban takes place. He could retroactively make a change, but he can’t stop it from going ahead.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-best-tiktok-alternatives">What Are The Best TikTok Alternatives?</h2>



<p>If you want an alternative to TikTok in case the application is banned in the US, you’re in luck.</p>



<p>Many people rely on Instagram Reels as an alternative to TikTok, or Facebook, which also supports a ‘shorts’ ecosystem. One of the best alternatives to TikTok is YouTube, which has a strong shorts platform that many creators use to earn a fair bit of money.</p>



<p>In recent months, YouTube has been slipping back a little on live streaming and prioritising short- and long-form content, so there’s a strong argument there for moving from TikTok to YouTube.</p>



<p>Other sites, such as Lemon8 and RedNote, could also face legislative action, given that they’re owned by Chinese organisations. Lemon8 is owned by ByteDance, the parent company sitting over TikTok, so that’s not the best step if you’re looking for a TikTok alternative.</p>



<p>To put it finely, 170 million American users could be set to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tiktok-ban-united-states-closer/">lose access to TikTok this month</a>, so be prepared. </p>

<p>Battlestate Games has announced the arrival of the ‘BTR Driver’ storyline in Escape from Tarkov. This snapshot mission chain will allow users to learn more about the BTR driver, who is present on several of the game’s maps, including Streets of Tarkov and Woods.</p>



<p>This news comes amid a slump for the game exacerbated by an increasing number of cheaters and technical issues. That fact alone has prompted some users to slam Battlestate for focusing on ‘things that don’t matter’ to the average player.</p>

<h2 id="h-enter-the-driver">Enter The Driver</h2>



<p>On social media, the Escape from Tarkov team posted an update explaining when, where, and how you can access the BTR Driver storyline:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>BTR driver storyline is now available in Escape from Tarkov:</p>



<ul>
<li>The chain starts at Mechanic with the task “A Helping Hand” at character level 20</li>



<li>Completing the chain earns the new achievement and unique rewards such as barters for new items and weapons, customization items, and more</li>



<li>The task chain will be permanent.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>



<p>It has been more than a year since the BTR mechanic was added to Escape from Tarkov, and for most players, it goes by relatively unnoticed. When it was introduced, it was buggy as all hell, gunning down PMCs with reckless abandon for no reason whatsoever.</p>



<p>It has a few neat functions, such as banking found loot, using it as a taxi service, and providing cover fire to PMCs willing to stump up the cash, but for the bulk of users, it’s just a thing that drives around the map on loop.</p>



<p>Admittedly, it’s nice to get a bit more content in Escape from Tarkov, but I’ll mirror what some users are saying – perhaps BSG’s efforts would be better spent fixing what exists rather than adding more to the game.</p>
