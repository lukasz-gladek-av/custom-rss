            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/creature-caravan-review-what-ride<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As the wooden wheels of your cart rumble along the dusty earth, you look back in wonder at the caravan you’ve assembled. Strange beasts flap heavy wings in the air, a frog-man ambles along peaceably, someone’s riding a giant snail? Sure, why not! This is the wonderful world of <i>Creature Caravan</i>, a brand new board game designed by <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/11854/ryan-laukat" rel="nofollow">Ryan Laukat</a>, and published by <a href="https://www.redravengames.com/" rel="nofollow">Red Raven Games</a>.</p>

<p>Red Raven Games provided me with a review copy of the game when I visited their booth at PAX Unplugged, and now that the game’s back in stock I thought it would be the perfect time to dive in and see what it’s all about!</p>



<blockquote>
<p><i>Creature Caravan</i> Stats:</p>

<ul><li>1 - 4 Players</li>
	<li>Est. Game Time: 60 Minutes</li>
	<li>Game Genre: Tableau Building, Dice Assignment</li>
	<li>Complexity: Medium</li>
</ul></blockquote>

<p><i>Creature Caravan</i> tasks players with competing to score the most points as they trek across a varied landscape full of strange creatures and dangerous Ember Zombies. As the name implies, players will slowly build up their caravan in the form of creature cards that they place by their board.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/creature-caravan-full-game-setup.jpg?itok=EMWnirWD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/creature-caravan-full-game-setup.jpg?itok=bGAGFTN7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Trek across the plains in Creature Caravan!</figcaption></figure><p>After playing through multiple rounds of the game, players will accumulate points by traversing the land, defeating zombies, trading in goods for points, and adding creatures to their caravan. The player who scores the most points wins after 12 rounds wins.</p>

<h2>How Do You Play <i>Creature Caravan</i>?</h2>

<p>To play the game, you’ll roll five dice and assign those dice to actions on your board. When you start the game, you’ll only have a few options available on your tableau. You can assign dice to gain creature cards to your hand, gain resources, or battle Ember Zombies.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/creature-caravan-board-and-cards.jpg?itok=PSQrBrrL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/creature-caravan-board-and-cards.jpg?itok=t9CCVtka 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The game board offers places to assign dice you roll each turn.</figcaption></figure><p>Where the complexity comes in is with the introduction of those creatures cards. As you add them to your tableau by paying resources to play their cards, you’ll unlock new slots to place your dice.</p>

<p>Placing dice in new slots unlocks additional benefits, like the ability to travel faster/further on the board, more attack to fend off Zombies, more card draw, etc.</p>

<h2>How Does It Feel To Play <i>Creature Caravan</i>?</h2>

<p><i>Creature Caravan</i> is one of my favorite types of games: the kind that starts fairly simply, and slowly gets more crunchy and complex as you play. Because of this, it’s easy to introduce new players right into the action.</p>

<p>I really like the mechanic of rolling dice and assigning them to spots on your caravan (you can assign dice of a matching number or higher to its associated spot - in other words, a die roll of a 4 could be placed on a 4, 3, 2, or 1 spot on your board).&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/creature-caravan-player-board.jpg?itok=X_qGNULZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/creature-caravan-player-board.jpg?itok=Kes1QWuX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>What starts simply with the above options soon blossoms into many different ways to spend your dice</figcaption></figure><p>I never spent a turn without at least a few interesting options in front of me, and as the game grew in complexity I ended up having <i>too many</i> cool things I wanted to do in a turn.</p>

<p>The only area of the game that feels a little less-baked than the rest of the game are the mechanics around Ember Zombies. These zombies show up when you arrive at various spots on the map, and place tokens on your board.</p>

<p>You can then add dice to slots to attack the zombies, which is really just another place to score points on your board. Of all the elements in the game, this feels least intuitive - though for my opponents who went all-in on attacking beat me pretty squarely, so maybe shows how much I know!</p>

<h2><i>Creature Caravan</i> Stuns With Its Art and Creature Design</h2>

<p>As usual, Ryan Laukat doesn’t <i>just</i> shine as a game design, but puts his artistic talent on display by illustrating all of the artwork for the game as well. It’s this artwork, I think above all else, that gives the game so much personality.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/creature-caravan-map.jpg?itok=KC1iMi5v 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/creature-caravan-map.jpg?itok=CwXk-nWe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Move along the board with your caravan!</figcaption></figure><p>Set in the world of Arzium, which also includes Laukat’s games <i>Above and Below</i>, <i>Near</i> <i>and Far, Now and Then</i>, and the all-new <i>Arzium RPG</i>, this is a setting full of bright colors, quirky characters, an internal logic that pulls it all together.</p>

<p>Without knowing all the in’s and out’s of the world, I can tell this game is illustrated by a creator who knows his universe down to the smallest bug and largest lumbering dinosaur.</p>

<h2><i>Creature Caravan - </i>Let the Cards Surprise You!</h2>

<p>I have a hot take for new players: I do <i>not</i> recommend going through and looking at all the character cards before you start playing. I know some of you might be screaming right now about “open information,” “optimal gameplay,” and “combo effects,” but it’ll be okay! Hear me out:</p>

<p>I don’t think your first play through is likely to be optimized for the best combing of creature effects anyway, so going into the game and letting each new flip of a character&nbsp;card surprise you will add a whole layer of brilliant discovery to the game!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/creature-caravan-creature-cards_0.jpg?itok=cIbi9I_6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/creature-caravan-creature-cards_0.jpg?itok=izmtjD9j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The creature cards add so much personality to the game!</figcaption></figure><h2><i>Creature Caravan - </i>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>There’s a cleanness of design on display in <i>Creature Caravan</i> that allows the player to truly settle into the game before adding creatures to your tableau expands the horizon of options. As I’ve mentioned above, the length this goes to welcoming players into the game cannot be overstated.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a game that let’s you roll dice (which we love, of course), plot movements carefully, collect a cadre of cool characters, and sink into evocative illustrations, <i>Creature Caravan</i> is the game for you!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steel-seed-release-date-close-to-the-sun<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher ESDigital Games and developer Storm in a Teacup have announced the release date for their stealth-action game&nbsp;<em>Steel Seed</em>, and it's coming next month.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Steel Seed&nbsp;</em>arrives on PC and current-gen consoles on April 10th. It's Storm in a Teacup's next major project after <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-store-exclusive-close-to-sun-launches-may-2nd-on-pc" rel="nofollow">2019's&nbsp;<em>BioShock</em>-inspired horror adventure <i>Close to the Sun</i></a>, although&nbsp;<em>Steel Seed&nbsp;</em>isn't related to that game in terms of story or setting.</p>

<p>Instead, it's a post-apocalyptic stealth-action game in which you play as Zoe and her drone companion Koby as they explore a massive underground facility filled with hostile machines. It'll play out in a third-person perspective, too, as opposed to&nbsp;<em>Close to the Sun</em>'s first-person viewpoint.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steel-seed-release-date-stealth.jpg?itok=XbPpKfGJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steel-seed-release-date-stealth.jpg?itok=Huwt-bP5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Steel Seed&nbsp;</em>is a stealth-action game from the makers of&nbsp;<em>Close to the Sun</em>.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Steel Seed</em>'s world is "hand-crafted", according to Storm in a Teacup, and it'll present plenty of opportunities to discover the game's "immersive narrative" and "environmental storytelling".</p>

<p>While stealth looks to be the main tool in your arsenal, Storm in a Teacup is also promising "dynamic combat" against a range of enemies, as well as "challenging bosses" and three different skill trees containing 40 upgrades between them.</p>

<p>Koby serves as both Zoe's narrative companion and a helper for&nbsp;<em>Steel Seed</em>'s puzzles, so I'm very much hoping this isn't a&nbsp;<em>God of War Ragnarok</em>-style situation where everything's solved for me. At the very least, if it is, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-puzzle-hints" rel="nofollow">let me turn down the hint frequency</a>!</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Steel Seed</em>, which gives a sense of the game's story and the world in which it takes place, right here.</p>




<p><em>Steel Seed&nbsp;</em>boasts the involvement of BAFTA winner Martin Korda, a writer and consultant in the industry who's worked on projects like&nbsp;<em>Destiny: The Taken King&nbsp;</em>and several&nbsp;<em>FIFA&nbsp;</em>(now known as&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC</em>) career modes.</p>

<p>Storm in a Teacup says the game will feature "an intriguing main character's evolution" and "a compelling and deep narrative experience" thanks to Korda's involvement. We'll have to wait and see whether those promises ring true.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Steel Seed&nbsp;</em>when it launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/458430/Steel_Seed/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10010794/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and Xbox Series X|S on April 10th.</p>

Some of the latest clips to emerge reveal that Battlefield 6, or whatever the new game is called, features the ability to drag a downed teammate to safety.</p><p>This would be a brand-new feature for the series, but it's not confirmed for the game, of course, as the Battlefield Labs test is not necessarily representative of gameplay and features that will be in the final product.

It looks pretty devastating in action, but again, it's not necessarily confirmed for the final version of the game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/nc-america-ceo-hopes-the-industry-and-her-company-is-on-upswing-after-layoffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Since the nascent period of online games in the late '90s and 2000s, publisher NCSoft and its massively multiplayer online role-playing games have been a mainstay. The company's one significant edge against competitors like Blizzard Entertainment's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>World of Warcraft</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was its focus on bridging the divide between Western and Eastern MMORPG audiences with a cross-continental portfolio including </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lineage II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Aion</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Guild Wars 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As live service games have become increasingly high risk for the industry, the long-running publisher sees a path through the turmoil, with its sights on company expansion. In 2025, the publisher intends to double down on its live service business in the wake of layoffs and restructuring to reaffirm its position on the global market—all with a focus on its MMORPG pedigree.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Current CEO of NC America Jeonghee Jin said she hopes the industry—and the company—is on the upswing after laying off workers. According to her, NCSoft is recalibrating its approach to supporting Western game developers, with the hope of not repeating mistakes from years past.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Building a new NCSoft">Building a new NCSoft</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While NCSoft has maintained steady success with legacy titles such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lineage II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Guild Wars 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the company has struggled across other ends of its portfolios. During the 2010s, NCSoft made efforts to expand in the United States, but that ultimately led to the shuttering of the sci-fi MMO </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wildstar </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and its developer Carbine Studios, and the online music-rhythm game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fuser </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">from developer Harmonix (now owned by Epic Games). In recent years, it's laid off workers and underwent a general restructuring in late 2024.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The last two years have been pretty bad for many game companies, including NCSoft, but honestly, I've seen cycles like this in the game business, and most other businesses," said the CEO. "We are always seeing these ups and downs, and especially right after the COVID lockdown period. We're now seeing a lot of layoffs and cancelations of promising projects, but I'm still actually very hopeful because I feel like we're kind of at the bottom of that cycle, and that a rise is happening."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In 2024, Jin was named CEO of NC America following her time as the former senior vice president and CEO of Pearl Abyss America, where she helped expand the reach the South Korean MMORPG </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Black Desert Online</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Since she joined the company, NCSoft has made numerous investments within European and Korean development studios for new IPs, including a new first-person shooter from Moon Rover and an RPG known as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Breakers </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">from Vic Game Studios, respectively.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Jin acknowledged the publisher's past misfires, saying she joined the company with the hope of learning from its mistakes. "When I joined, I had a lot of thoughts on where we can do things with NCSoft," they continued. "This publisher has such a rich history within the MMORPG space across the Korean and western markets, and that makes it such a unique company."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Going back to the '90s, NCSoft was one of the first MMORPG developers, and they've done a lot of experiments with trying to break through to other markets. Generally those titles have been doing great mostly in Asia, but to a lesser degree in western regions, which we want to work on more.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There have been a lot of investments with NCSoft over the years, and a lot of experiments, and some of them went great, but others not so much. I think a lot of people only remember failures, but there are a lot of achievements as well which definitely paved the way for other Korean companies and Asian developers who wanted to go global. I feel very optimistic now as we invest more within the western market, which we see a growth opportunity for."</span></p><p>Image via NCSoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Image via NCSoft.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now in 2025, Jin is heading up the new NCSoft office in Southern California following a notable restructuring effort. According to Jin, her current vision for NCSoft is a publisher that releases modern games that are more approachable for wide audiences—which includes the online shooter </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Project LLL</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">NCSoft will also lean into its steady successes within online live service games, which they still see growth potential in. Along with titles from Moon Rover and Vic Game Studios, a recent investment in Mistil Games and their upcoming third-person shooter </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Time Takers</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> show how NCSoft is heading into new territory.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's good for us to have more diverse genres in the portfolio, and with NCSoft America and the Western divisions, we are now in a better position to bring these titles to a broader audience."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Finding success within the live service model">Finding success within the live service model</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The video game industry within recent years has been a volatile and challenging space for developers to operate in. With record layoffs and studio closures, studios are also juggling ballooning development budgets and expectations for success.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think there are still a lot of successful titles right now, and they're still being loved by so many players, and not really having a really negative impact on their communities," she continued. "So I see a lot of bright and some dark sides of the business right now. But I know we're going to see that rise once again, and we'll do it all together as industry comrades. I'm also really looking forward to all the projects that we are working on, so I'm very positive and optimistic about the future."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Jin explained that NCSoft still thinks its central publishing role supporting a wide variety of studios has advantages over being a studio supporting one game. Live service games need "happy" players, and tracking player behavior can be a task that's too big for one dev team.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It can be very stressful...for any publisher and developer working on live service games, they hear a lot of harsh comments and feedback all the time," she said. "But that's why a core publisher exists for [live service games]. A really good team has to support that and figure out how to engage the community and guide the game over time."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For online games, the communities they foster can be a driving factor in future success. Along with maintaining a successful launch for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Throne and Liberty,</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> NC America also has the western launch of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Blade &amp; Soul Neo</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—a visual and gameplay remaster of its popular martial-arts action MMO—aims for a "nostalgic" trip back to a classic MMO experience for long-time fans, and the type of game that NCSoft plans to spotlight in the years ahead.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I'm feeling great about the current projects we are working on, like one potential project we are preparing just made me feel very optimistic about the future of NCSoft's business in the West, and I feel I have a clear vision about how I want to run the business at this point," said Jin. "In the first few months while I was here, I did a lot of studying and reflecting on the history of NCSoft—what did well and what didn't, and I talked to as many people as possible at the headquarters to figure out their perspectives about the Western regions and the growth opportunities there."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I'm in a very good place where I can plan confidently for our next projects—I feel good for what's ahead."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributor</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Alessandro Fillari is a writer/editor who has covered the games, tech, and entertainment industries for more than 12 years.

            <p>If you enjoyed your flirtations (and more) with Astarion in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, and want more, well, you can now romance the sultry vampire in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>.</p>
<p>This new line of romance comes thanks to the fan made Baldur's Village mod, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/romanceable-baldurs-gate-3-companions-are-being-modded-into-stardew-valley">which we first got wind of last year</a>.</p>
<p>"A new village has recently been built north of Pelican Town, and its new residents seem... rather unusual," <a href="https://x.com/XunHe1145/status/1898186199790981284">reads a post on social media</a>, announcing the mod's arrival.</p>

<p>The Baldur's Village mod is described as a "large expansion mod for Stardew Valley". Along with the ability to romance and eventually marry Astarion, this mod also adds new stores including a tavern, and other Baldur's Gate 3-inspired characters.</p>
<p>While Astarion is the only romanceable character right now, more are planned for down the line, with Halsin's storyline the next focus</p>
<p>"Once completed, we will shift our attention to expanding the mod's world-building, background stories, and gameplay by introducing new features and items," the Baldur's Village creators explained.</p>
<p>The mod's creators also assure that Baldur's Village will not "alter or break the original game", and you won't need to start a new save to play.</p>

<p>As for Stardew Valley, as of December last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-continues-its-wholesome-farming-dominance-with-latest-sales-milestone">the farming sim has sold in excess of 41m copies across platforms</a>. Of those 41m, over half are on PC, with 26m copies sold. Meanwhile, the Nintendo Switch accounts for 7.9m Stardew Valley sales.</p>
<p>Last year, creator Eric 'ConcernedApe' Barone also released Stardew Valley's bumper 1.6 update, which essentially boosted the game to an almost 2.0 status. This beefy update introduced a vast number of features to the base game, such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valleys-16-update-is-finally-here-with-some-impressively-lengthy-patch-notes">new NPC dialogues, home renovations and turtle pets</a>. This update was released on PC first, before becoming available across all platforms.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rootbound-ex-gothic-elex-developers</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rootbound-is-a-new-game-from-former-gothic-and-elex-developers.1129923/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rootbound-ex-gothic-elex-developers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A group of ex-Piranha Bytes developers have banded together to found new indie studio Brainlag Games, and the developer has also announced its first game in physics-based adventure&nbsp;<em>Rootbound</em>.</p>

<p>Per its new <a href="https://www.brainlag-games.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official website</a>, Brainlag was founded with the goal of "bring[ing] back what gaming was meant to be" and "creating immersive worlds with gameplay you haven't seen a hundred times".</p>

<p>That would certainly fit in with the development ethos of the studio founders' former outfit Piranha Bytes, whose name you might know best from the likes of&nbsp;<em>Gothic</em>,&nbsp;<em>Risen</em>, and<i>&nbsp;Elex</i>. The studio was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/piranha-bytes-shut-down-report" rel="nofollow">shuttered last year</a>, although neither Piranha Bytes nor parent company Embracer Group officially announced its closure.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rootbound-brainlag-games-ex-piranha-bytes-developers.jpg?itok=ikGB2ZLR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rootbound-brainlag-games-ex-piranha-bytes-developers.jpg?itok=9LvKIMX3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Rootbound&nbsp;</em>looks to be a very different prospect from its developers' former work.</figcaption></figure><p>That brings us to Brainlag, which was founded by Piranha Bytes veterans&nbsp;Markus Kloß, Maki Dieffenbach, Amadeus Weidmann, and André Hotz. Like Piranha Bytes, the studio is based in Essen in Germany.</p>

<p>Brainlag's first game&nbsp;<em>Rootbound&nbsp;</em>is, according to its Steam page, a "physics-based action adventure about a plantling's quest to save its home from a mysterious blight". Rather than being a fully-fledged 3D action RPG like&nbsp;<em>Gothic&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Risen</em>, it's a&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em>-style isometric affair.</p>

<p>Together with your sentient backpack, you will journey into the world of Akara, discovering "ancient puzzles" and fighting "dangerous monsters" as you seek to uncover a long-lost civilization's secrets.</p>

<p>By the looks of the debut trailer, the physics element of the game comes in a sort of <i>Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</i>-style environment manipulation mechanic whereby you can build bridges with planks, knock down stone walls, and interact with the world in other fun ways.</p>




<p>Unfortunately,&nbsp;<em>Rootbound&nbsp;</em>doesn't yet have a release date, but if you'd like to keep up with the game's progress, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3453490/Rootbound/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist it on Steam right here</a>.</p>

<p>As for Piranha Bytes, the studio may be dead, but its debut title&nbsp;<em>Gothic&nbsp;</em>lives on in the form of the upcoming remake (developed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-thq-nordic-studio-alkimia-interactive-to-develop-gothic-remake" rel="nofollow">by Alkimia Interactive</a>), which is now <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gothic-1-remake-2025-release-window" rel="nofollow">scheduled to launch in 2025</a>.&nbsp;</p>

Just when you thought Kojima probably couldn’t share any more about the game without spoiling he said, “Oh, just watch me.” The footage opens with a character named Neil who appears to be some sort of black ops spook called in for one last job to smuggle pregnant women across the U.S. Mexico border. He’s played by Italian actor Luca Marinelli and gives intense <em>Metal Gear</em> vibes by the end of the trailer. </p><p> Toward the end of the footage we see him wrapping a bandana around his head and emerging from a burning church with a squad of skeleton soldiers and fireworks exploding in the background like a death cult 4th of July celebration. There are callbacks to Mads Mikkelsen’s Clifford Unger in the first game, as well as obvious allusions to Kojima’s own <em>Metal Gear </em>series and its generations-spanning special forces operative named Snake. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/1j7i9fh/luca_marinelli_i_think_if_he_donned_a_bandana_hed/?rdt=55212&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/1j7i9fh/luca_marinelli_i_think_if_he_donned_a_bandana_hed/?rdt=55212" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans were quick to point out</a></span> that the director had previously tweeted that Marinelli would make a great Snake in a live action movie. The post came after the actor appeared in the otherwise pretty mediocre Netflix action blockbuster about immortal soldiers called <em>Old Guard</em>. Leave it to Kojima to weave an apparent troll of his former publisher, Konami, into meta commentary for his next serpentine-plotted thriller. </p><p>The trailer ends with Nicolas Winding Refn’s Heartman merging his DHV Magellan ship with a massive BT (hence the collector’s edition statue) to fight another massive BT and a ghostly Kaiju showdown of oozing black oil and paranormal horror. When <em>Death Stranding 2</em> was announced there were a lot of people, including myself, wondering why in the world we needed a sequel. After nearly 30 minutes of carefully crafted pre-release trailers, I’m 100 percent on board. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A recent patent filed by Nintendo strongly suggests that voice chat will be integrated into the Nintendo Switch 2 operating system, addressing one of the original Switch's biggest oversights.</p>
<p>The patent, which was <a href="https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/pdfRedirectDownload/20250058223?requestToken=eyJzdWIiOiI0YjEwOGFlNS0yYjc4LTRlMzQtOTRiYi1kNjZkZDNlMDZiNmEiLCJ2ZXIiOiJlZjViYmE5NC1hMDAxLTQyNzUtOTM1ZC03NTMyY2MyNjE5ZjAiLCJleHAiOjB9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> late last month by Nintendo in the United States, outlines a system for implementing proximity chat in games, suggesting not only OS voice chat integration for the Nintendo Switch 2, but also that first-party titles will likely support proximity chat, which could considerably improve multiplayer games like the next entry in the Mario Kart series or a potential new entry in the Splatoon series.</p>
<p>Voice chat support directly on the Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be confirmed, but it's been speculated over the months that the mysterious new C button on the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-pictures/">Joy-Con controller</a> could have something to do with it. Thankfully, we won't have to wait much longer to learn what the new button does and how the new system will improve the user experience over its predecessor, as the dedicated Nintendo Direct focused on the console, which will likely be out <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-june-release-announced-direct/">before the end of summer</a>, will air in less than a month.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on a yet-to-be-confirmed 2025 release date worldwide. We will keep you updated on the highly anticipated system as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kojima Productions has revealed the&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>release date, and the long-awaited sequel is on its way to PlayStation 5 in summer.</p>

<p>Per a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach&nbsp;</em>launches on June 26th. Unlike <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-directors-cut-pc-release-coming-to-steam" rel="nofollow">the original</a>, this one's a PS5 exclusive, although it's worth noting that&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>originally launched exclusively for PS4 before receiving a PC release (and then an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-xbox-release-kojima-ip" rel="nofollow">Xbox release</a>) later on down the line.</p>

<p>As well as revealing the release date, Kojima Productions also announced that pre-orders for&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>will begin on March 17th at 10am local time, so make sure to add that to your calendar if you want to get in early.</p>

<p>Naturally, that includes more spectacular scenery, more labyrinthine conversations between extremely famous people, and lots more walking. I'm looking forward to it tremendously.</p>

<p>In the trailer, you can catch glimpses not only of returning characters like Norman Reedus' Sam Porter Bridges or&nbsp;Léa Seydoux's Fragile, but also new players like Luca Marinelli's Neil and Debra Wilson's Doctor, as well as&nbsp;<em>Mad Max: Fury Road&nbsp;</em>director George Miller as Tarman.</p>

<p>You can check out the release date announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>right here. It's worth setting aside ten minutes or so to watch the whole thing, as it's exactly the kind of bonkers excess we've come to expect from Hideo Kojima.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em>, it's the sequel to 2019's&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding</em>. Originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-confirmed-by-norman-reedus" rel="nofollow">leaked by lead actor Norman Reedus</a> in 2022, the game was subsequently officially revealed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-trailer-revealed-at-game-awards-2022" rel="nofollow">at that year's Game Awards</a>.</p>

<p>It's not the only project Kojima is currently working on, either; he's also currently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-announces-new-game-od-in-partnership-with-xbox-and-filmmaker-jordan-peele" rel="nofollow">working on the mysterious&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-announces-new-game-od-in-partnership-with-xbox-and-filmmaker-jordan-peele" rel="nofollow">OD</a>&nbsp;</em>alongside&nbsp;<em>Get Out&nbsp;</em>director Jordan Peele, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-announces-next-generation-espionage-action-game" rel="nofollow">"next-generation espionage action game"&nbsp;<em>Physint</em></a>.</p>

<p><em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>launches exclusively for <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a> on June 26th.</p>

<p>Activision has confirmed that Verdansk is officially returning to Call of Duty: Warzone as part of Season 3. The announcement came via social media posts on Monday morning.</p>



<p>“As we celebrate Call of Duty: Warzone’s 5 Year Anniversary, it’s time to revisit a place of unforgettable memories,” the game’s official <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1899083215802904607" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media account</a> said.</p>



<h6 id="h-podcast-the-future-of-call-of-duty-insider-gaming-weekly">PODCAST: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-future-of-call-of-duty-insider-gaming-weekly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Future Of Call of Duty—Insider Gaming Weekly</a></h6>



<p>Verdansk will be returning alongside the start of Season 3 on April 3. In addition to the announcement, Activision released a new trailer to get players ready for what’s to come.</p>



<p>As far was what else fans can expect in Season 3 of Call of Duty: Black Ops  6, that information will be fully revealed when the launch gets closer. Season 3 was originally planned for a release later this month, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-season-03-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">but was delayed</a> so the developers can “[take] time to deliver a great experience” for players.</p>



<p>The announcement of Verdansk’s return is likely just the first for what fans hope is a big new season for the game.</p>

There’s also concern that Forza Horizon 5 on PS5 will become unplayable if a player loses access to their linked Microsoft account for whatever reason.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steel-seed-hands-on-preview-%E2%80%93-a-gem-in-the-making.1129869/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/steel-seed-hands-on-preview-a-gem-in-the-making/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Developing an original experience is becoming increasingly difficult in the video game industry, due both to the market's failure to always reward truly innovative games and the objective difficulty of creating something that hasn't already been done and making it fun. Still, plenty of titles inspired by gaming greats have managed to carve out a space in the industry thanks to the quality of the experience they offer.</p>
<p>This definitely feels like it will be the case with Steel Seed, a stealth action-adventure game in development by Storm in a Teacup, a small Italian development studio that has released some pretty unique indie games like N.E.R.O. - Nothing Ever Remains Obscure, Enki, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/close-to-the-sun-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Close to the Sun</a>, which attempted to do something different from the norm to varying degrees of success. With their latest game, on the other hand, the Italian studio seems to be playing it a little safely, as Steel Seed is a game that draws inspiration from other linear action-adventure titles like the Uncharted and the Star Wars Jedi series, featuring some light platforming and parkour and a combat system that's vaguely reminiscent of a Soulslike game. This, however, could be the best for the game.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250306164231_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While the experience felt almost immediately familiar in the short 20-minute-long demo I had the chance to try, the combination of elements from different games and their quality is sure to set the game apart from its illustrious inspirations. Set in a dark sci-fi world where humanity is on the brink of destruction, Zoe wakes herself up from what felt like a very long slumber to discover herself changed with a robotic body that grants her abilities far superior to those of a regular human. Lost in a world she doesn't recognize, Zoe sets out together with the mysterious drone KOBY to find her father and obtain the answers she seeks, only that this new world she woke up in won't make it very easy for her, as it is filled with machines out to take her down.</p>
<p>Steel Seed is clearly going for a cinematic approach, which feels well-realized already a few minutes into the adventure with some impressive set pieces like a giant robot going after Zoe and her companion drone, but developer Storm in a Teacup is clearly doing things right regarding gameplay as well. While the game employs a Soulslike combat system without a stamina system with light and heavy attacks and dodging, which can become a perfect dodge when timed correctly, as the sole defensive option, at least in the beginning, it implements these features well, thanks to how enemies react to hits, and how responsive Zoe feels to control. The challenge level also seems to be on point, as the enemies in the first area hit hard and don't just stand still taking hits. Over the course of the adventure, it will be possible to expand Zoe's skills to perform more complex maneuvers that will make combat feel more varied than in the first few minutes of the adventure.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250306164614_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Another big part of the Steel Seed experience will be the stealth mechanics, which also felt well put together in the short demo I played. Moving from one cover to another, Zoe will have to be extra careful avoiding and taking enemies down with instant takedowns, as their AI is mostly on point, making them react properly to Zoe's presence and alerting others in case she is found out. Overall, the stealth mechanics at the beginning of the game are somewhat straightforward, but they are well put together, and they are sure to evolve over the course of the game with more complex level design and an increased involvement of KOBY, who will be able to scan the environment unseen to help Zoe plan a course of action. Best of all, stealth sequences don't seem forced, although going straight for the enemy will put Zoe at a clear disadvantage due to the enemies' higher numbers.</p>
<p><iframe title="Steel Seed | Release Date Announcement Trailer | Coming April 10 | Demo Available Now" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fCuNl3h0IJ8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With an interesting setting that sets up some compelling mysteries right off the bat, great responsiveness, solid gameplay mechanics, and some impressive visuals powered by Unreal Engine 5, Steel Seed has the chance of becoming one of the surprises of this packed 2025. I did not know anything about the game, but the short demo I tried was enough to make me very interested in a game I feel will surprise many when it launches later this year on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has a new update that makes copious little and large changes to the popular animal-hitting sim. As often with PC game patch notes, the changelog is a balance of mealy fare such as fixes for broken <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-best-weapons-tier-list">weapons</a>, and moments of absurdity, such as addressing a problem whereby you'd hack the tail off an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-ajarakan-tips-weaknesses-rewards-how-to-beat">Ajarakan</a> only for it to transform into another monster's appendage. Also, you'll no longer be able to cheese the Gore Magala by somehow dropping a dozen boulders on it simultaneously.</p><!--more-->
<p>The update notes in question are to be found on <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/support/wilds/en/faq/detail/060">Capcom's FAQ for currently known issues</a>. The list of technical problems addressed as of today, 10th March include the "Grill a Meal" and "Ingredient Center" features not unlocking, the Field Guide becoming inaccessible, players falling through the map during the mission "Toward Fervent Fields", NPCs not appearing in "A World Turned Upside Down", tutorials repeating themselves, Lance Power Guards and mantles not activating properly, Insect Glaive offset attacks causing your hunter to space out, force quits due to a screen rendering bug, and wait, stop! I'm just listing and rewording them all. So much for not letting the AIs take my job.</p>
<p>Let's skip to the highlights. Firstly, they've fixed a problem where "some environmental features such as floating rubbles" could be exploited several times. I've never managed this myself, but I've now looked up <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MHWilds/comments/1j7w7m1/floating_rubbles_you_will_be_missed/">a relevant player video on reddit</a> and well, that's not how you're supposed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-hirabami-tips-weaknesses-rewards-how-to-beat">to beat Hirabami</a>. Can't fault the effectiveness, though.</p>
<p>Secondly, they've nobbled that issue with hacked-off monster parts transforming into parts from other monsters - <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MHWilds/comments/1j2xurg/monsters_dropping_the_wrong_parts/">see this video</a>, in which a dismembered Ajarakan obstinately poops out pieces of Gravios. I take a fiendish delight in this bug inasmuch as Capcom have accidentally gone full Monster Gacha machine. Monster Hunter is, in my experience, pretty gentle with its randomised loot drops, but who knows, perhaps this is secretly them testing a wonderful, magical omnibeast with three rotating eyes and one big arm you yank with your slinger to make assorted wyvern kidneys fall out the bottom.</p>
<p>The FAQ also spotlights a few Monster Hunter Wilds bugs they're still working on. These include network errors when firing an SOS flare right after a quest begins, link members (aka, people you've formed a regular four-person hunting party with) not being prioritised when deciding which players appear in base camps, Palico blunt weapons failing to inflict stun and exhaust, and problems with your profile not being editable and certain side missions being unfinishable.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds continues to be a Steam favourite. I confess, I've drifted away since last week, but that is simply because I am a news shark who must keep swimming forward to the next big release, or else succumb to a deluge of floating boulders. How are you getting on with it, if you're still playing?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

With the Switch 2 looming later in 2025, this is likely the last year we’ll see Nintendo develop and publish most of its games on the handheld hybrid that revolutionized how we play console-quality games. Over those eight years, Nintendo has put out some exceptional games from its stable of legacy franchises, and also created a handful of new ones that could stand the test of time. But what were the best of the best? Setting aside the games that are just straight remakes or re-releases (with an exception or two, noted in the text), here’s our ranking of the 30 best games Nintendo released on the Switch from its debut in 2017 to the present day.</p></div><div><p>Most of us played <em>1-2 Switch </em>because we needed something to play with friends who didn’t want to sit around watching us play <em>Breath of the Wild</em>. The mini-game collection is pretty much a Switch tech demo that almost feels like a <em>WarioWare </em>game but not as good or memorable. Still, it’s a fun time killer when you don’t have anything else to play on your Switch. Luckily, a lot has happened in the eight years since, like every other game on this list. </p></div><div><p><em>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition</em> is a compilation of bite-sized speedrunning challenges lifted straight from Nintendo’s releases for its very first console. It has selections from the original <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>, the first <em>Legend of Zelda</em>, and much more, and packages them in a way that requires you to constantly rethink levels you’ve likely played hundreds of times over the past 40 years. As Carolyn Petit <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-world-championships-nes-review-online-1851602392&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-world-championships-nes-review-online-1851602392">wrote when the collection came out</a></span>, “Repeatedly, <em>Nintendo World Championships</em> thrilled me by giving me exciting new ways to tackle games that I’ve been intimately familiar with for most of my life, and I suspect that I’ll continue having fun going back to it for some time and trying to improve my rating in some of the game’s many challenges.” Unfortunately, as she also notes, it lacks leaderboards for its individual challenges, eliminating the opportunity for fierce competition with friends that could have made this release an essential throwback instead of merely a novel curiosity. </p></div><div><p>The <em>Mario Party</em> series is, in a word, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-party-jamboree-switch-reviews-metacritic-1851673386&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-party-jamboree-switch-reviews-metacritic-1851673386">divisive</a></span>. <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree </em>isn’t any different. It’s got some great mini-games mixed in with some bad, some boards are a nightmare to play through while others are a breezy trip around the block, and ultimately how you feel about all of that will be determined by whether you’re playing with people who are good sports or the gamer equivalent of an angry wasp who knows nothing but how to pester you for your coins and stars. After nearly 30 years, <em>Mario Party </em>has iterated on its systems and polished away some of the rough edges that sometimes made these games miserable, but for all that refinement, its core impact remains largely unchanged: getting people to go from agreeable friends to sworn enemies with one roll of a die.</p></div><div><p>Seeing Princess Peach get to star in her own game for the first time in ages is certainly welcome, but sadly <em>Princess Peach: Showtime </em>ends up feeling secondary to its <em>Super Mario </em>counterparts. It has cool ideas like giving Peach different costumes and personas to don that also grant her new abilities, but it’s hampered by a simple platforming that doesn’t match the thrills of the <em>Mario </em>games. Hopefully next time Peach gets a starring role the game is up to snuff, and importantly, doesn’t take nearly another 20 years to come out. </p></div><div><p><em>Nintendo Switch Sports</em> had some massive shoes to fill as a successor to <em>Wii Sports</em>. The motion-controlled sports collection didn’t become the household name that its predecessor did, but that’s a tall ask considering <em>Wii Sports </em>was packaged in with Wii systems. By the time <em>Nintendo Switch Sports </em>launched in 2022, the novelty of the premise was dead and gone, but if you’re open to it again nearly 20 years later, you’ll find <em>Nintendo Switch Sports </em>is a fun party game evocative of a different era in Nintendo’s history. It’s a bit unremarkable, but it gets the nostalgic job done with a bit of modern flair. </p></div><div><p><em>ARMS</em> is one of the few new IPs Nintendo invested in for the Switch, and it’s also one of the more underrated games on the system. Its eccentric brand of stretchy, midrange melee combat isn’t quite as deep as the brawling in its fighting game contemporaries, but it is novel and stylish, and could have been a springboard for a better sequel. Though <em>ARMS</em> lives on thanks to fighter Min-Min’s inclusion in the <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> roster, it seems the series has largely been forgotten by Nintendo. Hopefully that changes with the Switch 2, because there’s potential here. </p></div><div><p><em>Nintendo Labo </em>is one of the more oddball experiments the company tried out with the Switch. The toys-to-life cardboard cut-out kits let users assemble handmade peripherals such as a fishing rod, a piano, and a toy car, each taking advantage of the Joy-Con controllers and the Switch itself to create truly original experiences you wouldn’t find on any other platform. Labo is an interesting use of the Switch’s tech, and it’s a shame we haven’t gotten more “throwing spaghetti at the walls” projects like it. Maybe Nintendo will have more ideas like it with the Switch 2's technical upgrades. </p></div><div><p>When I was in college, I didn’t have a real exercise routine. I would run laps around the neighborhood, but that wasn’t the launching pad I needed to actually adopt a healthier lifestyle. <em>Ring Fit Adventure </em>launched shortly after I graduated, and while I don’t play the fitness RPG anymore, I don’t think I would have moved onto more impactful exercise routines without it. The first time I played Nintendo’s exercise game, I woke up the next morning sore in a way I’d never been. This game doesn’t put on kid gloves and tell you to just jog-in-place your way to the end of a dungeon, it uses its titular Ring to make you push, pull, twist, and otherwise contort yourself into different poses to take down in-game foes, all with the goal of creating a regular gamified workout routine. Sometimes all you’ve gotta do to get someone to make a lifestyle change is make it a video game first. Now, I’m a self-taught gym rat, and I would probably have never gotten to that point without playing this game. </p></div><div><p><em>Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics</em> is a beast of a compilation. As the name implies, the collection includes 51 selections from the realms of board games, card games, and beyond. As Mike Fahey put it when he <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendos-new-clubhouse-games-is-a-damn-fine-collection-1843582587&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendos-new-clubhouse-games-is-a-damn-fine-collection-1843582587">wrote about the collection</a></span>, “<em>Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics</em> is no cheap-and-dirty mini-game bundle. It’s a polished collection of beloved multi and single-player card, dice, board, and sports games in a wonderfully presented package. It’s good stuff. <em>Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics </em>doesn’t just collect games, it celebrates them, teaches them, and helps keep their legacies alive.”</p></div><div><p>We often forget when recalling the Switch’s incredible first year launch lineup that <em>Xenoblade Chronicles 2</em> was part of the party. Monolith Soft’s sequel to the late-era Wii exclusive took the open-world RPG to the skies for a beautiful, sprawling, somewhat uneven adventure. Building on its predecessor, it married more engaging combat with even deeper progression mechanics to yield interesting exploration and fun battles, held back only by the annoying gacha mechanic underlying the game’s blade spirit system. The sky pirate fantasy about an orphaned salvager named Rex who battles an evil empire took narrative swings that didn’t always land and the characters were weak, but the overall package wasn’t without its charms. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p>It was wonderful to see the princess, for the first time, take the starring role in a proper <em>Zelda </em>game  instead of just being the series’ namesake (and no, we don’t count the CD-i games in which she was playable). Unfortunately, not unlike the aforementioned <em>Princess Peach: Showtime </em>existing in the shadow of Mario’s exploits, while <em>Echoes of Wisdom </em>has some novel ideas, it also can’t quite hold a candle to the kinds of adventures Link gets to headline. The one-two punch of B-tier, female-focused games in the span of six months had the unfortunate effect of making it seem like Nintendo really doesn’t think its leading ladies are ready for prime time. — Carolyn Petit </p></div><div><p>It’s sad that it took nearly ten years for us to get another<em> </em>game in this consistently delightful series. <em>Pikmin 4</em> continues the series’ trend of being an approachable but reasonably challenging spin on the RTS genre, all while letting you watch in horror as the titular little guys drown, get crushed, and fall to their deaths. Try not to let too many of them meet such a fate, though, or you’ll be out of resources as you try to move treasures to your ship, take down giant foes, and engage in the whimsical camaraderie of having dozens of adorable little bug-like creatures to vibe with.<em> Pikmin </em>isn’t the biggest of Nintendo’s franchises, which is probably why we’ve only gotten four of them on consoles in over 20 years. But every time one shows up, it’s wonderful, and<em> Pikmin 4</em> is no exception. </p></div><div><p>I always recalled the original <em>Luigi’s Mansion </em>on GameCube as being a bit divisive, but perhaps that perception came from it not quite getting the kind of glowing praise usually reserved for the mainline <em>Mario </em>platformers. As the spooky spin-off series has gone on, it’s only gotten better as Nintendo massaged the original concept and riffed on it in fun, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/we-stared-into-gooigis-cold-murderous-eyes-1835459296&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/we-stared-into-gooigis-cold-murderous-eyes-1835459296">often memeable ways</a></span>. As Chris Kohler wrote in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/luigis-mansion-3-is-an-eerie-delight-from-the-lobby-to-1839360620&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/luigis-mansion-3-is-an-eerie-delight-from-the-lobby-to-1839360620"><em>Kotaku</em>’s original review</a></span>, “It’s the sheer variety of experiences in <em>Luigi’s Mansion 3</em> that keeps it entertaining throughout. While you might at first think you’re in for a repetitive time as you go through the first few floors and find nothing but standard hotel rooms, things get quite unexpected as you continue higher and higher. While it doesn’t reinvent the wheel, it’s a solid take on a series that hasn’t had many entries over the last nearly 20 years. Mostly, it’s just nice to see that Luigi is indeed alive, and not dead.”</p></div><div><p>The <em>Splatoon </em>franchise has pretty rapidly gone from being a new, unproven series on the Wii U to giving us one of the most popular multiplayer games on the Switch, which is no small feat. <em>Splatoon 3</em> offered up a meaningful iteration on the first two games’ Turf War wall-painting mechanics and kept people engaged for months with regular Splatfest competitions that became mini-online wars over the silliest debates, and the appeal is no mystery; effortlessly moving through the ink you leave all over the map is still a delight. As Ari Notis <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-21-best-games-for-the-nintendo-switch-1794881447&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-21-best-games-for-the-nintendo-switch-1794881447">once wrote</a></span>, “If <em>Splatoon 3</em> doesn’t win you over to Nintendo’s take on the world of competitive shooters, nothing will. This third game in the ink-splattering sequel has something for everyone, from an endearing single-player campaign, to raucous showdowns against giant enemy salmon. It improves or expands on just about everything from the previous game without getting too overwhelming or losing its soul in the process, still focused on two teams trying to coat a location in their color of ink. The online connectivity can still be a mess, but the amount of character customization and player self-expression takes the social shooter to a whole new level. There’s even an in-universe collectible card game. It’s <em>Splatoon 3</em>’s world, we’re just living in it.”</p></div><div><p>The <em>Paper Mario </em>series has had a bit of an identity crisis over the years. Where once they were known as turn-based RPGs with a focus on well-timed input commands, we’ve since gotten a platformer and an action-adventure game that bear the <em>Paper Mario </em>moniker and signature visual style. <em>The Origami King </em>tries to find a happy middle ground between everything <em>Paper Mario </em>has ever been, and the result is a delightful sequel, albeit a potentially aggravating one that doesn’t commit to the tried-and-true turn-based formula of the series’ most beloved entries. As Chris Kohler wrote in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/paper-mario-the-origami-king-the-kotaku-review-1844379684&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/paper-mario-the-origami-king-the-kotaku-review-1844379684"><em>Kotaku</em>’s review</a></span>, “I’m not sure why Nintendo feels that <em>Paper Mario</em> can’t be a role-playing game: What exactly was the issue with the original games, which were widely praised and sold very well? But the major issue for me was not that Nintendo removed the series’ RPG mechanics, but that what it replaced them with was not as good. <em>Origami King</em> might not be the successor to <em>Thousand-Year Door</em> for which fans have been clamoring, but this time the formula works, allowing the series’ great writing and worlds to shine through.”</p></div><div><p>It’s fun to think about how if you’re ever hankering for another one of Mario’s run-and-jump adventures, you could just open up <em>Super Mario Maker 2 </em>and find an endless treasure trove of levels you’ve never experienced before. As a creation tool, <em>Super Mario Maker 2 </em>is full of new options and features to help you create the <em>Mario </em>levels of your dreams. As a nearly limitless archive of fan-created levels and challenges, the average <em>Mario </em>fan who has no interest in making their own stages still has a ton to get out of it.</p></div><div><p><em>Kirby </em>spin-offs have been 3D before, but <em>Forgotten Land </em>marks the first time the main platformer series has made the jump. Its open areas and possession mechanics feel inspired by <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, and though the pink puffball doesn’t quite reach the same highs, <em>Forgotten Land </em>still has a lot of charm, challenge, and creativity in its DNA. The Mouthful Mode in which Kirby tries to devour things he can’t quite fit in his gaping maw and then uses them for his own goals is still one of the funniest things to be announced during a Nintendo Direct, and it’s a clever feature that riffs on Kirby’s most recognizable trait: eating people and things and using them or their defining characteristics to his own advantage. <em>Forgotten Land </em>is a great spin on old ideas, and I can’t wait to see the series get even more creative as it further explores a 3D design space.</p></div><div><p><em>Metroid Dread</em> is at its best when it leans into how dangerous Samus Aran’s intergalactic exploits truly are. The sidescroller’s most memorable encounters are the ones in which the bounty hunter makes it out by the skin of her teeth, having barely scraped by without her fully-equipped combat suit and all her tools at her disposal. As Carolyn Petit wrote <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metroid-dread-the-kotaku-review-1847823602&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-dread-the-kotaku-review-1847823602">in the <em>Kotaku</em> review</a></span>, “I’m glad that<em> Dread</em> really goes for it, that it wants to make you feel hunted and disadvantaged and that it’s willing to feel hostile in order to accomplish that. The result is a feeling that survival itself is a reward more meaningful than all the upgrades in the world, a feeling I rarely get from games anymore.”</p></div><div><p><em>Xenoblade Chronicles 3</em> felt like a do-over in more ways than one. It took learnings from Monolith’s previous games and used them to turn the blueprint for the original <em>Xenoblade Chronicles</em> into a full-fledged open-world RPG that didn’t just feel like beautiful skyboxes over mostly empty fields. The combat is finely tuned, the characters are great, and the story about child soldiers is the best Monolith has ever produced. <em>Xenoblade Chronicles 3</em> tells an evocative tale of friendship, betrayal, and existential fear with one of the best party-based real-time hybrid combat systems around, and the studio’s obsession with baroque skill trees and stat augmenting systems is kept mostly in check. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p>When Nintendo said “Everyone is here,” they meant everyone. <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em>’s bonkers roster of 89 playable characters is an achievement, albeit a nightmare to balance. A common experience of disappointment among fighting game fans is seeing the next game in a series you love get announced, but your main not make the roster.. <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate </em>says “eff that” and brings back every single character from previous entries, creating a remarkable class reunion of the most iconic heroes and villains of Nintendo’s history. The guest characters, like the long-dormant Banjo-Kazooie and the unexpected Sora from <em>Kingdom Hearts</em>, are wild, and damn, that Joker reveal the night before launch got me to leave my house and buy a copy at midnight. <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate </em>was an ongoing cultural event for so long that, much like <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>, I can’t quite imagine how Nintendo is going to follow it up on the Switch 2. Maybe after all this expansion, a return to basics is what the series needs. </p></div><div><p>Before <em>Wonder </em>came along, it had been a while since the 2D<em> Mario</em> games had gotten a real upgrade, and while this one isn’t necessarily a revelation, it is the most interesting 2D platformer the plumber has given us in a hot minute. With new power-ups like the Elephant Fruit and level-altering Wonder Seeds, <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> knows how to maintain what makes the series so beloved while also keeping long-time fans on their toes. </p></div><div><p>Once trapped on the Wii U, <em>Super Mario 3D World </em>departed from the likes of <em>Super Mario 64 </em>and <em>Galaxy </em>to give us a game that fused the sensibilities of the series’ early 2D games with 3D gameplay. It deserved to reach a wider audience, and thankfully Nintendo liberated it from the library of that poorly selling console, sweetening the pot in the process by packing in a compact, experimental new adventure (which is why it’s included on this list). <em>Bowser’s Fury </em>adapts <em>3D World</em>’s new costumes and mechanics for an open-world game starring Mario and Bowser Jr., and right from the get-go it establishes a sense of scale unlike anything in the base game. When you start it up and immediately see a giant, terrifying kaiju version of Bowser unleashing fireballs at you like a final boss, it’s genuinely chilling, and establishes that this isn’t just another run-of-the-mill <em>Mario </em>adventure. <em>Bowser’s Fury </em>is a bite-sized experience, but it gives us a lot to chew on as we consider what the future of 3D Mario might look like.</p></div><div><p>If you owned a Switch in 2020, chances are you were playing <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em>. If you didn’t own a Switch before the latest entry in Nintendo’s beloved life sim series launched right at the beginning of the covid-19 lockdowns, you may have bought one so you could maintain some semblance of human interaction. <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons </em>is an often cumbersome game, so much so that there are <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auTi3stuL5M&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auTi3stuL5M" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fake Nintendo Directs</a></span> made to illustrate all the bare minimum improvements fans hoped for but Nintendo never actually implemented. Even so, <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons </em>represents one of the quintessential “you had to be there” moments in video game history. Words alone can’t capture how unifying it was to go to your friends’ islands when we couldn’t see each other anywhere else. <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons </em>may be clunky, but it was also a creative and social outlet for millions of people when we needed it most. It’s easily one of the most important games on the Switch. </p></div><div><p>It’s a bit maddening that Game Freak put out one of the most significant leaps forward the <em>Pokémon </em>series has ever seen with <em>Legends: Arceus</em>, but hasn’t looked to it as a template for the future. Taking <em>Pokémon </em>to a historical period before Pokémon gyms and criminal organizations existed let Game Freak design an action/turn-based hybrid RPG unlike anything the series had seen before. Its catching mechanics are unmatched, the changes it makes to the turn-based battles add new layers of strategy, and its story is some of the best narrative work Game Freak has ever pulled off. <em>Legends: Arceus </em>marks the first time since I was a kid that the <em>Pokémon </em>world felt big and unknowable. I’m excited for <em>Legends: Z-A</em>, but I don’t know if it’s going to feel the same without all that historical intrigue. </p></div><div><p>There aren’t many games that have inspired the level of fandom fervor that <em>Fire Emblem: Three Houses </em>has. Six years after its release, the question of whether or not Edelgard is a war criminal is still a touchy subject. Intelligent Systems’ first Switch game, developed in collaboration with Koei Tecmo’s Kou Shibusawa team, redefined what <em>Fire Emblem </em>was for a lot of fans. Though there’s some discussion to be had about whether its tactical combat is up to snuff compared to that of its predecessors, the school life and social sim elements are some of the most entertaining and endearing in the genre. Characters like the suave Claude, the honorable Dimitri (until, y’know, he’s not anymore), and the aforementioned war criminal Edelgard have essentially become the modern faces of the <em>Fire Emblem </em>franchise. There was a whole other <em>Fire Emblem </em>on the Switch in <em>Engage</em>, but we’re still talking about <em>Three Houses</em>. </p></div><div><p>In many cases, Nintendo porting a game from the Wii U to the Switch felt like the company was putting them on a lifeboat so they could escape a sinking ship. <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe </em>is one of those rescues, but it’s also so much more (which is why it’s on this list). The kart racer was ported to the Switch just a month after the console launched in 2017; it’s now been nearly eight years since that day and Nintendo is still adding new content to the 11-year-old game. <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe </em>is the best-selling game on the Switch, with a whopping 67.35 million copies sold as of 2020, and when you’ve got that big of a success story, adding a ton of new playable characters, courses, and modes is a no-brainer. Nintendo has announced that a new <em>Mario Kart </em>game is coming to the Switch 2, and considering that it’s following up one of the most feature-complete games in its genre, it’s going to have some huge shoes to fill.</p></div><div><p>Eight years later, I still get the <em>Super Mario Odyssey </em>bop <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1IHvzwUd6w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1IHvzwUd6w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Jump Up, Super Star”</a></span> stuck in my head from time to time. Every <em>Mario </em>game has to find some way to make the series’ winning run-and-jump formula fresh and exciting, and <em>Odyssey</em>’s big mechanical change was pretty transformative. Giving Mario’s hat eyes and letting you throw it on objects to take control of them adds a completely new dimension to a <em>Mario </em>level. There are over <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/every-super-mario-odyssey-transformation-ranked-1826833661&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/every-super-mario-odyssey-transformation-ranked-1826833661">50 different objects</a></span> Mario can control, and half the fun of <em>Odyssey </em>is testing the limits of what the game will let you do. I was surprised when I was able to possess random objects like cars, as well as enemies I’d only ever fought over years of playing these games. Those magical moments are sprinkled throughout <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, reinvigorating a series that you might think would start running out of gas at this point, and it all culminates in an amazing finale that pays off in an incredible way on both <em>Odyssey</em>’s core mechanic and Mario’s long-time rivalry with the Koopa king.</p></div><div><p> It’s hard to fully get perspective on just how influential <em>Breath of the Wild </em>has been when the ramifications of its arrival are still rippling throughout the realm of game design. With this incredible release Nintendo reinvented its own flagship fantasy series, integrating deep systems into its world in ways that make it feel stunningly alive, a place packed with incredible interactions and discoveries rather than just a map filled with icons to clear. At a point in time when many AAA games are trying to be these massive, life-sucking, open-world time wasters, <em>Breath of the Wild</em> stands as a testament to a concept of open-world design that’s not about simply cramming a map with objectives to complete but making the world so interactive and responsive and surprising that you naturally want to spend time there, just playing and experimenting and discovering.</p></div><div><p>Following up <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, one of the defining games of the last decade, is no small task, but<em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> builds upon <em>Breath of the Wild</em>’s foundations to stunning effect. The first game asks you to explore its open world to your heart’s content. <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> asks you to build something in all the empty spaces. Nintendo looked at the previous game’s themes and traversal and, instead of making the world bigger for the sake of it, chose to find new ways to extrapolate those ideas into something altogether different.</p><p><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> is all about experimentation, creative thinking, and problem-solving, and no two people play it the same way. I remember being in Discord calls playing the game alongside friends and it took days or weeks for some of us to come across certain storylines and characters others encountered right away because the paths we took were so vastly different. Then we used the Ultrahand mechanic to build vehicles, platforms, and other tools to solve puzzles with solutions that hadn’t crossed each other’s minds. Sharing a <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> clip is like presenting an art piece all one’s own, as people’s stunts, creations, and solutions were expressions of their creativity. <em>Breath of the Wild</em> told players to go wherever they wanted, and then <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> asked them to find a new way to get there. Like its predecessor, it will no doubt be hugely influential to the next generation of open-world games, perhaps in ways that we can’t yet begin to imagine.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While his dark past with the Bridges organization was teased, it's the brief moment where Neil dons a bandana that had Metal Gear Solid fans pointing at their screens:</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4456523-death-starnding-snake.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4456523" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4456523-death-starnding-snake.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4456523"></a><figcaption>Solid Snake, is that you?</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4456523-death-starnding-snake.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4456524-deathstranding2%282%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4456522-deathstranding2%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4456524,1300-4456522" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4456524-deathstranding2%282%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4456522-deathstranding2%283%29.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4456524-deathstranding2%282%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4456522-deathstranding2%283%29.jpg"></figure><p>As seen in the image above, Neil looks remarkably similar to Solid Snake once he dresses up for a fight. Back in a 2020 Instagram post, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CDMIVpVnef5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kojima mentioned that Marinelli</a> would be the "spitting image" of Snake if he ever decided to wear the character's bandana, and it looks like that prediction has come true in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-story-theories-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516214/" data-ref-id="1100-6516214">Death Stranding 2</a>.</p><p>What's also interesting to note here is that the character is flanked by several soldiers, similar to how Death Stranding's antagonist Clifford Unger would surround himself with troops whenever he appeared in the game. That suggests that Neil has died and has become a post-death entity, someone who finds himself driven to complete his unfinished business and can journey to battlefield beaches.</p><p>Another reference to Metal Gear Solid can be seen in the brief scene where Heartman takes control of the DHV Magellan submersible, fusing it with a gigantic entity from the tar to take on other titans. Yoji Shinkawa, who was the art director on 1998's Metal Gear Solid, also worked on Death Stranding 2 so it's not too surprising to see a few visual callbacks with the design of the Magellan.</p><p>There's also a hint of Pacific Rim in the control interface here for Magellan Man, which is a nice allusion to the film's director and Deadman's visual inspiration, Guillermo del Toro.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4456525-deathstranding2%284%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4456525" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4456525-deathstranding2%284%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4456525"></a><figcaption>Magellan Man is ready to rumble.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4456525-deathstranding2%284%29.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4456528-deathstranding2%288%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4456526-deathstranding2%285%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4456527-deathstranding2%286%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4456528,1300-4456526,1300-4456527" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4456528-deathstranding2%288%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4456526-deathstranding2%285%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4456527-deathstranding2%286%29.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4456528-deathstranding2%288%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4456526-deathstranding2%285%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4456527-deathstranding2%286%29.jpg"></figure><p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach will launch for PS5 on June 26, and anyone who purchases the digital deluxe or collector's edition can start playing two days early on June 24.</p>

            <p><strong>UPDATE 2.30pm UK:</strong> Nintendo's Alarmo is on general sale now worldwide.</p>
<p>Previously only available for Nintendo Switch Online members, the clock is available for all exclusively on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Hardware/Nintendo-Sound-Clock-Alarmo/Nintendo-Sound-Clock-Alarmo-2670177.html">My Nintendo Store</a> in the UK and Ireland. It's also on general sale on the European and American My Nintendo Stores.</p>
<p>Emails were sent over the weekend to customers notifying them of the change. Perhaps Nintendo only updated its notice earlier today in Japan due to the popularity of the product there in comparison to the rest of the world.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>ORIGINAL STORY 12pm UK:</strong> Nintendo has announced its Alarmo clock will be available on general sale in Japan in May.</p>
<p>Previously, only Nintendo Switch Online members have been able to order the alarm clock worldwide, though in Japan a lottery system was put in place due to its popularity.</p>
<p>A wider launch of the clock was expected in mid-January, but this was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-hits-snooze-on-alarmos-public-release">later postponed to early March</a> due to stock shortages. The clock will finally be ready for general sale in May - but only in Japan.</p>

<p>Nintendo Japan added an update to its <a href="https://support.nintendo.com/jp/information/2024/1204.html">Alarmo notice</a>, stating the launch date for non-members will be 22nd May 2025, both from the My Nintendo Store and game retailers. Pre-orders will open before this, though a date is unknown.</p>
<p>So far this is only in Japan, but presumably news of a worldwide general release will follow.</p> <div>

<p>First revealed in October, the Alarmo is an interactive alarm clock that responds to your body's movements by playing different sounds based on Nintendo video games.</p>
<p>Indeed, Nintendo has today added classic sound effects from Super Mario Bros. on the NES to the device, available to download for free.</p>

<p>Last month, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-coming-in-june-at-400-former-nintendo-employee-predicts">former Nintendo employee</a> - sales lead in the sales and retail department - suggested the Alarmo release being tied to Nintendo Online accounts may have been an intentional test ahead of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> pre-orders.</p>
<p>Switch 2 is yet to have its release date announced. Perhaps the general sale of Alarmo in May will free up Nintendo's online store for the new console.</p>
<p>"Alarmo's clever motion sensor is the star of the show in this pricey Nintendo-coated lifestyle gadget that otherwise skimps on the fun," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-alarmo-review-marios-charm-cant-justify-alarm-clocks-90-price-tag">Alarmo review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>One of my favourite things in the entire world is the brash poetry inherent in the word 'skyscraper', and the many writing and language lessons gleaned from considering how utterly mundane that word actually feels to use. This week, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cities-skylines">Cities: Skylines</a> community join me in the "probably thinking too much about skyscrapers" club. Paradox's city <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a> has turned ten.</p>
<p>To celebrate, they've <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/cities-skylines-ii/cities-skylines-anniversary">constructed a towering roadmap of freebies</a> for it and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cities-skylines-2">Cities: Skylines 2</a>, including new radio stations, new content, and a free-to-play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/949230/view/542225339665876198">Steam event</a> for the original running March 20-24.</p>

<p>Some<a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/cities-skylines-ii/news/ten-years-of-cities-skylines"> blogly</a> musings:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We founded Colossal Order with the dream of creating a city-builder that would bring more freedom and creativity to the cities players can build. With Cities: Skylines, that dream not only came true, but thanks to the continued support of our amazing fans, we had the opportunity to keep growing and building this game and community many years after its release and take it even further than anticipated. It's been an incredible journey that's taught us so much - and still has more to teach - and we are forever grateful to everyone who made it possible and who joined us along the way.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Cities: Skylines has continued to receive updates throughout the years, the most recent being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skylines-latest-dlc-came-out-this-week-18-months-after-its-final-dlc-came-out-last-year">last October</a>. Its sequel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skylines-2-review">launched in a rough state</a> a year prior, though has seen <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-six-months-of-renovations-cities-skyline-2-performance-is-considerably-less-terrible">some improvements since</a>. It's also seen some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skylines-2-devs-apologise-for-rushed-dlc-offer-refunds-promise-conciliatory-fan-summit">controversy surrounding "rushed" DLC</a>, and still looks a ways off from overtaking the original in both popularity and reception.</p>
<p>Paradox have fessed up to misjudging the impact of Skylines 2's launch technical shortcomings. Players are now "less accepting that you will fix things over time," Paradox CEO Mattias Lilja <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/players-are-now-less-accepting-that-games-will-be-fixed-say-paradox-after-underestimating-the-reaction-to-cities-skyline-2s-performance-woes">told Edwin last year</a>, with CCO Henrik Fåhraeus commenting seperately that "we were aware that performance was not great, but we underestimated how it will be perceived by players." </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/there-is-nothing-beyond-this-point-except-a-promisingly-odd-metroidvania-about-exploring-the-void<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
One of my Foundational Video Games is <a href="https://www.macintoshrepository.org/4498-mazeworld-the-ghost-of-mordaine">Mazeworld</a>, an elder Apple Macintosh first-personifier in which you explore a Carollian landscape of blue-walled darkness and rainbow-shelled snails. I was a young slip of a boy when Mazeworld released, and prone to daymares about crocodiles floating through the ceiling. Imagine my reaction to a game in which you are immediately confronted by a slathering, bodiless Cheshire Cat, its face a grinning smear that is only visible when it's charging right at you.
</p>
<p>
I'm always looking for games that similarly hide themselves, throwing you into a chasm of occult potentiality from which anything might emerge, given the appropriate rites. Games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nix-umbra-review-occult-horror-at-its-most-focused-and-intense">Nix Umbra</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-of-a-wish">Death Of A Wish</a> and now <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nothing-beyond-this-point">Nothing Beyond This Point</a>, a topdown metroidvania in which you are a flaming cube surrounded by floating rods, dropped into a pixelart-scuffed void. RPS reader Mr_B recommended it in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-are-we-all-playing-this-weekend-324?view=comments">our last weekend plays thread</a>, and I couldn't resist trying the demo.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The aforesaid void isn't quite a blob of bad vibes, in practice. It has structure and the suggestion of an orderly grand design. There are 16 areas divided into tacit rooms, with reassuring fixtures such as campfires. There are genre-familiar activities such as having to clear a room of foes before you can leave it, or choosing between three permanent power-ups at key junctures.</p>
<p>There is also a fair amount of Enigma, however. Some rooms wrap around themselves and can only be exited from a certain side. Campfires aren't just "access points" and "save points", they're there to provide "a false sense of security". There are sigils that can eventually be interacted with in the form of a doodling minigame, altering the environment. There are also three gods to find, and the rudiments of coherent places. At one point a disembodied voice started talking to me in garbled Cthulhu language, alluding to a distant obelisk. 
</p>
<p>
The combat is also quite ingenious so far. Basically, you're immortal as long as you're surrounded by floating rods, which dissolve when you take damage and can be regenerated by holding space - which locks you in place for a fateful second or two. Rods are also spent to perform special abilities such as fireballs and AOE blasts, so battles are inherently tenser and more focussed on resource management than in a lot of vanias. Enemies consist of crawling horrors, sniper ghosts, and mallet-wielding machines.
</p>
<p>
I do get some sense that Nothing Beyond This Point will resolve eventually into a straightforward game of room clearance, levelling, and boss battles (I broke off playing the demo after I was slain by a robot-building robot) but then again, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3321280/Nothing_Beyond_This_Point">the Steam page</a> cautions that "you've seen nothing yet". Haha, I don't see what they did there. I wonder if they have a Cheshire Cat. I wonder if they have crocodiles. Argh.

<p>Battlefield’s Factions determine which regions fight each other in matches. The concept has been around for decades, and Battlefield 6, which may release in 2025, will again feature waging Factions.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> could be pivotal for both EA and the storied shooter franchise. Recent Battlefield games haven’t fared too well. Battlefield 1 was solid, whereas Battlefield 5 focused too much on what fans didn’t ask for. On the other hand, Battlefield 2042 was the series’ comparison to jumping the shark.</p>



<p>2025 aims to bring Battlefield 6 and make it one of the best. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-sign-up-for-battlefield-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Labs</a> Factions have been the topic of conversation, so let’s dig into the latest details.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-factions-confirmed-so-far">Battlefield 6 Factions Confirmed so far</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Who will you fight? Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Battlefield 6’s 2025 pre-Alpha footage has shown NATO and what looks to be a PMC outfit called Pax Armata</strong> <strong>as the main opposing Factions.</strong></p>



<p>There are a few things to consider with Battlefield 6’s Factions so far. Firstly, this is a pre-Alpha, and it’s <strong>likely EA is using a ton of placeholders and unofficial names</strong> for now. The focus is on the gameplay, network connectivity, and overall game stability.</p>



<p>Given recent criticism of the franchise, it’s understandable if the multiple developers aren’t as bothered about the names of the game’s Factions for now. Secondly, don’t be surprised if EA does end up sticking with more generic Factions such as NATO and either an unnamed PMC (Private Military Company), or the generic use of “PMC” instead.</p>



<p>Real-life global tensions mean these decisions can’t be taken lightly. Battlefield 2042 did use “Russian Army,” “United States Marine Corps,” and “British Army,” but times change. So don’t be surprised to see Battlefield 6 adopt safe Faction names.</p>



<p>Even if Battlefield runs with NATO, you likely won’t be stuck with the same few default selections. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1j6wy6t/thats_a_union_flag_right/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">A Reddit post</a> has identified a Union Flag on a soldier’s uniform using the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-leaks-reveal-battlefield-4-vibe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 leaks</a>. This means there’s potential wiggle room for customization options. The OP for the post said: “I’m hoping Dice is brave and gives us some clear depictions of Russian, Chinese &amp; Iranian uniforms for the opfor Faction.”</p>



<p>Again, real-world scenarios and events have a bearing on how Battlefield 6’s final content looks. We’ll have to see how close EA and DICE push the boundaries.</p>



<hr>



<p>We’re still not 100% sure when Battlefield 6 is set to launch, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-launch-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA has claimed it will be before April 2026</a>. We’re still not ruling out a 2025 launch either. </p>



<p>What do you think of Battlefield Labs so far? Does the game look promising? Are we finally due a brilliant Battlefield game?</p>

            <p>Doom: The Dark Ages serves as a prequel to 2016's Doom and its sequel Doom Eternal, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-the-dark-ages-is-an-origin-story-for-the-doom-slayers-rage">tells the "epic cinematic origin story of the Doom Slayer's rage"</a>. But, even though it's a prequel, don't expect The Dark Ages to end with the Slayer being popped in a coffin.</p>
<p>As a reminder, 2016's Doom opens with the Slayer lying in a coffin, before he swiftly breaks free from the chains binding him so he can shoot the faces off advancing baddies. It is quite the way to kick things off.</p>
<p>So, if The Dark Ages is going to set us up for Doom 2016, surely we already know how the upcoming game is going to end, right? Wrong!</p>

<p>"I mean, that would end the Dark Ages, the medieval chapter of the Doom saga. This is kind of like the Chronicles of the Slayer," Doom: The Dark Ages game director Hugo Martin told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/doom-the-dark-ages-wont-end-with-the-slayer-in-a-coffin-waiting-for-the-start-of-doom-2016-that-would-mean-that-we-couldnt-tell-any-more-medieval-stories/">PC Gamer</a>, when asked about potentially seeing the Slayer getting locked away.</p>
<p>"So if we took it all the way to that point, then that would mean that we couldn't tell any more medieval stories. And I'm not announcing projects or anything other than to just say it's better to leave it open."</p>
<p>The game director added that the Doom: The Dark Ages team has some DLC planned for the prequel, so again putting the Slayer in a coffin during the main story wouldn't make sense.</p>
<p>"We do have a DLC and things like that, so it won't - I'm not giving away spoilers - but it doesn't end with him [in the coffin]," the developer continued.</p>
<p>"The story is that they collapsed a building on top of him and then put him inside of that sarcophagus that we find him in at the beginning of 2016," said Martin.</p>
<p>"And this game doesn't end that way."</p>

			<p>There are two castles, and that ‘V’ between them means that they’re not on the best of terms. You play cards from your deck in an effort to destroy the nefarious enemy castle. And… well, that’s just about the only the aim of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3398880/Castle_V_Castle/">Castle V Castle</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Castle V Castle | Official Game Reveal (Steam PC &amp; Mobile)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3WHiA2nZrRE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The demo that you can currently leap into as part of Steam Next Fest does away with any pretence of tutorials or storytelling, instead leaning on the idea that the title does both of those things. What more could you need to know?</p>


<p>Castle V Castle is a strategic resource management game, accruing enough of each to use in offense and defence against that vile enemy castle. There’s probably some deep-seated visual analogy for the fact that you and your enemies look identical, but I’ll let you mull that over on your own time.</p>
<p>These resources are broken down into separate sections, with your castle’s level prominently displayed at the top. You’ve then got Build, which displays the number of bricks you have, and the number of builders, followed by the Attack category which shows your soldiers and number of weapons. Finally, there’s Magic, which contains Witches and Magic Power.</p>

<p>Each of these can be utilised to grow your castle, expand defences, or go on the attack, whittling the enemy castle down faster than they whittle yours. It’s simple, but there’s a real push-and-pull between the two sides.</p>

<p>Successfully completing a stage grants you a reward chest or, if you’re unlucky, a cursed chest. Either will give you the choice between two permanent upgrades or curses, before sending you off again to fight the next castle. They really do throw them up these days, don’t they? As you progress you might have to decide whether to focus on magic or old fashioned sword-swinging, depending on the curses and boons you’ve chosen.</p>
<p>The biggest sticking point comes when you don’t have enough resources to play a card. Discarding one will see it replaced by another, but you also lose your turn so it can completely change the outcome of a round if you don’t get it right. I found it easier to get rid of higher value cards, focusing on easier to play, low value cards, but you miss out on the most powerful attacks if you do that, from whirling dervishes of knights, to a robot that counts down through ten rounds before annihilating you.</p>
<p>There’s a great sense of character here, despite the simple black and white visuals and focused gameplay. The demo is quite short – 20 minutes, if that – so it’s not a huge timesink to check out, and if it captures your attention, there’s a daily challenge that you can hop into each day. Castle V Castle is listed as a singleplayer title, but it feels like a natural fit for online multiplayer, which I hope is something the team at Nopopo consider. Either way, I can see it capturing a good number of players in its grey brick walls when it releases.</p>
<p>Castle V Castle is a smart spot of strategy, with a great aesthetic. It’s definitely one to keep an eye on.</p>
