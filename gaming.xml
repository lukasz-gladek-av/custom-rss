			<p>According to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-23/nintendo-says-demand-for-switch-2-console-in-japan-overwhelming?srnd=undefined">Bloomberg</a> report, analysts are expecting Nintendo to have &nbsp;6-8 million <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know-about-nintendos-new-console/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> units on hand for its June 5 launch. This would make it one of the biggest console launches in the video game industry's history.</p>
<p>Coming into 2025, everyone expected the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 to be one of the most significant events of the year. Demand for the Switch 2 has even exceeded Nintendo's expectations. In Japan alone, Nintendo received 2.2 million applications from consumers looking to grab a Switch 2 console.</p>
<p>Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa had to take to <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo/status/1914982671522083155">X</a> to formally apologize to players that "<em>a significant number of applicants won't be selected</em>" because the demand exceeded expectations. Bloomberg's report also notes that Nintendo is doing what it can to increase console production to meet the demand as best it can by June 5.</p>
<p>Pre-orders for the Nintendo Switch 2 only went live in the United States and Canada today, after having been <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-have-been-delayed-in-canada-thanks-to-us-tariffs/">delayed</a> due to tariffs announced by the U.S. Consumers looking to lock in their pre-orders<a href="https://x.com/spencerhakimian/status/1915257488703705328?s=46"> reported</a> that websites for retailers like Best Buy and Walmart crashed due to the overwhelming flood of traffic. The outages weren't too bad overall, as many people were still gleefully announcing they had grabbed a pre-order.</p>
<p>While the price of the Switch 2 and its games remains controversial for players, those who could grab a pre-order or buy it on day one are likely getting a better deal than those who choose to wait. Tariffs still loom over the console's pricing like a dark cloud, and we've already seen them impact the Switch 2, as Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-us-hardware-pricing-stays-the-same-accessories-bump/">increased the price</a> of several Switch 2 accessories as a response to tariffs.</p>
<p>The price of the console has stayed the same for now, but Nintendo stipulated that it could still increase in the future, "<em>depending on market conditions</em>."</p>

Some players argue that Strategist heroes are penalized by <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ ranking system, which prioritizes kill counts over other stats like healing or damage mitigated, unfairly penalizing players for focusing on keeping their teammates topped off rather than popping heads. Support heroes have also been on the receiving end of several nerfs over the course of the game’s first three seasons. Often the only thanks they get are harassment and blame from their teammates, all while content creators like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1FxkPCzRWM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1FxkPCzRWM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">streamer Necros</a></span> criticize support players on their platforms.</p><p>In a thread on the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1k5vjdy/the_support_strike_and_necros_comments_why_this/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1k5vjdy/the_support_strike_and_necros_comments_why_this/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Marvel Rivals </em>subreddit</a></span>, user Revolutionary-Ad6480 wrote about the strike and why attitudes like the one Necros expressed on his stream have so many Strategist players disillusioned with the game, saying that it points to a growing cultural problem within the community.</p><p>“We’re not asking to be glorified or seen as the ‘hardest’ role - because I don’t think we are,” they wrote. “We just want basic respect. It’s tiring to be called brain dead or worthless when your stats are solid and you’re playing your role the way it’s meant to be played.”</p><p>The movement has spread across other social media platforms, including X (formerly Twitter) and TikTok. However, there are a fair number of detractors casting doubts on the size of the movement, with several <em>Rivals </em>streamers making fun of the whole thing and calling it dramatic. As of yet, it’s unclear if the message is getting through to those in the community who need to hear it. Maybe those players will get it when they’ve got to swap over to Strategist themselves because nobody is healing.</p><p>For more on <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, check out <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975"><em>Kotaku</em>’s review</a></span>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A report said a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/there-is-a-fallout-3-remaster-in-the-works-but-its-not-arriving-anytime-soon-report/1100-6530903/" data-ref-id="1100-6530903">Fallout 3 remaster is coming</a>, and now one of the game's original designers, <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/16256/bruce-nesmith/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bruce Nesmith</a>, has commented on what he'd like to see from it.</p><p>Nesmith told <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/fallout-3-designer-expects-remaster-to-heavily-revise-gunplay/?utm_source=syndication&amp;pubDate=20250423" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Videogamer</a> that he'd like to see Fallout 3's gunplay improved upon to make it more like Fallout 4's. "[Fallout 3 combat] didn't hold up to shooters at the time," he said. "Also, it's an RPG shooter; it's not a run-and-gun shooter. But a lot of work was done on that for Fallout 4. So I anticipate seeing a lot of that work go into it, assuming they're doing the same thing."</p><p>Nesmith pointed out that Fallout 3 marked Bethesda's first big stab at a shooter-style game, and the gunplay was not ideal.</p><p>A Fallout 3 remaster could also beef up the visuals of the 2008 game, Nesmith said. The Oblivion remaster didn't just make the game visually in line with the 2011 version of Skyrim--it exceeded it, Nesmith said. He said he was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-oblivion-dev-reacts-to-oblivion-remastered-not-sure-remaster-does-it-justice/1100-6531057/" data-ref-id="1100-6531057">pleasantly surprised by the work that went into Oblivion Remastered.</a></p><p>A report said the rumored Fallout 3 remaster <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/there-is-a-fallout-3-remaster-in-the-works-but-its-not-arriving-anytime-soon-report/1100-6530903/" data-ref-id="1100-6530903">would not launch for a long time</a>, so anyone hoping to play it soon should probably give up hope about that.</p><p>Meanwhile, Bethesda Game Studios plans to make <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-5-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6522412/">Fallout 5</a>, but it's not coming until after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6492383/" data-ref-id="1100-6492383">The Elder Scrolls VI</a>--so it's not going to launch soon.</p><p dir="ltr">Oblivion Remastered is currently on sale for 17% off at GameSpot sister-site Fanatical (both GameSpot and Fanatical are owned by Fandom).</p><p>In other Fallout news, new update for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-fallout-76-update-is-live-letting-players-finally-become-a-ghoul/1100-6530194/">Fallout 76 finally allows players to become Ghouls</a>.

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> has introduced quite a few <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-and-different-in-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered/2900-6492/">new features and improvements</a> to Cyrodiil, but one classic feature from the original 2006 version of the game has undeniably remained: extremely cursed character faces.</p><p dir="ltr">To be fair, most of the horrifying faces in the original Oblivion belonged to NPCs. Player-characters often ended up looking a bit off as well, but the player-character's face wasn't featured as prominently in the original game as it is in the remaster, nor was third-person mode as polished as it is in the latest version of the game, so the game's wonky NPC faces tended to overshadow whatever horrors players put together in the character creator. In Oblivion Remastered, however, many of the game's NPCs have had glow-ups, while the game's character creator has given players more flexibility to turn the Hero of Kvatch into an utter monstrosity. There's even a subreddit where players can share said monstrosities: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OblivionAbominations/" rel="nofollow ">/r/OblivionAbominations</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Naturally, Oblivion Remastered's updated character creator makes it far easier for players to create <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k6aau5/i_made_a_beautiful_orc_lady/" rel="nofollow ">visually appealing characters</a>, but it also makes it easier for players to create characters that are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k6becp/you_are_the_one_from_my_dreams/" rel="nofollow ">pure nightmare fuel</a>. Almost immediately following the game's surprise release, social media started filling up with screenshots of player-character designs that make <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/167oww7/why_do_the_characters_look_like_that_im_scared/" rel="nofollow ">the bug-eyed NPCs</a> of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starfield/">Starfield</a> look downright friendly. Here are some of our favorites.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Sir Vancelot</h3><p>Arguably the most popular horrifying player-character, Sir Vancelot has started appearing all over social media since his creator first shared him.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Dumb and Dunmer</h3><p>This delightfully horrifying dark elf is truly the stuff of nightmares.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Shrek</h3><p>This particular orc (...that <em>is</em> an orc, right?) is giving off major "Shrek had a few too many filler injections" vibes.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Yu-Gi-Oh My God</h3><p>It's nothing if not accurate.</p><h3 dir="ltr">The Janker</h3><p>Some men just want to watch the Oblivion Gate burn.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Not-So-Handsome Squidward</h3><p>Someone free him from his suffering.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Jimmy No-Tron</h3><p>Depends on one's definition of gorgeous.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Orange-In-Chief</h3><p dir="ltr">"This is a really, really great Oblivion player-character. The best, really terrific. No fake news here. Other player-characters? Losers! Total disasters. Everyone agrees.

            <p>
It's been a few months since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hyper-light-breaker">Hyper Light Breaker</a> launched into early access, unfortunately arriving in a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hyper-light-breaker-early-access-review">bit of a mess</a>. The game just wasn't there, which obviously is what early access is for, but it was rough. Everything was just a bit too difficult, too unbalanced, and the loop wasn't strong enough to do over and over again, none of which you want in a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a>. Developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/heartmachine">Heart Machine</a> have been tinkering away at it though, bringing in some much needed tweaks here and there, and now the game's first big update is coming next week.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
This update, titled Buried Below, will be coming to the game April 29, just a few days away. We'll get to the additional stuff in a moment, because first I want to talk about the actual biggest part of the update, which is a complete rework of the game's core structures. 
</p>

<p>
For starters, currently you have three lives before a run is finished. With this update, you'll get one, and when you die, you'll lose all your items as opposed to keeping them across runs. You do keep certain currencies across runs, but for the most part it's going for a more traditional roguelike experience now when it comes to dying and loot. Extracting with said loot will be easier too, you can do it at any shrines you come across, and you don't have to fend off waves of enemies to successfully get out.
</p>
<p>
SyComs, those lil robots that follow you around, now have their own sort of class-like system, with each Breaker getting one assigned SyCom with fixed stats. You'll be able to equip them with perks to give your Breaker passive abilities too. For new players, and old ones too, there's also a tutorial at the beginning of the game, something sorely needed for a game of its challenge level.
</p>
<p>
Ok, onto the part of the update where it gets its name from. There's Rondo, a new Breaker whose abilities will let you boost your flash-step and parry. Heading underground will eventually lead you to a new Crown, the game's bosses, called Maw. It's a big ole evil-looking dragon whose attack patterns have some <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/returnal">Returnal</a> vibes about them. The underground area has been kept a bit mysterious in the trailer for the update, so I can't really tell you what there'll be down there, but you'll be finding caves across the map in general now.
</p>
<p>
Honestly, good on Heart Machine for killing their darlings and retooling the core structure of their game so much. It sounds like quite a radical change from what they were going for, and personally it's tempting me to jump back in. I haven't played since launch, bouncing off of it because it was so rough to play, so I'm quite curious to see how it feels now.

Even worse, Nintendo warns that some people might not even get a chance to place an order on a Switch 2 via an invite e-mail until <em>after</em> June 5, aka the day the console launches.

Everything more or least gets buried. We don’t have the cash nor muscle to throw around, so everything is carefully planned. Including when to release, based on other releases etc - to try to maximize the chances of getting attention.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Antonsson then pointed to Red Soul Games’ Post Trauma, which Raw Fury published on April 22. It’s a puzzle horror game inspired by PS2 era classics where you “navigate environments, tackle threats, and meet other lost characters in the depths of the Gloom.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Love the game that dropped but feel the pain for our team and especially the developer we’ve worked with for years - who has poured his heart and soul into his game,” Antonsson said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Raw Fury had tweeted sarcastically on April 22: “Thank god Post Trauma was the only notable release of today and nothing else happened!”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">From Bethesda and parent company Microsoft’s point of video, the Oblivion Remastered shadow-drop has been a big success. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-launches-big-on-steam-and-its-only-going-to-get-bigger">The game enjoyed an impressive start on Steam</a>, and it’s dominated online discussion as players celebrate the return of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remastereds-funny-character-faces-are-going-viral-for-being-total-nightmare-fuel-and-for-looking-like-the-original-fallout-talking-heads">funny character faces</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yes-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-still-has-all-the-bugs-glitches-and-memes-fans-know-and-love-from-20-years-ago">old bugs, and memes</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even other games Microsoft itself has pushed hard in marketing terms are running up against Oblivion Remastered.

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">If you don't play games on PC (or even if you do), you might not know that there's been <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?term=parkour" rel="nofollow ">a run on parkour games</a> for a while now. All of these also compete with games like Roblox and Fortnite, where parkour sims carve out a major aspect of the user-generated worlds on display. But one of these parkour games stands out above the rest: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/rooftops-and-alleys/" data-ref-id="5000-612233">Rooftops &amp; Alleys: The Parkour Game</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">It's both the highest-rated parkour game on Steam (among those with more than just a handful of reviews) and has the most Steam reviews by far, with 96% of its nearly 5,000 user reviews giving the game the illustrious "Overwhelmingly Positive" distinction on the digital storefront. Soon, it'll be leaving early access and coming to consoles as well, with a 1.0 launch on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S scheduled for June 17.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGtD2Kz2tH8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nGtD2Kz2tH8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">During my hands-on time with the game, it was quickly apparent how much solo developer Michel Losch drew inspiration from the past. The arena-like maps and the ability to freely go wherever and chain together stylish moves felt like something right out of a classic Tony Hawk game. One of its maps, The Shed, seems to intentionally invoke imagery of Tony Hawk's beloved warehouse level. Still, I agreed with Losch's assessment that the physics and required stick skills of his game end up landing Rooftops &amp; Alleys (R&amp;A) somewhere in the middle of Tony Hawk and the more sim-like Skate series from EA.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, none of R&amp;A is performed on boards either, so it also gave me Mirror's Edge vibes (albeit, in third-person, not first-person), and Losch name-dropped Jet Set Radio Future as another inspiration. Like DICE's classic dystopian freerunning game, high-level play in R&amp;A looks so effortlessly cool, and even a beginner like me can appear skilled and stylish--provided they don't skip the tutorial. And much like Jet Set Radio Future, that sense of style in R&amp;A's gameplay extends beyond movement to influence the audiovisual experience--playable characters offer lots of colorful customization, and there's an eclectic soundtrack that Losch and his fiancée produced together.</p><p dir="ltr">I was both impressed and, at times, intimidated by the game's mechanics. Any one move itself was easy to perform, but the real magic of parkour is chaining together a long sequence of maneuvers, which wasn't as easy to pull off. Not that I'm complaining--the upward skill slope was an enjoyable climb, culminating in an incredible sense of flow when it all briefly came together (I tended to see my character come crashing down eventually).</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4482109-ss_28e0e3a1e1192f3f1a1faf7a1a8ef9d03dda0fbc.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4482109" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4482109-ss_28e0e3a1e1192f3f1a1faf7a1a8ef9d03dda0fbc.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4482109"></a><figcaption>The Shed map reminded me a lot of Tony Hawk's famous warehouse level.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4482109-ss_28e0e3a1e1192f3f1a1faf7a1a8ef9d03dda0fbc.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">For the true test, though, I handed the controller off to my 12-year-old son, who would probably prefer I describe him as a (virtual) parkour expert. He loved what he played and felt like, while it was more challenging than something like Parkour Reborn on Roblox--which is more like a Spider-Man sim anyway, if you ask me--he appreciated the intricacies of the controls, and how the things you could do in the game very much resemble the reality of parkour. Rooftops &amp; Alleys doesn't seem like it will stray too far from that reality, for now anyway, and instead equips players with the tools to perform feats that parkour athletes can accomplish in the real world. Maybe some future update will send players to the moon, but, for now, it's all intentionally grounded.</p><p dir="ltr">Since debuting in Steam Early Access, the game has received 30 updates, Losch told me, including two additional maps, lots of challenges, several multiplayer modes (such as Tag and Capture The Flag), and numerous enhancements to the game's foundational movement mechanics. But the game's next milestone is maybe its most important.</p><p dir="ltr">"1.0 will be the biggest update yet," Losch said. "The game will get its sixth map, a brand-new online multiplayer game mode (Tricks Battle), a lot of new time trials and trick rush challenges, new music, over 100 different customization options, a full progression system with unlockables, fun achievements, improved gameplay mechanics--such as the brand new physical sliding mechanic, which is purely momentum-based--and an amazing photo mode which I honestly could not be more proud of!"</p><p dir="ltr">To date, R&amp;A has sold more than 150,000 copies, which isn't half bad when you consider Losch set out to pursue game dev as a passion project on the side of his 15-year career as a music producer and DJ. "[2023] marked the beginning of my solo game dev journey, so I had to learn Unreal Engine from scratch and overcome many hurdles that previously kept me from going for it and making my dream parkour game," he told me.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4482110-ss_3afbd42240a8ce19da0ed36c717cb75b7f81b404.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4482110" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4482110-ss_3afbd42240a8ce19da0ed36c717cb75b7f81b404.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4482110"></a><figcaption>Rooftops and Alleys is not a game where you can hold a button to auto-parkour in style.

He continued, "I have been craving a good parkour game my entire life [...] I think I honestly got lucky in the sense that my personal taste and itch for a certain pParkour game seemed to have been aligned overall with the [genre's] community and players."</p><p dir="ltr">Rooftops &amp; Alleys: The Parkour Game gets its Steam 1.0 update and debuts on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S on June 17.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>'s second wave of physical Lego sets will include codes for in-game character skins.
</p>
<p>
The next batch of four Lego sets will drop in from the Battle Bus on 1st June - and there's a range of options to choose from.
</p>
<p>
Each contains exclusive <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-fortnite">Lego Fortnite</a> minifigures, as well codes to unlock at least one in-game skin per set - something the Lego Fortnite range did not include with its first four sets released last year.
</p>
<p>
Joining the range is <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/peely-sparkplug-s-camp-77075">Peely &amp; Sparkplug's Camp, the cheapest option at £18</a> for a 250-piece set. This looks to be based on the Lego Fortnite Odyssey game mode, as it features replicas of its workbench item and wolf enemy. Minifigures included are, unsurprisingly, Peely and Sparkplug. You'll also get a code for the Sparkplug in-game skin.
</p>
<p>
Next up in size is the <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/durrr-burger-restaurant-77076">Durrr Burger Restaurant, priced at £54.99</a> for a 546-piece set. This includes a corner of the burger restaurant seen on various older Fortnite maps, plus minifigures for Beach Bomber, Beef Boss and Grimey. You'll also get a code for the Beef Boss in-game skin.
</p>

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/77075_Prod_en-gb.webp?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/77076_Prod_en-gb.webp?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/77077_Prod_en-gb.webp?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
</figure>
</figure>
<p>
Splash out a little more and you can buy the <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/klombo-77077">Klombo set, priced £89.99</a>, which features Fortnite's lovable purple dinosaur as he appears in Lego Fortnite, plus minifigures for Oro and Adventure Peely. The in-game skin here is for Adventure Peely, which Lego Fortnite fans may have already from an earlier Lego Pass.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, this wave's centrepiece set is the enormous <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/mecha-team-leader-77078">£209.99 Mecha Team Leader model</a>. This is one of those big Lego sets designed to sit on a shelf and look impressive, rather than actually be played with - though at 45cm tall and weighing in at 2503 pieces, you're going to need a big shelf. 
</p>
<p>
Mecha Team Leader has been the star of a few Fortnite live events, most notably <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-how-fortnites-mecha-vs-monster-battle-played-out">the game's monster vs mech battle</a> that was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-remix-finale-event-smashes-14m-all-time-player-record">remixed last year in a fight sequence featuring Eminem</a> (standard Fortnite). Included in the box are two codes each for both the Mecha Team Leader and Mecha Team Shadow skins. But is it worth £210? Hmm. You do get a Mecha Team Leader minifigure too...
</p>
<p>
Lego and Fortnite's collaboration began several years ago, with the launch of its in-game Lego Fortnite mode that has since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-fortnite-brick-life-is-a-major-new-social-game-mode-that-sounds-a-bit-like-the-sims">grown into several modes</a> and a platform for hundreds of smaller community-made minigames. Nearly all Fortnite skins now also have a digital equivalent (though not Eminem, in this case).
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-lego-sets-leak-including-99-battle-bus">Lego Fortnite's first four Lego sets</a> include a giant Supply Llama, a Durrr Burger, a large model of Peely Bone, and a recreation of the Battle Bus with around a dozen minifigures - that one really is very nice.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/24/nintendo-switch-2-edition-game-upgrade-prices-set-at-8-and-17-depending-on-the-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo has added prices to the online store pages for Nintendo Switch 2 Edition game upgrades in the UK, confirming that there will be multiple price points, depending on the games.</p>
<p>For more straightforward upgrades like Breath of the Wild, Nintendo will be charging £7.99 / €9.99 / $9.99, while Switch 2 Edition games that also gain a significant amount of DLC content, such as Kirby and the Forgotten Land will be priced at £16.99 / €19.99 and likely at $19.99 in the US.</p>


<p>The four games with live listings are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/The-Legend-of-Zelda-Breath-of-the-Wild-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2787250.html">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Upgrade Pack</a> – £7.99</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/The-Legend-of-Zelda-Tears-of-the-Kingdom-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2787249.html">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Upgrade Pack</a> – £7.99</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/Super-Mario-Party-Jamboree-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-Jamboree-TV-2785806.html">Super Mario Party Jamboree – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV </a><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/Super-Mario-Party-Jamboree-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-Jamboree-TV-2785806.html"> Upgrade Pack</a> – £16.99</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/Kirby-and-the-Forgotten-Land-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-Star-Crossed-World-2787773.html">Kirby and the Forgotten Land – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World Upgrade Pack</a> – £16.99</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point, I feel like the worst effect that these Switch 2 upgrades has had is to make the game titles practically unreadable. Did the Super Mario Party Jamboree content really need to be called Jamboree TV again, and have a ‘Nintendo Switch 2 Edition’ sandwiched right in the middle of it? at least ‘Star-Crossed World’ sounds like a DLC expansion, but Jamboree TV sounds like the marketing department got lost mid title and wrote it again.</p>
<p>But you pay extra for those additional words, because they add a bunch of extra stuff to each game. Jamboree TV has new camera and Mouse-Con mini-games, while <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/13/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-star-crossed-world-switch-2-edition-preview/">Star-Crossed World remixes the original game with new frozen world elements</a>.</p>

<p>Given this pricing, we would expect that future cross-gen Nintendo games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, which has new graphics modes and mouse controls, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, which is a more straightforward resolution and performance bump, will have a £8 price bump over the Nintendo Switch versions.</p>
<p>This also suggests that third parties will likely have a good bit of freedom to price upgrades how they see fit, especially as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/these-games-are-getting-free-nintendo-switch-2-upgrades-from-nintendo/">Nintendo is also making free updates</a> for a number of games from the Switch back catalogue.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/12/nintendo-clarify-that-physical-switch-2-editions-will-not-feature-download-codes/">Switch 2 Edition games will be sold as Switch 2 cartridges physically</a>, though it will likely be more cost effective to buy the Nintendo Switch version and then the upgrade separately, which will work with either digital or physical copies of each game. Kirby, for example, is priced at £66 all-in on the eShop, but would be £55 if you buy the Switch game from Argos for £38 and then upgrade.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortuary-assistant-movie-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Horror work sim&nbsp;<em>The Mortuary Assistant&nbsp;</em>is getting a movie adaptation, and it'll star&nbsp;<em>Arrow</em>'s Willa Holland and&nbsp;<em>House of Cards</em>' Paul Sparks, according to a new report.</p>

<p>Per a Deadline <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/the-mortuary-assistant-movie-willa-holland-paul-sparks-1236376119/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">article</a>, the movie will be produced by Epic Pictures' horror label Dread, which is also the publisher of&nbsp;<em>The Mortuary Assistant&nbsp;</em>via its gaming wing DreadXP. The company will co-produce the movie alongside Traverse Media.</p>

<p>Story-wise,&nbsp;<em>The Mortuary Assistant&nbsp;</em>will proceed pretty much exactly as you'd expect it to if you've played the game. Holland will play Rebecca, a young woman who works as a mortuary assistant. Sparks will play her boss Raymond Delver, who Deadline describes as "a mentor, but also a potential threat".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mortuary-assistant-movie-game-shot.jpg?itok=Igk2-TZ6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mortuary-assistant-movie-game-shot.jpg?itok=YRHlwycb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Mortuary Assistant&nbsp;</em>is getting a movie adaptation.</figcaption></figure><p>Rather than a straight adaptation, however, Deadline says the movie will serve as "a new chapter in the story that will expand on the game's world and mythology", so even if you've already played&nbsp;<em>The Mortuary Assistant</em>, you should still get something from this.</p>

<p>Helming the adaptation is Jeremiah Kipp, a director who's worked on horror properties before. Perhaps his most well-known project is&nbsp;<em>Slapface</em>, an indie horror movie from 2021 that won the Cinequest Film Festival's Audience Award.</p>

<p>Speaking to Deadline, Kipp said that he and&nbsp;<em>The Mortuary Assistant&nbsp;</em>game creator Brian Clarke "respond to character-driven storytelling within a disturbing horror space" and that the movie's creation process has "organically felt like an expansion of [Clarke's] unique gameplay".</p>

<p>For his part, Clarke says he's "extremely fortunate" to see a&nbsp;<em>Mortuary Assistant&nbsp;</em>movie to get made, and that he "can't wait for fans to see [the game] expand into new territory".</p>




<p><em>The Mortuary Assistant&nbsp;</em>is just one of a number of games to be getting film adaptations in the coming years. Others include <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/outrun-movie-report" rel="nofollow">an<i>&nbsp;</i><em>OutRun&nbsp;</em>movie</a> from producers Michael Bay and Sydney Sweeney, as well as Nintendo's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/live-action-zelda-movie-march-2027" rel="nofollow">live-action&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie</a>&nbsp;and a film <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/live-action-zelda-movie-march-2027" rel="nofollow">based on Hazelight's hit&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em></a>.</p>

			<p>Developer Heart Machine's <a href="https://wccftech.com/hyper-light-breaker-preview-lo-fi-roguelite/">Hyper Light Breaker</a> launched at the top of the year in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1534840/Hyper_Light_Breaker/">Early Access</a>, and the studio has officially announced that its first major update, Buried Below, will arrive on <strong>April 29, 2025.</strong></p>
<p>Regarding what's new in the update, a new Breaker called Rondo will be added to the game, who comes with a new SyCom with two perks, a new crown called Maw, two new melee weapons, and new environments to run through, such as caves.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The rest of the major changes are quality-of-life updates and significant changes to the run structure. In a press release, Heart Machine calls it "<em>the most significant feature overhaul yet with a complete rework of the game's run structure</em>."</p>
<p>Players will now have one life per run, losing items in their inventory and resetting the Overgrowth when they die. Heart Machine says this change will allow the team to "better adjust difficulty and make the game easier to get into<em>&nbsp;but harder to master</em>."</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Along with this change comes a few new gameplay loops, including introducing more ways for players to leave the Overgrowth, SyComs following more of a class-like system with character customization being redesigned, and streamlining vendors and player inventory.</p>
<p>The final significant aspect of the update is an improved onboarding path. Once the update is live, first-time players will be thrown into a tutorial that will take them through the game's core mechanics and explain a few key aspects they'll need to know with Hyper Light Breaker. Heart Machine hopes that this new tutorial will be useful to first-time players and even returning players who may just want a refresher on the basics.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>As part of the new update being revealed, Heart Machine is providing Wccftech 20 game keys to giveaway beginning&nbsp;<strong>Wednesday, May 7, 2025</strong>, a week after the update will have gone live. Make sure to follow Wccftech's and Heart Machine's social channels to be prepared for the giveaway so you don't miss it.</p>

It was literally <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/frostpunk-3-could-launch-as-early-as-2027-with-an-untitled-larger-scale-11-bit-game-planned-for-2029">only last week</a> that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/11-bit-studios">11 bit studios</a> announced a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a> was on the way, even saying that it could have a release date "as early as 2027." Yet, here we are now, with the reveal of what it actually is. It's not Frostpunk 3, it's not a spinoff, it's Frostpunk 1886, a "reimagined" version of the original game. Yes, that basically just means that it's a remake, though it does sound like it's got a bit more going on from it than the original.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
For starters, Frostpunk 1886 is being made in Unreal Engine as opposed to 11 bit's homegrown Liquid Engine. For the most part that won't matter much to you or me, except for the fact that this version of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game will actually have mod support. This isn't something that was possible in the original game due to "technical limitations", says 11 bit in a press release.

<p>
11 bit also notes that this won't just be a visual upgrade, as there'll be new content, mechanics, laws, and even a new Purpose path. No details on what any of that new content will actually be, but it sounds like a reasonable amount effort was put into make sure they're not just selling you a remake of a game that won't even be a decade old by the time 1886 releases (11 bit reaffirmed that it's slated for a 2027 release date, and that development has already started).
</p>
<p>
Currently 11 bit are still working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk-2">Frostpunk 2</a>, which had a bit of a rocky start, though seems to be in a bit better shape these days. Oh, and don't worry, the devs also said that Frostpunk 1886 and Frostpunk 2 will "evolve side by side", so it's not a complete do over.

Fortunately, he happens to be quite good with both. How could he not be? That mustache is just giving “will duel at ten paces at a Starbucks”.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-skills-gustave-lune-maelle-1851777515&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-skills-gustave-lune-maelle-1851777515">Grab These Skills First In <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a></span></p><p>As for starting skills, he’s the first in your crew to have <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-skills-gustave-lune-maelle-1851777515&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-skills-gustave-lune-maelle-1851777515">the ability to Mark enemies using Marking Shot</a></span>, a lightning-based skill which sets baddies up to take more damage on the next hit. It’s a tool you gotta wield carefully to get the most out of it, but an important one. The most crucial one, for reasons you’re about to find out, is Lumiere Assault, which is a snazzy five hit combo. It doesn’t do massive damage on its own, but mostly it’s because it’s your best primer for.</p><h2 id="h2287"><a id="overdrive"></a>Special mechanic: Overdrive</h2><p>So, this here is your main event, the thing you should be working towards with Gustave at all times. See, every time you attack, dodge, or parry an enemy, his Winter Soldier-brand prosthetic arm gains a charge, up to 10. Overdrive then allows Gustave to release the charges for a huge amount of damage, which can also break enemies if their meter’s built up at least halfway. Naturally, the more you can stock up, the better—especially in the early going, a fully charged Overdrive is basically game over for every enemy you meet. But that still means getting 10 Overdrives and having the AP in stock to unleash it. <br></p><h2 id="h2288"><a id="builds"></a>Recommended builds/synergy</h2><p>Here, my friends, is where Lumiere Assault comes in. You come pre-equipped with a skill that gives you five charges for Overdrive right up front—as long as you hit the QTEs. It’s also extremely useful for enemies with shields, since taking down five shields at once will make the job extremely easy for the rest of your crew. However, you’re still going to want to give Overdrive as much a chance for total devastation as possible before you drop the hammer. You’ll get a skill early on called Powerful which increases damage output for the whole party, but you’ll mostly want to use Pictos/Lumina. </p><p>Focus on perks that grant extra AP after killing an enemy or dodging (e.g. Dodger, Dead Energy) so you’re not caught out there with a full charge, but no way to capitalize. Critical Burn is also a nice one to slap on after Lune’s in your party. Set enemies on fire, and then at least one of your Overdrive hits will be absolutely devastating. <br></p><h2 id="h2289"><a id="skills"></a>Skills to aim for</h2><p>Once you’re a bit further down the road, Strike Storm and Shatter wind up becoming your best friends. Strike Storm is basically a better Lumiere Assault, which can give you eight charges if you hit it right, and Shatter can break enemies without having to drop the Overcharge just yet. Also, From Fire is extremely useful once both Lune and Maelle are with you, since it’s basically a bespoke way for Gustave to heal himself without dipping into your collection of tints, or taking the others away from the important work of burning everything alive. </p><hr><p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For the new Crown, Early Access players have seen glimpses of her in a couple of ways—as she’s shown as a Crown that’s possible to fight when readying up to enter the Overgrowth and players have entered her arena in the hostile crystalscape of the Jeweled Spire. The Heart Machine team’s been working hard on getting Maw ready, and they’re thrilled the time has come for players to face her in just a few days!</p><p><strong>Change in Run Structure</strong></p><p>Since Early Access launch, the Heart Machine has taken to heart all of the player feedback they’ve received across the board. Inspired by player feedback, the upcoming update will introduce the most significant feature overhaul yet with a complete rework of the game’s run structure, as players will now have one life for each run and when they die they will lose items in their inventory, and the Overgrowth will reset. This change was made to balance the game around a more traditional roguelike experience, turning each run into a more consistent and rewarding “zero to hero” adventure than before. This change also allows the Heart Machine to better adjust difficulty and make the game easier to get into, but harder to master, and addresses much of the feedback the team has received from players since Early Access launch.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>This shift in run structure will introduce a few gameplay loops and progression changes to make runs easier, better and ultimately more enjoyable for all players, including veterans and newcomers alike, than before.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_960766"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><ul><li><strong>Extraction</strong> – More Options for Players: Instead of only one way to leave the Overgrowth (via the Telepad), players will be able to extract at any Shrine in the Overgrowth and there’ll be no waves of enemies to defeat like before. This change will make it so players can extract more often, making the game easier as a result which was one of the main requests from players to change the game’s difficulty.</li><li><strong>SyComs</strong> – Follows a Class-Like System, More Loadout Potential: Character customization has been redesigned giving each Breaker one assigned SyCom with fixed stats, and players have the option to equip a perk to the SyCom that gives the Breaker a new passive ability. For instance, Rondo’s SyCom has an equippable perk called “Bladedancer” that increases Rondo’s damage and attack speed. Players can develop their SyCom stats further at Shrines in the Overgrowth with extended upgrades unlocked through meta progression. This change, inspired by player feedback, will make it so each Breaker is similar to a “class” making each Breaker feel different from one another, and make it so players can come up with distinct builds per Breaker.</li><li><strong>Inventory and Vendors</strong> – More Streamlined: The Vault system will be changed as when you die, the inventory in your Vault will no longer carry over between runs except for Golden Rations, the main meta progression currency in the game. This will allow players to focus solely on acquiring new gear during their runs instead of having to focus on managing their inventory so often like before. Additionally, vendors in the Overgrowth and Cursed Outpost will also have new roles, with Bright Blood and Materials now used for purchases and upgrades. While gear sales have been removed from hub vendors, players can still use them to enhance equipped items.</li></ul><p><strong>Improved Onboarding</strong></p><p>The second major addition in the upcoming patch is a brand-new onboarding tutorial that launches automatically the first time players start the game after the update, regardless of save status. This guided experience introduces core mechanics through a structured level that leads to the Cursed Outpost hub. From there, players will gain access to a dedicated space for learning and practicing advanced combat techniques such as dash attacks and parries. Designed to align with the game’s reworked structure and expanded mechanics, this revamped introduction provides a smooth and informative entry point for both new and returning players.</p></blockquote><p><em>Hyper Light Breaker</em> is currently in Early Access for <a title="Platforms > PC [22,979 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1534840/Hyper_Light_Breaker/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p><p>Watch a new trailer below.

                <p>Cyberpunk 2077 has seen tremendous growth since launching in 2020. Originally littered with bugs, Night City is now better than it’s ever been--thanks to dozens of updates from CDPR and the brilliant Phantom Liberty expansion that transformed the world and strengthened the narrative. Nintendo users weren't able to play the open-world RPG on Switch, but they will be able to play it on Switch 2 on June 5, which is the same day the console launches. <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Cyberpunk+2077+Nintendo+Switch+2+Preorders+Are+Live+-+Full+Game+Is+On+The+Cart&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-04-24+09%3A11%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-04-24+09%3A11%3A23&amp;fnarticle_id=6531086&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Pre-Order+Guides&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FCyberpunk-2077-Ultimate-Edition-Nintendo-Switch-2%2F16204669929%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fcyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition-nintendo-switch-physical-game-cartridge-preorder-walmart%2F1100-6531086%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a> is now available to preorder for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. </p><div title="[Various] Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition for Nintendo Switch 2" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3427" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="[Various] Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition for Nintendo Switch 2" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1804712/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Cyberpunk-2077-Ultimate-Edition-Nintendo-Switch-2/16204669929&amp;subId1=subid_value" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/goto.walmart.com\/c\/1804712\/565706\/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https:\/\/www.walmart.com\/ip\/Cyberpunk-2077-Ultimate-Edition-Nintendo-Switch-2\/16204669929&amp;subId1=subid_value&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1804712/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Cyberpunk-2077-Ultimate-Edition-Nintendo-Switch-2/16204669929&amp;subId1=subid_value">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition for Switch 2</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1804712/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Cyberpunk-2077-Ultimate-Edition-Nintendo-Switch-2/16204669929&amp;subId1=subid_value" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/goto.walmart.com\/c\/1804712\/565706\/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https:\/\/www.walmart.com\/ip\/Cyberpunk-2077-Ultimate-Edition-Nintendo-Switch-2\/16204669929&amp;subId1=subid_value&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1804712/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Cyberpunk-2077-Ultimate-Edition-Nintendo-Switch-2/16204669929&amp;subId1=subid_value">$70 | Releases June 5</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>This is the only version of the game up for preorder.

Trade tokens will be removed from the game by this fall, and players will instead use Shinedust (currently used to upgrade cards visually) to trade. The developers are looking to increase the amount of Shinedust players can earn in order to accommodate its new role, and will additionally be updating the game's card-trading functionality to make it easier to share which cards players wish to trade for.</p>
