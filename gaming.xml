			<p>I’m a massive fan of&nbsp;TRON, but more specifically, I’m a massive fan of TRON: Legacy. The 2010 sci-fi sequel has been cemented in my subconscious since the day it came out. The world it built has always been so captivating to me, with sleek metal obelisks and neon colorized highlights dancing around in my dreams most nights. It’s all complemented by gripping audio design, from the roar of the light cycles to the zap of a bouncing identity disc and the iconic Daft Punk&nbsp;curated score. Every opportunity I get to revisit that world is a thrill, so I’ve been chomping at the bit to get my hands on the latest spinoff of my favorite sci-fi property –&nbsp;TRON: Catalyst.</p>
<p><iframe title="TRON: Catalyst | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xrt-GkCO-ZQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While it doesn’t have a number in the title, TRON: Catalyst pretty much a direct follow-up to Bithell Games’ 2023 visual novel, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/tron-identity">TRON: Identity</a>. The two titles make a really complementary pair and, after rolling credits on this latest release, it’s clear they’re aiming to continue this story further with a third entry. TRON: Catalyst focuses our sights on Exo, a program working as a courier in the virtual city of Vertical_Slice who lands in hot water when her last delivery of the night ends up being an explosive device that goes off in her hands. She makes it out alive, but not unaffected. Whatever she was tasked to deliver ended up giving her the ability to Glitch, which lets her rewind time to an earlier point whenever she chooses. Hunting for answers on why she can do this and who’s responsible lands her in the middle of a plot of resistance and uprising, and a race against the clock to stop a Glitch storm from wiping out the entire system.</p>


<p>Mechanically, the glitch ability is a lot less exciting than it sounds. I’m a sucker for a good time-loop game, but it needs to smartly loop that concept equally through the narrative and the gameplay. TRON: Catalyst doesn’t strike that balance. Your hand is often held tightly by the game as your objects guide you on when to press the loop button to reset the current chapter, retaining your obtained info and abilities to progress down a new path. Despite the illusion of dialogue choices and branching exploration, the entire experience is incredibly linear, never once feeling like you have the ability to shape any outcomes yourself.</p>


<p>Despite the middling use of time-loop gameplay, I was still in awe getting to run around the world of TRON and explore such lovingly crafted locales. The dense Iso-populated cities and barren, green-tinted Outlands perfectly matched my memories of them from other TRON properties, and the pink-tinted Automata add a new element to the mix that I loved exploring. You’re given iconic tools like the Identity Disc and a Lightcycle to play around with, too.</p>
<p>Tossing and slicing your disc plays out in pretty basic real-time combat, with a skill-tree that helps expand your abilities. It’s hardly the focus of the game or it’s strongest suit, but it helps break up the exploration heavy segments that occupy the rest of the game. Lightcycle chases and battles, on the other hand, are a delight. The top-down viewpoint of the game never properly captures the sense of speed you’d hope for from these moments, but the battles are so satisfying and I could honestly see myself getting lost in a mode that was nothing but those bike battles for hours, if it was on offer.</p>

<p>If there’s one element of TRON: Catalyst that actively disappointed me, though, it was the soundtrack. A major part of the modern identity for the TRON franchise is it’s music. TRON: Legacy introduced us to the electronic and orchestral fusion of Daft Punk excellence that has gone on to influence the music of every spin-off title since then, and the upcoming TRON: Ares film promises to carve out an equally exciting audio identity for itself with a soundtrack composed by Nine Inch Nails. TRON: Catalyst fails to ignite the same excitement that most Tron music does, its score often playing it safe and basic and remaining buried far too deep into the background. It also doesn’t buck trends and try to establish it’s own identity with those tracks. Instead, it feels like the safest, undetectable interpretation of what TRON: Legacy introduced to us.</p>
<p>That’s probably the best word I could use to describe TRON: Catalyst –<strong>&nbsp;</strong>safe. It has a lot of big ideas, but only gives you the faintest taste of each of them. As a fan of the franchise, I still adored every second of it, but I was never truly wowed or inspired playing this as I was from any other entries in the series. With an ending that so clearly queues up a sequel, my biggest wish is that whatever comes next is bigger, bolder, and louder in every way possible.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		TRON: Catalyst is a safe spin-off of the iconic TRON: Legacy world - it presents big ideas but only ever dips it's toes into those waters, wrapping things up as a mostly okay game that existing fans will likely find a lot of joy in nonetheless. 	</p></div>

<p>She ain't no Odd Rock</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="DK Bananza 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e21dc5f3ea534/dk-bananza-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it">Direct</a> from Nintendo revealed that DK's new companion, Odd Rock, isn't actually Odd Rock at all, but rather a young Pauline. Gasp!</p>
<p>We all kind of knew this was coming, of course, thanks to a previous leak, but it's still pretty cool to see just how vital she'll prove to be with the overarching story.</p>
<p>Thanks to a new page via the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/games/switch2/aaaca/index.html">Japanese Nintendo Store</a>, even more details regarding Pauline have been revealed, including her age. According to a very brief summary of her character, she is 13 years old at the time she encounters DK in Bananza.</p>
<p>Translated via Google, the sumary reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A 13-year-old girl who loves to sing. She used to live above ground, but for some reason she was brought to the underground world and turned into a rock."</p>
</blockquote>
<figure><a title="Pauline - DK Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5fdc75f17bb9a/pauline-dk-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Direct revealed that Pauline can use her singing abilities to point DK in the right direction during gameplay, while also transforming him into one of three new forms: Kong Bananza, Zebra Bananza, and Ostrich Bananza.</p>
<p>Co-op play is also supported, with a second player taking on the role of Pauline to sing out deadly words to defeat enemies and blast away chunks of the environment. GameShare has also been confirmed for DK Bananza, with users of Switch 1 consoles able to join the fun.</p>

            <p>I actually can't remember the last time I played a shmup. Maybe a Gradius? I don't know anything about ZPF's genremates or even what its name stands for, but I do know a good colourful big bastard turtle when I see one, and that was enough for me to try the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3095410/ZPF/">Steam demo</a>.</p>
<p>"Great score!" Zam Pankman-Fried told me after I died 45 seconds in. From this, I learned that ZPF is a massive liar, but also that I actually quite like shmups still. Pretty compelling as far as avoid the bad thing 'em ups go.</p>

<p>There is/was/are going to be <a href="https://megacatstudios.com/pages/zpf">physical carts of this one available</a>, and while I appreciate the commitment to the 16-bit, I know where buying one physical game ends, and it ends with me buying so many I'm forced to start an unsuccessful retro gaming YouTube channel where I film myself in front of my heaving collection to adopt an air of legitimacy like a Netflix documentary trying to convince you to heed an MBA's opinion on magic mushrooms because they're sitting in front of a very large bookshelf. Steam suits my purposes fine for now. Here are some features:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Inspired by classic horizontal shooters like Lords of Thunder, Elemental Master, and the Thunderforce series, ZPF is a passion project from the designer and developer of Super XYX and Tänzer.</li>
<li>Players will dodge and weave through intense bullet patterns, unleashing a barrage of firepower upon hordes of unique and challenging enemies.</li>
<li>Brace yourself for epic encounters with mid and end-stage bosses, each demanding a different strategy to defeat.</li>
<li>Upgrade your arsenal and gain valuable tips between levels at each of the world’s in-game shops.</li>
<li>Finish every stage and discover a treasure trove of hidden secrets.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Needless to say I really like how this one looks, even if I lack the language this morning to call it anything more precise than "colourful and cybery". Rainbow Geiger? Enlighten me, art style knowers. Reminds me quite a bit of <a href="https://hollow-press.net/collections/cyberflesh/products/cyberflesh-boardgame">Hollow Press's Cyberflesh</a>. Will I get good enough at it to see that turtle in the cyberflesh? Doubtful, but I'm motivated.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The remaining Nightlords will be added at a later date. At the end of each week the "Sovereign will disappear from the available Expeditions… for now".</p>

<p>What's more, defeating the Everdark Sovereigns rewards players with Sovereign Sigils. These are unique tokens that can be exchanged for special Relics and items. Additional Sigils will be rewarded the first time an Everdark Sovereign is defeated.</p>
<p>"This is only the beginning of the Everdark Sovereign cycle," read the <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/the-everdark-sovereigns-have-emerged-elden-ring-nightreign">update notes</a>. "As the power of the Night ebbs and wanes, the Sovereigns will soon return to the abyss they came from."</p>
<p>At the start of the month, FromSoftware stated that "enhanced fights against existing Nightlords" would be on the way, while a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-two-player-mode-confirmed-as-fromsoftware-celebrates-35m-players">duo mode is coming "at a later date"</a>. Even before this, though, dataminers discovered game files for new phases of each Nightlord encounter, so this update was very much expected.</p>
<p>What wasn't expected, perhaps, was the weekly cycle of these encounters. It's a smart live service-esque twist to keep players coming back regularly and exactly what the game needs to extend its longevity.</p>
<p>Once all the Nightlords are defeated, the only reason to return is to complete Remembrances with each character. This may not be attractive enough for some, so seeing the beginning of regular updates is a welcome addition.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-has-confirmed-dlc-but-what-could-be-included">DLC is also on the way</a>, although it's unknown what this will include. Would a Bloodborne pack of returning bosses be too much to ask?</p>
<p>The Everdark Sovereign version of Adel, Baron of the Night is available from today, 19th June until 26th June at 1:59am UK time.</p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is FromSoftware's online multiplayer spin-off to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>. It's "an exhilarating rush and a celebration of the studio's prior achievements Souls veterans will devour," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-review">Eurogamer's Elden Ring Nightreign review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>There's no doubt that Mario Kart World is the most important launch game for the Nintendo Switch 2. Not only is it the only new game (no, the Welcome Tour definitely doesn't count) made by Nintendo for the launch lineup, it's also the sequel to one of the best-selling games ever. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, at last count, has sold nearly 70 million units on the original Switch.</p>
<p>Whether Mario Kart World can match it with similar success remains to be seen over a long period of time. Still, the early reception is promising. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-kart-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In Wccftech's review</a>, the game earned an 8.5 out of 10 score from Nathan Birch, who wrote:</p>
<p><em>Mario Kart World is a bold and ambitious new entry in the world’s most popular racing franchise, delivering smartly updated mechanics, a collection of gorgeous courses, and an open world that impresses with its scope and variety. Admittedly, the game doesn’t quite manage to eclipse the giant that is Mario Kart 8 and some classic modes don’t mesh perfectly with the new sandbox approach, but there’s no denying Mario Kart World gets the Switch 2 off to a peppy start.</em></p>
<p>Making the new open world-style game required a much larger workforce, though. Japanese analyst Papen (<a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/mario-kart-world-had-a-significantly-larger-dev-team-than-past-entries-with-art-related-positions-increasing-threefold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Automaton</a>) has looked into the headcount, discovering that around 300 developers worked on Mario Kart World, compared to 163 on MK8 Deluxe. That shows how Nintendo is following the market trend in this regard, with larger and inevitably more expensive teams making bigger games.</p>
<p>The biggest increase was in the art department, which tripled in size from one game to another. Furthermore, like most of the gaming industry nowadays, Nintendo leveraged several development teams beyond Nintendo EPD, such as Monolith Soft, Bandai Namco, Imagica Geeq, and 1-Up Studio. This could go some way to explaining why Mario Kart World was <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-is-worth-the-80-price-of-admission-says-nintendo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infamously priced at $80</a>.</p>
<p>Did you purchase the game alongside the Nintendo Switch 2? If so, please comment below with your impressions.</p>

			<p>A new CAPCOM Spotlight livestream has been announced this morning by the Japanese publisher. It will air on Thursday, June 26, at 3 PM Pacific Time (6 PM Eastern time, 11 PM GMT, midnight CET) on CAPCOM's YouTube channels. It's expected to last around 40 minutes, featuring news and updates on both upcoming games (<a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-sgf-2025-hands-off-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Resident Evil Requiem</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-hands-on-sgf-2025-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PRAGMATA</a>) and existing games (Monster Hunter Wilds and Street Fighter 6).</p>
<p>The first two are those more likely to gain interest from fans. CAPCOM has shown them off during this year's Summer Game Fest, and our envoy, Kai Tatsumoto, checked both. Here are a couple of quotes from his previews:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Much of the Resident Evil Requiem demo was spent in the dark shadows and ambiance of the abandoned hotel with no shambling zombies or dogs to contend with. After a brief jump scare when opening a door, Grace gets her first encounter with an infected human, one thankfully already dead for good. It’s here that an even larger monster is introduced, a massive hunch-backed, grotesque fiend with massive teeth that gobble up the corpse. Due to its hulking size on par with Lady Dimitrescu, its running speed isn’t that fast, and Grace can escape her with relative ease, at least for a brief moment, before the monster escapes into the ceiling above. After another surprise encounter and getting a sizable chunk of her shoulder bitten off, Grace had to heal up using a med injector she found earlier, a healing tool that was first introduced as part of Chris Redfield’s kit in the last two mainline titles.&nbsp;</em></li>
<li><em>It’s not all linear hallways and shooting gallery corridors in PRAGMATA. The player astronaut can jump and glide about briefly to reach far-off platforms, or shoot security locks and open up new elevators to help traverse the lunar station. Taking a step off the beaten path rewards the players with fresh weapons and even permanently increases the number of healing items they can carry at a given time. PRAGMATA’s demo only ran about fifteen minutes or so after getting an initial introduction to the setting and reintroduction to a game that CAPCOM has revealed and talked about only briefly since the initial reveal five years ago today. During my entire session, I kept getting these uncanny Lost Planet vibes through the gunplay and overall technology used in the construction of the world. However, I’m sure this is just a personal take on the world of PRAGMATA.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><iframe title="(Teaser) Capcom Spotlight | 6.26.2025" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uC18vWzk8u8?feature=oembed" width="740" height="416" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Of course, many CAPCOM fans still play Monster Hunter Wilds and Street Fighter 6. The latter game has just <a href="https://wccftech.com/capcom-announced-street-fighter-6-has-surpassed-5-million-copies-sold-since-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> the 5 million sales milestone. Both are likely to be supported for a few years still.</p>
<p>Which of these games are you most looking forward to for next week's CAPCOM Spotlight? Let us know below.</p>

            <p>When the tragically half-empty hooch barrel of potential that was Capone 'em up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/empire-of-sin">Empire Of Sin</a> launched back in late 2020, it also sold a pass pledging two story expansions down the line. The first of these <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/empire-of-sins-first-dlc-and-major-free-update-launch-november-18th">arrived in 2021</a>. Time and more time passed, prompting a union of shaking fists to wave grubby promissory notes scrawled on diner hamburger wrappers and brace themselves for a trampling by the proverbial Pinkerton agents on horseback of continued disappointment. Despite this, that second DLC never materialised.</p>
<p>Do not fear the sound you hear. The Pinkerton's have not found you - it is simply the heavy clopping of legal obligations being grudgingly fulfilled. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1303314/Empire_of_Sin__Hunt_For_Aurora/">Hunt For Aurora is now available</a>, assuming there's anyone left with the energy to avail it.</p>

<p>Romero Games haven't returned for this one. It's been developed by Moonmana, of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2628460/Ultimate_pirates/">shonky Pirate MMO fame</a>. The DLC centres around new boss Robin Kray and partner Sylvia Taylor trying to nab "the Aurora diamond". I don't know much about diamonds aside from the absurd onslaught of 60's marketing that popularised the engagement ring, and the capitalisation prompted me to look up the Aurora, although the most interesting piece of information I came away with is that "Fancy" is an actual proper grading term, which I enjoy quite a bit. Nevertheless, "crime friends want shiny rock" feels like a worthy enough setup.</p>
<p>Here's what <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1303314/Empire_of_Sin__Hunt_For_Aurora/">Steam has to say</a> about Hunt For Aurora.</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li><strong>New Boss:</strong> Robin Kray</li>
<li><strong>New Side Character:</strong> Sylvia Taylor</li>
<li><strong>New Gangster Class:</strong> Vanguard (melee and versatile combat builds)</li>
<li><strong>New Racket:</strong> Dance Clubs</li>
<li><strong>Lucky Companion:</strong> A loyal dog with uncanny good luck</li>
<li><strong>Arsenal Expansion:</strong> High-power Prototype Pistol, Plains Rifle, Model 21 Shotgun, M1886 Sniper Fusil, Irma Submachine Gun, MP 28 Submachine Gun, and Brn. Vz. 26 Machine Gun</li>
<li><strong>6 deadly melee weapons:</strong> P1907, Hooked Quillon Bayonet, 10'' Chef’s Knife, Hunting Knife, Balisong, and Fish Knife</li>
<li><strong>4 New Mission Chains:</strong> Dive into 14 missions in total!</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>I haven't played Empire Of Sin for a very long time. If you have, can you please let me know if there's likely to be a tangible difference between the Chef's Knife and the Fish Knife?</p>
<p>I chatted to Romero Games back in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-empire-of-sins-new-updates-are-adding-more-strategy-more-drama-and-truth-thats-stranger-than-fiction">2021 about the future of Empire Of Sin</a>, following a huge patch. I'd be very interested to learn the full story of how the game was effectively abandoned, because Brenda and the team sounded very motivated at the time.</p></div>

Over the past few years, some of the coolest Nintendo collectibles have been produced by Lego. The building set manufacturer created <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0BSRG8C96,B0DJ1C87WL,B0BSRDW8LL,B0BSRFTX2N,B0BSRFV626&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">four Donkey Kong-themed sets</a> back in 2023 for its Lego Super Mario line.

Unfortunately, the original four sets were discontinued by Lego late last year. Here's the good news, though: Amazon sometimes carries and restocks retired Lego sets months after every other retailer removes them from shelves. Fortunately, that has happened with Donkey Kong Lego sets, including the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Expansion-Collectible-Buildable-Characters/dp/B0BSRG8C96?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">hard-to-find Donkey Kong Tree House</a></strong>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4517697-legodonkeykongtreehouse.png" data-ref-id="1300-4517697" data-ratio="0.70666666666667" data-width="900" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4517697-legodonkeykongtreehouse.png" data-ref-id="1300-4517697"></a><figcaption>Donkey Kong's Tree House (555 pieces)</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4517697-legodonkeykongtreehouse.png"></figure><p>All five Donkey Kong Lego sets, including the four that are discontinued and sold out at other retailers, are currently in stock at Amazon.

<p>"Several adjustments have been made"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Pikmin 3 Deluxe" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f6751a32c7063/pikmin-3-deluxe.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo released a bunch of free Switch updates alongside the launch of the Switch 2 earlier this month but one issue that wasn't entirely resolved was tied to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_3_deluxe">Pikmin 3 Deluxe</a>.</p>
<p>At the time, Nintendo was only able to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/psa-switch-2-updates-for-multiple-first-party-switch-games-are-now-available">"partially" alleviate an issue</a> which occured when playing the game on the Switch 2, and the "entire screen" would flicker in several scenes. It mentioned in the previous patch notes how a fix was on the way, and today it's seemingly delivered on this promise with the Version 1.1.3 game update:</p>
<h2>Pikmin 3 Deluxe: Ver. 1.1.3 (Released June 16, 2025)</h2>
<p><strong>The following updates have been made when playing the game on Nintendo Switch 2:</strong></p>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue that occurs when playing on Nintendo Switch 2 where the entire screen will briefly turn off and on again in several scenes of the game, such as at the beginning and end of a day.</li>
<li>Several adjustments have been made to improve gameplay on Nintendo Switch 2.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Nintendo also mentions how this particular problem has <em>not</em> been resolved in the Pikmin 3 Deluxe Demo, but a fix for this will be distributed alongside a full game update at some point in the future.</p>
<p>These are the only updates Pikmin 3 Deluxe has received for the Switch 2 so far and if there are any upgrades released, we'll let you know. Pikmin 3 is marked on Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible-guide-what-switch-games-cant-be-played">backwards compatibility list of games</a> with issues that have "been resolved, or are planned to be resolved by an update".</p>
<p>This follows on from an update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> and the Switch 2 exclusive <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>

Unless you're mega lucky, of course.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">10: Lillie's Clefairy ex - 184/159</h2><div catalogid="2f8c71b9-ea28-4296-a154-d2c4107f9496" id="223150"><div id="223150" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lillie's Clefairy ex - 184/159</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Whilst Lillie's Clefairy ex SIR is considered the main chase card of Journey Together, it's quite affordable now. Due to the overhype surrounding this set and scalpers not being able to get the same astronomical amounts for it, this card soon crashed to around the $150 mark. It's a gorgeous card and a no brainer decision for your binder.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">9: Team Rocket's Moltres ex - 229/182</h2></div><div catalogid="2f8c71b9-ea28-4296-a154-d2c4107f9496" id="223151"><div id="223151" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Team Rocket's Moltres ex - 229/182</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">How can anyone not love this card? It's got action, stunning detail and eye popping color that represents the Team Rocket vibe of Destined Rivals perfectly. It's a beast in battle too, with Flame Screen doing 110 damage whilst reducing damage from the opposing Pokémon by 50. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Evil Incineration allows trainers to discard a Team Rocket's Energy in order to immidiately discard an opposing active Pokémon and all attached card. Play this right and it could turn battles on their heads, especially because its a basic Pokémon, so it can be built up straight away on a trainers bench without evolution mechanics getting in the way. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">8: Latias ex - 239/191</h2></div><div catalogid="2f8c71b9-ea28-4296-a154-d2c4107f9496" id="223152"><div id="223152" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Latias ex - 239/191</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Sharing a dual artwork with <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKgqVj?object_uuid=ae948c6d-f4c6-49f6-ab91-b545c3b5f3c2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Latios Illustration Rare</a>, Latais ex is holding it's value of nearly $200 and is an absolute stunner playing on a sunset background with Latios. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's ability allows you to switch out basic Pokémon to hit swiftly with Eon blade, which does 200 damage and stops it from attacking next turn. All trainers need to do is survive the next turn and switch out with another Pokémon for free. Rinse and repeat, love to see it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">7: Roaring Moon ex - 162/131</h2></div><div catalogid="2f8c71b9-ea28-4296-a154-d2c4107f9496" id="223153"><div id="223153" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Roaring Moon ex - 162/131</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Roaring Moon ex SIR has held it's value out of the gate since Prismatic Evolutions dropped, which is frankly amazing. The linework in this card is ridiculously intricate, giving it that cave painting vibe that goes well with ancient Pokémon found deep in Area Zero, Paldea. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a cool moment too, seeing Roaring Moon seemingly escaping some sort of cosmic calamity. The more you look at it the better it gets.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6: Cynthia's Garchomp ex - 232/182</h2></div><div catalogid="2f8c71b9-ea28-4296-a154-d2c4107f9496" id="223154"><div id="223154" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Cynthia's Garchomp ex - 232/182</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm calling Destined Rivals as the best Scarlet and Violet set for it sheer amount of detailed and expresive artwork, and Cynthia's Garchomp ex SIR is a fantastic example of this. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With calls to the Pokémon League in the early anime (See the fire lamps at the top of the stadium) and big screen behind trainers on platforms, Garchomp can be seen lunging forward and breaking ground as it goes. Amazing card and well worth the money.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5: Pikachu ex - 238/191</h2></div><div catalogid="2f8c71b9-ea28-4296-a154-d2c4107f9496" id="223035"><div id="223035" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pikachu ex - 238/191</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Current Market Value: $289.86</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Pikachu ex SIR is partially to blame for the Pokémon TCG boom that kicked off at the end of October 2024 and is still going today. After peaking at $485 at the end of 2024, it's finally stabalized at a much for reasonable $295 at the time of writing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a good time to snap it up, if you've got the cash, but the amount of nostalgia and detailed yet soft artwork on this card will make it climb back up as we move away from the Scarlet and Violet era over the years to come. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">4: Ethan's Ho-Oh ex - 230/182</h2></div><div catalogid="2f8c71b9-ea28-4296-a154-d2c4107f9496" id="223155"><div id="223155" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Ethan's Ho-Oh ex - 230/182</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This was one of my main chase cards from Destined Rivals, just look at it. Not only have we got mental amounts of nostalgia for Pokémon Gold and Silver OGs, but it reminds me so much of the first ever episode of Pokémon when Ho-Oh was revealed for the first time (which was before Pokémon Gold and Silver released). It's a stunning illustration that means so much to plenty of trainers, and I half expected the $300 market value before release.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">3: Greninja ex - 214/167</h2></div><div catalogid="2f8c71b9-ea28-4296-a154-d2c4107f9496" id="223034"><div id="223034" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Greninja ex - 214/167</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Current Market Value: $288.31</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Greninja ex SIR is my favorite in this article as I have it graded in a 10 and I'm being completely bias. Joking aside (I'm not) but this is one of the best artworks outside of Prismatic Evolutions in the Scarlet and Violet era. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Twilight Masquerade was a slept on set in my opinion, but the chances of pulling this are stacked. If you have the money upfront, i'd put it into this card instead of trying to rip packs. But I also obviously hate having fun, so the choice is yours.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2: Team Rocket's Mewtwo ex - 231/182 </h2></div><div catalogid="2f8c71b9-ea28-4296-a154-d2c4107f9496" id="223038"><div id="223038" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Team Rocket's Mewtwo ex - 231/182 </h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Current Market Value: $378.76</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What a beast of a card! Mewtwo ex SIR captured that Mewtwo's Revenge energy so hard, immense amounts of nostalgia in this card for me. It looks like everyone agrees considering it's currently over $450. Destined Rivals cards are up and down day after day, so no doubt we'll see this settle at a cheaper pricepoint before it crossed the vintage checkpoint in years to come.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1: Umbreon ex - 161/131</h2></div><div catalogid="2f8c71b9-ea28-4296-a154-d2c4107f9496" id="223040"><div id="223040" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Umbreon ex - 161/131</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Current Market Value: $1,162.95</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">We always knew it was going to be insanely priced, and we needed a cheaper Umbreon chase card after <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/246723/pokemon-swsh07-evolving-skies-umbreon-vmax-alternate-art-secret?page=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Umbreon VMAX (Moonbreon)</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Granted, it's still a mental market price, and over $1,000.

These could've dominated the whole article, otherwise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For starters, <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3G1yP?object_uuid=ae948c6d-f4c6-49f6-ab91-b545c3b5f3c2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Glaceon ex SIR</a> is a stunner, but I always prefer seeing Pokémon cards with a bit of movement and action in them. I have to say though, the ornate ice patterns and overall terastalisation of <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3G1yP?object_uuid=ae948c6d-f4c6-49f6-ab91-b545c3b5f3c2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Glaceon</a> is dipicted so well. It's also one of the less eye-wateringly expensive Eeveelution cards from Prismatic Evolutions at the minute.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keeping up the trend is one of my favorites, <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3G1yR?object_uuid=ae948c6d-f4c6-49f6-ab91-b545c3b5f3c2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jolteon ex SIR</a> from Prismatic Evolutions. There's been some banger Jolteon Cards in the past, for me that would be <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/264213/pokemon-swsh09-brilliant-stars-trainer-gallery-jolteon?Language=English&amp;page=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jolteon from the Brilliant Stars Trainer Gallery</a> and the <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/253418/pokemon-swsh-sword-and-shield-promo-cards-jolteon-v-swsh183?Language=English&amp;page=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jolteon V Sword and Shield Promo Card</a>, but this one has unlimited energy. Just look at how expressive this card is, perfectly showcasing Jolteons speed and agility with one of the coolest backgrounds i've seen in a Pokémon card. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The cell shading mixed with comic book artstyle of <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxAxmp?object_uuid=ae948c6d-f4c6-49f6-ab91-b545c3b5f3c2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vaporeon ex SIR</a> from Prismatic Evolutions is a stunner. Just look at how light is captured in every drop of water and crystal. Plus I think this is one of the cutest depictions of this water-type Eeveelution we've had for some time. Absolute banger of a card and would do a flip terribly if I pulled this beast.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another beautiful pastel artwork with <a href="https://zdcs.link/9YWM4r?object_uuid=ae948c6d-f4c6-49f6-ab91-b545c3b5f3c2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Espeon ex SIR</a>. On top of Espeon being a fan favorite, it's easy to see why this card is now over $300. I've never seen that many shades of purple in such a small space before, such a stunning piece of art, imagine pulling this, getting a 10 then getting it in your slabbed collection? Stuff of dreams.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I love me a good woodblock print, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QL8MYX?object_uuid=ae948c6d-f4c6-49f6-ab91-b545c3b5f3c2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Leafeon ex SIR</a> gives me massive tradition Japanese art vibes. The bold colours, thick lines and the overall beauty of this makes it worth the price tag.Verdant storm for   a grass and colourless energy can be devestating too, 60 x damage for every energy attached to all of your opponents Pokémon. Lethal!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's such a shame Fairy typing didn't come back for <a href="https://zdcs.link/znx5ej?object_uuid=ae948c6d-f4c6-49f6-ab91-b545c3b5f3c2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sylveon ex SIR</a>, because I can't think of a more Fairy type Pokémon card ever. It's another stunner with a cute stance and a pastel color pallete that just makes it. There's that much pink it just works, a fantastic card and its easy to see why it's over $400, especially as it's one of the most popular Eeveelutions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9207bed9c7d34/nintendo-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has rolled out a new system firmware update today for the Switch 2 and original model which bumps the hybrid family of devices up to Version 20.1.5.</p>
<p>This update officially kicks off the Switch 2's life with a stability update, but nothing else is revealed in these patch notes. This follows on from Version 20.1.1 which was released earlier this month and contained some minor fixes.</p>
<p>Here's the full rundown of the latest system update, courtesy of Nintendo's support page:</p>
<h3><a id="current" name="current">Ver. 20.1.5 (Released June 18, 2025)</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>General system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://x.com/OatmealDome/status/1935542554642051512">Dataminer 'OatmealDome'</a> suggests trying out any games that may have had issues to see how they're performing on this new firmware:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I'm currently seeing reports that 20.1.5 fixes some Switch 1 games that previously didn't work on the Switch 2. If you have any problematic games, try them after updating!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If there is anything significant going on behind the scenes of this latest update, we'll be sure to let you know.</p>
<p>If you're not prompted to update your system, you can manually enter the system settings from the home menu on the Switch and Switch 2 to perform this update. You then navigate to the "system" option and perform a "system update" from here.</p>
<p>Nintendo has also been updating many of its games over the past week, including its Switch 2 launch title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/big-year-for-big-wheels.1222695/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/alters-clair-obscur-expedition-33-50-big-wheel<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the most interesting things about playing <em>Clair Obscur</em>,<a href="https://aftermath.site/clair-obscur-expedition-33-gustave-act-one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a video game full of very interesting things</a>, is learning<a href="https://aftermath.site/clair-obscur-journals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> some of the wild and wacky ways previous Expeditions tried and failed to bring down the Paintress</a>. Some brought submarines, others cars. Some brought siege engines. One expedition brought naked butts.</p><p>For me, though, the doomed idea that sticks in the memory is<a href="https://clair-obscur.fandom.com/wiki/Expedition_50" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Expedition 50, who tried to traverse The Continent using...an enormous wheel</a>. It's funny, it's weird, it was clearly <em>never </em>going to work and yet it's so bold, so <em>out there</em>, that you can't help but admire both the Expedition and<em> Clair Obscur’s</em> dedication to the bit. Using a giant wheel as both a base and means of transportation is just the dumbest idea. It doesn't have any balance. It wouldn't be able to make the slightest jump without toppling over, which would then destroy your car <em>and </em>your house. Who even thought of this? There's a reason this doesn't exist in other video games, even make-believe ones, why-</p><figure></figure><p>Ah, excuse me, I am now being told that a second 2025 video game features a Big Wheel.</p><p>I started playing <em>The Alters </em>this week, and you only have to play for a few minutes before being introduced to your base of operations, the one thing that will keep you alive and move you around on an incredibly hostile alien planet. It's huge, it's fancy, it's supposedly the epitome of modern space exploration technology in a universe with quantum computing and on-demand human cloning.</p><p>And it's a Big Wheel.</p><p>The same complaints made against Expedition 50 can be made here, whether in terms of in-universe logic or just game writing. It's a dumb idea! It'll topple over, it's not an optimal use of space, it's too tall, I could go on forever.</p><p>And yet the same truth also applies here: it's a Big Wheel. I wouldn't have written this many words about a Big Truck, or a Big Van, or even a Big Spaceship, because those are things I would expect here. Big Wheel is not, and it is stuck in my mind, like a rusty nail in my heel. I was not prepared for <em>The Alters</em> to have 2025's second Big Wheel, but now that I've been confronted with it, I can't help but fully embrace the madness.</p><p>Everything about <em>The</em> <em>Alters </em>is a bad idea! People's motivations to sign up to the doomed mission are cooked, the ethics of everything you're doing out there are worse, the conditions you're working under are atrocious. Why not send you out there in a Big Wheel?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/wuchang-fallen-feathers-is-a-soulslike-with-a-unique-look-and-a-neat-hook<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m not going to lie to you, folks. When I hear the word “soulslike,” my eyes start to glaze over, and I imagine the sweet release of death. It’s the same way I feel when someone says “metroidvania,” or “roguelike.” There’s nothing inherently wrong with soulslikes, metroidvanias, or roguelikes, for the record. There’s just an awful lot of them. I love a good steak, but you can’t eat fillet mignon every day. Sometimes you need some sushi, a taco plate, hell, even just a burger. A little variety goes a long way. So when I got asked whether I wanted a one or two-hour appointment with Wuchang, I only signed up for an hour. But I was allowed to play for two, and I’m really, really glad I did. Wuchang may be a soulslike, but it’s got unique ideas, and by the time I put down my controller, I knew I wanted to see more of what it has to offer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers sets itself apart from the jump with its unique art and setting. It takes place in the land of Shu during the latter part of the Ming Dynasty. That single choice sets what I played of Wuchang apart from just about every other soulslike. Most games in this genre aren’t shy about their dark fantasy aspirations. In theory, that should mean everything looks a little different. In reality, that means most games look like Dark Souls, which means that most games really look like Berserk. I like Berserk, but it’s not great when everything looks like it stepped out of one of Kentaro Miura’s panels. Wuchang’s dark fantasy, make no mistake, but its setting means a lot of what I saw looks and feels unique (and colorful).</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The story’s got an interesting setup, too. You play as Wuchang, a pirate with a nasty bout of amnesia. In my demo, she woke up without knowing who she was or what was going on. Unfortunately for her, amnesia might be the least of her problems. You see, Wuchang has contracted a disease known as the Feathering. It starts small; feathers form on your limbs. But as the disease progresses, you lose your memories, go mad, and undergo a “monstrous transformation.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Unlike most other Souls games, you don’t have to equip or spec into magic for it to be useful. It just is.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s no known cure, but that doesn’t mean our girl is just going to lie down. She’s healthier than most, so she’s going to look for a cure. The problem is, once most people realize you’ve contracted the Feathering, they’ll attack you on sight. It’s a neat reason for why just about everyone in Wuchang (though not all; there are plenty of people willing to help you) will attack you as soon as they see you. And the Feathering isn’t entirely a curse; it also gives Wuchang access to very powerful magic. Unlike most other Souls games, you don’t have to equip or spec into magic for it to be useful. It just is. That’s pretty slick.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The other big thing Wuchang does is make each of its weapons unique. Each one is different in very subtle ways. The greataxe in my demo could block, but parrying was a technique that was essentially reserved for a longsword. Other weapons didn’t have either ability, opting instead for attack skills to lay on the hurt. And you can’t just fire off these skills anytime, either. Using them (aside from block and parry, which you always have provided you’ve equipped a weapon with them) take charges, which you build by pulling off perfect dodges or parries. Nailing perfect dodges and parries also charges your magic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wuchang isn’t quite as fast as Bloodborne, but it’s faster than most souslikes and encourages you to be aggressive to build those charges. The dance is still here against bosses, and you shouldn’t charge in blindly, but Wuchang is less about waiting for enemies to whiff an attack and punishing them and more about forcing them to swing at you, building those charges, and then cashing in for big damage, either through weapon abilities, magic, or attacks that deal damage while switching to your other equipped weapons. It’s a nice change of pace from traditional soulslike, and forces you to take risks to get access to your best stuff.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Even leveling up is its own thing. Instead of dumping points into your core stats, you fill out a skill tree for everything from your weapons to upgrading your flasks. If you want specific stats, you’ll get them through the armor you equip. There’s no shortage of outfits in Wuchang, from the traditional to the risqué (and there is no shortage of fanservice in Wuchang), but you’re not just playing Fashion Souls or looking at core stats here. You always want to be sure you’re picking the right resistances. If you’re losing to enemies with swords, you might want some slashing resistance. Getting smashed by a big hammer? Bludgeoning resistance is the way to go. Magic got you down? Get some magic resistance in you. These choices matter, and I appreciate that your gear matters, even if I could have done without some of the fan service.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There’s no shortage of outfits in Wuchang, from the traditional to the risqué.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There are still bonfires (here, they’re shrines) and resting at them, which in Wuchang is known as “entering the Dream,” still respawns any enemies you’ve defeated. Even that, though, isn’t necessarily safe. The first time I entered the dream in my demo, I was attacked by a large, bird-like boss. I lost the fight that followed, but when I went back to the dream, the boss wasn’t there. I couldn’t tell you what the deal with that was, but it was interesting, and I kept wondering when (or if) I would get another shot at him. I didn’t, but I am interested in getting another crack at him and figuring out what all that stuff is about.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of bosses, I did get to square off with three of them during my time with Wuchang, and none of them corresponded to the “Big Dude in Armor” stereotype. From Software got that right with Artorias the Abysswalker, and they (and many others) have leaned on similar versions of that fight since. Often imitated, never duplicated, as the saying goes. Wuchang isn’t interested in sitting down at that table, though.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead, every one felt very different. The first was a masked man with a halberd. He definitely had a range advantage on my longsword and greataxe combo, but that was fine with me. I wanted him to swing at me so I could build charges and then use my greataxe to lay down the law. This boss took me quite a few attempts, mostly because I’d think I had an opening when I really didn’t, and get cooked for trying to attack when it wasn’t actually my turn. Once I got his patterns down, though, I was building charges and spending them efficiently, dodging through his attacks and landing big swings of my own. And when I needed to back off? I could cover myself with magic.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The second fight was against someone who seemed to have been transformed by the feathering. This was more acrobatic. The boss would leap into the air and attack from range, forcing me to time my dodges to avoid projectiles and keep from committing until I absolutely had to. I didn’t find it nearly as hard as the first (it took me just s couple tries), but I did appreciate the change of pace.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last fight… whew, that last fight. Only one person at the entire event beat the final fight in the Wuchang demo, and I’m sad to say it  wasn’t me. While the other two fights were all about dodging, this one (against a woman wielding a sword), forced me to parry. Even with the right weapon and good timing, she was a hard fight: incredibly fast, aggressive, and damaging. Every time I tried to back off to heal, she was in my face. Even when I parried her successfully, I had to be careful; I often only had time for a single counterattack before she’d hit me again. It was a brutal fight, and I didn’t win, but I appreciated how hard it was, and how I’d had to change my strategy for each boss. I can’t wait for another crack at her from the comfort of my couch.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And that sums up my feelings with Wuchang as a whole, really. I got a ton of time with it, far more than anything else I played at Summer Game Fest, and I left satisfied with what I’d seen. But I was also excited to see more. Not bad for a souslike, right?</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>We recently went hands-on with the first North American preview event for Dying Light: The Beast during our appointment with Level Infinite to see their other lineup, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/exoborne-impressions-and-qa-from-sgf-2025/">Exoborne</a>. From roughly the beginning of Kyle Crane's return to the world of Dying Light, we got to play out the first hour or so of the adventure, following his escape from captivity after a thirteen-year stint of experiments and inhumane treatment. While he wasn't yet The Beast that this semi-sequel proves, the gameplay did show a meaner, more vindictive Kyle Crane who's angry at the world. This is a man who still has his parkour instincts but isn't shy about knocking a few heads around with a two-handed weapon, no matter if they're human or volatile.</p>
<p>Granted, it was quite clear that Kyle Crane is still just about as effective as he once was in the first Dying Light, and taking on volatiles was asking for a death wish this early on in the adventure. During this session of Dying Light: The Beast, we got to experience small pieces of the Dying Light DNA, from the day and night cycle and the return of safe rooms with IV lights to keep the infected at bay (with a new feature to bolt and shutter windows). The demo even featured a short driving sequence to propel the story into an abandoned junkyard where a twelve-foot-tall infected giant calls his home, leading to a shootout and dance of death. The playthrough session ended with Kyle Crane making the decision to inject infected blood into himself after taking down that hulking behemoth, so there's certainly no way that could backfire on the player, right?</p>
<p>Following the hands-on demo, we sat down with Tymon Smektała, Franchise Director for Dying Light. As a reminder, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-launches-on-august-22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launches</a> on August 22 for PC and current-generation consoles, with old-generation consoles also getting it, albeit later.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Dying-Light_-The-Beast-Screenshot-14-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><strong>What was behind the decision to make Kyle Crane's adventure its own standalone title rather than a DLC for Dying Light 2?</strong></p>
<p>First of all, it makes sense because it's Kyle Crane, right? And there is the whole origin story about how the project started. But actually, I don't really want to go there, because right now at Techland we feel that this is a burden that we have to kinda carry on our backs and I think it makes our work a little bit more challenging because we now need to convince players.</p>
<p>But even though it started as something then, right now it's basically the next Dying Light game. It just doesn't have three at the end of it because we just don't want to scare too many people that might be new coming to the franchise. But actually, we would like to lose that weight on our backs because even though everything starts as something, it evolves and changes. Over the last six months, we have kept adding and adding and adding to the game. Right now, it's an extremely sizable game. The main story takes about 20 hours to complete and all the extra stuff, the side narrative, side mission, and open world activities, they easily double that.</p>
<p>Also, in terms of quality and implementation, side missions have cutscenes, they have quest design practically on the same level as the main story. The last time I played Dying Light: The Beast from start to finish was in April, and my save was 37 hours long of gameplay. So, it is a very proper experience. We have also improved the visuals a lot. Our in-house C-Engine in-house engine went through a number of iterations. Now, all the weather effects, the rendering of materials, lighting, shadows, and how the sun moves in the sky. All of those things are on a completely different level compared to Dying Light 2: Stay Human. One day, we realized we had a new game on our hands. That realization is also something that we would like to assume moving forward as a developer. Because both Dying Light 1 and 2 took seven years to make. We think that with a slightly different approach, with a bigger focus, we can release games more often. We are probably looking at a three or four year cycle, and I think that Dying Light: The Beast is the first step in that direction.</p>
<p>I understand why some players might think, 'oh, it started as a small thing and now they charge full price, they just want to sell it as the next game.' But it actually is, it is the return of Kyle Crane. The campaign is comparable to the previous games, and I think it really is the best Dying Light game we have ever made.</p>
<p><strong>What makes this iteration of Kyle Crane so different from the first game?</strong></p>
<p>There are two things. One is on a more mechanical level, which is obviously the beast-like abilities he gets access to. Aside from his regular survival skills, there's a new progression skill focused on the beast mode and his beast-like abilities—those special superpowers that he gets from the experiments conducted on him by the guy named Barron.</p>
<p>The whole thing about the narrative is that you want to take revenge for those experiments. Narratively, I think Kyle Crane is much more seasoned. In the first game, he was almost like a mercenary who started the game being very one-dimensional. But then, as he went through the game, he started showing some additional colors. Yeah, I think he's very colorful in this one. He really expresses a lot of emotions. He starts as this very bitter, a little bit frustrated character that was basically taken away from the world for a number of years.</p>
<p>He just wants revenge. But then he encounters people in the region of Castor Woods. He encounters communities. He starts interacting with them, and this makes him grow. This makes him open his heart to the people around him. It is a revenge story, but with a number of twists and times and I think the vocal performance of Roger Craig Smith is really phenomenal in this one because Roger is able to use the 10 years of additional experience as a voice actor for the same character that he did 10 years ago, except he's more mature now.</p>
<p><strong>Will this version of Kyle Crane be as nimble and agile as he was in the first Dying Light?</strong></p>
<p>Generally yes, of course, but I don't think nimble and agile are the best words, because yes, he's able to go anywhere he wants, but I actually would like to avoid the word nimble because I think that's one difference between Kyle and Aiden, the protagonist of the second game. Aiden was this young boy who was actually very energetic and nimble.</p>
<p>Kyle was able to use his parkour and go everywhere, but he felt more grounded and more physical. You could really feel like there's a ton of muscles that are pulling the body on top of the rooftop. So, in terms of the feel of the animations, we are aiming at the same thing with Dying Light: The Beast. He's quite a bulky guy. He's able to go anywhere. But he does it realistically in a very physical, grounded manner.</p>
<p><strong>With these superhuman abilities that he's getting from defeating and injecting the Chimera's essence into himself, does that enhance his jumping and running speed?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. On the surface, you might think, okay, I just deal more damage. But you can also run faster and jump higher, even though we didn't design his abilities to be used for traversal or solving environmental puzzles. Of course, we are playtesting the game constantly as the development progresses, and we have realized that there are a number of players who are using those abilities to maybe cheat their way a little into some of the environmental puzzles.</p>
<p>At first, we discussed in the studio that maybe we should limit that somehow, but then we said, "Why should we?" Those players were smart enough to come up with that solution, and games were always about freedom and liberty to do what you wanted to do. So we kept that in the game. Even though the majority of those abilities are focused on combat, there are a number of them that you can use to basically just be more effective with traversal.</p>
<p><strong>Some of the Chimeras will be defeated as part of the story of Dying Light: The Beast, while others will be optional encounters players find in the world. What's the breakup? Is it like 50-50?</strong></p>
<p>I would say it's very much skewed more towards the main story. We actually first thought that they would be like open world activities, but then we realized during playtesting that a number of players just go through the game and don't look for anything outside the main story. We realized that a lot of those cool boss fights with Chimeras would be lost to players. They just wouldn't know that they even existed. After some consideration, we decided to pull most of those Chimeras into the main story.</p>
<p>And I'm actually very glad we did that because some of those fights, well, hopefully all of them, but some have standout moments that we wanted all players to experience. So right now, the majority of the fights are there on the main story path, while some will just require you to maybe just be a little bit more observant of the environment.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Dying-Light_-The-Beast-Screenshot-15-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><strong>Are there any breadcrumbs to guide the player towards these Chimeras, or will there be points on your map to keep an eye out for?</strong></p>
<p>The general mindset for Dying Light: The Beast is that we don't want to guide players too much. Of course, if you play the main story, there's an objective. There is a dot on the compass that tells you where to go. But I think with the world we have created, a lot of the fun comes from discovering what's in it and exploring it yourself. Of course, there are some icons on the map. There is an objective for the main story, but I highly encourage all of our players to get loose, start exploring, and start seeing what's there in the world for them.</p>
<p><strong>In open world games, there's usually a diverse type of side content and quests. Are there any mission types that either are not returning for Dying Light: The Beast or are brand new?</strong></p>
<p>Some of them, definitely. One thing that we are doing is bringing vehicles back, and there are a number of missions focused on vehicles, like I would say little races that you participate in. So definitely, that's something quite new.</p>
<p>Not many people know this, but Techland was making rally games around 15 years ago. We have kept the developers of those games within the studio because they were very talented programmers in general. They always wanted to get back to creating vehicles and driving models, etc. The lead programmer working on the vehicles for this game was also the lead programmer for one of our oldest rally games. That's why we decided to have a number of those additional activities around driving. Actually, I think there's a potential for a zombie Carmageddon game in there somewhere, so maybe we'll do that at some point in the future.</p>
<p>Looking at other content, we basically examined what worked and didn't work in the previous games and then decided to cherry-pick the most interesting formats, tweak them, and update them.</p>
<p><strong>Can you share any examples of what you did?</strong></p>
<p>For example, save zones were a staple of the first Dying Light. We presented them differently in the sequel, which might have been a misstep. We went back to the blueprint of the first game but then added a number of small mechanics. For example, you can barricade the save zones using shutters, which is needed for the save zone to actually be able to function.</p>
<p><strong>Is Kyle Crane any good at using a glider?</strong></p>
<p>Nothing to announce at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Alright. In the demo, we saw many military troops out there with plenty of guns. Is that a new focus on leaning more into military tech?</strong></p>
<p>Generally, when it comes to firearms, I wouldn't say that's our focus, but we spent a lot of time and resources making sure that the guns feel right, sound right, and have the right animations. And when you shoot that enemy with a shotgun, he actually flies away as he should.</p>
<p>We wanted to make sure that guns are properly realized in Dying Light: The Beast, and I think we never really did that in any of the previous games. We had guns in the first, and we introduced them later in Dying Light 2: Stay Human, but they were never realized on this level.</p>
<p>All the military tech comes from the fact that the guy who controls the whole area owns a private army. So, yes, you will fight with them and you could feel that this turns into a military shooter type of game. But it's definitely not predominant in the game. It is still a game that is very much zombie-centric. It's very much a game where we present the different combat situations and challenges in front of you, and we give you plenty of tools to choose the one that you want to use to solve that problem in front of you. Melee weapons, ranged weapons, firearms, a number of accessories, or maybe even trying to turn the zombies against the Barron's people and vice versa.</p>
<p><strong>Will the firearms be as customizable as the melee weapons?</strong></p>
<p>Not really. There are some systems that allow you to upgrade the guns, but you don't craft the guns; you can just make them more effective, deal more damage, basically be upgraded.</p>
<p><strong>Okay. Any changes to how the durability system works for melee weapons?</strong></p>
<p>No. I know this is a divisive mechanic for players, but I think it's needed for a survival horror game because these games work at their best when you feel fragile. And for you to feel fragile, we really need to have those moments where we take away stuff from you.</p>
<p>So it's there, but you can repair your weapons, you can upgrade your weapons, you can scrap your weapons. Actually, we are introducing a crafting table in every safe zone where you can do a number of things to make them more effective in the next encounter.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Dying-Light_-The-Beast-Screenshot-19-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><strong>Any plans or thoughts about bringing back 'Be the Zombie' mode?</strong></p>
<p>It's not going to be there at launch, but I think we, as Techland, have already proven that we are trying to be this developer that listens to our community. Right now we are just focusing on the proper launch of the game, but then we see where the community's appetites are and we'll start announcing our plans for post-launch support after the new releases.</p>
<p><strong>With this iteration of Kyle Crane being so much more vicious and dangerous, how is the night still going to be a challenge?</strong></p>
<p>It's going to be a challenge in the way that if you play with headphones and it's dark in your room, then you're really going to get scared. We are not doing anything revolutionary with our night. We are just trying to execute the best possible version of our night. So, it's properly dark. The flashlight just offers you a little visibility. There are those moments of tension where you just want to see what's in front of you when you turn, but you don't really know yet.</p>
<p>The Volatiles' visual design and behaviors have been improved to make them even more gruesome and scary. What really helps us a lot is the new environment. In our prior games, you could use parkour to basically get away from any situation. But to use parkour properly, you need to have a city landscape with buildings to jump on. I think our players got used to the fact that they can use parkour every time they are surrounded to get away.</p>
<p>But when you are in the middle of the forest, like you take away the car from you, you can just run. You cannot really do all of those cool tricks that make the zombies fall behind. You can just run, and they run as fast as you, so I think the new environment adds a lot to the tension and pressure we put on the players during the night.</p>
<p><strong>Are the new consoles helping you realize the visual fidelity you've wanted to?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely. Absolutely. I think it is most visible in the lighting, shadows, weather effects, and how we render materials. If you see a stone, it looks like a stone from real life. If you see a wooden table, it looks like a wooden table from real life. So, the power of the current engine and then modern hardware is something that really adds to the visual fidelity. And I think fidelity is the most important word here because fidelity leads to immersion.</p>
<p>It was always a goal for Dying Light games to put you in the shoes of the protagonist, make you feel like you are part of this world and you have to survive in it.</p>
<p><strong>Okay. And what are your thoughts on bringing Dying Light: The Beast to the Nintendo Switch 2?</strong></p>
<p>I would love this to happen at some point, but nothing to announce at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Which platforms will Dying Light: The Beast be available on?</strong></p>
<p>The game will be available for PC, PS5, Xbox Series S, and X on August 22nd, with old-generation versions to follow by the end of the year.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be a physical release?</strong></p>
<p>Not at launch, but we are considering some options, maybe approaching it more from a limited edition perspective. But for the full launch, it's a digital-only release.</p>
<p><strong>To wrap things up, is there one thing you're so passionate about that you don't want players to miss?</strong></p>
<p>Keep your eyes open for the details. It is a very detailed world, with everything you will encounter, including how the zombies look, how the weapons look, and how they behave. The locations, the interiors, the apartments, and the buildings you visit. All of those things are full of details, so please appreciate those details. Stop for a second. Look around you, and I think you'll be amazed at how much work and passion have been put into this project. One tip for players who will be stepping in fresh without the knowledge of the previous games.</p>
<p>Don't mistake this for a mindless hack-and-slash against zombies type of game. This is a game of smart survival. This is a game where you have to use your brain to survive, to complete what's in front of you. So don't play it mindlessly, just try to focus, try to get into the groove.</p>
<p><strong>What's the best way for players to understand the story of Kyle Crane before going into this?</strong></p>
<p>We are actually doing a lot to import them properly. If you have never played a game before, a very nice summary will play at the beginning of the game. But we have also made a lot of conscious narrative decisions to feed you the information in a way that you don't get overloaded with stuff, but you'll be properly able to understand everything that happens around you.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you so much for your time.</strong></p>

EA's free-to-play Skate reboot is officially gearing up to launch into early access this "summer", narrowing down its previous "2025" release window. But first, it'll receive its "biggest playtest update" yet, which will be made available to all registered Insiders starting on 2nd July.
</p>
<p>
This latest iteration of Skate was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-latest-skate-entry-is-live-service-free-to-play-game">formally unveiled in 2022</a> as an "authentic evolution" of the beloved skateboarding series, and is being developed by Full Circle, a studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-announces-full-circle-the-new-studio-working-on-the-next-skate">specifically set up to work on the project</a>. Its team - which includes original Skate creators Deran Chung and Cuz Parry - has been intermitently sharing progress reports since then, and select players have even been able to participate in early closed playtests.
</p>
<p>
Playtests were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skate-is-finally-ready-for-playtesting-heres-how-to-get-involved">expanded to consoles at the start of this year</a> (and were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-skate-doesnt-yet-have-a-full-release-date-but-already-has-microtransactions">rapidly followed by microtransactions</a>), and EA now says it'll be opening playtests up to everyone, provided they've registered their interest before 27th June. This comes ahead of Skate's "biggest playtest update yet", which will pave the way for its early access release this "summer".

<p>
Skate's impending update is officially titled Update 0.27.0, and promises "upgrades, changes, fixes, and performance improvements". EA <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/news/the-grind-vol-three">goes into a little more detail in its blog post</a>, but playtest participants can expect a visual overhaul, bringing the likes of increased environmental detail, improved lighting and shadows, better textures and effects, UI enhancements, and an increase in players per server to 150.
</p>
<p>
That's alongside more missions and challenges - EA says players will now find over 140 challenges around the city of San Vansterdam - plus expanded character customisation options (including more hairstyles, gestures, and emotes), and overhauled progression and rewards.
</p>
<p>
EA's blog post also contains answer to some frequently asked questions (no to keyboard and mouse support, yes to cross-progression, for instance), but the important bit is that anyone wanting to experience Skate's impending playtest update on 2nd July will need to have <a href="https://skate.game/insider">registered as an Insider</a> by 27th June, with access invitations set to go out in waves. Registration will no longer be available after this point, as Full Circle makes final preparations for Skate's "summer" early access launch. It sounds like summer might be nearing its end by the time Skate arrives, however, given EA also says the game is now "just months away".

In fact, it already happened. <em>Return to Silent Hill</em> has been done for a bit now, after it wrapped up shooting in 2023. It’s directed and co-written by Christophe Gans, the same guy who directed the weirdly good original <em>Silent Hill </em>film from 2006. This new film isn’t connected to that movie or the less popular 2012 sequel film, <em>Silent Hill: Revelation</em>. Instead,<em> Return to Silent Hill</em> is a standalone movie based heavily on <em>Silent Hill 2. </em></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/2025/06/silent-night-deadly-night-return-silent-hill-release-dates-1236436030/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/2025/06/silent-night-deadly-night-return-silent-hill-release-dates-1236436030/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On June 18, <em>Deadline </em>revealed</a></span> that Cineverse, Bloody Disgusting, and Iconic Events Releasing—the same trio of companies responsible for <em>Terrifier 3</em>—are bringing<em> Return to Silent Hill</em> to theaters. The horror film will be released on January 23, which does make me nervous, as that’s historically the month when movie studios and production companies dump bad films into cinemas.</p><p> There is no trailer for the movie yet, but here’s an old teaser from 2022: </p><p>“Return to <em>Silent Hill </em>hits theaters at the perfect time,” said Mark Rupp, CFO/COO and co-founder of Iconic Events Releasing. “[It arrives after the] successful recent launch of the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> game remake that the movie is based on, while also celebrating the 20th anniversary of the start of the horror film franchise.”</p><p>Yeah, that makes me even more nervous. The fact that the main reason this thing is getting a theatrical release is because the recent <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake did so well doesn’t fill me with confidence. </p><p>Regardless, in January 2026, we are getting a live-action adaptation of <em>Silent Hill 2.</em> If <em>Return to Silent Hill </em>turns out to be bad, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-ps5-townfall-ascension-konami-bloober-1849679202?_gl=1*187f2zx*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTAyNzkwOTMkbzEzOCRnMSR0MTc1MDI3OTE0MiRqMTEkbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-ps5-townfall-ascension-konami-bloober-1849679202?_gl=1*187f2zx*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTAyNzkwOTMkbzEzOCRnMSR0MTc1MDI3OTE0MiRqMTEkbDAkaDA.">well, at least we’ve got a bunch of <em>Silent Hill</em> games and remakes to play these days.</a></span> </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
