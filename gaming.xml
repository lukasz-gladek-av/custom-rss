But that was long, long ago, and the immortal god’s children, now locked away in the underworld, are but malevolent powers who leech their influencer into the kingdom of Lethe. But who are you? Well, you’re just a member of a guild, trying to survive the grim and ghastly world of <i>Doomsong</i>.</p>

<h2><b>What Is </b><b><i>Doomsong</i></b><b>?</b></h2>

<p><i>Doomsong </i>is a brand new Tabletop RPG created by Jack Caesar, Chris Caesar, and Morgan Finley (illustrator), published by Caesar Ink. In this game set on the verge of a biblical apocalypse, players take on the role of guild members struggling to eke out an existence and survive in the treacherous kingdom of Lethe.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doomsong-travelers.jpg?itok=ZLedlZa5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doomsong-travelers.jpg?itok=l4tC_XGO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>With a core rulebook coming in at nearly 300 pages, as well as additional materials already available for purchase like the adventure <i>Lord Have Mercy Upon Us</i>, printed maps and calendars, and more - <i>Doomsong</i> is hitting the market ready to make a splash.</p>

<h2><i>Doomsong </i>Revels In Simplicity</h2>

<p>The core mechanic of <i>Doomsong</i> can, essentially, be boiled down in wonderfully simple terms: your character makes checks by rolling a d6, and the player will consult their character’s traits and abilities to make a case for why their roll should be higher.</p>

<p>With many of the difficulty checks set at 5, you’ll need those traits to add to your roll. Is your character from the slums with the Slumcaste trait? Then you’ll have an easier time navigating the city and get a +1 to your roll. But traits can be hindering, too. For example, if the same character from the slums wants to impress a noble, that Slumcaste trait could end up giving them a -1 to their roll!</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doomsong-attack-sequence.jpg?itok=-2vqodas 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doomsong-attack-sequence.jpg?itok=Dr2uXdvA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Combat follows a similar logic, with the difficulty of the roll to attack set by your opponent’s toughness. As you hack away at your opponents (and they do the same to you), that toughness level will drop (damage is dealt to a character’s toughness, there’s no HP as it were), making it easier and easier to hit them with each successive strike.</p>

<p>But combat also has a great dice-assignment mechanic to it. Each PC has two dice that they assign at the start of their combat round to various actions. The faster they happen, the less powerful, the longer they take to go off in a round, the more valuable or powerful the action. It's a great way to handle what ends up being a really interesting, mixed activation initiative.</p>

<h2>The World of <i>Doomsong</i> is Rich and Deep</h2>

<p>While you can pick this game up <a href="https://caesar.ink/shop" rel="nofollow">off the shelf</a> (or off of <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/499566/doomsong" rel="nofollow">DrivethruRPG</a>), learn the basic mechanics, and set your table off on their (not so) merry way, <i>Doomsong</i> really rewards GM’s who are into the world building, into the lore, and take the time to read through the book.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doomsong-fish-monster.jpg?itok=QO1dNOzM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doomsong-fish-monster.jpg?itok=WHP8Cnmo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>That’s the experience I had with this game. I sat down and read this book cover to cover, totally engrossed in the world created here. Subway ride after subway ride to and from the day job, I had my nose stuck in this book, learning about the various powers that shape and control the Kingdom of Lethe.</p>

<p>Ruled by a vicious ecclesiastical government who seeks to root out and destroy any who perform heretical magic (as all supernatural power comes not from the dead true god, but his ruinous children), and set in a low-magic world that is, for lack of a better term, falling apart at the seams, <i>Doomsong</i> and its world was right up my alley.</p>

<p>For fans of medieval horror like myself, sometimes playing this game feels like the TTRPG equivalent of the baroque, terrifying, chokingly religious vibe of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13543121-between-two-fires" rel="nofollow"><i>Between Two Fires</i></a>, which is… just about exactly what I’m looking for in a game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doomsong-enemy.jpg?itok=CEweoPbh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doomsong-enemy.jpg?itok=hQOfXQFo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The game contains a full bestiary of nasty adversaries, from your common mercenary to talking bears, stomping giants to the Sublime demi-god named Hope (not as good an entity to run into as the name implies).</p>

<h2>Death is a Fact of Life in <i>Doomsong</i></h2>

<p>This is not the kind of roleplaying game where you create your character, kit them out with incredible gear, and set out to avenge the murdered one true god. Not by a long shot. <i>Doomsong</i> is a game that revels in its own lethality, and encourages players to think of their characters as one part of a great story, actors who can - at any moment - exit stage left.</p>

<p>In my first game with my table, after a bit of carousing with other members of the Ratcatchers guild, they set off to find out why a church bell won’t stop ringing (I pilfered a few of my favorite adventure hooks from the <i>Lord Have Mercy Upon Us </i>campaign book for my custom campaign), and were soon ambushed by robbers on the road.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doomsong-villagers.jpg?itok=Ou39HPxg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doomsong-villagers.jpg?itok=EEyq8SFJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A fair fight, weighted slightly in my players’ favor, and still they left the fight bruised, banged around, and with one of my characters missing an eye! That was just the first fight, with little nobodies in the grand scheme of the bestiary. What a rush!</p>

<p>And the one thing I think <i>Doomsong</i> does <i>so</i> right here to soothe some of that sting from a highly lethal game is simple: character creation is quick and really, really fun.</p>

<h2><i>Doomsong </i>Character Creation - Roll With It!</h2>

<p>In <i>Doomsong</i>, creating your character is all about rolling on tables and making decisions based on those rolls. First, you roll on the Origins table to see where you’re from, originally.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doomsong-character-origin.jpg?itok=Eu1uH98u 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doomsong-character-origin.jpg?itok=CpylUMJ6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>You could end up rolling and being from the uncharted wilds of the Weald, born in the slums, from a working family on a farm, the middle class, or wealthy elite (or you could be something really strange/special). After determining your birthplace - which does make a lot of difference in the world of <i>Doomsong</i> - you’ll be instructed to turn to another page to resolve another life path roll.</p>

<p>Rolling on that table may offer you options, and this is where you acquire traits, abilities, and sometimes (though its more rare) starting gear: do you gain some new trait from having lived at one time as a performer? Were you a soldier in the army? Only the dice (and your own decisions you make throughout) will tell.</p>

<p>In this way, character creation is fun and fast, and does an incredible job of mixing intense randomness through dice-rolling with giving you choices and options throughout. Hell, you can even die during character creation!</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doomsong-lifepaths.jpg?itok=fkbBHK1p 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doomsong-lifepaths.jpg?itok=wzKD_ssK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><i>Doomsong </i>TTRPG - Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>And that’s why I love <i>Doomsong</i> so much, every step of the way you’re</p>

<p>invited to truly choose your own adventure, from character creation on up to how you interact with the world, it’s the perfect blend of gritty details (do you have enough food to last your journey) and abstraction (your weapon gives you a +1 to your roll… that’s usually it).</p>

<p>With absolutely stunning artwork that truly evokes a feeling of dread, and gameplay that is as entertaining and thought-provoking as it is brutal, <i>Doomsong </i>is an absolute must-try for fans of classic RPG’s, and for players who want to get away from the plot-armor of other big-name fantasy RPGs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Give it a try, there’s even <a href="https://caesar-ink.itch.io/doomsong-demo" rel="nofollow">a free download of trial rules available on </a><a href="http://itch.io/" rel="nofollow">itch.io</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Metro 2033 is celebrating its 15-year anniversary today, March 16, 2025. Below, we examine how its subtle morality system helped to illustrate its broader points about humanity and violence.</em></p><p dir="ltr">In video games, evil tends to be gigantic. Think of the rivers of blood in Baldur's Gate 3's evil endings or an army of Sith bowing to the player in Knights of the Old Republic. These moments are not exactly comical, but they have a glee to them. They have the joy of a cackling cartoon villain. In some sense, Metro 2033 is no exception. In the wake of atomic devastation, the Moscow metro populates itself with cruel bandits, monstrous mutants, and authoritarian militants. It is grimmer than the prior examples to be sure, but there is still a note of the absurd in its endless cruel men. But the game's ultimate quest, to destroy a mutant army of "Dark Ones" with an atomic weapon, casts the shadow of real-world brutality. Metro 2033 concerns itself with the miniscule decisions and delusions that build up to atrocity, all under an atomic shadow. Unlike most other morality systems, Metro 2033 does not announce itself; instead it builds up the protagonist's character through tiny individual moments: beats of butterfly wings that become a hurricane.</p><p dir="ltr">This works in a simple binary way. Completing certain tasks will net protagonist Artyom moral points. Get enough points and he'll have the opportunity for the good ending. In contrast to other games with morality systems, the player cannot see how many points Artyom has earned. There is only a sound and a flash of light (a more ominous sound plays when Artyom loses moral points). Fittingly, Artyom has humble origins. He is not a soldier. His station is distant from the comparatively sprawling central stations of the Metro and he has rarely left his home. He is as explicit a player-insert as a game like this can muster. More familiar with the world than the player to be sure, but also an outsider and newcomer to most of it. A sort of greatness awaits him. The game opens in media res: Artyom outfitted with military-grade gear and fighting a massive migration of mutants on the surface. But at the start, he is only arrogant because of his youth, not his power. He is incapable of atrocity; it takes an invitation for him to become a monster.</p><p dir="ltr">Metro 2033 opens with Artyom's older friend and mentor Hunter visiting his home station. Hunter is a ranger--a kind of special forces operative who acts as a de facto police officer in the metro. He warns of the Dark Ones, claiming they have destroyed other stations, intoning, "My order has a motto: If it's hostile, you kill it." As he departs to find them, Hunter leaves Arytom with his dog tags, telling him to warn the Metro's central government at the "polis" station should he not return. Hunter trusts Arytom with this task, because of his liking for him--not because of any special ability or skill he has. Doing a favor for a friend is a long way from dropping a bomb.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="570407447" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

Artyom's accumulation of allies and weaponry, but in the sense of emotional capacity for harm. There's a lot of downtime in Metro 2033. The gas-lamp markets and claustrophobic bedrooms of the stations act as spaces to breathe between the dark wasted corridors of the train lines and the barricaded, hostile settlements of bandits and fascists. Outside of the stations, Metro 2033 has a survival-horror quality: horrific monsters, limited ammo, and wasted environment. But the stations themselves act as tours for the mundane life of the Metro's citizens. Beggars plead for money, domestic disputes bleed through thin walls, and conversations wait to be overheard. Arytom does more than fight monsters. He can give to beggars or ignore them. He can chat up the station's inhabitants or blow right past them. In other words, Arytom can avoid atrocities by paying attention to other people. But generosity is only a part of it.</p><p dir="ltr">The morality system also values this attention even when it isn't applied to human beings. The Metro's economy is based on military-grade bullets, which can be spent outright or used as powerful ammunition on their own. On the irradiated surface, Artyom must wear a gas mask, but its filters deplete quickly; he must scavenge or buy more to survive. These systems in combination encourage Arytom to search for materials to aid his journey. Finding caches left by dead rangers or even examining the corpses themselves will net Artyom more moral points. Levels are linear, but labyrinthian. The game rewards the player when they explore its margins or off the path set for them.</p><p dir="ltr">In a sense, Metro 2033’s emphasis on the path less taken makes it an anti-military shooter. Even at their most expansive, Call of Duty campaigns are focused on objective markers and straightforward, set-piece level design. Metro 2033 takes cues from this, but often allows for multiple approaches. Its UI is absent of any path indicators. When it slips into a more military-shooter mode, it is when Arytom has a guide, someone else, often a soldier, to show him the way. But even in those moments, the morality system still tracks deviations from the path and rewards them.</p><p dir="ltr">In other words, when Arytom obeys orders, he kills innocents. Hunter attributes violence to the Dark Ones, but Arytom never actually sees it occur. Instead, Arytom sees them looking at him and they scuttle off into shadows when he returns their gaze. Hearsay and rumor make them out to be an existential threat, but experience gives Artyom something else. The Dark Ones dot his journey with visions, mostly of Moscow before the bombs fell. It's a simple message: "Don't do this again." The Atom Bomb rends the world, just not in literal terms, but psychically--spiritually. The Dark Ones are vessels of that loss: prophets that seek to prevent its second destruction.</p><p dir="ltr">Mountains of individual decisions led to the atrocity of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, even though we tend to lay it at the feet of men like Truman and Oppenheimer. But even these men were composed of small choices. American Prometheus, the biography upon which Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is based, gives its subject curious virtues. They are the very traits that made Oppenheimer a charismatic and affable figure that enabled him to build the bomb: his powers of persuasion, his ability to comprehend and summarize complex information, and his consideration for the many people who worked under him. What does it mean to be a "good" person, even someone with strong moral convictions, when what you build is death? It would be easy to blame Oppenheimer's sins and deficiencies for the bomb, but there is often a stronger connection between the first atomic weapon and his virtues.</p><p dir="ltr">This is a nuance that Metro 2033 cannot quite manage. If Arytom is caring, generous, and attentive, he will have the opportunity to prevent the Dark One's obliteration. If he is simple and bullish, he will kill them all. But atrocity is woven into mundanity in insidious ways. Even generosity can go hand in hand with violence. One only needs to take a look at the investment portfolios and political donations of philanthropists to bear that out. There is a simplicity to Metro's moral fable that undercuts its aspirations.</p><p dir="ltr">But Metro 2033 still has power, not just for its sheer subversion of military shooters, but its apocalypse mood. Light is soft, scant, and diffuse. Darkness is dank and all-enveloping. What plant life appears is gnarled and dead, twisted like the metal of the Metro infrastructure. The shadows of ghosts stand in flashlight brightness, vanishing with the click of a switch. The world is haunted. Metro 2033's journey is Arytom deciding whether he will be haunted too.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/fromage-review-say-cheese<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s the early 20th century, and as an artisanal French cheese maker, your to-do list keeps growing! There’s the cheese to make, of course, but do you have everything you need for the cheese festival? Are you ready to deliver your cheese around France? These questions, and more, curdle players in the all-new board game <i>Fromage </i>designed by Ben Rosset &amp; Matthew O'Malley (<em>The Search for Planet X</em>), and published by R2i Games.</p>

<h2>What Is <i>Fromage</i>?</h2>

<p><i>Fromage </i>is a simultaneous worker placement board game where players take on the role of French cheesemakers, trying to gain prestige points to become the best in all of France.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Fromage</i> Stats:</p>

<ul><li>1 - 4 Players</li>
	<li>Est. Game Time: 30 - 45 min.</li>
	<li>Game Genre: Simultaneous Worker Placement</li>
	<li>Complexity: Medium+</li>
</ul></blockquote>

<p>In the game, you’ll use your limited amount of workers to make cheese and place that cheese in various parts of a rotating board. Each player has 15 cheese tokens, and the game ends when one player places their final token. From there, you’ll tally up points you gain in four different sections of the board, and your own personal player mat, and the player with the most points wins.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fromage-different-cheeses.jpg?itok=M40a20n5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fromage-different-cheeses.jpg?itok=HjrSrBCX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bleu, Hard, and Soft cheeses all vie for dominance in various regions of France, this the Villes venue of the board.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Do You Play <i>Fromage</i>?</h2>

<p><i>Fromage </i>is all about carefully planning out your turns to balance using your limited workers - of which you only have three - either to gather resources (needed to gain various benefits), or to make cheese on the quadrant of the board currently facing you.</p>

<p>And that’s the most crucial part of <i>Fromage</i>, in my opinion, that bit about “currently facing you.” Implementing a unique rondel component for the central board, you’ll assign your workers to the quarter of the board facing you at the table.</p>

<p>Then, once everyone has played their workers and the round ends, the board rotates one quarter of the way around. You recover any worker of yours currently pointing at you when the board rotates. Less valuable/quicker actions will have your worker pointing at you the next turn of the game, but longer actions could take up to three turns.</p>

<h2>So Much To Do At The Dairy Farm!</h2>

<p>I love this style of worker-placement game, where you have so many options, and can see so many different paths to victory laid out ahead of you. The four main quadrants of the board, called venues, each offer a tantalizing way to earn victory points - but you’ll only see them once every four spins.</p>

<p>First, there’s the Festival venue, where you’ll show off your cheeses to crowds at a cheese festival in the town square (I want to go to a cheese festival in <i>my</i> town square!), and you score points by making orthogonally adjacent cheeses on the game board grid.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fromage-board.jpg?itok=0OpTG3M9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fromage-board.jpg?itok=2KcdbU75 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The entire Fromage board offers so many possibilities in each of the four different villes. In front of us is the Fromagerie ville.</figcaption></figure><p>The Fromagerie venue is all about placing down cheeses on shelves to gain immediate resources in return, and you’ll score in the end for have cheese on different shelves. This is a great venue for trading some lighter points for useful resources like fruit (which some cheese spots across the four venues call for).</p>

<p>Third is the Bistro venue, where you’ll offer up your cheeses at a prestigious French restaurant for pairings. Each time you successfully pair two cheeses of your own on the same table, you’ll increase the value of all your cheeses at this venue.</p>

<p>And finally there’s the Villes venue, which is - I’m not joking - a fun little area control portion of the game where you’re trying to deliver cheese to cities across France to grow your customer base.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fromage-territories.jpg?itok=EGl2DqYQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fromage-territories.jpg?itok=lkz3v8S0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The villes invite friendly local competition.</figcaption></figure><p>There’s so much to do, and it would be in your best interest to mostly ignore some of these venues and focus on gathering resources and honing in on one section - but that’s easier said than done when every rotation of the board opens up new possibilities.</p>

<h2>Fromage Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>As you can tell from this review, I’m totally enamored with <i>Fromage</i>. I think this is an absolutely unique gameplay style, with a fun and innovative approach to worker placement that I’ve not come across previously.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I really like how each venue feels very different from one another, and though I didn’t cover it much here in this review, you have your own player board that allows you to stash resources needed to gain extra points and build up your farm.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fromage-player-board.jpg?itok=xQb1R2HD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fromage-player-board.jpg?itok=w5Le4PE8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Upgrade your player board to help boost your cheese production and reputation!</figcaption></figure><p>Though the order cards, and some upgrades to your farm, feel a little under-ripened (who has enough time in this game to devote to special orders and fully upgrading?), it all works together to hint at many different areas of opportunity to score points.</p>

<p>All said, if you’re looking for a new take on worker placement, then it may just be time to get cheesy with <i>Fromage</i>!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/630856/angry-miao-am-infinity-mouse-gaming-price-specs-impressions<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>Angry Miao is known for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23312108/angry-miao-cyberblade-anc-earbuds-am-hatsu-mechanical-keyboards-arthouse-design-tech">ridiculous</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/23/24204005/angry-miao-am-rgb-65-nintendo-game-boy-mechanical-keyboard-price-specs">over-the-top</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24277781/this-655-keyboard-is-wired-only-because-it-has-to-power-389-leds">mechanical keyboard</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23416961/angry-miao-adjustable-flex-alice-mechanical-keyboard-anime-availability-specs-price">designs</a>, but now it’s made a gaming mouse that’s, you guessed it: ridiculous and over-the-top. It’s also cool as all hell, starts at $125 on a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/angrymiao/am-infinity-mouse-gaming-mouse-with-unlimited-battery-life">Kickstarter preorder special</a> ending March 17th, and may be my new favorite mouse. </p></div><p>The AM Infinity Mouse has a skeletonized magnesium-alloy shell that weighs just 49 grams, making it one of the lightest full-size mice on the market. Within its hollowed-out, super lightweight black chassis is a magnetic battery that can be popped out and swapped in seconds. A spare is kept charged and at the ready on the mouse’s 2.4GHz receiver. This functionality gives the mouse its name, as Angry Miao claims hot-swapping equals “infinite” battery. Just like how my fridge has infinite ice cubes, obviously.</p><p>The Infinity Mouse’s more conventional features include an 8,000Hz polling rate for minimal input latency, even with high-refresh monitors. Its PixArt <a href="https://mechkeys.com/blogs/news/pixart-introduces-paw3950-upcoming-flagship-optical-sensor-for-gaming-mice">PAW3950 optical sensor</a> is capable of 30,000 DPI so you can make the mouse as ridiculously sensitive as you want. And its new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDl6HXIYgeI">TTC Orange Dot Optical V2 micro switches</a> have a nice tactile click, sensitive enough to confidently register when pressing anywhere on the left and right mouse buttons (even up near the mouse’s center). Its forward and back buttons on the left side are see-through blue in this pre-production model, but Angry Miao says they’ll be black on final units expected to ship in June.</p><p>In addition to the 2.4GHz connectivity enabled through its RGB-illuminated dongle / battery charger, the mouse also supports Bluetooth and wired USB-C. (In wired mode without a battery, it’s just 39 grams). Angry Miao claims that when using 8,000Hz polling over 2.4GHz wireless you can get up to 17 hours of continuous use before having to swap its 340mAh battery. That’s ample time for it to recharge on the receiver. And if you bump the mouse down to 1,000Hz the estimated battery life extends to 43 hours.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The wireless receiver puck has RGB lighting that shows charging status once you swap batteries.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>I expect the most polarizing aspects of the AM Infinity Mouse to be the aesthetics and the ergonomics of its open design. The open look may not be to everyone’s liking, especially if you don’t want to deal with dust buildup on your mouse’s circuitry. While plenty of other mice have had cutouts for the sake of weight savings, they’re usually much more conservative honeycomb patterns. The Infinity Mouse leaves just the bare-minimum of metal. Angry Miao claims it pursued this design upon inspiration from the <a href="https://www.carscoops.com/2022/04/the-evanora-imagines-the-ultimate-lotus-speedster-for-the-track/">Lotus Evanora</a> concept and late-1970s <a href="https://media.lotuscars.com/en/heritage-race-cars/lotus-type-79.html">Lotus Type 79 F1 car</a>, and it does look like a small sampling of automotive art on your desk.</p><p>But like a race car, the Infinity Mouse and its massive cutouts may not comfortably accommodate everyone. My average hands feel perfectly fine gripping the Infinity Mouse, but none of my fingers or palm touch points fall directly on an edge. If you have small hands and rest your palm harder on the base of your mouse, you may feel differently about this one’s comfort.</p><p>I love this thing. Like Angry Miao’s keyboards, it’s a striking design piece to have on your desk. But unlike its boutique mechs, the Infinity Mouse is priced much more logically. I’m no esports competitor, but I’ve used my share of quality gaming mice from the likes of Logitech, Razer, and SteelSeries — and I regularly use an older Logitech G Pro Wireless.</p><p>The Infinity Mouse has great tactile click sounds, it feels snappy and solid, and its movements on a desk mat are nice and smooth. It makes my 80g Logitech feel a little hefty by comparison, and its swappable batteries are a treat. I never have to worry about pulling a cable out to clutter up my desk while the mouse charges.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->17</strong><span><figcaption><em>Here are a whole bunch of macro detail shots of the Infinity Mouse, if you’re like me and like staring at every square inch of this thing.</em></figcaption></span></p></section><p>I know you can free yourself of mouse charging woes with something like a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23005435/magic-mouse-apple-logitech-powerplay">Logitech G Powerplay</a> (of which my mouse is actually compatible). But that Qi-based charging pad alone costs over $100 and still requires a cable stretching across your desk. The Infinity Mouse’s receiver can just discreetly hang out at the perimeter of your desk (even more so if you turn off its RGB lights) and have your fresh charge ready for you in a snap. A mouse that uses AA or AAA batteries is arguably just as hot-swappable as the Infinity Mouse and costs <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-LIGHTSPEED-Wireless-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B07CMS5Q6P?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">as little as $30</a>. But any old mouse like that is not going to look this cool or feel this smooth. And dealing with disposable batteries is a wasteful nuisance that I personally, strongly dislike.</p><p>There’s a lot of marketing hype around high-performance mice being tuned for esports-level performance and giving you a competitive edge. The reality is, most people are not able to take full advantage of a mouse or other peripheral to make much of a difference in their KDR or how often they land the dub. But let’s be honest, it’s fun to pretend our tools enable us to perform our best, even when we know it’s overkill. The Infinity Mouse has those fancy specs like a lot of other mice out there, but it’s also got a truly unique design and some handy functionality benefits.</p><p><em>Photography by Antonio G.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ashly-burch-has-gone-on-record-expressing-concerns-about-%E2%80%98ai-aloy%E2%80%99.1135833/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ashly-burch-concerns-ai-aloy-video/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Recently, a clip surfaced online showcasing an AI-driven version of Aloy from the Horizon series. The real-time AI bot was shown having a conversation with a human, responding to questions while standing in an in-game environment. The clip was subsequently taken down, but not before it reached Aloy’s actor, Ashly Burch, who raised key concerns.</p>



<p>She was advised by Guerrilla Games that the AI bot didn’t reflect anything in development, nor did it use her motion capture or vocal talents, but it’s still enough to set a worrying precedent about the character – and all other characters voiced by such iconic performers.</p>



<p>We’ve been here before – a while ago, I interviewed Doug Cockle (Geralt, <em>The Witcher</em>) about AI voice replication, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doug-cockle-ai-voice-replication/">he labelled it ‘theft’</a>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-i-feel-worried-about-this-art-form">‘I Feel Worried About This Art Form’</h2>



<p>In a clip <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ashly.burch/video/7481742753991314734">uploaded to TikTok</a>, Ashly Burch addressed the current SAG-AFTRA strike, which is taking place <strong>because </strong>AI technology exists. She stressed that voice actors are asking for ‘protections’ against AI replication, which is arguably the biggest concern troubling actors – and it has been for the last year or two.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I feel worried, not because the technology exists, not even because game companies want to use it, because of course they do, they always want to use technological advancements, I just imagine a video like this coming out that does have someone’s performance attached to it.</p>



<p>That does have someone’s voice, or face, or movement, and the possibility that if we lose this fight, that person would have no recourse. They wouldn’t have any protections, any way to fight back, and that possibility, it makes me so sad. It hurts my heart, it scares me.</p>



<p>I love this industry and this art form so much and I want there to be a new generation of actors.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ashly Burch has long fought for the betterment of the VA vertical. Almost a decade ago, she was unable to reprise her role as Chloe Price in <em>Life is Strange: Before the Storm</em> because she was striking with hundreds of other actors on the grounds of compensation rates and pay scales in the industry.</p>



<p>We’ve seen many actors fight back against AI replication. On social media, Roger Clark (Arthur Morgan, <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>) and Ned Luke (Michael de Santa, <em>GTA 5</em>) have been outspoken against videos using AI versions of themselves – even if those videos are silly parodies or memes. </p>



<p>In September 2024, Jennifer Hale <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jennifer-hale-ai-voice-acting/">went on record as saying</a>, ‘AI is coming for all of us.’</p>



<p>Do you think voice actors are right to be concerned about the sharp rise of AI replication? Let me know your thoughts in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/bobby-kotick-files-defamation-suit-media-outlets/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Bobby Kotick, the former CEO of Activision Blizzard, has filed a suit in Delaware against G/O Media, naming Kotaku and Gizmodo specifically. The suit complains that both outlets attempted to smear Kotick by ‘going out of their way’ to besmirch his name by mentioning false, withdrawn allegations of discrimination and workplace harassment.</p>



<p>It was claimed by Kotick that articles were penned with the ‘malicious purposes of causing further harm’ to his name, which was at the time already considerably tarnished.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-seeking-damages">Seeking Damages</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://courtconnect.courts.delaware.gov/cc/cconnect/ck_public_qry_doct.cp_dktrpt_frames?backto=P&amp;case_id=N25C-03-157&amp;begin_date=&amp;end_date=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Delaware suit</a> filed by Bobby Kotick is pretty basic on the surface, but details of the complaint were obtained and published <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/former-activision-blizzard-ceo-sues-over-news-articles-accusing-him-of-workplace-harassment-discriminatio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by Courthouse News Service</a> on March 13.</p>



<p>The complaint from Kotick reads:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Neither article had anything to do with Activision. </p>



<p>Both were about rumors that Kotick was interested in buying TikTok. Yet, Kotaku and Gizmodo went out of their way to include withdrawn, false allegations relating to workplace issues which G/O Media knew had been conclusively disproven by numerous investigations … purely for the malicious purposes of causing further harm to Kotick.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The articles in question were reports published by Kotaku and Gizmodo about the claim that Bobby Kotick was part of a cabal looking to acquire TikTok in the United States. For reference, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bobby-kotick-buy-tiktok/">I also covered those claims</a>, but I neglected to insult the man or bring up his troubled past at Activision Blizzard, aside from mentioning what employees were saying about him on social media.</p>



<p>But that’s probably why I’m not being sued.</p>



<p>Courthouse News Service noted that Kotaku and Gizmodo updated their articles to remove more negative terminology, but Kotick insists that, as a general rule, they’re still ‘mischaracterising’ him, and he’s seeking damages. </p>



<p>Stay tuned to see how this unfolds.</p>

            <p>
I get that in-world the whole appeal of Dune's Arrakis is all of that spice it harbours, but to be honest the giant sandworms are a bit of a dealbreaker for me. Even still, I have to  admit that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> looks pretty neat even with that ever present threat, and a new trailer all about exploring the desert planet that dropped this week has helped pique my interest a little further. For starters, that desert bike looks pretty nifty, my time in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sable">Sable</a> taught me that I love a good zoom through beautiful, sandy vistas, and this looks to be similar, even if Dune: Awakening's world is a bit more hostile.
</p>

<p>
I'm glad that like many games before it, it's copying Breath of the Wild's climbing so you can scale pretty much any clifface. Once you're up there you can do the video game staple that is scanning your environment to reveal the nearby area on your map, which will highlight shipwrecks or abandoned testing stations. You know, the Ubisoft effect. What actually makes that kind of interesting are the coriolis storms.

Most of the times storms in video games are just about blocking your vision, preventing you from going somewhere, maybe making it harder for you to be seen by enemies and vice versa, but Dune: Awakening's coriolis storms change the entire map every single week. Being an online survival game, obviously this is something to keep players coming back so that it feels fresh week to week, but if <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/funcom">Funcom</a> can execute it well it could make for an interesting time, the headaches for cartographers aside.
</p>
<p>
If you're eager to jump into the game, you can't quite do that yet because it's not out until May 20th. However! <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/its-time-to-create-a-character-and-benchmark-a-sandworm-in-dune-awakening-assuming-youre-buying-it-in-may">You can already make your character ahead of its release</a>, so you've got plenty of time to make a cooler, more sci-fiy version of yourself, or some nightmarish creation you post on social media for 11 likes.

            <p>
Remember when Nvidia announced that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> RTX mod way back in, crikey, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/half-life-2-rtx-mod-brings-ray-tracing-and-dlss-to-another-valve-classic">2023</a>? Yeah, I didn't realise how long it had been either. To be perfectly honest I thought it had already come out, but apparently not, because just this week Nvidia shared that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life-2-rtx">Half-Life 2 RTX</a> is getting a demo next week on March 18th. No, the full mod still doesn't have a release date, but when do any game projects ever release quickly after they were announced?
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The demo will specifically let you play through the Ravenholm and Nova <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prospekt">Prospekt</a> levels, and a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/rtx-remix-half-life-2-rtx-demo-launching-march-18/">really long blog post from Nvidia</a> has desperately tried to make it clear all of the ways this mod supposedly makes the original game look better. Apparently "every aspect of each level has been upgraded" and everything from weapons, to enemies, to skyboxes have all been remade.
</p>

<a aria-label="Half-Life 2 RTX | Demo with Full Ray Tracing and DLSS 4 Announce" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j31ISEd8xRM?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>
Nvidia's blog post lets you do that thing where you can slide an image back and forth to see what it looks like with RTX on and off, and to be perfectly honest, most of the time it doesn't look better, it just looks foggier. The original game still looks incredible to this day if you ask me, there's a reason so many people still love it. 
</p>
<p>
Besides, most people aren't going to be able to play the dang thing anyway - the post notes that to "play at the level of detail shown in the screenshots and videos seen in this article, we recommend a GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics card," even if there are ways to supposedly "ensure a great experience on previous-generation GPUs, too." I don't think I want to turn my PC into a jet engine for a 20 year old game, thanks very much.
</p>
<p>
The base version of Half-Life 2 actually got a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/half-life-2-is-20-years-old-and-has-been-updated-with-steam-workshop-support-and-developer-commentary">pretty nice update</a> last November for its 20th anniversary, which folded Episodes One and Two into the main package, and even fixed some old bugs. Cheers for that again, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/valve">Valve</a>.

            <p>
A new week, a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a> update, and a pretty hefty one has arrived at that. Before we get on to some of the more notable changes, over on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/obsidian-entertainment">Obsidian's</a> forum pages where you can read the <a href="https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/134488-patch-130-notes/">full patch notes</a>, the developer shared that in the coming weeks it plans to release a roadmap that will "go over some of the plans we have that will be coming to the game over the upcoming year." Whether that be DLC, free content, or just some planned gameplay changes, I couldn't tell you, your guess is as good as mine.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Right, about those various updates. Firstly, there's a number of community requested features that have been added in and/ or tweaked, like your player character getting an additional talent point at levels 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. Any of you with save files past any of those levels will find that they have those additional points now. Those of you on PC playing with a mouse and keyboard have the option to toggle between walking and running now too.
</p>
<p>
A nice accessibility feature has been added in too, you can now increase the font size and apply bold styling to all documents, tutorials, in-game pop-ups, and the ledger's quest tab. The photographers amongst you will be pleased to hear that you can now keybind the option to toggle your HUD on and off for cleaner screenshots, or reduce the HUD's opacity if you like your health bar being transparent for some reason.
</p>
<p>
On top of that, camera-wise an FOV slider has been added for playing in third-person, and you can lock the compass to always point north instead of rotating inputs. All of you controller players can completely customise your button inputs now too. There's a whole laundry list of other fixes, tweaks, and improvements that I won't bore you with here, but it certainly looks like it'll make for a smoother experience overall. Happy Avowing! Or whatever it is you do, I haven't played it yet.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/why-assassins-creed-2-and-3-had-the-best-writing-the-series-has-ever-seen<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the most memorable moments in the entire Assassin’s Creed series happens near the start of Assassin’s Creed 3, when Haytham Kenway has finished rounding up his band of assassins in the New World. Or at least, the player is led to believe they’re assassins. Haytham, after all, uses a hidden blade, is just as charismatic as previous series protagonist Ezio Auditore, and has – up until this point in the campaign – played the part of a hero, busting Native Americans out of prison and beating up cocky British redcoats. Only when he utters the familiar phrase, “May the Father of Understanding guide us,” does it become clear we have actually been following our sworn enemies, the Templars. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To me, this surprising setup represents the fullest realization of Assassin’s Creed’s potential. The first game in the series introduced an intriguing concept – find, get to know, and kill your targets – but fell short in the story department, with both protagonist Altaïr and his victims being utterly bereft of personality. Assassin’s Creed 2 took a step in the right direction by replacing Altaïr with the more iconic Ezio, but failed to apply the same treatment to his adversaries, with the big bad of its spinoff Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood, Cesare Borgia, coming across as particularly underdeveloped. Only in Assassin’s Creed 3, set during the American Revolution, did the developers at Ubisoft devote as much time to fleshing out the hunted as they did the hunter. It lent the game an organic flow from set-up to payoff and, as a result, achieved a delicate balance between gameplay and narrative that as yet hasn’t been replicated since.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/10/ac-3-writing-1741616500293.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The underappreciated AC3 features the series' best balance of gameplay and story. | Image credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While the current RPG era of the series has largely been well received by players and critics, a wealth of articles, YouTube videos, and forum posts agree that Assassin’s Creed is in decline, and has been for some time. What exactly is responsible for this downfall, however, is subject to debate. Some point to the increasingly unrealistic premises of the modern games, which have you face off against gods like Anubis and Fenrir. Others take issue with Ubisoft’s implementation of a varied spectrum of romance options or, in the hotly-disputed case of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, replacing its hitherto fictional protagonists with a real-world historical figure, an African samurai called Yasuke. My personal nostalgia for the Xbox 360/PS3-era games notwithstanding, I’d argue it’s none of these. Instead, such decline is a result of the series’ gradual abandonment of character-driven storytelling, which has by now gotten buried deep inside its sprawling sandbox.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over the years, Assassin’s Creed has padded its original action-adventure formula with a slew of RPG and live service-ish elements, from dialogue trees and XP-based levelling systems to loot boxes, microtransaction DLC, and gear customization. But the bigger the new installments have become, the emptier they have started to feel, and not just with regard to the countless climb-this-tower, find-that-object side-missions, but also their basic storytelling. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>While a game like Assassin’s Creed Odyssey technically has more content than Assassin’s Creed 2, much of it feels wooden and underbaked.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Although allowing you to choose what your character says or does should theoretically make the overall experience more immersive, in practice I’ve found it often has the opposite effect: as scripts get longer and longer to account for multiple possible scenarios, they feel like they lack the same level of polish as a game with a more limited range of interaction. The focused, screenplay-like scripts of the series’ action-adventure era allowed for sharply defined characters that were not pulled thin by a game structure that demands its protagonist be compassionate or brutal on the whim of the player.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thus, while a game like Assassin’s Creed Odyssey technically has more content than Assassin’s Creed 2, much of it feels wooden and underbaked. This unfortunately breaks the immersion; it's too often very obvious that you are interacting with computer generated characters rather than complex historical figures. This is in stark contrast to the franchise’s Xbox 360/PS3 era, which in my humble opinion has produced some of the finest writing in all of gaming, from Ezio’s fiery “Do not follow me, or anyone else!” speech after besting Savonarola, to the tragicomic soliloquy Haytham delivers when he is at long last killed by his son, Connor: </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>“Don't think I have any intention of caressing your cheek and saying I was wrong. I will not weep and wonder what might have been. I'm sure you understand. Still, I'm proud of you in a way. You have shown great conviction. Strength. Courage. All noble qualities. I should have killed you long ago.”</em></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/10/ac-3-haytham-kenway-writing-1741616625131.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Haytham Kenway is one of Assassin's Creed's most richly-realized villains. | Image credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The writing has suffered in other ways over the years, too. Where the modern games tend to stick to the easily digestible dichotomy of Assassins = good and Templars = bad, the earlier games went to great lengths to show that the line between the two orders isn’t as clear-cut as it initially appears. In Assassin’s Creed 3, each defeated Templar uses their last breath to make Connor – and, by extension, the player – question their own beliefs. William Johnson, a negotiator, says the Templars could have stopped the Native American genocide. Thomas Hickey, a hedonist, calls the Assassins’ mission unrealistic and promises Connor that he’ll never feel fulfilled. Benjamin Church, who betrays Haytham, declares it’s “all a matter of perspective,” and that the British – from their point of view – see themselves as the victims, not the aggressors. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Haytham, for his part, tries to shake Connor’s faith in George Washington, claiming the country he’ll create will be no less despotic than the monarchy from which the Americans sought to liberate themselves – an assertion which rings all the more true when we discover that the command to burn down Connor’s village wasn’t given by Haytham’s henchman Charles Lee, as previously thought, but Washington. By the end of the game, the player has more questions than answers – and the story is stronger for it.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking back on the franchise’s long history, there is a reason why one track from the Jesper Kyd-composed Assassin’s Creed 2 score, “Ezio’s Family,” resonated with players to the point of becoming the series’ official theme. The PS3 games, particularly Assassin’s Creed 2 and Assassin’s Creed 3, were – at their core – character-driven experiences; the melancholic guitar strings of “Ezio’s Family” weren’t meant to evoke the game’s Renaissance setting so much as Ezio’s personal trauma of losing his family. As much as I admire the expansive worldbuilding and graphical fidelity of the current generation of Assassin’s Creed games, my hope is that this out-of-control franchise will someday scale itself down, and once again deliver the kind of focused, tailor-made stories that made me fall in love with it in the first place. Sadly, in a landscape dominated by sprawling sandboxes and single-player games with live service-style ambitions, I fear that’s just not “good business” anymore. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tim Brinkhof is a freelance writer specializing in art and history.

            <p>
People love to go on and on about how good <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/titanfall-2">Titanfall 2's</a> campaign mode is, and they'd be right to do so, but really we all know there's one specific level we have in mind when it comes to the sidelined shooter: the time travel one. I don't care for shooters all that much, online or offline ones, yet I still gave a go because the time travel level really appealed to me mechanically. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored-2">Dishonored 2's</a> similarly structured time travel section wooed me similarly, so I was very pleased to discover the newest trailer for Tenet of the Spark this week, an action-adventure game that is basically Titanfall 2 and Dishonored 2's time travel levels made into an entire game.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Tenet of the Spark has a few things that sets itself differently from said two levels. In the first instance, it's pretty much all melee combat. Punchin', hammerin', knife throwin', that sort of thing. Where the time travel element is most notably different is that you can travel between three time periods: modern day, the Viking age, and the Aztec era. The thing that I'm finding most fun from the game's trailer, as you can see above, is that the level design is more or less the same across all three time periods, with the set dressing being the big thing to change.

<p>
Enemies themselves stay in the same spots throughout the three periods too, with each setting looking to have its own advantages and disadvantages. For example, in the Viking setting, you can throw or push objects, and you've got a big ole hammer you can smack things with, whereas in the Aztec period you've got a knife you can chuck at baddies for some long-distance options.
</p>
<p>
It's neat! And stylish as all hell too, I love the effect of the environment changing between time periods, everything shifts and pops a little bit, it's not just swapping you from one scene to the next. The game has been in the works for a little while now, but doesn't have a release date just yet. If it takes your fancy, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2565010/Tenet_of_the_Spark/">wishlist it here</a>.

            <p>
Earlier this week, you might have seen the abomination that was an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/leaked-video-shows-playstation-toying-with-aloy-from-horizon-as-an-ai-chatbot">AI-powered version of Horizon series protagonist Aloy</a>. It came as part of a leak that showed Sony experimenting with the ability to chat to video game characters that use OpenAI and Chat-GPT to respond, though Sony quickly saw to scrubbing any evidence of footage using the power of copyright laws. Notably the voice behind this AI version of Aloy was not that of her voice actor's, Ashly Burch, but the voice actor has offered up her own thoughts on the whole situation.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Quite quickly in the video Burch shared to TikTok, she explained that developer Guerilla had contacted her to claim that the "demo didn't reflect anything that was actively in development", and importantly didn't use any of her vocal or facial performance. Even with that, Burch did still say she feels "worried", not about "Guerrilla specifically, or Horizon, or my performance, or my career specifically, even. I feel worried about this art form. Game performance as an art form."
</p>
 <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>
As Burch points out, The Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sag-aftra">SAG-AFTRA</a>) is still <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ai-protections-remain-the-sticking-point-for-todays-sag-aftra-game-actor-strike">currently on strike</a>, specifically because of concerns over AI being used to replace actors in the game development process, and that they're asking for protections from its usage. This includes very reasonable things like requiring consent before making an AI version of the actor in question, fair compensation, and to be informed of how the AI dub is being used.
</p>
<p>
For Burch, her concern is a video like this coming out that is based on someone's performance, and "the possibility that if we lose this fight, that person would have no recourse. They wouldn't have any protections, any way to fight back. And that possibility... it makes me so sad. It hurts my heart. It scares me."
</p>
<p>
The leaked video is just a tech demo, it's not something we'll necessarily see implemented in any games or for other purposes, but personally I hope it stays as buried as Sony's lawyers are trying to make the footage. Fingers crossed SAG-AFTRA gets their needs met.

			<p>According to a new analysis shared online today, the comprehensive implementation of ray-traced global illumination in the recently released Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition is likely a preview of the Grand Theft Auto VI features.</p>
<p>The tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> released earlier today their analysis of the new version of the fifth entry in the series by Rockstar Games released on PC this month, providing a good look at the new features and how they compare with the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S versions of the game. The feature that sets the new PC version of the game apart from every other is the comprehensive implementation of ray-traced global illumination, which, by itself, suggests that this tech is being developed for Grand Theft Auto VI and has been backported to its predecessor. Usually, when a developer implements platform-exclusive ray tracing features, it does so in a limited fashion, as highlighted by games like Dying Light 2, where RTGI works only for the sun, or in The Witcher 3, where RTGI does not work on a per-pixel basis but only applies to the world with probes, causing visual artifacts.</p>
<p>In Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition, on the other hand, RTGI not only works on a per-pixel basis, but it also features stable and coherent bounce lighting from any random light, which is not easy to implement and requires a lot of work. The same tech, in addition to emitting materials, is featured prominently in the Grand Theft Auto VI trailer, further suggesting that the Enhanced Edition new features are a preview of the tech that will be featured in the next entry in the series launching later this year.</p>
<p>If the same Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition RTGI tech will be featured in the next entry in the series, Digital Foundry believes how the Enhanced Edition runs could be indicative of the performance that should be expected on base consoles for the sequel. While the tech is cleverly optimized and is not particularly heavy on the GPU, it is heavy on the CPU, and a Ryzen 5 3600 CPU, a CPU comparable to that of the base current generation consoles, cannot run the game at a steady 60 FPS at 1440p resolution and NVIDIA DLSS at Quality mode. This, in addition to the reveal trailer running at 30 FPS, further suggests that Grand Theft Auto VI will be limited to 30 FPS on base consoles, as many believe it will.</p>

<p>Ray-traced global illumination is only one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-pc-ray-traced-global-illumination-ambient-occlusion-dlss-fsr/">new features</a> introduced in Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition.

<p>Counter-Strike 2 keeps breaking the all-time high record for peak concurrent players on Steam. It seems as though a new record is being set every week at this point, and the latest figure is a <strong>doozy</strong>. Hours ago, the game hit 1.82 million peak players, which represents solid growth since the last time the record was broken with 1.74 million peak players.</p>



<p>As I write this, 1.5 million people around the world are playing Counter-Strike 2. The next top title on Steam is PUBG, the free-to-play battle royale game, which has 659,000 people playing.</p>



<p>Nothing comes close to Counter-Strike 2.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-here-we-are-again">Here We Are Again</h2>



<p>Counter-Strike 2 has secured another peak player record, and at this point, it’s becoming <strong>at least </strong>a monthly affair. More people are playing Counter-Strike than ever before, and it never leaves the top spot on Steam unless something remarkable hits the market, like Palworld.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It doesn’t end there, though.</p>



<p>Counter-Strike 2 is also the most popular game on Twitch by a mile, boasting 381,000 concurrent viewers at the time of writing. In second place is Just Chatting, with 316,000 viewers – the next top <strong>game </strong>on Twitch is Dota 2, with 183,000 viewers.</p>



<p>It helps that Counter-Strike 2 has a phenomenally popular esports scene, and that’s where much of the viewership and player count records come from. Most of the top channels on Twitch broadcasting Counter-Strike 2 are co-streaming the ESL Pro League, which is unfolding as you read this.</p>



<p>Whenever a top-tier esports tournament unravels in the Counter-Strike 2 space, it makes people flood the game, all eager to replicate what they’ve seen the best Counter-Strike players do on stream.</p>



<p>When did you last play Counter-Strike 2? Perhaps you’re playing it right now, loading into a match as you read this. Let me know in the comments.</p>

Trying to track down Lost Origin, Astral Radiance, or Brilliant Stars booster packs without paying inflated prices is bloody impossible as Pokémania 2025 rolls on. Single packs from these sets can now cost £5 to £10 each, especially for the more popular expansions. That’s where Pokémon V Boxes come in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These boxes contain four booster packs and cost under £20, meaning you’re paying under £5 per pack while also getting a couple of foil promo cards and an oversized card. If you’re still trying to complete your Sword and Shield-era collections, this is one of the best ways to do it at retail price.</p><p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/15/pixel-9-50-1742048567908.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lost Origin boosters are my main target (Giratina V Alt-Art is my dream pull), Hisuian Electrode V Box is the best choice. It includes two Lost Origin packs along with Astral Radiance and Brilliant Stars, two sets loaded with Trainer Gallery hits. Considering individual packs can run you £6 or more on eBay, this is an easy win.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Want Lost Origin packs but don’t mind swapping out Brilliant Stars for Fusion Strike? Virizion V Box is another bargain. Fusion Strike has some strong chase cards, including Gengar VMAX and Espeon VMAX Alt-Art, so it's well worth ripping open. Lost Origin’s Giratina V, Astral Radiance’s Origin Forme Dialga, or Brilliant Stars’ Charizard VSTAR are all solid reasons to grab these V boxes before they sell out or go out of print. Both aren't far off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.
