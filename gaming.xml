			<p>A new Indiana Jones and The Great Circle video shared online today compares all console versions, highlighting how the Xbox Series X version is closer to the PlayStation 5 Pro version than the base model release.</p>
<p>The video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@brazilpixel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brazil Pixel</a> takes a good look at the Xbox Series X, PlayStation 5, and PlayStation 5 Pro versions of the game, showing an early game sequence running on all systems while keeping track of the performance, which is rock solid on all three systems in terms of frame time and frames per second, and the render resolution. While the PlayStation 5 Pro version obviously runs at the highest resolution, native 4K most of the time, the Xbox Series X doesn't lag too far behind, having a smaller gap with the PlayStation 5 Pro version than with the base PlayStation 5 version, which is made more impressive by the console's power usage.</p>
<p><iframe title="Indiana Jones and the Great Circle - Xbox Series X vs PS5 vs PS5 Pro - FPS and Resolution Test" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/itCYV8m04Fc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There was no doubt that Indiana Jones and The Great Circle would run best on PlayStation 5 Pro, considering it is the most powerful console available on the market. Besides running at native 4K resolution most of the time, this version of the game comes with some <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-playstation-5-pro-global-illumination-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enhancements</a> over the other systems, which include light global illumination, ambient occlusion, and contact shadows improvements.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/">Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</a> is now available on PC, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. The game is now available on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro for owners of the Premium Edition, and will release for everyone else later today.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2s-worlds-are-going-bigger-ign-first</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-outer-worlds-2s-worlds-are-going-bigger-%E2%80%93-ign-first.1165878/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2s-worlds-are-going-bigger-ign-first<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">“One of the very first things we were targeting when we started The Outer Worlds 2 was to make these big, expansive areas. It's what players told us they wanted,” game director Brandon Adler told me when talking about how the team at Obsidian built the open regions for this sequel. But bigger doesn’t always mean better, and they seemed aware of that when creating the more expansive zones across the different planets and moons you’ll visit in The Outer Worlds 2. There appears to be a focus on rewarding exploration, creating dense environments, and designing areas that pull you in specific directions to investigate points of interest off in the distance. So, while it’s structurally similar to the original where you visit distinct open areas through the main quest, there’s a greater sense of scale this time around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I was able to see some of these ideas in action with a gameplay tour of Golden Ridge, a new open region on the planet-moon Dorado that you’ll visit early on in The Outer Worlds 2. It’s an arid, desert-like region with trench lines from a war that broke out in the past, mining facilities run by a faction called The Protectorate, and a ton of hostile wildlife mutated from the polluted environment. Art director Daniel Alpert spoke about maintaining the first game’s decorative art nouveau and retrofuturistic inspirations, but going with something a bit more harsh for Golden Ridge. “We were able to pull from areas of the late old West to World War 1 and imbue the areas with little touches – you’ll notice a trench warfare line, and if you go a little further into a town, you'll still find that frontier colony vibe,” he said when working on Golden Ridge.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Outer Worlds 2 - Golden Ridge Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Adler spoke to how the art direction feeds into the stories they’re trying to tell, specifically on this planet: “Before we get into any area, we have deep conversations about the overall story, the factions and what they’re doing, and what's important to them. Asking things like, why was anybody in Golden Ridge?” He gave examples of collaborating with the art team to have a sort of synergy between aesthetics and the game’s purpose, saying “We’ll say like, we want the trench lines <em>here</em>, maybe for gameplay reasons, but talk about why it makes sense story-wise.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As any good RPG does, these kinds of stories are woven into the regions themselves, and Adler teased some of that, saying “I won't get into what happens at the beginning of Golden Ridge, but there's a big state change in the area when you first get there. It’s going to blow people away and make them really want to investigate what's happening.” That’s said to be indicative of the rest of the game, as he continued telling me, “You’ll see that throughout a lot of our areas as well. We try to do those types of things - let the players see big events that are happening pretty early and get them hooked into the area.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With that foundation, the team wanted to pack the region with interesting things along the way with the main quest. “We made sure of that with big open sightlines and we spent a lot of time and effort on making really cool looking points of interest out in the distance to really draw players and really bring them off the beaten path,” Adler said. He referenced filling these areas with side quests, supporting characters, and smaller stories to unravel, similar to the first game. There seems to be a concerted effort in rewarding players with collectibles (like a new collection of tossball cards) and gear, even for exploring parts of the region that don’t really have a specific story or quest purpose. It’s an important piece to this style of RPG, of course, and something they were conscious of when it came to improving things from the first game, making sure all parts of the development team were involved in making that happen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I also got to see the Zyranium Lab, which is an interior level on Golden Ridge, and it was impressive not just for its scale, but the ways in which I can see gameplay possibilities for how I approach these kinds of games. In a similar vein as the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-gameplay-the-outer-worlds-2-ign-first">exclusive gameplay demo</a> I saw of the N-Ray Facility, I got the impression that levels like these are more intricately designed and drawing from immersive sims like Deus Ex and Dishonored. They’re larger and have multiple paths forward that look deliberate for a range of playstyles while still maintaining a focus on pulling the player in specific directions. “When we're building these more open spaces, we have a defined path that we want the player to go through. But in true Obsidian game style, we allow players to go everywhere and kind of experience whatever they want,” Adler said with regards to designing levels within the open regions.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“One of the very first things we were targeting when we started The Outer Worlds 2 was to make these big, expansive areas. It's what players told us they wanted.”</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Golden Ridge was the only open region I was able to see, so I asked about what we can expect from the rest of the game’s worlds. Alpert told me, “We intentionally design each of our worlds to feel different from each other. It's a unique landscape every time you land on a new moon or new area. So it shouldn't be like, you go somewhere new and it's a little bit more of the same. These other areas are completely different from the last moonscape you just came from, and the next one you're going to be visiting is completely different as well.” While that may seem par for the course in a spacefaring journey like The Outer Worlds, the conscious effort to address the limitations of the first game and be more intentional about how its worlds are built makes me hopeful that the The Outer Worlds 2 can be an evolution of how Obsidian designs its games and worlds. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, from what I’ve seen thus far, The Outer Worlds 2 looks promising on several fronts. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-the-outer-worlds-2-lets-you-go-wild-with-rpg-character-building-ign-first">reworked RPG elements</a> look like they’ve been made to be more distinct when it comes to the role-playing experience, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-gameplay-the-outer-worlds-2-ign-first">small snippets of gameplay</a> show better accommodation for specific playstyles. And taking a look at the open zone of Golden Ridge gave not just a better sense of scale, but a natural sense of exploration with greater density and purposeful points of interest along the way. Soon, we’ll be diving deeper into combat design and the evolution of the Flaws system as part of IGN First exclusive coverage on The Outer Worlds 2, which also includes a conversation with original Fallout developer and creative director Leonard Boyarsky on how the first game was about establishing a new foundation for Obsidian and this sequel being the idealized version of that initial vision.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>In 2022, Rockstar Games introduced GTA+, a subscription service that provides a variety of perks and bonuses in GTA Online. With <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5s-new-enhanced-pc-edition-how-to-preload-and-transfer-story-progress-for-free/1100-6529782/" data-ref-id="1100-6529782">GTA 5 Enhanced bringing GTA+ to PC for the first time recently</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a>'s release coming up this year, we're running through everything you need to know about GTA +. Do you really need to sign up for yet another subscription service? Only you can answer that, but below you'll find a breakdown of the key facts about GTA+ to help you decide.</p><h2 id="What_Is_GTA__"><strong>What Is GTA+?</strong></h2><p>GTA+ is a subscription service for GTA Online that originally debuted in March 2022 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. The subscription offering came to PC for the first time with GTA 5 Enhanced's launch in March 2025. With <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-and-enhanced-version-out-now-on-game-pass/1100-6530881/" data-ref-id="1100-6530881">GTA 5 Enhanced now available for PC Game Pass</a>, you can subscribe to GTA+ from within Game Pass. That's right: a subscription within a subscription.</p><h2 id="Free_Games_And_Other_Perks"><strong>Free Games And Other Perks</strong></h2><p>To begin with, every GTA+ subscriber gets 500,000 worth of GTA$ deposited automatically into their in-game accounts monthly based on their billing date. Members also get a 15% bonus in GTA$ for Shark Card purchases, while they also earn GTA$ multipliers for certain GTA Online missions and modes. Subscribers also get discounts on in-game items, with discounted wares varying month by month.</p><p>GTA+ members also get access to The Vinewood Car Club where they can claim free vehicles. Also in terms of vehicles, subscribers get a 100-car garage, spread across five floors.</p><p>Members receive monthly benefits--for April 2025, Rockstar is offering the Bollokan Envisage sports car, special clothing items, and vehicle liveries. You can <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/gta-plus/benefits" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">visit this page</a> to see the current month's special bonuses for subscribers.</p><p>Another major perk of signing up for GTA+ is getting access to the GTA+ Games Library. This is a rotating selection of classic Rockstar titles that players have access to for as long as their membership remains active. The current roster of freebies includes Bully, Red Dead Redemption, GTA: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition, GTA: Liberty City Stories, GTA: Chinatown Wars, and LA Noire.</p><h2 id="How_Much_Is_GTA__"><strong>How Much Is GTA+?</strong></h2><p>GTA+ launched in 2022 priced at $6/month, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ahead-of-gta-6-release-rockstar-raises-gta-price-by-33/1100-6522616/" data-ref-id="1100-6522616">the price went up to $8/month in 2024.</a> Memberships can be canceled at any time. There is no multi-month or annual subscription option.</p><h2 id="How_To_Sign_Up_For_GTA_"><strong>How To Sign Up For GTA+</strong></h2><p>GTA+ requires a copy of GTA V or GTA Online. You can sign up on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S through those platforms' store pages or from within GTA Online. On PC, people can sign up via their preferred store or in game.</p><h2 id="GTA_6_"><b>GTA 6?</b></h2><p>Rockstar Games has not said anything yet about if GTA+ will be supported with GTA 6. Given that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-suggests-that-current-gta-online-could-continue-after-gta-6-releases/1100-6529517/" data-ref-id="1100-6529517">GTA 5's GTA Online may stick around even after GTA 6 launches</a>, it's possible GTA+ will continue to be supported for that game at least. It's expected that GTA 6 will have a significant online mode given the huge success of GTA Online, but it remains to be seen what form it may take. Rockstar has not uttered a word about GTA 6 since December 2023.</p><h2 id="Take_Two__Thrilled__With_GTA_"><strong>Take-Two "Thrilled" With GTA+</strong></h2><p>In 2022, Rockstar owner Take-Two commented on GTA+'s introduction, saying the company was "thrilled" with the response out of the gate.</p><p>"We're thrilled about how it's been rolled out so far. We're thrilled with the conversion rate," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-is-off-to-a-great-start-take-two-says/1100-6503526/" data-ref-id="1100-6503526">Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said back then</a>. "And it's clear, that consumers really like the opportunity to engage with GTA Online and they value... what we're offering through a subscription."</p><p>Take-Two hasn't said a whole lot about GTA+ in the ensuing years, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-much-money-taketwo-makes-from-microtrans/1100-6477537/" data-ref-id="1100-6477537">the company loves the kind of recurring revenue that a subscription service provides. </a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steel-ball-run-is-the-best-jojo%E2%80%99s-bizarre-adventure-part.1165851/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/steel-ball-run-jojos-bizarre-adventure<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last Saturday was <a href="https://jojowiki.com/JOJODAY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JoJoDay,</a> a special fan celebration event where the official <em>JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure</em> anime brought back <a href="https://x.com/miyake_ktrm/status/1911240544275316910" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beloved voice actors</a> and the musicians behind its <a href="https://x.com/kazusou_oda/status/1911053146669154469" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">banger opening themes</a>. The event also announced an upcoming <a href="https://jojocaravan.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">art exhibit</a> and a <a href="https://t.co/jljMpW0gbD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Japan-only mobile game</a>—something Western fans may not play but will certainly appreciate for its crisp new character renders. The star of the attraction was the long-awaited official announcement of David Production’s anime adaptation <a href="https://jojo-portal-anime.com/sbr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Steel Ball Run</em></a>, the seventh part in the <a href="https://kotaku.com/jojos-bizarre-adventure-jjba-jojolands-jodio-dragona-1850130485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still-ongoing manga series</a>. Without hesitation, I’d argue it stands as the best part of the entire series.&nbsp;</p><p>In contrast to previous parts, which followed generations of JoJos from 1888 to 2011, <em>Steel Ball Run</em> rewinds the clock back to 1890s America to follow Joestar protagonist Johnny—a paraplegic ex-jockey who enters a grueling cross-country horse race from San Diego to New York, in the hopes of winning a $50 million prize. But for Johnny, the real draw isn’t the money—it’s the chance to learn more about the enigmatic Gyro Zeppeli, a former fellow competitor whose mysterious steel balls briefly restored Johnny’s ability to walk. What unfolds is&nbsp; essentially a 19th-century<em> </em>take on <em>Death Race</em> <em>2000</em>, where Johnny and Gyro square off against a fleet of dangerous riders with weird powers of their own.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="『スティール・ボール・ラン ジョジョの奇妙な冒険』 特報映像／&quot;STEEL BALL RUN JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure&quot; Anime Announcement trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RHkvkwnQbEQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Much of <em>JJB</em>A’s mass appeal is pretty simple. It features a revolving door of eccentric supermodel-looking weirdos whose names and ghost powers are peppered with music references as they battle to save the world. Along the way, the show weaves in other oddities, like a vampire’s generation-spanning vendetta against a family whose genetics he’s hijacked, the grim realities of the Floridian female prison system, and Italian gangsters waging a war on drugs. While <em>JJBA </em>delivers plenty of unforgettable characters and strategic, chess-like battles—like Jolyne Cujoh navigating a prison riot with literal meteorite hazards—it’s hard to ignore the sheer number of wild, last-minute asspulls the series commits.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s be honest—while Araki has a habit of loosely sprinkling in hints just enough to justify how heroes and villains outmaneuver each other, a lot of the show’s better moments are because it re-adjusts how previously poorly defined powers worked at the tail end of the series (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/9e7j6v/i_have_some_questions_about_gold_experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">looking at you, <em>Golden Wind</em></a>). While <em>Steel Ball Run</em>’s release is still on the horizon, I wanted to take a moment and explore one particular battle between its heroes and a man named <a href="https://jojo.fandom.com/wiki/Ringo_Roadagain" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ringo Roadagain</a>, which solidified it as the crown jewel of Hirohiko Araki’s manga series.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Spoilers for that, I guess.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><em>JJBA </em>fights run on a tried and true formula of its heroes mysteriously encountering a villain and having to suss out <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitPostCrusaders/comments/ap6t5c/op_jojo_stands_explained_in_one_picture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how their powers work</a> in order to exploit a weakness within it. That happened in part three with <a href="https://jojo.fandom.com/wiki/The_World" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dio’s time rewinding The World power</a>, Diavalo’s King Crimson (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/c8wxjf/how_does_king_crimson_work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whose powers are still a subject of debate to this day</a>) in part five, and in part six with Enrico Pucci’s Infinity Stones-esque <a href="https://jojo.fandom.com/wiki/Made_in_Heaven" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Made in Heaven</a>. In <em>Steel Ball Run</em>, when Gyro and Johnny cross paths with Ringo Roadagain — a gunslinger enlisted by the president to take them from the race (don’t ask) — Ringo wastes no time explaining his ability outright. His stand, <a href="https://jojo.fandom.com/wiki/Mandom" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mandom</a>, grants him the power to rewind time back six seconds. Why reveal such a crucial detail? Well, Ringo is chasing what he calls “the True Man’s World”— a&nbsp; philosophy where true strength comes from one’s willingness to risk life and limb to achieve their goals. In essence, he’s on some Kraven the Hunter type shit, believing that fairness in battle is essential to proving oneself. The concept is very old hat, but it fits seamlessly into the rugged, macho cowboy setting of <em>Steel Ball Run</em>. To add even more machismo into their battle, Ringo and Gyro settle their affairs&nbsp; through an old-fashioned duel inside the quiet confines of a log cabin.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>@ Shueisha/Viz Media</span></figcaption></figure><p>Gyro and Ringo’s duel is less a battle of strategy and more a clash of ideals. Ringo sees Gyro, who was raised Catholic and was formerly a Neapolitan executioner, as a “conformist” bound by societal and religious frameworks imposed on him. His critique of Gyro isn’t rooted in anti-Christian sentiment; rather, Ringo recognizes Gyro’s relentless drive, referred to in the series as “<a href="https://jojo.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Determination" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dark Determination</a>,” as something hindered by the constraints of dogmatic beliefs. Ringo’s battle with Gyro is the closest thing the series has come to a villain outright telling its hero, “We’re gonna get you some self respect, even if it kills you.” Ringo also stands out as arguably the most honorable villain in the entire series. He bows before and after duels and refrains from using his Stand against opponents without spiritual abilities, ensuring fairness in combat, which is a neat change of pace for the series.&nbsp;</p><p>When Gyro believes he’s cracked Ringo’s tell — the act of turning the hand on his wristwatch as a trigger to rewind time, which Gyro assumes is the physical manifestation of his stand — it’s revealed that the watch isn’t necessary at all. Ringo uses it purely to give his opponent a fighting chance. That shit is raw as hell. Although Ringo is a minor villain in the grand scheme of <em>Steel Ball Run</em> meant to serve as a narrative stepping stone for Gyro and Johnny to overcome as they press onward to greater challenges, this battle leaves a lasting mark on Gyro’s character. Before their journey continues, Ringo offers Gyro one final farewell.</p><p>"Welcome...to the True Man's World.”</p><p><strong>Correction, 4/16/25, 10:45am-</strong>-The original version of this article misstated the name of character Ringo Roadagain.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/phil-spencer-feels-great-about-xboxs-2025-slate-of-games-with-more-unannounced-titles-to-come/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>With the success of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/minecraft-movies-success-continues-the-trend-of-film-tv-adaptations-bolstering-game-sales-and-engagement/">Minecraft movie</a>, Microsoft's head of gaming, <a href="https://wccftech.com/phil-spencer-would-rather-revisit-owned-ips-than-rely-on-more-licensed-games/">Phil Spencer</a>, took an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/microsoft-phil-spencer-minecraft-movie-fallout-season-2-1236352653/">Variety</a> to discuss how Microsoft and Xbox feel about navigating the future of its adaptations.</p>
<p>In that conversation, Spencer also commented quickly on what Xbox has lined up for the rest of 2025. He avoided accidentally leaking anything, but he does confirm that there are more unannounced titles beyond what Xbox has already officially announced. Along with what we do know, Spencer feels "<em>great</em>" about Xbox's 2025 lineup.</p>
<p>"<em>For us and the rest of this calendar year, I really feel great about the slate of games. We just had “Avowed” come out, and I have to go backwards and just say Obsidian continues to do a great job. We’ve obviously talked about “The Outer Worlds 2,” “South of Midnight,” “Doom.” There’s more stuff, some stuff that’s unannounced and I’m walking in my head to make sure I don’t leak anything.</em>"</p>
<p>One of the games that Spencer is trying to avoid talking about is likely the one that has already leaked: the remaster of <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-lead-comments-on-nearly-official-oblivion-remaster/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a>, which could be officially confirmed in a matter of days.</p>
<p>Other potential titles could be the long-rumored Gears of War and Halo Collections coming to PlayStation and possibly even Nintendo. There's been less buzz around those of late, but if Xbox continues to be as good at keeping secrets the way it's kept the Oblivion remaster a secret, we won't have to wait very long to hear more about either collection.</p>
<p>Spencer was also asked about the Nintendo Switch 2, and he said that he wants to support it and that "<em>Nintendo has been a great partner."</em></p>
<p>"<em>We think it is a unique way for us to reach players who aren’t PC players, who aren’t players on Xbox...I’m really a big believer in what Nintendo means for this industry and us continuing to support them. And getting the support from them for our franchises, I think, is an important part of our future.</em>"</p>
<p>Speaking of Xbox's future, the platform's next big date will be its <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-set-for-june-8-the-outer-worlds-2-gets-direct-presentation-immediately-after/">upcoming June showcase</a>. After that, we'll have a better idea of what 2025 looks like for Xbox.</p>

<p>Miju says that the "love" it received upon <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/planet-crafter-planet-humble-dlc-release-date" rel="nofollow">releasing</a> the game's recent&nbsp;<em>Planet Humble&nbsp;</em>DLC persuaded the studio to "continue to support&nbsp;<em>The Planet Crafter&nbsp;</em>for a long time", and that the Moons Update will "bring [the game] to the next level".</p>

<p>You'll be able to visit two new moons after you've finished terraforming your first planet, and once you're on a moon, you'll be able to terraform that as well. You'll keep all your blueprints, knowledge, and equipment, and you'll even be able to exchange resources between planets and moons.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>The Planet Crafter</em>, it's an open-world survival-crafting game based largely around terraforming planets. Your goal is to land on a planet and render its ecosystem habitable for humanity.</p>

<p>To that end, you'll have to gather resources from said planet in order to survive, and you'll need to find a way to generate oxygen and warmth to make sure you can live in your new environment as well.</p>




<p><em>The Planet Crafter&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1284190/The_Planet_Crafter/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/649665/microsoft-xbox-copilot-first-look-notepad<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft has started testing an early version of its Copilot for Gaming experience. Sources familiar with Microsoft’s Xbox plans tell me that employees can now access Copilot within the Xbox mobile app, and that while it looks similar to the existing Copilot chatbot, it’s designed to tap into your Xbox account.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/628666/microsoft-xbox-copilot-for-gaming">Announced last month</a>, Copilot for Gaming will eventually be available across multiple devices — including Xbox consoles — to act as a companion or assistant that can guide you through games, download and launch titles, and more.</p><p>To my understanding, the early version available to Microsoft employees – which might change before release – includes the ability to pull up your recent Xbox achievements, get game recommendations based on your play history, and ask for tips about completing games. You’ll also be able to use this assistant to download and install games on your Xbox console.</p><p>Much like the existing Copilot, you can type to this Xbox chatbot or use voice to ask questions. You can also pick between a variety of voices: energetic, wise, chill, or heroic. Microsoft is also working on Copilot characters that will be animated versions of the AI assistant, but this isn’t present in the Xbox version yet.</p><p>Microsoft is also working on more features for its Copilot for Gaming experience in general, with ambitions to use its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/645666/microsoft-copilot-vision-windows-beta-testing">Copilot Vision feature</a> to let the AI assistant see what you see during games on a PC. This will, if Microsoft can pull it off, eventually allow Copilot to fully guide you through games and offer tips on how to play titles like <em>Overwatch 2</em> or <em>Minecraft</em>.</p><p>This initial Copilot for Gaming feature will be available to Xbox Insiders soon, and Microsoft plans to tweak it constantly based on feedback from Xbox players. It’s not clear when this gaming Copilot will appear on Xbox consoles though, but I’d imagine it’s a while away given that Microsoft has only just started testing Copilot inside the Xbox mobile app.</p><p>I’m interested to hear what feedback Microsoft gets about Copilot for Gaming, particularly because it will debut as a feature inside the Xbox mobile app. I’m not sure why I’d use a chatbot to download and install Xbox games or check my achievements, but if Microsoft can actually turn this into an AI gaming coach then that would certainly pique my interest.</p><div><p id="xbox-games-keep-appearing-on-battle-net"><h2><strong>Xbox games keep appearing on Battle.net</strong></h2></p></div><p>Blizzard’s PC launcher, Battle.net, used to only have a handful of games available to download and install, but it’s quickly becoming Microsoft’s launcher of choice for new and existing Xbox games. <em>Avowed </em>launched on Battle.net recently, and now <em>Sea of Thieves</em> is <a href="https://x.com/seaofthieves/status/1911832579306569928?s=12">heading to the launcher</a> next month.</p><p>What’s interesting about these two additions is that they’re not Activision or Blizzard games, and both are available for Game Pass subscribers.You had to use the Xbox app or Microsoft Store to access Game Pass titles on PC previously, but by opening them up to Battle.net, Microsoft is signaling that it might be open to enabling Game Pass access on more PC launchers.</p><p>This isn’t just two games, either. <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> and <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> are also coming to Battle.net at launch, and Game Pass subscribers will be able to get these through this launcher, too. The downloads are fully managed by the Battle.net client instead of being handed off to the Microsoft Store, and all you need to do is link your accounts to get access to Game Pass titles.</p><p>I doubt this means Microsoft will fully move away from the Microsoft Store and Xbox app for Game Pass installs. But with millions of Battle.net users, it does mean the company can offer up more choices for how people obtain and play Xbox games. The Battle.net launcher is certainly another opportunity to sell PC players on PC Game Pass or Xbox Play Anywhere titles.</p><p>If you know more about Microsoft’s Battle.net plans, you can reach me via email at <a href="mailto:notepad@theverge.com">notepad@theverge.com</a> or speak to me confidentially on the Signal messaging app, where <a href="https://signal.me/#eu/soK8N9/6J1KVh2/ZZblbDEGXHNH1gK0Q+RaxJQ7vUxDDTYvxX8hARqMZfjuz3Egj">I’m tomwarren.01</a>. </p><div><p id="the-pad"><h2><strong>The pad:</strong></h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><strong>Microsoft is slowing some of its data center buildouts. </strong>After weeks of reports about Microsoft adjusting its data center projects, the company has finally admitted things are slowing down. “We are slowing or pausing some early-stage projects,” said Noelle Walsh, Microsoft’s president of cloud operations and innovation, in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/noelle-walsh-b29356108_microsoftcloud-datacenters-activity-7315439628562423808-W67e/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_ios&amp;rcm=ACoAAAGe5_YBNBxfcDaC5YJlW57cvMMdg5ZCG-g">post on LinkedIn</a> last week. Microsoft says it will continue to invest in regions where it has existing data centers and projects, but it’s obviously being more cautious about early stage investments.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft is about to launch Recall for real this time. </strong>The feature that captures screenshots of most of what you do on a Copilot Plus PC is finally about to launch. Recall was supposed to debut alongside Copilot Plus PCs last June, but after security researchers raised concerns, it was delayed multiple times so that the company could properly secure it. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/646911/microsoft-recall-windows-insiders-preview">It’s now in Release Preview</a>, which means it’s only weeks away from releasing to all Copilot Plus PC owners.</span></li><li><span><strong>ActiveX is now disabled by default in Microsoft 365 apps</strong>.

Microsoft had previously switched the default to “Prompt me before enabling all controls with minimal restrictions,” which allowed Office users to still run ActiveX controls. “The new default setting is more secure because it blocks these controls entirely, reducing the risk of malware or unauthorized code execution,” Microsoft says.</span></li><li><span><strong>GPT-4.1 heads to Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI service</strong>. On the same day that OpenAI announced its GPT-4.1 models, Microsoft was ready to host them in Azure OpenAI.

Microsoft has started <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-24H2#3370msgdesc">removing a block</a> on some PCs that were unable to upgrade to Windows 11, version 24H2.

This folder is typically associated with Microsoft’s Internet Information Services (IIS) web server, but <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-21204">Microsoft warns</a> that Windows users shouldn’t delete it after the update because it’s “part of changes that increase protection and does not require any action from IT admins and end users.”</span></li><li><span><strong><em>Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em></strong><strong> is imminent</strong>. Leaked images from developer Virtuous’ own website have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/648877/oblivion-remaster-images-leaked-microsoft">confirmed a long-rumored <em>Oblivion </em>remake</a>. Rumors suggest that <em>Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered </em>will be announced as a shadow drop next week, and I previously reported that Microsoft was aiming to release this remastered version in late spring or early summer.</span></li><li><span><strong>The Snipping Tool now has a text extractor</strong>. If you’re a Windows Insider, you can <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/04/15/text-extractor-in-snipping-tool-begins-rolling-out-to-windows-insiders/">now test the new text extractor feature</a> inside the Snipping Tool app on Windows 11.

            <p>
11 Bit Studios have shared new details and images of their untitled Project 8, a mournful third-person action-adventure that was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/frostpunk-creators-cancel-project-8-and-lay-off-staff-amid-concerns-that-narrative-driven-story-rich-games-dont-sell">cancelled last year amid layoffs</a>. CEO Przemysław Marszał observed at the time that "it was conceived under very different market conditions, when narrative-driven, story-rich games held stronger appeal" - a comment that made me want to unplug the internet and crawl into bed with a choose-your-own-adventure book. Now, Marszał has offered a fuller account of the cancellation.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
All this comes from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-war-of-mine-developers-cancelled-project-8-revealed-a-risky-project-that-would-have-been-a-big-departure-for-the-studio">a Eurogamer report</a> penned by Prince Robert of Purchese. According to the report, Project 8's main character was a slender, masculine figure equipped with a slingshot you could use to distract threats. Set in a colourful fantasy world, the game would have focussed on stealth, climbing and environmental puzzling rather than combat. Its story was a process of working through the five stages of grief after losing a loved one. In brief, it sounds like a mixture of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gris">Gris</a>, Prince of Persia, and the recent <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/south-of-midnight">South of Midnight</a>. 
</p>
<p>
So why was it abandoned? According to Marszał, 11 Bit were overambitious about moving into the third-person action-adventure genre, having expanded their workforce dramatically off the back of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a>'s success. With little direct experience to call upon, the Project 8 team struggled with both the relatively arcane 'stages of grief' concept and more familiar difficulties, like how to make hiding from enemies enjoyable. All this was, of course, exacerbated by wider factors such as the Covid pandemic.
</p>
<p>
"We felt like it would be possible to do another game in a totally different genre, with a bit of a crazy difficult topic, with a new team," Marszał told the site. "And it was a bit too optimistic to be honest. We thought a lot about it so it wasn't like 'hey let's do it', but going back, it was a bit too optimistic, and thinking that games are easy. And making games isn't easy. It's very difficult stuff." 
</p>
<p>
According to Marszał, Project 8 faced frequent delays over the course of "seven or eight years" in development. After all that time, the only playable parts of the game were a prologue and a level themed around the emotion of denial, which feels rather on-the-nose as poetic ironies go. "And when we heard that we need to add another year or two to the production time it was like 'wow'," Marszał went on. 
</p>
<p>
Following this proposed delay, 11 Bit considered Project 8's odds of success against wider market conditions at the time. In particular, they looked at the reception for similar emotive or psychological action-adventure games, such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii">Senua's Saga: Hellblade II</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/a-plague-tale-requiem">A Plague Tale: Requiem</a>. They eventually came to the conclusion that they would lose money selling the game.
</p>
<p>
"We allowed ourselves - that was the optimism - to do too difficult a game," Marszał concludes in the piece. "It had a cool premise but that wasn't wise, especially for a team that was doing the game as a first game. It was just too ambitious. It was multiple aspects that, at the end, we knew, no, we won't make it. Either [cancel it] or we will spend another tens of millions of dollars and fail heavily." 
</p>
<p>
A number of 11 Bit staffers were slated to lose their jobs alongside Porject 8's cancellation, though some appear to have been transferred to other projects. Marszał has now confirmed that 18 people were let go. If you're one of them, I hope you've found your feet elsewhere.

                <p dir="ltr">Ninja Gaiden has been on a long hiatus, and for fans of the classic 2D games on the NES, it's been even longer. Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound is a classic throwback from publisher Dotemu (Streets of Rage 4, TMNT: Shredder's Revenge) and developer The Game Kitchen (Blasphemous series). But while Ragebound shows their respect for retro craftsmanship, it feels more like an evolution of the 8-bit originals than a broad reinvention. This is still an action-platformer at heart, serving as a respectful homage to Ninja Gaiden classics that picks up right where those left off.</p><p dir="ltr">During an extended hands-on with Ragebound I was able to try a lengthy chunk from the early hours of the game: a playable story sequence, tutorial, and then a few stages full of tense combat and new mechanics that fit right into the classic feel of Ninja Gaiden.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1456601196" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

their village when Ryu journeys to America. When a barrier between the human and demon realms tears apart, the village is beset by demons and Kenji steps up to be the new protector of the realm. But in the course of the story, the demo also introduced a secondary protagonist: the Black Spider ninja Kumori. The Black Spider Clan was a major antagonist in the later Team Ninja games, so in a way, this is bridging the gap between the two eras of the series.</p><p dir="ltr">The two also offer differentiation to their gameplay styles that keeps you juggling between different abilities. Kumori's spirit fuses into Kenji's body, allowing you to switch between the physical and spirit realms at will. While Kenji uses the katana blade with a very similar feel to the originals, Kumori's specialty is throwable kunai blades. Kenji is an acrobatic melee fighter, especially with the ability to bounce off of enemies and projectiles in mid-air, while Kumori is better suited for ranged attacks. That gives the two a very different feel, and allows you to switch into the spirit realm to solve platforming puzzles and combat scenarios that aren't possible with Kenji alone.</p><p dir="ltr">Kenji and Kumori also have access to a Hypercharge ability: a devastatingly powerful attack with special properties. Defeating enemies charges up the special attack, but like a combo counter, it resets if you get hit. That heightens the combat tension, as you could use the Hypercharge as soon as you get it or try to hold onto it for a particularly tough enemy. Both Kenji's katana and Kumori's kunai build the charge, but when you're separated, you only have access to half of your power set. It's a clever way to express through gameplay that these two are strongest when joined together, even if they hate it.</p><p dir="ltr">That's a major source of strife, at least in the early game, as the two ancient enemies constantly snipe at each other and vent their biases and grudges. As the title implies, Kenji is the cool and well-centered operator while Kumori is more aggressive and, well, full of rage. Enemies who come to rely on each other is a classic storytelling trope but it's done well here, against the backdrop of a fantastical, demon-filled Japan. It helps flesh out the characters and gives a Black Spider ninja the rare opportunity to step into the spotlight as a hero.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite these changes and new wrinkles, Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound feels right at home next to the classic tough-as-nails Nintendo games. The original Ninja Gaiden games were known for their tight, unforgiving platforming. Ragebound looks to be slightly more forgiving than those originals, but given my experience with a few of the early stages, it still looks to be a skill-testing action-platforming challenge. Everything from the weight of the jumps to the speed of your blade feels, if not identical to the originals, at least in conversation with those mechanics in a way that felt immediately inviting and familiar to me as a longtime fan.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4477681-ninjagaidenragebound-newscreenshot2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4477681" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4477681-ninjagaidenragebound-newscreenshot2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4477681"></a><figcaption>Kenji summons the help of Kumori in Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4477681-ninjagaidenragebound-newscreenshot2.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">And as you'd expect from this pairing of publisher and developer, the pixel art is characteristically gorgeous. The environments are darker than the vibrant tones of TMNT but not as gothic as Blasphemous, and the characters themselves are smaller in relation to their backgrounds, but their movements are perfectly readable. The yokai designs are a particular standout, looking traditional while adding splashes of color that look intentionally unnatural against the more grounded scope.</p><p dir="ltr">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound is coming this summer to PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

It’s a lot of hard work, but it’s a lot less hard work than making a whole new game, and only one of them is certain to make lots of money. New games, and especially new IPs, now come with enormous risk, where hundreds of millions of dollars can evaporate in a single disastrous launch week. The teams creating <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290"><em>Concord</em></a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-hogwarts-legacy-rocksteady-arkham-1851522893&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-hogwarts-legacy-rocksteady-arkham-1851522893"><em>Suicide Squad</em></a></span><em>&nbsp;</em>worked incredibly hard, exhaustingly so, and the results were massive financial black holes. If their time had instead been dedicated to making a proven success look prettier, profits would have been practically guaranteed. Remastering games is a pragmatic decision based on prudent economics. It’s just that it also sucks.</p><figure id="" data-id="a949ae412b5bab12f18946c2e2999074" data-recommend-id="image://a949ae412b5bab12f18946c2e2999074" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the opening post-sewer moment in Oblivion, with no mods." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the opening post-sewer moment in Oblivion, with no mods." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>This is the game running vanilla, no mods, and it clearly doesn’t need a remaster.</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a949ae412b5bab12f18946c2e2999074" data-recommend-id="image://a949ae412b5bab12f18946c2e2999074" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the opening post-sewer moment in Oblivion, with no mods." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Here’s a secret fact about <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em>: It works just fine. Great, in fact. Released in 2006, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/22330/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV_Oblivion_Game_of_the_Year_Edition/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/22330/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV_Oblivion_Game_of_the_Year_Edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you can buy it from Steam right now for $15</a></span> (and frequently far, far less), and it works perfectly right away. It runs in 2560x1440, requires no hacks or mods, and within minutes of booting it up just now I wasn’t noticing that the graphics are dated. Heck, Bethesda games’ graphics are dated at launch, invariably improved by modders in the months that follow—no one was buying <em>Oblivion</em> for its looks in 2006, not least the hilariously terrible character models. And given <em>Starfield</em>’s are just as embarrassing, it’s not like that’s going to suddenly improve either.</p><p>The point is, <em>Oblivion</em> already exists in a very playable form that’s just as entertaining and flawed as it was 20 years ago. Also, there are 20 years’ worth of mods to improve all the aspects that Bethesda is pathologically incapable of doing well—UI, facial animations, inventory arrangement, voice acting, textures—to have the game look and run exactly as you want. So what, precisely, is an officially remastered <em>Oblivion </em>for?</p><p>Yes, like I said, it’s for making money, especially from long-term fans of the game who <em>do </em>want to see it look prettier, returning to a Cyrodiil  whose graphics look like their two-decade-old invented memories of the original. There’s also the potential to draw in a new audience who’s perhaps only ever played <em>Skyrim</em>, so they can be disappointed to learn the predecessor wasn’t nearly as good. But even <em>Skyrim</em>’s original audience is noticing a little more grey in their hair, given that was nearly 14 years ago.</p><p>This is then made more frustrating given the extraordinary efforts of the <em>Skyblivion</em> modders, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/skyblivion-skyrim-oblivion-bethesda-mod-remake-1851731043&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/skyblivion-skyrim-oblivion-bethesda-mod-remake-1851731043">who have spent over a decade remaking <em>Oblivion</em> in <em>Skyrim</em>’s engine</a></span>, hoping to finally finish their herculean project in 2025.

While <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gog-games-preservation-program-drm-1851696363&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gog-games-preservation-program-drm-1851696363">GOG has recently launched some significant efforts to preserve PC gaming</a></span>, it’s barely scratching the surface of a vast history of video games that are being lost to time and technology, because those who own the rights either don’t care or are actively hostile to anyone attempting to preserve their games for them. Games that cannot just be bought from Steam and run with a click are certainly not receiving elaborate remakes, and can now only be played via illegal methods.</p><p>Now, I’m not daft, and I’m not advocating for publishers to spend millions of dollars remastering forgotten, obscure games from their 1980s and ‘90s catalogues; I know they’re far more likely to plunder them for titles to attach to wildly different new games (cough-<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marathon-gameplay-trailer-release-date-price-season-ps5-1851775940&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-gameplay-trailer-release-date-price-season-ps5-1851775940"><em>Marathon</em></a></span>-cough). Still, I do really believe that dedicating a fraction of the resources that go into remasters to preserving a company’s back-catalogue would be beneficial to humanity. Or, you know, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/editorial-why-games-should-enter-the-public-domain&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/editorial-why-games-should-enter-the-public-domain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>just releasing them into the public domain like they obviously should</em></a></span>. </p><p>However, I think this should also be recognized as part of the existential malaise in which video games now find themselves, where the AA game is all but non-existent and new ideas are kryptonite to publishers.</p><figure id="" data-id="d0cd306078ad17fa76c9f2f1c0d8ad70" data-recommend-id="image://d0cd306078ad17fa76c9f2f1c0d8ad70" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A man holding up a massive boulder in the desert." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="d0cd306078ad17fa76c9f2f1c0d8ad70" data-recommend-id="image://d0cd306078ad17fa76c9f2f1c0d8ad70" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A man holding up a massive boulder in the desert." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Yes, the ballooning costs of game development would be the subject of a whole other article, and the industry’s obsessive focus on live-service is yet another, but these and other crippling aspects of game creation under late-stage capitalism all contribute toward the reasons why remastering has become so endemic. As I’ve said, it’s safe. And right now, publishers are retreating toward perceived safety like terrified kittens. But doing this can only make the problems worse—they can only solidify the notion that the only sure way to make a profitable game is to have it be one you’ve made already.</p><p>What we need are bold new ideas made at sensible prices. And it’s agonizing to watch the indie world produce original hit after original hit, and publishers unable to recognize how they could be funding and profiting from this phenomenon at a AA level. The reason there are so many great games to plunder and remaster is because for decades previously, this is how game development worked! There was no need for a game to make half a billion dollars for it to have been worth releasing, when doing so gave the developers the opportunity to create fresh conceits that could gain widening popularity that fueled ever-more sequels and spin-offs.</p><p>Because while it’s grimly amusing to joke about Naughty Dog remaking the same three games for the rest of eternity, the company also demonstrates that it’s a Sisyphean task. Endlessly updating a game to reflect the latest gimmicks in graphics is folly, that boulder always rolling back down as fast as it can be pushed up, withe the miserable irony that it’s just as good of a boulder when left at the bottom of the hill.</p><p>Bethesda, for crying out loud, get on with making <em>The</em>&nbsp;<em>Elder Scrolls VI</em> and leave the perfectly good and perfectly enjoyable <em>Oblivion </em>and <em>Fallout 3</em> to the modders. And, for goodness sakes, release <em>Morrowind</em>’s source code. And the same goes for everyone else.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
