			<p>Following BioWare's release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gets-heavy-pc-specs-and-no-denuvo-confirmation-ps5-pro-info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detailed Dragon Age: The Veilguard PC system requirements</a>, some players might be worried whether they'll be able to play the game smoothly on their configurations.</p>
<p>Thankfully, NVIDIA has announced today that the game will be available for cloud streaming via the GeForce NOW platform from day one. Moreover, they have also announced a limited time offer to get the game for free if you purchase a six-month GFN subscription for the Ultimate tier.</p>
<p>Considering that the game is otherwise priced at $59.99, that would reduce the cost of the six-month GeForce NOW Ultimate subscription from $100 to $40, provided you were interested in buying Dragon Age: The Veilguard to begin with. The offer is valid starting today until October 30, the day before the game's launch.</p>
<p>GFN Ultimate subscribers will also be able to experience the game at its best, playing at 4K HDR with NVIDIA DLSS 3, NVIDIA Reflex, and ray traced reflections and ambient occlusion.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/retrorealms-ash-vs-evil-dead-review-fist-full-of-boomstick<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Retrorealms: Ash vs. Evil Dead</em> feels like a throwback to the nascent days of the 1990s. A video game tie-in to a famous movie property packed with familiar imagery compressed into 16-bit sprites. Much like the best of those titles, it's an experience that is better than expected but still has a questionable price tag for the content provided.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/retrorealms-ash-vs.-evil-dead-ash-shotgun-blast.jpg?itok=_hPaJ7H5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/retrorealms-ash-vs.-evil-dead-ash-shotgun-blast.jpg?itok=tvlXqsWu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Name's Ash. Housewares.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Retrorealms: Ash vs. Evil Dead</em> Review – Klaatu Barada Necktie</h2>
<p>As the name implies, <em>Retrorealms: Ash vs. Evil Dead</em> is based on the bloody horror comedy series. Ash Williams, boomstick enthusiast and slayer of evil is caught in a conundrum. An all-powerful eldritch horror from beyond mortal ken, known as The Overlord, has stolen the Necronomicon.</p>
<p>Using this forbidden tome of ancient power, The Overlord plans on plunging the world into a living nightmare filled with demons and death. Thankfully, Ash is still the same braggadocious, hard-drinking, chainsaw-wielding badass who is no stranger to carving up monsters.</p>
<p><em>Retrorealms: Ash vs. Evil Dead</em> is an arcade platformer. You'll alternate between navigating dangerous platforms, fighting demons and deadites, and picking up collectibles along the way.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/retrorealms-ash-vs.-evil-dead-nightmare-world.jpg?itok=KqmQTd7c 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/retrorealms-ash-vs.-evil-dead-nightmare-world.jpg?itok=ECnXqBD1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Just another day in the life, huh Ash?</figcaption></figure><p>Ash's moveset is familiar and functional. You have a melee attack, a <em>Ducktales</em>-esque plunging attack, a dodge roll, and a chargeable shotgun blast attack. There are consumable weapons you can pick up to help in a fight like kandarian daggers, nail guns, and oil lanterns. Ash even has a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/mega-man-zero-zx-legacy-collection-review" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Mega Man</em></a> wall kick, letting him scale up narrow passageways with ease.</p>
<p><em>Retrorealms Ash vs. Evil Dead</em> has some light RPG elements. Killing enemies and finding hidden collectibles earns you cash which you can spend on certain upgrades. These include health and ammo upgrades and new moves like a spinning slash or a rising uppercut.</p>
<p>Lastly, the game has a unique selling point with the nightmare realm. At the push of a button, you can temporarily switch to a nightmare version of the level. This contains tougher enemies as well as hidden passages and platforms that can lead to hidden rewards. Those rewards include three Necronomicon pages tucked away in each level, and special golden tickets. Golden tickets can be spent to unlock special 3D props from the <em>Evil Dead</em> series. If you want to find everything, you will need to be quick and careful.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/retrorealms-ash-vs.-evil-dead-ash-boss-fight-jump-scare.jpg?itok=LNcXRtgR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/retrorealms-ash-vs.-evil-dead-ash-boss-fight-jump-scare.jpg?itok=k9daauMX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This jumpscare got a laugh out of me.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Retrorealms: Ash vs. Evil Dead</em> Review – Good? Bad? I'm The Guy With The Gun</h2>
<p>If you're a big fan of the <em>Evil Dead</em> series, <em>Retrorealms: Ash vs. Evil Dead</em> is a nostalgic treat. The dialogue perfectly emulates Ash Williams' B-movie charm. The game is packed full of locations, characters, and boss fights from the Starz series. For example, Ash's healing items are his “Pink F” cocktails and levels end by getting into Ash's iconic ride, The Delta. There are even enemies based on the goofy deadite puppets.</p>
<p>It's the kind of fan service that helps gloss over the game's tissue-thin plot. In arcade fashion, you just hop from location to location with bosses popping up because The Overlord summoned them. For a game based on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/evil-deadthe-game" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Evil Dead</em></a>, that campy, “don't think about it too hard” energy works for the experience, but it does make the story feel light and frivolous.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the visual presentation is spot on. Wayforward continues its stellar reputation of detailed, expressive sprite animation in this game. Every character moves fluidly and gracefully. Areas are packed with background gags and colorful pop. Also, as befits something based on a Sam Raimi property, fights end in ludicrous explosions of pixelated blood and gore.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/retrorealms-ash-vs.-evil-dead-shopping-mart-level.jpg?itok=9r5IG81b 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/retrorealms-ash-vs.-evil-dead-shopping-mart-level.jpg?itok=-UnaD8od 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Guess who gets to supervise you blockheads tonight?</figcaption></figure><p>As for the level design, it is brisk and breezy. The nightmare world mechanic introduces some light exploration, risk, and reward. There's a decent mix of verticality, environmental hazards, and enemy variety to make each section a solid challenge.</p>
<p>The difficulty curve can be annoying. There are sections of the game that can feel patently unfair about halfway through. Medusa head enemies. Precision platforming challenges over deadly spike traps. Monster closet ambushes. The list goes on.</p>
<p>Exacerbating these frustrations is the game's lack of checkpoints. There is a single checkpoint in each level, and unless you pumped all of your resources into health upgrades, you may see certain gauntlets more often than others.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/retrorealms-ash-vs.-evil-dead-eligos-boss-fight.jpg?itok=-Qdd7oU_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/retrorealms-ash-vs.-evil-dead-eligos-boss-fight.jpg?itok=qd4iB1w8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hey look, it's that guy from that show.</figcaption></figure><p>Lastly, if you strictly care about content by volume with your purchases, <em>Retrorealms: Ash vs. Evil Dead</em> may ask too much for too little. I ended up rolling credits while getting most of the collectibles after about 75 minutes of gameplay. For a price tag of $24.99, that can be a bit steep, even for retro arcade fans.</p>
<p>But, these issues aren't exactly dealbreakers. Since the game is trying to emulate an old arcade game, <em>Retrorealms: Ash vs. Evil Dead</em> encourages replayability. In addition to finding all of the hidden tickets and Necronomicon pages, the game has a scoring system. If you enjoy doing no-hit runs or speed runs, this game can go from a one-hour experience to a five-hour experience easily. Just know what you're getting into before checking out.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/retrorealms-ash-vs.-evil-dead-michael-myers-boss-fight.jpg?itok=XX-_XKem 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/retrorealms-ash-vs.-evil-dead-michael-myers-boss-fight.jpg?itok=1-uY1UJb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Want to see how this goes down? It'll cost you.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Retrorealms: Ash vs. Evil Dead</em> Review – Did Someone Say Crossover?</h2>
<p>I must also mention that <em>Retrorealms: Ash vs. Evil Dead</em> is just one game in the <em>Retrorealms</em> series. Furthermore, if you purchase other games in the Retrorealms line, you can play as different characters in those different arcade titles. If you own <em>Retrorealms: Ash vs. Evil Dead</em> and <em>Retrorealms: Halloween</em>, that means you can play through Haddonfield with Ash or stab up deadites as Michael Myers.</p>
<p>This applies, to downloadable characters as well. For <em>Retrorealms: Ash vs. Evil Dead</em>, you can play as Kelly Maxwell. Aside from some dialogue changes and sprite animation, her playstyle is similar to Ash's. She's mostly there for completionists.</p>
<p>The idea of mixing and matching horror icons in these different arcade games is a nice conceit, but I am concerned it prioritizes fan service over gameplay polish. While I enjoyed my time with <em>Retrorealms: Ash vs. Evil Dead</em>, it's the kind of light experience that I don't think will be livened up with other replayable characters. And if other titles are similarly priced, it may be the wrong kind of horrifying for the player base.</p>

<p>If you're a horror fan who is content with a short runtime and a dubious pricetag, <em>Retrorealms: Ash vs. Evil Dead</em> is a bloody Halloween treat. But like any sugary Halloween treat, it's one you should savor, lest you end up with a stomachache and buyer's remorse.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/retrorealms-halloween-review-%E2%80%93-a-familiar-shape.1012020/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/retrorealms-halloween-review-familiar-shape<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Retrorealms: Halloween</em> is an uncanny experience. It invokes the old trend of 1990s movie tie-in games. Ones that vaguely use the framework of its source material for a pixel-art arcade platformer. Given the convoluted nonsense of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/halloween-games-unreal-engine-5" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Halloween</em></a> franchise, it isn't the strangest thing to happen, but it may ask a bit upfront with its price tag.</p>
<h2><em>Retrorealms: Halloween</em> Review –&nbsp; A Thing of Evil</h2>
<p>Much like other games in the series, <em>Retrorealms: Halloween</em> involves a sinister plot by an eldritch horror called The Overlord. The Overlord wants to pull the human world into the world of nightmares. To that end, he will need a champion to cleave a path of carnage, blood, and terror through the world. So he has selected the iconic Shape himself: Michael Myers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/retrorealms-halloween-overlord-screenshot.jpg?itok=NpXbLdop 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/retrorealms-halloween-overlord-screenshot.jpg?itok=Hh2N0GZq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This will totally not bite him in the ass. Totally. Probably.</figcaption></figure><p>To ensure the Haddonfield killer listens, The Overlord has taken something precious to him: the tombstone of his sister Judith. Of course, nothing good ever comes from someone trying to control or guide Michael Myers. Thus begins a bloody massacre through the local town spread across five levels.</p>
<p>Myers' move list is familiar to other <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/retrorealms-ash-vs-evil-dead-review-fist-full-of-boomstick" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Retrorealms</em></a> protagonists. You have a simple attack, a short-range teleport, and a wall kick. Myers can also pick up consumable weapons such as pitchforks, sickles, and bloody fire axes to stun and kill enemies at range. Lastly, Myers' has a chargeable dashing slash that lets him cover short distances.</p>
<p>The level design continues the series' nightmare world gimmick, adding a light level of exploration. At any point in a level, you can teleport to a darker, more twisted version of the level with harder enemies and alternate paths. Alternate paths filled with collectible Jack-O-Lanterns and Golden Tickets. Golden Tickets that can be exchanged for collectible 3D exhibit pieces from the <em>Halloween</em> series.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/retrorealms-halloween-nightmare-world-screenshot.jpg?itok=4sWE4AYJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/retrorealms-halloween-nightmare-world-screenshot.jpg?itok=sGXR_-Dc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Thank you convenient conveyor belts.</figcaption></figure><p>Aesthetically, <em>Retrorealms: Halloween</em> has a lot going for it. The sprite animation looks great. There's a great synth soundtrack, including a funky remix of the iconic <em>Halloween</em> theme song.</p>
<p>The shoestring plot contains boss fights and cameos from franchise characters. A personal highlight is a double boss fight with Laurie Strode and Doctor Loomis. You collect candy corn as part of the game's light RPG elements between levels. The game even has item placements inside innocent civilians you need to stab.</p>
<p>If you want to feel like Michael Myers in an arcade platformer, this looks and sounds the part.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/retrorealms-halloween-spike-trap.jpg?itok=MDKtv8EN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/retrorealms-halloween-spike-trap.jpg?itok=NMuD_zvK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Easy....eeaaasyy....</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Retrorealms: Halloween</em> Review – Evil Dies Tonight</h2>
<p>What keeps <em>Retrorealms: Halloween</em> from being a perfect marriage of retro gameplay and movie license are small but annoying issues. Aside from consumables, Michael doesn't have a long-range option. His dash attack can be interrupted by enemy projectiles. This becomes a problem when enemies start chucking acid and explosive vials. Worse still, it's a problem exacerbated by multiple demon eye enemies firing eye beams in the nightmare world sections</p>
<p>Michael Myers feels a bit stiffer compared to other <em>Retrorealms</em> characters. There's a slight delay in his teleport dash, making it difficult to pull off in the thick of a fight. In addition, his standard knife attack is lacking in reach. Pair this with some other annoying game design decisions: constantly spawning flying enemies and monster closets, and there is more frustration than joy in this arcade throwback.</p>

Outside of the Mark of Thorn, <em>Halloween</em> doesn't dabble in supernatural elements. It's just a masked killer and his next victim. That elegant simplicity works well in something like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/behaviour-red-hook-purchase" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Dead By Daylight</em></a> but can lead to creative issues in a retro platformer. Because of this, the game leans more on its original demon monsters to pick up the slack and ends up clashing with Michael Myers' appeal.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean <em>Retrorealms: Halloween</em> is a complete waste of time. There are setpieces and boss fights that work wonderfully here. But when you are charging $24.99 for a game with a run time of just over an hour with expectations of replaying it, these little moments can add up significantly.</p>

<p><em>Retrorealms: Halloween</em> gets the look and sound of its source material down, but stumbles in spots with its retro platforming gameplay. Coupled with a steep asking price and its horror-themed experience that is more trick than treat.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.dontnod-bourse.com/en/financial-information/press-releases?ID=ACTUS-0-88278" rel="noopener" target="_blank">financial summary released yesterday</a>, Don't Nod reiterated that the studio has had a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-financials-first-half-2024">pretty trying time</a> so far this year, once again pointing to the underperformance of first-half releases&nbsp;<em>Jusant&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden">Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden</a>&nbsp;</em>as motivating factors.</p>
<p>That release also confirms that "up to 69 jobs" may be at risk in what the studio is calling a "reorganization project to safeguard its competitiveness in an increasingly demanding and competitive ecosystem", but STJV isn't happy with this announcement or the way it was made to employees.</p>

<p>According to STJV, Don't Nod workers' representatives were informed about the layoffs in a meeting yesterday. They "were not told in advance about the meeting's topic", and they also weren't provided with "any documents and information" prior to the meeting.</p>
<p>STJV says Don't Nod employees have been raising alarms about the company's situation for over a year, and that former HR head Matthieu Hoffman described layoffs as "unimaginable" (STJV's quote, not Hoffman's) in summer, just three months before yesterday's announcement.</p>
<p>The union also says that Don't Nod management is hiding its "failures" and "inconsistent decisions" behind "excuses" like the state of the economy and the competitive nature of the gaming industry.</p>

<p>The union calls for "a social movement like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-strike-investor-letter">the one currently happening at Ubisoft</a>", calling on Don't Nod employees to "mobilize to save their jobs and working conditions". Strong words indeed. We'll have to wait and see if they bear fruit.</p>

<p>CL4L has clinched the NA LCQ ahead of the BLAST R6 Montreal Major and will be the first non-pro team to appear at a Rainbow Six Siege Major in <strong>five years</strong>. This remarkable achievement comes with a helping of disappointment for other teams, namely C9 Beastcoast, the underdog side that won the BLAST R6 Manchester Major in May.</p>



<p>CL4L eliminated C9BC, OXG, and Wildcard on their way to Montreal. From their respective bedrooms and remote setups, Beeno, Packer, Atom, Gity, and Tristan slammed T1 teams into the dust to secure this memorable achievement.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-believe">Believe</h2>



<p>CL4L is a non-professional side made up of mostly professional players, but some haven’t even graced a Pro League before hitting the qualification spot for a BLAST R6 Major. It could be the journey of a lifetime if the team can win big in Montreal next month, but that’s a <strong>huge </strong>ask.</p>



<p>The recent qualification matches that CL4L put out in the NA LCQ were nothing short of electrifying:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The BLAST R6 Montreal Major is a $750,000 tournament that’s set to unfold between November 7 – 17, and so far, some big hitters have qualified:</p>



<ul>
<li>Team BDS</li>



<li>Team Secret</li>



<li>DarkZero Esports</li>



<li>FaZe Clan</li>



<li>w7m Esports</li>



<li>Team Liquid</li>
</ul>



<p>A few teams are still yet to find their place in the tournament, but in the coming days, all will be settled.</p>



<p>CL4L making the cut is nothing short of staggering. The team is so rudimentary it doesn’t have any social media profiles or pages on platforms like Liquipedia, it’s just a few guys teaming up to play Rainbow Six Siege together, and ruling the roost while doing so. In Montreal, 20 teams will walk in – will CL4L walk out with a trophy?</p>



<p>Let us know your expectations for CL4L on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

As a result, all preorders in Kuwait will be cancelled and refunded to the original point of purchase. We remain hopeful that local authorities will reconsider, and allow players in Kuwait to enjoy this all-new experience in the Black Ops series.</blockquote><p>Activision failed to explain the reason for Black Ops 6’s Kuwait ban, but it probably had something to do with its setting.

        <p>In <em>Taboo Trial</em>, combat lies at the heart of the game.

Items dropped during combat play a crucial role—players can purchase various upgrades in shop rooms or obtain in-game boosts such as Valkyrie blessings and rune enhancements.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Black Ops 6 - Campaign Intel Drop Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The exact reason why Kuwait did not approve Black Ops 6 for release is unknown. However, some speculate it has to do with the portrayal of the Middle East given that Black Ops 6's campaign focuses on the Gulf War. Saddam Hussein has been featured in advertisements for Black Ops 6, and many believe the campaign could feature the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait that kicked off the Gulf War.</p><p>Before this, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pakistan-bans-black-ops-ii-medal-of-honor-warfighter/1100-6402835/" data-ref-id="1100-6402835">Black Ops 2 was banned in Pakistan</a> after store owners raised concerns that the game depicts the country as a training ground for terrorism.</p><p>Activision could theoretically edit or censor Black Ops 6 to appease local authorities in Kuwait, and there is precedent for this. Activision previously <a href="https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/No_Russian" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">removed the "No Russian" mission from Modern Warfare 2</a> to appease authorities in Russia, while <a href="https://censorship.fandom.com/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_World_at_War" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">World at War's Nazi references were removed for the game's German release.</a> Whether or not Activision will edit or adjust Black Ops 6 for Kuwait is unknown.</p><p>Some developers refuse to compromise on their vision and opt to straight-up cancel a game for a specific region if a country's ratings board denies a game for release. For example, Krafton opted to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-callisto-protocol-canceled-in-japan-to-avoid-censoring-content/1100-6508674/" data-ref-id="1100-6508674">cancel The Callisto Protocol's release in Japan</a>, saying it was unwilling to edit the game for creative reasons. Other studios have found fun and creative ways to get around local rules. For example, South Park: The Stick of Truth was censored in Australia and Germany due to scenes involving anal-probing, abortion, and swastikas. During certain censored scenes an<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/south-park-rpg-censorship-feels-like-a-double-standard-co-creator-says/1100-6418167/" data-ref-id="1100-6418167"> image of a statute making a face-palming gesture appears</a>, along with text describing what you would have seen in the uncut version. In Australia, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/south-park-the-stick-of-truth-uses-crying-koala-picture-to-circumvent-australian-censors/1100-6416827/" data-ref-id="1100-6416827">the game used an image of a crying koala during the probing scene</a>, leaving it up to the players' imagination.</p><p>Black Ops 6 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-preload-and-launch-times-detailed/1100-6527163/" data-ref-id="1100-6527163">launches on October 25</a>, and it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-works-on-game-pass/1100-6524136/" data-ref-id="1100-6524136">will be available on Game Pass at launch</a>.

It was subsequently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-takes-two-launches-this-november-on-nintendo-switch">released on Switch in 2022</a>, and, more recently, the game was said to be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-takes-two-movie-enters-development-at-amazon-studios-dwayne-johnson-may-star">getting a film adaptation</a>, with Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson involved. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-1m<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Konami has announced that the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake has hit a big sales milestone, and the game managed to achieve said milestone in just a few days.</p>
<p>Per a <a href="https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000001019.000050711.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">press release</a> (for which we're using machine translation),&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2</em>&nbsp;managed to rack up a million sales by October 11th, which is just three days after the game's launch on PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>
<p>The fact that&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>is a console exclusive, with an Xbox port <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-console-exclusive-to-ps5-for-1-year" rel="noopener" target="_blank">around a year away at least</a>, arguably makes that milestone more impressive. Here's hoping this leads Konami to think about making more&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>games in the future.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/silent-hill-2-sales-pyramid-head.jpg?itok=75oyakmx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/silent-hill-2-sales-pyramid-head.jpg?itok=QJxWSG76 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Pyramid Head wants to know if you've gone out and bought&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>yet.</figcaption></figure><p>The one million figure combines physical shipments and digital sales, although Konami doesn't say how those two are weighted, so we don't know whether the digital or physical version of the game has proven more popular.</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake, it's a reimagining of the 2001 survival horror classic developed by&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/medium">The Medium</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Layers of Fear&nbsp;</em>studio Bloober Team.</p>
<p>Although it remains fairly faithful to the original game's story, the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake shifts the action to a&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil</em>-style over-the-shoulder perspective and expands the world too, allowing you to explore more areas of the titular town.</p>
<p>Naturally, the visuals and overall presentation have been improved as well, and the remake also adds new cutscenes to expand the story a little, so this is a more substantial remake than the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-release-date-and-gameplay-info-revealed"><em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</em></a>, for instance.</p>

<p>It's a good time for remakes of survival horror classics from the 2000s. Yesterday, Capcom announced that its&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>remake had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-8m">surpassed eight million sales</a>, a pretty impressive figure in itself (although one that still pales in comparison to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-village-sales-10-million">mighty&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Village</em></a>).</p>
<p><em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2124490/SILENT_HILL_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/silent-hill-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-black-ops-6-cross-platform-answered/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Black Ops 6 is 2024’s Call of Duty release, and it has been a long time coming. Activision has put a lot of money and effort into producing and marketing this stellar title, and fans worldwide were excited about it from the moment the first trailers aired. In this modern, ever-connected world, gamers everywhere have one key question: ‘Is Black Ops 6 cross-platform?’</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-black-ops-6-crossplay">Is Black Ops 6 Crossplay?</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6, like every Call of Duty game since 2019, is fully cross-platform compatible. That means that if you have a PlayStation 5, nothing is stopping you from joining forces with your friends, even if one is on Xbox Series X and the other is on PC. </p>



<p>Modern Call of Duty games are linked more by a centralised Activision-backed account system than they are by individual platform identity networks. That means that regardless of your platform, you’ll be matched up with players on other formats. That of course does bring about a fair share of problems.</p>



<p>It means as a console player, you could be matched with PC players – and some gamers <strong>fear that</strong>. It’s no big secret that PC players have access to more sophisticated cheats, which is a massive issue with the Call of Duty ecosystem.</p>



<p>But fear not – you can <strong>turn off crossplay in Black Ops 6</strong> in the in-game menu. That’ll lock you to matchmaking exclusively with others on your format of choice.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-black-ops-6-cross-progression">Is Black Ops 6 Cross-Progression?</h2>



<p>As Call of Duty accounts link up across platforms, you’ll be able to enjoy unhindered cross-progression elements on Black Ops 6. That means that if you have the game on PC and want to switch over to a PlayStation 5 copy, nothing is stopping you from logging in on the other device, recovering your process, and carrying on where you left off.</p>



<p>It’s a neat and seamless system that players love.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/conan-exiles-age-of-heroes-begins-today-adding-voiced-companions-and-living-player-settlements/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Funcom might be busy working on Dune Awakening ahead of the game's planned <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-to-be-released-in-early-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early 2025 launch on PC</a>, but Conan Exiles is still going strong and receiving updates, too. Today, the developer has released Chapter 1 of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/conan-exiles-introduces-fully-voiced-companions-in-new-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Age of Heroes season of updates</a>.</p>
<p>The main additions are two fully-voiced companions, the sorcerer Liu Fei and the Aesir warrior Freya. Liu Fei is reportedly trapped somewhere among humanoid grey apes, and Funcom warns players to carefully hear his story before deciding whether to add him as a companion.</p>
<p>Freya, on the other hand, can be found on a high peak surrounding the Northern Aqueduct. A bloodthirsty desire for vengeance is the backdrop to this adventure, and it's up to the player to lead or be led by Freya.&nbsp;Both Liu Fei and Freya have their own perks, abilities, and powers, and Funcom teased they'll be a consequence of the choices made by players during the respective companion quests.</p>
<p>Once you have recruited them, you can examine their perks to find out exactly what moment on your journey together led them to choose that perk and how those abilities will manifest themselves in combat. Each companion has a total of six possible perks, although they can only learn three through your interactions.</p>
<p>Interestingly, your companion could end up with a completely different set of perks compared to another companion brought in by a fellow clan member. In Conan Exiles Age of Heroes, you can have multiple companions of the same character with different sets of perks. It's up to you to complete the quests for each additional companion you wish to recruit.</p>
<p><iframe title="Conan Exiles – Age of Heroes Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XTI5N7tBlvc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Another big new feature of the update is the so-called living player settlement system. Whereas NPC workers in a Conan Exiles player's base used to be entirely static, they will now be powered by an internal needs system to imitate dynamic behavior. Needs include hunger, rest, sleep, and work.</p>
<p>Moreover, if the base is attacked, the workers will trigger a flee-or-fight behavior. As a general rule, this should be tied to their job (e.g., a cook would probably flee), but Funcom hinted that there may be exceptions. Furthermore, with the new update, the workers won't be attached to a specific workstation anymore; their bonuses will instead apply to all stations relevant to their profession and tier within a 140m radius (about 54 foundation blocks).</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Last but not least, after many requests from Conan Exiles players, the workers can now be dressed up like any fighter, so you can change their clothing and weapons according to your liking.</p>
<p>The Bazaar item shop also got a significant expansion to the Argossean building set: there's the beautifully detailed observatory, interior decorations, and Pictish weapons and armors.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/killing-time-resurrected-review-mansion-madness</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/killing-time-resurrected-review-mansion-madness.1011960/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/killing-time-resurrected-review-mansion-madness<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/nightdive-studios">Nightdive Studios</a> announces a new remaster for an old title, I get excited. It gives me -- and others -- a chance to check out antiquated or otherwise forgotten games that have slipped through the cracks of time. Such is the case with <em>Killing Time: Resurrected</em>, a shockingly refreshing and charismatic old-school shooter that originally launched on the 3DO, of all things.</p>
<p>Not all 3DO games are built the same, that much is certain after playing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/poed-definitive-edition-review-more-like-pooed"><em>Po'ed: Definitive Edition</em></a> earlier this year. Trade <em>Po'ed</em>'s abstract and haphazard level design for the more deliberate open world of&nbsp; <em>Killing Time: Resurrected</em>, and you'll fall in love with both the Prohibition-era setting as well as its surprisingly engaging story, all told through real-life actors via full-motion video (FMV).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/killing-time-fmv.jpg?itok=yFenz2O1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/killing-time-fmv.jpg?itok=5AQpe_SJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>These scenes are visually enhanced, having more visual clarity than old versions of <em>Killing Time: Resurrected.</em></figcaption></figure><h2><em>Killing Time: Resurrected</em>'s Novel Way of Storytelling</h2>
<p><em>Killing Time: Resurrected</em> captivated me right from the start. This title was originally released in 1995, and shooters from that era are plentiful, though they tend to gravitate toward fantasy or science fiction. In this stylish, art deco-inspired shooter set around the 1930s, an engrossing narrative unravels as players explore an estate and its surrounding grounds on an enigmatic isle.</p>
<p>We're quickly introduced to several characters through the use of FMV cutscenes. Walking up to certain points around the island play these scenes, and this is one aspect where <em>Killing Time: Resurrected</em> really sets itself apart from other shooters of the era. FMV was definitely more common in the 90s than now, but to use it aplenty in a shooter seems novel.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/killing-time-fmv-2.jpg?itok=MAUHxHhm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/killing-time-fmv-2.jpg?itok=GLsnXcd1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This butler guy? He's chill.</figcaption></figure><p>A deep story isn't exactly a mainstay of the genre, with few exceptions. <em>Killing Time: Resurrected</em> is one of those exceptions -- through its use of FMV, I was easily engaged with the story, and became very interested to see what twists and turns it had in store.</p>
<p>The owner of this island, Tess Conway, becomes increasingly intrigued by the occult, and she comes in possession of an Egyptian water clock. Through various machinations that you'll see unravel through FMV -- which are essentially glimpses into the past -- she ends up trapping the entire island in time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/killing-time-environments.jpg?itok=1IGJizb5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/killing-time-environments.jpg?itok=BeU94OYy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Just doing some pest extermination.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Killing Time: Resurrected</em>'s Manor is Entrancing</h2>
<p>That's the bare minimum of the story, but there are dozens of different scenes, and six or so characters that all interact with each other in one way or another. The acting is hit or miss, but the writing for the actual dialogue is quite good.</p>
<p>All of this takes place across the aforementioned isle. This is another aspect where <em>Killing Time: Resurrected </em>shines. Rather than being split into levels or episodes like your typical boomer shooter, the isle is one vast, explorable space full of enemies.</p>
<p>The mansion itself, right in the middle of this isle, is the star of the show. Outside it's almost like a castle, and inside it's a surprisingly massive complex with rooms aplenty. <em>Killing Time: Resurrected</em> feels like a super solid corridor shooter while inside the mansion. Each wing of this manse has its own theme and character to it, adding even more mystery and whimsy to the abode.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/killing-time-enemies.jpg?itok=LaVCIM-o 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/killing-time-enemies.jpg?itok=TMWcnmbW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Housekeeping does not take kindly to shotguns.</figcaption></figure><p>The prevailing theme here is art deco -- which looks absolutely stunning with Nightdive's enhanced visuals -- and you'll fight a myriad of strange enemies within. The East Wing is meant for entertainment, with a beautiful ballroom, dining area, and tons of space for partying. Fittingly so, it's also filled with killer clowns, as well as gangsters, undead chefs, and more.</p>
<p>The West Wing is for guests, and again this is bedazzled with beautiful, opulent flair. Portly housekeepers and demonic maids stand in our way, and upstairs even more madness ensues with the complex layout of this mansion. It's extraordinarily fun to explore, and plenty of surprises await players within.</p>
<p>There are various Egyptian-themed temples and other buildings scattered across the island as well; here, you need to grab keys and other items in order to progress. <em>Killing Time: Resurrected</em> is a blast when you know where you're going, but it's also a great big key and item hunt at the end of the day.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/killing-time-temple.jpg?itok=Vw6HiKFy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/killing-time-temple.jpg?itok=m-lp4LqT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is not something you'd expect to see on a seemingly innocuous island.</figcaption></figure><h2>Fetch Me the Keys!</h2>
<p>When you don't know where to go, well, <em>Killing Time: Resurrected</em> can feel monotonous. Enemies you kill stay dead, so there's nothing to entertain you while you retread your path looking for keys. What's more, these keys are color-based, and there are ten in total. As someone who is colorblind, it was difficult to tell which key went where, and as far as I know, there's no remedy to make this aspect more legible.</p>
<p>The wide open, outside areas of the grounds are also not nearly as exciting as the mansion itself, because you're mostly fighting the same handful of enemies in the woods. Though it should not be understated, this game came out in 1995 originally -- it was an ambitious concept to begin with, but it still ages well enough.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/killing-time-map.jpg?itok=qGNT6-w6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/killing-time-map.jpg?itok=BjwYxDhu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>As you can see, the map is surprisingly vast.</figcaption></figure><p>One aspect that <em>didn't</em> age quite so gracefully is <em>Killing Time: Resurrected</em>'s weapons. Gunplay is serviceable, perhaps adequate, but gun variety is subpar. There are six weapons total, disregarding melee. The pistol becomes obsolete almost immediately as it shares ammo with the Thompson, and that does everything the pistol does, but better.</p>
<p>There's a shotgun, which will likely be your mainstay, a flamethrower (its ammo can be sparse), molotov cocktails, which are highly situational, and an ankh, essentially this game's BFG. You're mostly alternating between the shotgun and Thompson the entire time, so the variety leaves a lot to be desired. Even one or two more guns would have made gunplay more appealing.</p>

<p>Nightdive's work on this port is basically flawless. Compare images from the original game with this remaster, and you'll be amazed by the work they do. Visuals are crisp, and gameplay is smooth as smooth can be. At this point, I would be surprised if Nightdive botched a remaster, because each one I've played thus far has been just as good, if not better, than the last<em>: Killing Time: Resurrected</em> is no different in that regard.</p>
<p>What a pleasant surprise, <em>Killing Time: Resurrected </em>is. This once obscure shooter gains new life with a wonderful remaster. Indeed, it's become one of my favorite shooters of the era, and that's accredited to its unique identity and unconventional approach to storytelling. They really just don't make 'em like they used to, and <em>Killing Time: Resurrected</em> is proof of that.</p>

<p>The Olympic Update is pretty aptly-named; it brings a new region with a brand new Guardian to vanquish, as well as Xinth, the Black Coat, a brand new weapon with unique Aspects for you to discover.</p>
<p>You can now decorate the Crossroads with "dozens of unlockable decorations" and spruce it up with music tracks, too, bringing "a personal touch to your home between the realms", as Supergiant says.</p>

<p>If you're running a Mac, you'll also be pleased to learn that this update brings native Mac M1 support, although you're out of luck if your Mac has a chip that's older than the M1, sadly.</p>
<p>In terms of what lies in&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>'s future, Supergiant says it wants to work on "what awaits further beyond the newly-added Region" for the next major update, alongside new Boons and new enemies.</p>
<p>The studio is estimating that this update will be launched sometime early next year, and it should take "a little less development time overall" than the Olympic Update did.</p>

<p>The full&nbsp;<em>Hades 2&nbsp;</em>Olympic Update patch notes are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/7057794870234137716" rel="noopener" target="_blank">available to read here</a> if you want to know everything that's new.</p>
<p>Alternatively, in true Supergiant style, you can enjoy the patch notes in the form of a dramatic reading given by narrator Logan Cunningham, because of course you can.</p>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 represents the next generation of this twenty-year-old shooter series. It’s one of the most highly-anticipated titles to hit the franchise in years, and Activision (and associated studios) spared no expense when marketing and promoting the game. However, there’s one question that still floats around the minds of COD multiplayer fans worldwide: Does Black Ops 6 have SBMM?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-is-sbmm-in-cod">What is SBMM in COD?</h2>



<p>SBMM means ‘Skill-Based Matchmaking’, and it’s an algorithm-driven mechanic that determines who you’re matched with online. It’s driven by many criteria, such as your ping, input, kill-death ratio, and match history, but it’s one of the most controversial features in Call of Duty’s storied history.</p>



<p>Many multiplayer gamers <strong>hate</strong> SBMM because it ‘deliberately’ forces you to play against more challenging opponents more regularly, rather than landing you in a truly randomised pool of players for each new game. That means that the better you are, the tougher your experience will be.</p>



<p>In recent years, Activision has tweaked SBMM to be even more intelligent. It can now tell when you’re ‘about to’ quit Call of Duty, and by way of a response, it might offer you a slightly more relaxed lobby so that you do better and keep playing for longer.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-sbmm-in-black-ops-6">Is SBMM in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately for some, Black Ops 6 <strong>does </strong>have SBMM. It has been claimed that every Call of Duty game for the last ten years or more has featured SBMM elements, and Black Ops 6 will be no different. Further, it’s assumed that Black Ops 6 will feature more intelligent SBMM than ever before, as it’s a mechanic that Activision’s teams are forever trying to improve.</p>



<p>SBMM isn’t always a bad thing, of course. In 2024, Activision lifted the lid on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-reveals-sbmm-cod/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">driving factors of Skill-Based Matchmaking</a>. It was explained that the more important factors when matching players with one another are elements like connection, ‘time-to-match’, platform, and whether or not the users have access to voice chat.</p>



<p>The most critical factor is ping – <strong>not </strong>K/D or recent match performance.</p>



<p>That’s why it’s not necessarily a bad thing that Black Ops 6 does have SBMM – it might be a mess of unstable matches and connection errors, otherwise.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/space-marine-2-patch-4-0-introduces-a-new-operation-and-other-changes/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Space Marine 2’s patch 4.0 is a free content update and is now live. It introduces a new Operation called Termination, a new photo mode for Operations, balancing changes and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The free update adds Termination as a new PvE Operation for Space Marine 2. The Operation will occur on the planet of Kadaku, where players will find new “dreadful foes”. You will have to use your artillery to eliminate these pesky enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Space Marine 2’s update also adds new Lethal difficulty for Operations; check them out below.</p>



<ul>
<li>Ammo Crates will have limited refills per player.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Majoris Enemies can become more deadly and harder to kill if they get enraged.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Armour will be restored through finishers only when you are around your battle brothers.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Overcoming these challenges will reward players with new cosmetics.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Lastly, Space Marine 2’s update will also add a Photo Mode in operations. However, players will only be able to use it when playing solo. Moreover, the characters you are trying to capture will now follow the camera with their eyes. If you are interested in the gameplay and balancing tweaks, check out the <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/97-patch-notes-4-0-new-content-for-operations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">full patch notes</a> for Space Marine 2’s patch 4.0.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, Focus Entertainment recently announced that Space Marine 2 has 4.5 million players across all platforms. The game is also the most-played title from the Warhammer 40,000 franchise, with an all-time peak of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2183900/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">225,690 on Steam</a>.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-rom-emulate/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo shutting down emulators like <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-emulator-yuzu-shut-down-nintendo-gets-paid-2-4-million/">Yuzu</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ryujinx-switch-emulator-is-dead-too-taken-down-by-nintendo-like-yuzu/">Ryujinx</a> years after their first release may have to do with the Nintendo Switch 2, as the system may end up being easier to emulate near launch than the vast majority of gaming consoles.</p>
<p>Thanks to the recent massive <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pokemon-mmo/">Game Freak leak</a>, which confirmed the Ounce codename for the next Nintendo console, among other things, as reported by<a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Centro LEAKS</a>, the system seems to use the same tools and ROM format that is being used for the current Switch, but with new encryption keys only known to Nintendo. This would make the system far easier to emulate than every other gaming system at launch and may explain why the Japanese company shut down emulators like Ryujinx and Yuzu after they had been widely available for years.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Ounce (Switch 2) seems to use the same tools and ROM format Nintendo currently uses for Switch 1 (ROMs are still NSPs), but obviously they have new encryption keys that only Nintendo has</p>
<p>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/1846709024160420043?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 17, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Very little is currently known about the Nintendo Switch 2 other than that it has been in the works for a while. Production seems to have started ramping up recently, and a first look at what is supposed to be an early prototype was shared online <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-new-video-design/">last month</a>. Unfortunately, it's still not clear when the system will be formally announced and when precisely it will be released, although recent reports suggest that the console could be ready for a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-rumored-to-be-ready-for-march-april-2025-launch/">March-April 2025 release.</a></p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

	<div>
	
		
				<div>
					
					
								<p><em>World of Warcraft</em>, or <em>WoW</em>, is like the Red Hot Chili Peppers of the massively multiplayer online roleplaying genre: not only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers_2022%E2%80%932024_Global_Stadium_Tour">is it still going strong</a> but it’s also somehow even bigger than you thought. <em>World of Warcraft</em>’s current numbers aren’t public, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHDFgZAuJHU">one recent educated guess</a> came in at 7 million paying subscribers, which, at $15 / month, would make the game a billion-dollar earner by itself. Its developer, Blizzard, merged with Activision in 2008, and Microsoft gobbled up both companies in 2022, but <em>World of Warcraft </em>remains a load-bearing spine of the newly formed corporate turducken. The game that redefined gold mining for the 21st century is still a 19th-century gold mine for its landlords.&nbsp;</p>

								<p>It’s also thriving in a subscription ecosystem that it helped to legitimize. <em>World of Warcraft</em> debuted in 2004, during an era when you still had to buy games in boxes from stores. The runaway success of Blizzard’s always-on portal to Azeroth proved that, for the right product, studios could charge a recurring fee beyond the initial cost of the core game’s (at the time) formidable five installation CDs. Here, in the enshittified 2020s, we’ve all grown used to renting our culture by the month, but it was genuinely pathbreaking for <em>World of Warcraft</em> to have 12 million subscribers at its peak in 2010. It didn’t invent the monthly model, which had already gained traction in games like <em>Ultima Online</em> and <em>EverQuest</em> during the dawn of the massively multiplayer online roleplaying game (MMORPG) genre. But <em>World of Warcraft</em>’s success took that recurring charge mainstream and helped popularize the unassailable business logic that having your customers pay you once was worse than having them pay you until they decided or remembered to stop.&nbsp;</p>

								<p>As <em>World of Warcraft </em>turns 20,<em> </em>its enduring financial success arguably pales in comparison to its cultural significance. I asked Angela Washko, a new-media artist who staged several notable performance pieces inside the game world, what she considered <em>World of Warcraft</em>’s biggest contribution, for better or worse. “<em>World of Warcraft</em> expanded the notion of what public space was,” she told me. “I saw the bonds created amongst members of my guilds moving beyond the game space, as players flew across the country to meet each other.” Everyone I talked to about <em>World of Warcraft</em>’s legacy seemed to mention someone or other getting married, either in the game itself or here in reality after meeting in the game. “I think the degree of immersion and dissolving of the boundary between ‘real life’ and ‘fantasy’ within <em>World of Warcraft</em> was really a turning point in computing culture,” Washko said, adding that <em>World of Warcraft </em>“changed the conversation around video games from being something that was ‘an escape from everyday life’ to something that was an extension of one’s social life and happened to take place in a virtual environment.”&nbsp;</p>

								<p>Through her own work, Washko also explored the less savory side of a fantasy game populated by real people; her <a href="https://angelawashko.com/section/300206-The%20Council%20on%20Gender%20Sensitivity%20and%20Behavioral%20Awareness%20in%20World%20of%20Warcraft.html">Council on Gender Sensitivity and Behavioral Awareness in <em>World of Warcraft</em></a> involved traveling from town to town to educate passersby about feminism and discuss how the game’s dominant culture often created a hostile environment for its marginalized players. I recalled my own playing days, when you could be flying into a town on your hippogryph, minding your own business, only to be deluged by a wave of sewer-grade hate speech on a public text channel. We now take it for granted that online spaces reflect the social dynamics of the people who occupy them, including and especially the problematic ones, but in many ways, <em>World of Warcraft</em> was the kobold in this particular coal mine.</p>

				</div>
		
				<div>
					
					
								<p>I first encountered the <em>Warcraft</em> universe like many ’90s computer kids: as a series of top-down, real-time strategy games about economic management and cartoon fantasy violence. The world (lowercase) of <em>Warcraft</em> pitted the seemingly noble Alliance (humans, elves, dwarves, your Tolkienesque usual suspects) against the villainized Horde (orcs, trolls, and other stock monster-humanoids from the trope factory) in a vicious-with-a-touch-of-slapstick conflict spanning three main titles and numerous expansions between 1994 and 2003. If no one was using the phone, you could play against your friends over a modem. The series had a rich and goofy aesthetic of exaggerated proportions, saturated colors, and sarcastic jokes. The units that ran your economy were literal simpering peons, which gave everything a barrel-shaped, vaguely comedic flavor that played well against the high-gloss cinematic interludes that would become Blizzard’s calling card.</p>

								<p>Flush with revenues from its flagship series, Blizzard began exploring how it might expand <em>Warcraft</em>’s popular lore into other types of games. First, a point-and-click game called <em>Warcraft Adventures</em> — a late-1990s attempt at LucasArts-style vintage puzzle-solving in a cel-shaded take on the<em> </em>mythos — was infamously canceled for not meeting Blizzard’s internal release standards. (It also leaked, fully playable, not too long ago. Based on what I’ve seen, Blizzard was right.) Then, starting in 2001, an experimental team of a few dozen people got busy building a whole new engine that would bring Azeroth into 3D for the first time and let players meet, socialize, and slaughter skeletons together. It was a primordial example of the modern phenomenon where a corporation exploits its intellectual property by jumping genres and colonizing a new medium. It was also how they’d get me.</p>

								<p>There are plenty of humbling ways to use Gmail’s internal search function, especially if you’ve had your account for roughly as long as <em>World of Warcraft </em>has existed. For one example, consider my collected personal correspondence surrounding <em>World of Warcraft</em>, from the peak years of its involvement in my life. When I queried “Warcraft before:2007/1/1,” it yielded about two dozen results, and together, they trace a blunt biography of that moment: landing a big new job; getting hella dumped; and “spending two months as an antisocial hermit,” as I told a friend in a Gchat in early 2006. (And how about <em>World of Warcraft </em>outliving Gchat?)&nbsp;</p>

								<p>Reviewing the private record, it’s clear <em>World of Warcraft </em>tore through my life like an experienced raiding party of max-level grinders through the Deadmines. Admittedly, it was the kind of nymph-stage young adult life that was conceptually made of crepe paper and easily shredded by a video game. But something about the predictable rhythm of ordering junk food delivery after an exhausting workday, logging onto <em>World of Warcraft,</em> and hopping through some lush environment searching for herbs to make into sellable virtual potions just drew me in, one night after another.</p>

								<p>This aspect of <em>World of Warcraft</em> — its knack for blurring the line between work and fun until the casual observer might not quite recognize it as either — often came up when I spoke to others about their experiences. “One thing <em>WoW</em> proved on a large scale is that people will turn a game into a job at the slightest provocation,” said Cory O’Brien, now a narrative and level designer for games like <em>Redfall </em>and <em>HoloVista</em>. <em>“</em>I remember spending hours and hours and hours grinding for dust so that I could enchant magic items. I remember smelting tin and copper to make bronze.” The elaborate crafting system in <em>World of Warcraft</em>, which often required materials gained through repetitive in-game labor, represented an explosion in the popularity of the now-ubiquitous mechanic where you, as a player, find some stuff and turn it into something else. “I still play all these more recent games like <em>Minecraft,</em> <em>Project Zomboid,</em> and <em>Valheim</em> that are literally just that crafting part,” O’Brien told me. “I spend so much time doing monotonous, repetitive tasks, for free, because somehow we have discovered that that’s fun.” Here, in 2024, it’s hard not to feel a vaguely sinister undertone to all of this as the rising tides of capitalistic overreach gamify the gig economy and hijack the natural human affinity for rewards for their own extractive purposes. But to Washko’s point about an expanded social life, one reason this all worked is that you were often helping out real people, with “legitimate needs” in the scope of the game. You were rarely just doing these things for yourself.</p>

								<p>It wasn’t always exactly a waste, either. Andrew Simone, now a project manager in tech, attributes a large swath of his professional tool kit to skills he gained as a guild leader in <em>World of Warcraft. </em>“I actually stopped playing <em>WoW</em> largely because I felt like I was managing my guild more than my actual professional jobs,” he told me, proceeding to outline a frightening slate of workplace-flavored tasks that included interviewing prospective guild candidates, analyzing performance metrics from the game’s multiuser boss fights, dealing with in-guild sexual harassment, managing schedules across the world to hold meetings about all these things, writing guides for new members, and even “cultivating a kind of guild culture so people <em>enjoyed</em> being there,” which is an incredible thing to say about something that is already ostensibly a game. I know there are countless former guild leaders reading this and nodding along because their current workday docket has nothing on mediating a 10-way raiding party dispute over who should get the legendary enchanted pauldrons that just dropped.&nbsp;</p>

								<p>On the other hand: plenty of it <em>was</em> a giant waste. I can’t tell you, back in the day, how many hours I was technically playing <em>World of Warcraft </em>but<em> </em>ignoring the game itself while I sifted through, rearranged, and tested various custom add-ons for its labyrinthine, fintech-ass user interface. <em>World of Warcraft </em>is a persistent software ecosystem with clients and servers and all kinds of data flying between them at all times — it’s just not necessarily exposed to every player in full. An entire cottage industry of user-created UI mods sprung up to assign repeatable actions to shortcut keys, or process advanced analytics from game logs like Simone would do for his guild, or implement an “<a href="https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info23151-AGT-AutomaticGoblinTherapist.html">automatic goblin therapist</a>” who answers any incoming whispers to your character with an in-game implementation of the classic ELIZA protocol. Letting players scratch their own itches for how the game felt to play was also a clever way to limit complaints about the parts of it that weren’t as polished. I never got much into the game’s advanced content myself, but for those who did, pretty much the only way to follow the expected meta of guild raids was to use externally designed UI add-ons. <em>World of Warcraft </em>had the audacity to make players create their own custom cockpits for the game and ended up creating a kind of recursive procrastination where you could even distract yourself from your intended leisure activity. Anyone who’s ever rearranged the app icons on their phone knows just how ubiquitous this kind of time-consuming “metawork” has become.</p>

								<p>Recently, I engaged in a more contemporary form of networked social entertainment — sitting around a big TV with friends, watching four strangers play a game together on Twitch. Just as things were picking up, the stream cut out, and an algorithmically inserted video ad began to play: it was for <em>World of Warcraft</em>. This was a group of mostly game designers, and before I had a chance to say anything, someone <em>else</em> piped in to mention <em>World of Warcraft</em> was 20 years old now — and formally impactful enough that working game makers still know its birthday.</p>

								<p>Seeing that ad, writing this piece, none of it was enough to get me to reinstall <em>World of Warcraft</em>. (It’s a good thing the game never stooped to making you feed your in-game pets.) I didn’t really feel I had to replay the game to measure its influence because its influence is everywhere. Every monthly subscription, in-game economy, or digital “third place” where lives bleed into online connections owes it some spiritual recognition as prior art; those things have all become inescapable. Twenty years later, we are all living in the <em>World of Warcraft.</em></p>

<p>"At this time, the title will not be available for release in the region. As a result, all pre-orders in Kuwait will be cancelled and refunded to the original point of purchase," Activision told us. "We remain hopeful that local authorities will reconsider, and allow players in Kuwait to enjoy this all-new experience in the Black Ops series."</p><p>While Activision did not go into further detail as to why Black Ops 6 had not been approved for sale in Kuwait, it is fair to assume the game's Gulf War themes are a key factor for this decision. Iraq invaded Kuwait in the early 90s, which triggered the start of the first Gulf War.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is set to release later this month, on 25th October. When it arrives, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-the-next-batch-of-xbox-game-pass-titles-for-october-and-into-november">will also be available on Game Pass</a> via the service's Ultimate and PC Game Pass membership tiers.

            <p>Analogue has unveiled its next console, the Analogue 3D, that allows users to play original N64 cartridges in 4K.</p>
<p>The console follows Analogue's successful Analogue Pocket device that plays original Game Boy cartridges.</p>
<p>"Analogue 3D represents a milestone in video game preservation: it's not only the world's first reimagining of an N64 - but the world's first 100 percent-compatible recreation of an N64," reads the <a href="https://www.analogue.co/3D">company's website</a>.</p>

<p>"No more incompatibilities found in software emulation like input lag, graphic/audio inaccuracies, timing/frame rate issues and more. For the first time, you can re-experience the N64 exactly as it was meant to be, without compromise."</p>
<p>In addition, the console is region free, includes both bluetooth and wi-fi, and features four original-style controller ports.</p>
<p>Further, Analogue has created a new wireless controller with 8BitDo, though its modern design loses the iconic three prongs of Nintendo's original. It's sold separately for $39.99.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Introducing Analogue 3D. A reimagining of the N64. </p><p>In 4K resolution. Perhaps the greatest multiplayer system of all time.

</span>
</p></div>
<p>The console itself comes in black or white and is available for $249.99 (about £192). Pre-orders will open on 21st October directly from the <a href="https://store.analogue.co/">Analogue store</a>, with shipping expected in the first quarter of 2025 (according to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/250-analogue-3d-will-play-all-your-n64-cartridges-in-4k-early-next-year">ArsTechnica</a>).</p>
<p>On the product website, Analogue details the "unmistakable essence" of CRT to the look and feel of N64 games. As such, the console features original display modes to meticulously reproduce CRT displays. "Capturing the warmth, depth, and texture in every frame. The soft glow of phosphor and vibrant colours unite with immersive scanlines and shadow masks. This isn't just upscaling - it's an unprecedented transformation."</p><p>It certainly looks like a beautiful machine - especially if the Analogue Pocket is anything to go by. Of course, if you own a Nintendo Switch, you can play plenty of N64 games if you have a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-online-games-available-to-play-right-now">Switch Online Expansion Pack</a> membership.</p>
<p>Still, the Analogue 3D uses original cartridges, meaning the whole catalogue of games will be playable beyond the obvious Mario and Zelda favourites.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>This year's Fallout Day will be celebrated in style, with a broadcast that will give players a glimpse at the future of Fallout 76, the latest entry in the series.</p>
<p>As confirmed by Bethesda, Jon Rush and Bill Lacoste, Creative Director and Lead Producer of the latest entry in the series, will provide a new look at what the team is working on during the first-ever Fallout Day broadcast, which will air on October 23rd at 9:00 PM CEST/ 3:00 PM EST / 12:00 PM PST. FalloutforHope, a community-run charity initiative, will also be part of the festivities, as confirmed by a video message shared on the official X profile.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>While only Fallout 76 has been mentioned to be part of the broadcast, it would definitely make sense for Bethesda to take advantage of the occasion to speak more about what's in store for the future of the popular series, especially now that its popularity is at an all-time high thanks to the successful TV show by Amazon which has registered <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-fallout-tv-show-has-registered-100-million-viewers-to-date/">100 million viewers</a> to date. Even without Bethesda's involvement, however, fans of the series are still able to experience more Fallout in existing games thanks to high-quality fan-made mods, such as the incredible <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-is-now-available-for-download/">Fallout: London mod</a>, which finally brings the post-apocalyptic series outside the United States for the first time.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a>'s <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> remake, which released earlier this month, has already managed to shift an impressive number of copies.</p>
<p>As shared by publisher Konami, the remake, which puts players back into the grief-riddled shoes of James Sunderland, has already sold a total of 1m copies (that's across both physical and digital media) since its global launch on 8th October.</p>
<p>In fact, Konami said the remake reached this sales milestone in less than a week, citing sales figures from 11th October. So, that's actually a whopping 1m copies in just three days.</p>

<figcaption>Here's Eurogamer's review for Silent Hill 2 remake in video form. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOv1JTfPnuQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>As noted by industry insider DuskGolem, this rather zippy timeframe makes <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> the fastest-selling entry in the series to date.</p>
<p>What's more, while Bloober hasn't published sales of its previous games, this so far appears to be the company's biggest critical and commercial success to date.</p>
<p>As a slight aside (considering the two series were traditionally in competition on PlayStation), <a href="https://x.com/dev1_official/status/1846479698232324198">Capcom</a> also announced today its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a> remake has now welcomed "eight million-plus agents" since its debut.</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Silent Hill 2 Remake has surpassed 1 million units sold in less than a week (via Konami's press release, reached 1 million sales on October 11th).</p><p>Makes it the fastest selling Silent Hill game by far, &amp; certainly not bad for a PS5/PC exclusive releasing for a long dormant IP. <a href="https://t.co/OqpYs5kbI5">https://t.co/OqpYs5kbI5</a></p></div>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1846770601027162471?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 17, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>But, back to Silent Hill 2. It is fair to say today's sales milestone is well deserved for Bloober. The game has been met with widespread acclaim from critics and fans, who have praised the developer for its brillaint remake. </p><p>"Against the odds, Bloober Team has delivered a remake that both expands Silent Hill 2 in just the right places, and gives careful attention to what it preserves," our Vikki wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">Eurogamer Silent Hill 2 Remake review</a>, awarding the game an impressive five out of five stars in the process.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Praise the gods, it's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a> update day, and developers Supergiant are not mucking about. They have bolstered the nippy roguelike with a heap of shiny new things in this "Olympian Update", including a new weapon with homing attacks, a liver-pecking boss fight, two new animal familiars, and the home region of the Gods - mount Olympus. It's probably the biggest update they've made yet in terms of fresh sights. And by "fresh sights", I mean Dionysus sporting a leopard-print thong. Yikes.</p>

<p>Chief among the changes is the new region, Olympus, which looks suitably full of marble statues and ionic columns, if suspiciously gloomy. The new weapon is called the Black Coat, which can launch a bunch of missile-like orbs at enemies or be used to perform damage-blocking counterattacks. Your two new animal familiars will be Raki the raven and Hecuba the hound, who can dig holes for you in place of the usual shovel, it seems. Yes, you can pet the dog. Don't make Frinos the frog jealous, now.</p>
<p>If you're wondering how much this update advances the story, we're told that there are now 2500 new voice lines,  plus "expanded subplots" for certain characters like Arachne the spider gal and Dora the friendly ghost. But the big new development in this regard is probably the appearance of Prometheus, the Titan that made humans from clay and then stole fire from the gods to give to humanity. You'll be fighting him as a boss, and likely learning a bit about his motivations. The eagle who chows on his liver every day also seeks extra protein from your face.</p><p>Like I say, it's an absolutely stacked update. You'll be able to decorate your hub at the Crossroads. Many hexes and keepsakes have been tweaked. There's new portrait art for Charon, Medea, and Hades, among others. And while Olympus is the big new hot spot, existing regions also have some new locales, we're told. I'm not even going to try to summarise the many, many changes to boons and blessings. Just know that there are some new boons, while others have been altered, and a few have been removed. </p>
<p>All the highlights are mentioned in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/7057794870232159705">this Steam post</a> but you can get into the nitty gritty of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/7057794870234137716">the full patch notes</a> if you like. Supergiant has even recorded <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQtih_yy6IA">a 26-minute long "dramatic reading"</a> of the changes, featuring Logan Cunningham, voice actor of Homer and vocal calling card of the studio. This sounds like the most niche bedtime listening.</p>
<p>I found the fast pace and quippy conversatin' of Hades 2 a lot of fun in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2-early-access-review">early access review</a>. But I haven't been back to it much. Maybe this update will convince me to go check on my favourite rival, Nemesis. According to these patch notes, "she is less quick about gruffly running through exits; she is less quick to purchase items from Charon." Aw, I always <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2s-best-girl-is-nemesis-because-she-messes-up-your-run">liked that about her</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Former PlayStation exec Shawn Layden has discussed the state of the games industry, stating there's a "collapse of creativity" and that relying on blockbusters is "a death sentence".</p>
<p>Layden took to the stage at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> Asia alongside Raw Fury co-founder and chief publishing officer Gordon Van Dyke (thanks <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/shawn-layden-aa-is-gone-and-thats-a-threat-to-the-ecosystem-going-forward">GI.Biz</a>), where the pair discussed the disappearance of AA studios.</p>
<p>In the past, said Layden, studios focused simply on whether a game was fun rather than monetisation schemes, though admitted "risk tolerance was fairly high".</p>

<figcaption>Nintendo has announced new hardware, but it's not Switch 2 - so what's the point of Alarmo?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNKD3U-4AY" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>"Today, the entry costs for making a AAA game is in triple digit millions now," he continued. "I think naturally, risk tolerance drops. And you're [looking] at sequels, you're looking at copycats, because the finance guys who draw the line say, 'Well, if <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> made this much money in this amount of time, my Fortnite knockoff can make this in that amount of time.' We're seeing a collapse of creativity in games today [with] studio consolidation and the high cost of production."</p>
<p>Further, Layden stated "AA is gone", which he described as "a threat to the ecosystem".</p>
<p>Noting the general standard of games, including indie titles, is much higher thanks to advancements in tools, he continued: "Now if we can just get a bit more interest and excitement and exposure for these lower budget, but super creative and super unusual [type] of games... I'd like to see more of that. Because if we're just going to rely on the blockbusters to get us through, I think that's a death sentence."</p>
<p>AA games can bring "the new thing" and can be developed far quicker than AAA games, said Layden. Most importantly, though, they must seek unique ideas not monetisation.</p>
<p>"If you're going to pitch me your AA game, and in the first two pages of your deck is your monetisation and revenue, subscription scheme, I'm out. Your first page has to be 'This game needs to be made and here's why'," he said.</p>
<p>"I want to see that fire, I don't want to see 'here's the chief accountant on the team that's going to explain to you the [game's monetisation]'."</p>
<p>Layden also commented on current trends around <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-ai-is-changing-video-game-development-forever">AI in game development</a>, stating it's "not a saviour".</p>
<p>"Artificial intelligence has been in gaming since almost the first or second games ever made," he said. "So all this excitement about gen AI, I find kind of humorous. I do see its applications in certain places for certain things. But it's just a tool, it's not a saviour. It's a tool in the way that Excel is a tool. It just helps speed you along your tasks."</p>
<p>Layden began working for Sony in 1987, eventually serving as chairman of SIE Worldwide Studios from 2014 - 2019. He's worked as a strategic advisor at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> since September 2022.</p>
<p>His comments are perhaps best reflected in games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a>, a unique and creative concept that was certainly a risk for Tango Gameworks.</p>
<p>That studio was closed by Microsoft, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tango-gameworks-and-hi-fi-rush-acquired-by-pubgs-krafton-following-microsofts-studio-closure-in-may">subsequently acquired by Krafton</a>. And Krafton boss Changhan 'CH' Kim has made comments that parallel those of Layden - specifically the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/krafton-acquired-tango-gameworks-to-maintain-its-legacy-rather-than-cash-in">studio acquisition was motivated by the desire to maintain its legacy rather than make money</a>.</p>
<p>"We wanted to maintain their legacy," said Kim. "Although they did not have a big success in their games, we saw many creatives worth pursuing. That's why we wanted to work with that organisation."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
