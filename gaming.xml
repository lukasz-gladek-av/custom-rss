Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p>The first Nintendo Switch basically had the road to itself, and Nintendo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review">instantly proved</a> just how awesome a hybrid console and handheld could be, leading to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24150926/nintendo-expects-switch-to-become-its-best-selling-console-ever-this-year">massive success</a>. We now know that the Switch 2 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">is set to launch in 2025</a>, but it will be released into a world that’s packed with very capable handheld gaming PCs that could present an interesting challenge to Nintendo, especially following news from CES 2025.</p><p>Valve’s Steam Deck kicked off the handheld gaming PC push in large part because its Linux-based SteamOS makes playing your games just about as easy as it is on consoles. That’s why one of the biggest CES announcements is that Valve is going to let people install SteamOS on other handhelds <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338405/valve-steamos-beta-other-handhelds-beyond-steam-deck">as soon as April</a>, potentially making the entire handheld PC gaming market a lot more appealing.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339466/nintendo-switch-2-pc-gaming-handhelds-steamos">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NTQ5" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24345191/nintendo-switch-2-bigger-screen">The Switch 2’s bigger screen is just what I wanted</a></h2><div><p><cite>Image: The Verge, Nintendo</cite></p></div><div><p>Nintendo has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">finally revealed the Switch 2</a> — but it didn’t reveal everything. Even still, the new console looks pretty much like a bigger, more refined Switch. Sure, that’s the straightforward and expected move from Nintendo. But it’s also exactly what I’ve been waiting for.</p><p>The first Switch was a revelation. When it launched, I marveled over being able to play <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> on my TV and then take the console out of the dock and play in handheld mode curled up on the couch. Nintendo absolutely nailed the execution of combining its console and portable expertise into one great device, and ever since, the Switch has been a constant companion at home and while traveling.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24345191/nintendo-switch-2-bigger-screen">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NjU2" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24344511/nintendo-switch-2-features-specs-handheld-dock-upgrade-comparison">The Switch 2 is boring — and that’s exactly what Nintendo needs</a></h2><div><p><cite>Image: The Verge, Nintendo</cite></p></div><div><p>You can always count on Nintendo for a surprise. This is the company that followed the Game Boy with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/24242128/nintendo-ds-touchscreen-games-2004-launch">a strange dual-screened handheld</a> and broke out of its GameCube slump with a console focused on motion controls. It’s the company that lost its lead with the Wii U and then gambled on another innovation — the portable hybrid known as the Switch — to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718273/nintendo-2023-big-moment-mario-zelda">ultimately get back on top</a>. All of those were big, risky swings that seemingly exemplified the company’s playful, experimental ethos.</p><p>The Switch 2, on the other hand, is… <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">a bigger, better Switch</a>. It’s kind of boring. But it’s also exactly the right move from Nintendo. At a time when people expect their games and experiences to carry over between devices, the old console paradigm of starting over with a new generation doesn’t make a whole lot of sense. And since Nintendo hit a home run with the original Switch, it has the runway to be a little bit boring this time.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24344511/nintendo-switch-2-features-specs-handheld-dock-upgrade-comparison">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Whenever the Switch 2 comes out, it’ll have competition from handheld PCs.</p><p>As I wrote <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339466/nintendo-switch-2-pc-gaming-handhelds-steamos">earlier this month</a>, “it will launch into a world that’s packed with very capable handheld gaming PCs that could present an interesting challenge to Nintendo.”</p><p>Yes, the Switch 2 will probably outsell most handheld gaming PCs by a wide margin.

Here’s a quick breakdown of what the announcement trailer showed us about the Switch 2’s Joy-Cons.</p><p>Before the official reveal of the console, there were rumors alluding to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324483/nintendo-switch-2-leak-reddit-next-handheld">how the new Joy-Cons would work and their internal mechanisms</a>. The most significant rumor was that they were held to the console via magnets, and in the reveal video, that appears to be the case. The video features the Joy-Con seemingly snapping to a cover as though attracted by a magnetic force.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24343722/switch-2-joy-cons-details-magnets-drift-nintendo">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NzUx" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24345091/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-event-schedule">You’ll be able to try out the Switch 2 starting in April</a></h2><div><p><cite>Image: The Verge, Nintendo</cite></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6Nzcw" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24337198/switch-2-mario-kart-nintendo">Nintendo teases a new Mario Kart for the Switch 2</a></h2><div><p><cite>Image: The Verge, Nintendo</cite></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MzM4" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24236766/nintendo-switch-2-games-direct-date-time">Nintendo announces Switch 2 Direct for April</a></h2><div><p>Now that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">Nintendo’s reveal of the Switch 2</a> has put to rest years of anticipation and rumormongering, it’s time to hear more information about the console and, importantly, all the games. The company has announced it will hold a Switch 2 Direct scheduled for April 2nd.</p><p>The Switch 2 reveal trailer showed footage that looks to be a new <em>Mario Kart </em>game, which is a good indication it’ll be a launch title. There’s speculation that the forthcoming <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/26/24052049/i-love-this-theory-that-metroid-prime-4-could-be-a-cross-gen-switch-2-launch-title">might straddle both consoles</a> the way <em>Breath of the Wild</em> launched on both the Wii U and the Switch back in 2017.

Everything else has come by way of leaks and info supplied by third-party manufacturers. Late last year, one such manufacturer, Dbrand, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320659/nintendo-switch-2-dbrand-killswitch">debuted its Killswitch carrying case meant for the Switch 2</a>.

<p>Nintendo released a notice today announcing the discontinuation of My Nintendo Gold Points.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through the My Nintendo reward program, players could earn Gold Points when purchasing digital Nintendo Switch games or DLC. The earned points could be used towards rewards and discounts on the My Nintendo Store and Nintendo eShop. However, after March 25, 2025, at 1:30, Gold Points will no longer be awarded on eligible purchases.</p>



<p>Fortunately, players can use Gold Points they have already earned for longer, as they are valid for 12 months after receipt. Moreover, there are some cases where Gold Points may be awarded after the discontinuation date; check them out below:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Players will earn Gold Points if they pre-order a downloadable product before the end of the bonus period.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Gold Points can be earned if players purchase a packaged version of software released before the expiration.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Also, suppose players purchase Nintendo Switch (OLED model) White/Customized, Nintendo Switch Customization, or Nintendo Switch Lite Yellow/Turquoise/Grey/Coral/Blue from the My Nintendo Store before the reward expiration date and time. In that case, they will be able to earn Gold Points after the shipping date. Check out more details about earning Gold Points after the discontinuation date <a href="https://support.nintendo.com/jp/information/2025/0218.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>.&nbsp;</li>

            <p>Former PlayStation boss Shuhei Yoshida has said he took the job overseeing indie games for PlayStation because he "had no choice" - and now they're selling better than ever on the console.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/shuhei-yoshida-looks-back-at-31-years-at-sony-playstation-exit-interview/">Venturebeat</a>, Yoshida discussed his 30+ year career at PlayStation, including his move in 2019 from president of SIE Worldwide Studios to overseeing a new initiative focused on independent developers.</p>
<p>"Well, I had no choice," said Yoshida about the move. "When Jim [Ryan] asked me to do the indie job, the choice was to do that or leave the company."</p>

<p>He continued: "But I felt very strongly about the state of PlayStation and indies. I really wanted to do this. I believed I could do something unique for that purpose."</p>
<p>Yoshida explained PlayStation had been criticised by indie developers, that "PlayStation doesn't care about indies". That's now changed, he believes, with indie games on PlayStation selling better than PC in some instances.</p>
<p>"You don't hear that kind of criticism anymore," said Yoshida. "Last year we had lots of anecdotes from our indie partners that their new games were selling better on PlayStation than any other platform. Thats amazing. Some games sold better on PlayStation than on PC. When I started that work five years ago, our indie partners would say that when they released their games multiplatform, the Switch version would sell three to five times more than PlayStation. Bit by bit, that gap has narrowed down. We have a strong team inside the company supporting indies."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-announces-retirement">Yoshida left PlayStation last month</a>, though clarified in this interview that he hasn't retired. He "felt good about the state of [PlayStation's] support for indies" and so decided to leave. As such, he plans to still work with indie developers.</p>
<p>"Oh, yeah. I love working with these younger, talented developers," said Yoshida. "They come up with amazing games every year. Every year when you come to one of these events, a couple of the nominees for game of the year are indies. They're bringing something exciting to the industry. It's a lot of fun. That's my dream job, to be able to help them."</p>
<p>Yoshida also addressed current issues in the games industry, in particular why development has slowed down and so many layoffs have occurred.</p>
<p>"I think it's an overreaction to the Covid situation," he said. "Companies invested too much, including ourselves. Then we had to face reality and make adjustments. If you take out the Covid years you'd have smoother growth over the years."</p>
<p>Yoshida discussed his beginnings at Sony, courting companies like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> and Namco to move development to PlayStation, and his own work on games like Crash Bandicoot and Gran Turismo. "Crash Bandicoot was my first product, though," he said. "Mark Cerny and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> taught me a lot. They trained me as a producer."</p>
<p>A big shift at Sony happened ahead of the PS4. The PS3 was "another hard time", Yoshida explained - a topic also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-playstation-30th-anniversary-interview-with-shawn-layden-it-was-a-fight-to-get-the-sony-name-on-the-machine-they-didnt-want-to-be-associated-with-it">covered recently on Eurogamer by fellow former PlayStation exec Shawn Layden</a>. "We were losing a billion dollars. I thought PlayStation was finished."</p>
<p>As such, with development of the PS4, hardware and software teams worked more closely together to ensure the console was easy to develop for and collaboration could occur. That's how the controller's Share button was created, for instance.</p>
<p>"Starting with PS4 and PS Vita, that wall broke down," said Yoshida. "We became part of the hardware design process. We loved that. Lots of things about the hardware came from ideas and feedback from the game team. So we loved the system. We knew what we were getting. We were making prototypes based on the hardware prototypes."</p>
<p>He added: "But we still didn't know if it was going to succeed, until Microsoft made some great decisions for us. They put the ball on the tee and let us take our swing. We couldn't have asked for better competition."</p>
<p>Since leaving PlayStation, Yoshida has been interviewed a number of times, discussing everything from a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-hasnt-playstation-done-anything-new-with-bloodborne-shuhei-yoshida-has-a-theory">new Bloodborne game</a>, to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ill-fated-nintendo-playstations-first-game-was-a-space-shooter-says-former-exec-shuhei-yoshida">ill-fated Nintendo PlayStation's first game</a>.</p>
<p>And beyond helping indie games, he's starring in one too: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-lands-first-video-game-voice-role-in-promise-mascot-agency">Yoshida has voiced a character in the forthcoming Promise Mascot Agency</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
During a house clearout I recently discovered a cache of creative writing from my teenage years. Naturally, I now consider most of it to be unbearable. Reading certain notebooks makes me feel as though my stomach is mounting an upwards assault on my brain. BURN IT, scream the parts of said brain that have learned the perils of starting poems with "O Muse". BURN IT ALL. Nonetheless, I felt bad about being mean towards my adolescent self, so I popped all those misbegotten papers in a giant suitcase. It squats next to me right now as I type these words, like a mausoleum filled with dead albatrosses. 
</p>
<p>
Similarly mixed emotions appear to inform <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/amphora-hell">Amphora Hell</a>, in which you play an amphora (read: ancient species of vase) with legs. The amphora is the work of the Kilnmaster, a terrible Olympian force who is sort of one part Hephaestus to one part shmup villain. The Kilnmaster has just decided that he hates his amphora with legs and wishes to destroy it with flying hammers. "No evidence of my failure must remain," he bellows in the Itch preamble. "Prepare to be scrapped!"
</p><!--more-->
<p>
What follows is a sort of arcade pisstake of neurotic perfectionism and the way projects we deem write-offs may refuse to let go of our imaginations. It's a simple play, so simple that my previous sentence feels desperately overloaded.</p>
<p>As the amphora, you run right or left on a stack of lanes and moving platforms, trying to avoid twirling hammers that appear at random from either side. The challenge increases rapidly: stay intact for 40 seconds or so and the Kilnmaster's nightmarishly disembodied head will appear and coast towards you, purring threats like a demon vocoder. The unspoken objective is to last long enough to hear the entirety of the game's pulsing background track. I have yet to manage this.
</p>
<p>
I like this game because it's a self-deprecating introduction to creator June Flowers's <a href="https://june-flower.itch.io/">other experiments</a>, which range from "the first gunk-type game" to a game of stick and hoop played using interactive fiction mechanics. All of this is summarised as "brain poison for your brain poison", which describes a lot of the art I like.</p>
<p><a href="https://june-flower.itch.io/amphora-hell">You can download Amphora Hell for free on Itch</a>. If you get past the floating head stage, do let me know if there's anything weirder to report, and by all means share any of your own projects you now wish to destroy with flying hammers.

            <p>I tend to play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer 3</a> closer to an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> than a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a>. Balance? Leave me alone, for I am immersed in the stinky fantasy of being a sniveling Skaven bin-licker, commanding my slaves to mine useless gold purely because it irritates my dwarfish enemies.</p>
<p>As such, I'm not quite as tuned into the nuances of enemy faction behaviour as a lot of players, despite my ungodly hour count. I do miss fighting against large enemy empires though, something the AI seems more reluctant to pull off these days.

<p>There's a fair bit of design talk in the blog, so I'll stick to the helpful "How will this affect you in-game?" explainers they've given. They're looking at three major areas in all: 'Query System', 'Aggression', and 'Faction Potential'.</p>
<p>The query system is how the AI detects enemies and potential enemies on the map. So, anyone who isn't them basically, given that it's Warhammer. The problem? Campaign AI prioritises defending its settlements when enemy forces are present, and 'enemy forces' hitherto included even the lowliest agent character. They're now making the enemy less likely to cower behind their walls at the merest whiff of a rambling troubadour weaving daisy chains on adjacent farmland. From the blog:</p>
<blockquote><p>"How will this affect you in-game? It means an AI controlled faction will no longer immediately assume a defensive posture and concentrate forces near/in settlements whenever any hostile agent ventures into their territory. This should enable AI factions to use resources that previously went to the defensive response for other purposes, e.g. raiding enemy territories, concentrating forces to break through defended positions."</p></blockquote>
<p>They're also aiming to make the AI better at assessing rival faction's strength, and more incentivised to declare war on other AI factions. I sort of love how vaguely sinister the word 'incentivise' is in this context, since its basically flipping a switch in someone's head that makes them angrier (which I seem to remember being the <a href="https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Angron">actual lore behind a Warhammer 40k character</a>, actually.)</p>
<p>Finally there's 'faction potential', which basically governs how powerful a given faction is likely to grow. If you've noticed certain Dark Elves performing absurdly well in <em>every single campaign</em>, it's likely to do with their high potential. From the blog:</p>
<blockquote><p>"We’ve made five tweaks to Faction Potential for this Beta:</p>
<ul>
<li>A slight increase of major AI faction strength versus minor AI factions</li>
<li>Slight increase of faction potential weight in auto resolve calculations</li>
<li>Lowered the minimum faction potential minor factions can have</li>
<li>Moderately increased the maximum faction potential bonus for AI factions under the shroud - this allows higher potential factions to defeat and conquer lower potential factions faster</li>
<li>Small increase of base faction potential for all factions on all difficulty levels"</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>This should mean that major factions conquer the little guys faster and more often, increasing the chance they'll survive until late game, and also be less passive overall.</p>
<p>This can obviously change between campaigns, but here's <a href="https://youtu.be/EYLHQwGffHg">a quick timelapse</a> by YouTuber MonkeyBot of a campaign in the current beta. The Bloody Hands orcs seem to do a lot better than usual, and the Skaven don't usually do quite as well in my experience either. Also, the Ordertide has been well and truly krumped.</p>
<p>Will I be jumping in to try these changes any time soon? No. I have work to do and showers to take regularly, both of which will suffer horribly if I'm not careful. You should be careful, too. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-warhammer-3s-ai-playing-smart-in-forge-of-the-chaos-dwarfs-is-as-miserable-as-it-is-brilliant">Good Twarhammer AI can be horrible</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>If you’ve got children that have grown out of the Gruffalo but still like to be read a story at night, chances are you know about Dog Man. A series of books from Dav Pilkey, Dog Man is a dog, who’s also a policeman, who takes part in a host of silly adventures in his superhero alter-ego, The Bark Knight.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dog Man: Mission Impawsible - Launch Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/toJ0IOjJVKQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Dog Man has reached that hallowed ground of popularity and ubiquity that have earned him an upcoming cinematic debut, but Dog Man fans can already join him in Dog Man: Mission Impawsible, a platforming adventure featuring all his friends. It’s an old-school tie-in platformer, and while it’s relatively simple, younger fans will absolutely get a kick out of the artwork and spending time with their favourite characters.</p>


<p>Piggie – a bad guy who happens to be an actual pig – along with his cohorts, Bub and Crunky, are causing bother in the city, and it’s up to Dog Man and his Supa Buddies to save the day. They’re going to do that by jumping across platforms, hopping on bad guys’ heads, and making their way through the occasionally tricky levels from left to right, and while it isn’t Mario, it’s mechanically sound and offers enough variety to keep you entertained through the game’s runtime.</p>


<p>Much of that variety comes from being able to switch between Dog Man and his two companions, 80-HD and Lil’ Petey. Besides being able to jump different distances, or fit through different-sized spaces, they all have special abilities that you’ll need to employ to make it to the end of each level, their talents growing as you progress. It’s easy to grasp, and the younger gamer in our house could easily recognise the various points that needed a specific character to get past.</p>
<p>That said, Dog Man: Impawsible Mission can be tricky for younger fingers and thumbs. My youngest is 8 years old, and while we aimed to take turns doing levels, he often passed the controller back to me mid-stage because it was proving frustrating. That’s in part due to some jumps needing to be much more precise than others, while the characters’ different heights injects a spot of trial and error. We overcame all those mild frustrations together, but if your child isn’t a regular platformer fan, prepare to be their in-house Supa Buddy.</p>

<p>Dog Man: Impawsible Mission definitely looks the part, with bright and vibrant visuals that look as though they’ve been pulled straight from the books. There’s also artwork to unlock that showcases some of the storyboarding from the books, or highlights key moments in the game, but these are made slightly less interesting by the inability to zoom in closer, or to blow them up to full screen.</p>

			<p>Ever dreamed of getting into The Elder Scrolls VI as an NPC (non-player character)? Well, here's your chance, courtesy of Bethesda Game Studios and Make-A-Wish: <a href="https://my.onecause.com/event/organizations/sf-0018000000bK8c8AAC/events/vevt:fd137384-5aab-481b-bcc9-95db4365f38b/auctions/silent-auction?linkId=100000340468689" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there's an ongoing silent auction</a> to make this specific dream come true.</p>
<p><em>One winner will have the opportunity to work with the Bethesda Game Studios development team to create a character to appear as a video game NPC in The Elder Scrolls VI.</em></p>
<p><em>Calling all gamers and fantasy fans! This once-in-a-lifetime opportunity allows you to immortalize yourself in one of the most highly anticipated video games of all time, The Elder Scrolls VI. The Elder Scrolls series, developed by Bethesda Game Studios, is renowned for its vast open worlds, deep lore, and immersive storytelling. With this exclusive experience, you'll work with the developers to create a custom character that will appear in the game, leaving your mark on the legendary franchise.</em></p>
<p>The only issue is that, well, the auction is already well beyond the means of any regular gamer. Right now, the bid is at $10.5K, and it's bound to get higher—it was at $7.1K just yesterday. There's no publicly listed end date, though one would assume you'd get notified about that kind of information after making a bid. Also, this is only available for United States residents.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time we have covered someone getting into The Elder Scrolls VI as an NPC. Back in November 2018, fans of the fantasy RPG franchise <a href="https://wccftech.com/fans-bethesda-shirley-curry-npc-tesvi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">petitioned</a> Bethesda to add 'Granny' Shirley Curry, who had become beloved in the community after her YouTube videos of playing Skyrim. A few months later, Bethesda officially <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-elder-scrolls-vi-or-starfield-e3-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that they had already scanned Curry to make her an NPC in the game. Meanwhile, modders have already <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-grandma-shirley-curry-is-now-available-in-game-through-a-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added</a> her to Skyrim.</p>
<p>The Elder Scrolls VI was <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-starfield-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at E3 2018 when Bethesda wanted to reassure fans about its commitment to single-player games following the unveiling of Fallout 76. It only <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-is-officially-in-early-development-but-you-wont-hear-any-more-about-it-for-some-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entered production</a> around the launch of Starfield, in August 2023. The likely launch window is between late 2027 and 2028.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/lost-records-bloom-rage-tape-1-review-rocking-in-90s<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em> was a heady mixtape of nostalgia for me. It brings Don't Nod's narrative strengths of young adult melodrama and magical realism into an era I lived through. A story about four young women sharing a pivotal summer in the year of 1995.</p>

<p>It is a spot-on punk rock time capsule full of flawed characters, a mesmerizing pop soundtrack, and young adult angst. However, due to how Don't Nod has decided to present this tale, it is difficult for me to fully recommend this intimate adventure.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lost-records-bloom-rage-swann-on-bed.jpg?itok=hF1KLRmD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lost-records-bloom-rage-swann-on-bed.jpg?itok=k4oLzLZT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The old days of rental stores and rewinding cassettes.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em> Tape 1 Review – My So-Called Life</h2>

<p><em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em> starts with Swann Holloway, a woman returning to her childhood home of Velvet Cove after receiving a text from some old friends. After reconnecting at a local bar, her friends slowly remember the first time they met twenty-seven years ago and a haunting incident that has reunited them in the present.</p>

<p>Those friends include Autumn, a girl with a summer job and a jerk for a boss, Kat, a quiet but observant bundle of anger in overalls, and Nora, an acne-scarred defiant rocker with a turbulent home life.</p>

<p>This framing device, while familiar, does a great job of suspense. It's the basis for various coming-of-age stories like <em>Stand By Me</em>. The flashback structure adds a level of suspense to the entire story, the knowledge that something major or devastating will happen in the future. This is a studio that doesn't shy away from emotional gut-punches, and that unease hangs over the entire narrative.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lost-records-bloom-rage-tape-case.jpg?itok=nlrgg0LB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lost-records-bloom-rage-tape-case.jpg?itok=-crGXONb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The minute I saw this I turned to dust and immediately wanted to hang out with Swann.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em> Tape 1 Review – Gotta Get With My Friends</h2>

<p>It's a clever set-up since the pacing of <em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em> is far more sedate. Like most narrative-centric experiences, gameplay involves moving Swann through several locations, choosing dialogue options that either build (or destroy) relationships with certain characters and occasionally solving a puzzle. The closest point of comparison would be another Don't Nod drama, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/tell-me-why-episode-3-spoilers" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Tell Me Why</em></a>. You have some authorship over Swann's character, but the draw is more on character drama than plot logistics.</p>

<p>The closest thing to a major mechanic is Swann's camcorder. At any point in the game, you can pull it out and record snippets of video. Record enough of a certain object or phenomenon and you'll make a Memoir, a sort of montage of your footage. There are even sections in Swann's bedroom where you can watch the footage you shot up to that point.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lost-records-bloom-rage-camcorder-footage.jpg?itok=7jsYceGY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lost-records-bloom-rage-camcorder-footage.jpg?itok=QTMtE6aL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I did a double-take when I first used this. The effect is perfect.</figcaption></figure><p>It's a small but wonderful way of characterizing Swann through gameplay. Recording every bird, squirrel, or beautiful skyline isn't just for completionism but illustrates Swann's interests. Her friends even encourage or chide her for it in certain scenes.</p>

<p>As the story of <em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em> unfolds, the vibe is less Stephen King or Hitchcock and more <em>The Donnas</em> or <em>Bikini Kill</em>. From the minute you play as teenage Swann, it is clear Don't Nod did their research into the 90s era.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Every time you use Swann's camcorder, there's a noticeable analog filter over the lens. The shelf is packed with boxy VHS cassette tapes and thick potboiler novels. She even has a troll doll and an off-brand Tamagotchi on her desk. But the best atmospheric touch is the music: a moody blend of dreampop mixed with riot grrl punk rock. When it comes to depicting the look and feel of the 1990s, this game comes off ace.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lost-records-bloom-rage-playground.jpg?itok=3PP7wEpV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lost-records-bloom-rage-playground.jpg?itok=pnsze4hl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hanging out at night. It happened more often than you think.</figcaption></figure><p>This underground attitude extends to Swann's friends. They play in a garage band, aptly titled <em>Bloom &amp; Rage</em>, openly smoke, and complain about things in their personal life&nbsp;- complaints like distant or deadbeat fathers, annoying sisters, and how to get out of their dead-end small town.</p>

<p>Complimenting this is dialogue that walks the razor's edge of adolescence and awkwardness. Writing convincing dialogue is difficult for young adults, the first <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/life-is-strange-remastered" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Life is Strange</em></a> was particularly hit-and-miss, but it's clear the narrative team here did their research. The dialogue isn't just believable, it is couched in the era.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lost-records-bloom-rage-adult-autumn.jpg?itok=3yIaptJD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lost-records-bloom-rage-adult-autumn.jpg?itok=3EaQcDxz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Good question, Autumn. Good question.</figcaption></figure><p>The countercultural attitude isn't just the characters putting on airs but a part of the girl punk cultural movement that started in the mid-90s. The disdain for authority isn't just friction against parental systems, but an extension of social awareness of institutional problems. As angry and juvenile as the main cast can get, they have layers.</p>

<p>The present-day sections further contrast this atmosphere. While brief, these interludes do a great job of framing the characters' yearning for the past. A past not inundated with smartphones, social media, or recovering from a devastating global plague. The game even keeps track of your relationships between certain characters in the present and the past; further cementing the effect of time on people and memory. There is some rose-tinted nostalgia here, but it is more wistful than romantic.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lost-records-bloom-rage-abyss-glow.jpg?itok=_cJKMiLm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lost-records-bloom-rage-abyss-glow.jpg?itok=6yyM0yW1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Starting to think something is going on in this town....</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em> <em>Tape 1</em> Review – B-Side Pending</h2>

<p>While the vibes of <em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em> are immaculate, I can't fully recommend the game on them alone. There are some technical issues. Uncanny robotic facial animations and out-of-sync lip flaps kept distracting me during certain parts. There is some tell-don't-show going on regarding certain character dynamics. For example, Nora's dysfunctional home is alluded to in the montage and mentioned but not illustrated.</p>

<p>But the biggest hurdle is pacing. The lion's share of this game were several small scenes intercut with montages of small-town life, a nature walk through the woods, some quasi-horror segments, and a big rock-and-roll performance. The closest thing to stakes isn't life or death or confiding in a dark secret but helping a character find a set of lost keys. If you think plot and narrative momentum are central to an experience, chances are you'll be bored or frustrated by this.</p>

<p>Finally, <em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em> is currently an incomplete story. There is an inciting incident and a big cliffhanger twist near the end. It's a twist that gets better the more I think about it, but that lack of closure does sour the experience; even if that closure arrives in a few months.</p>

<h2><em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em> <em>Tape 1</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>While it only tells half a story and has some technical jank, <em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em> retains the quirks and the charm of Don't Nod's previous outings. As awkward and occasionally embarrassing as Swann and her friends can be, their story is a melancholic and human one. And if you know you'll need to wait for the ending, I say give this a look.</p>

<p>According to a new report, Rockstar Games plans to make GTA 6 a new “metaverse platform” for user-generated content.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://digiday.com/media/rockstar-games-talks-with-top-metaverse-creators-with-an-eye-on-making-grand-theft-auto-the-next-creator-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Digiday</a> reports that Rockstar has spoken to some of the best user-generated creators for Roblox, Fortnite, and GTA for their upcoming title, GTA 6. According to the report and three anonymous industry insiders, the developers are exploring the possibility of creating custom experiences in the game, which will allow these creators to introduce their intellectual property to GTA 6’s world while having the ability to alter the existing elements of the game, too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fans will appreciate user-generated content in GTA 6 after seeing how well GTA RP servers have done for a game released over a decade ago. Thanks to the user-generated content players experience in the GTA RP servers, GTA 5 remains one of the most popular games on Steam and is followed massively on Twitch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, in 2023, it was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fivem-redm-rockstar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rockstar had acquired Cfx.re</a>, which brought two of the biggest role-playing communities under its umbrella, FiveM and RedM. At the time, it was speculated that this move would allow GTA 6 to feature role-playing servers at launch or might get them soon after release; however, the developers never confirmed this information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/corsairs-ceo-believes-gta-6-is-coming-to-pc-early-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Corsair’s CEO believes</a> GTA 6 will come to PC early next year. Also, GTA 6 release <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-release-may-not-be-the-end-for-gta-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">may not be the end</a> for GTA online. What are your thoughts on GTA 6 developers exploring user-generated content?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>The upcoming Elder Scrolls 6 has been long in the pipeline. As I've already said, it was first announced over six years ago. At the time of its reveal, Bethesda was keen to make sure everyone knew Elder Scrolls 6 was still a way out, and said it was in pre-production (although we do know it will be released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/todd-howard-confirms-fallout-5-will-be-bethesdas-next-game-after-elder-scrolls-6">before Fallout 5</a>). Then, back in 2021, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-6-in-design-phase-being-built-on-new-starfield-technology">Bethesda said Elder Scrolls 6 was in a design phase</a>.</p>
<p>The studio's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/todd-howard-wishes-hed-been-a-bit-more-casual-with-his-elder-scrolls-6-announcement">Todd Howard has since said he wished he had been a little more casual with the game's announcement</a>. Additionally, in October 2023, Skyrim's lead designer Bruce Nesmith said Bethesda announced Elder Scrolls 6 when it did in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elder-scrolls-6-revealed-so-early-due-to-pitchforks-and-torches">bid to appease any angry mobs which had their "pitchforks and torches" out</a>, desperate to know more.</p>
<p>"But I'm betting you won't hear much in the way of details until a good six months before release," Nesmith said at the time.</p>
<p>So, do you fancy turning yourself into an Elder Scrolls 6 NPC?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nintendo has announced it will discontinue its Gold Points scheme across the Switch eShop and official Nintendo website.</p>
<p>From 25th March 2025, players will no longer be able to earn Gold Points from purchases. Points earned before this date will still be usable.</p>
<p>Gold Points are currently earned through purchases on the eShop or official Nintendo website, essentially like a loyalty scheme, and can then be redeemed for a discount.</p>

<p>Pre-orders for digital games made up to and including 24th March 2025 will still earn Gold Points, regardless of the game's release date (even if payment occurs after this date). Points will not be granted if the pre-order is cancelled, or if payment fails. Pre-orders after this date will not earn points.</p>
<p>Gold Points can still be earned by registering physical games, as long as the game was released by 24th March 2025 (as shown on the eShop). Gold Points can be earned up to two years from a game's original release date in Europe (one year in other countries).</p>
<p>Lastly, Gold Points are valid for 12 months from the date of being earned, expiring at the end of a calendar month. That means Gold Points earned up to and including 24th March can be used to receive a discount on the eShop for another year.</p>
<p>It's unclear why Nintendo is ending this scheme, with the <a href="https://my.nintendo.com/news/7db7f9327a48ec83">announcement</a> simply stating: "We sincerely thank you for using the My Nintendo rewards programme, and apologise for any inconvenience."</p>
<p>Perhaps Nintendo will be switching to a new equivalent scheme for Switch 2 and is ending Gold Points in advance?</p>
<p>In similar news, Nintendo has stated <a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/GB/en/pretickets/70020000000101">Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers</a> cannot be redeemed for Switch 2 exclusive games.</p>
<p>These vouchers are available for players with a Nintendo Switch Online membership, allowing them to purchase two games from a select list at a discounted price, including various Nintendo exclusive games.</p>
<p>"Please note that Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers cannot be redeemed for Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive games," the purchase page now reads.</p>
<p>Again, it's unclear what Nintendo's plans are here for Switch 2, but change is definitely afoot.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Nintendo unveiled its Switch 2</a> last month, along with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-announcement-reveals-new-mario-kart-game">brand new Mario Kart</a>.

			<p>Yesterday, Arc System Works announced the launch date of its upcoming game HUNTERxHUNTER: NENxIMPACT: July 17. This will be the first fighting game based on Yoshihiro Togashi's manga and anime franchise and the first game from the IP to be released globally.</p>
<p>Pre-orders are now open digitally on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/JP0036-PPSA24274_00-0000000000000000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456420/HUNTERxHUNTER_NENxIMPACT/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>, with Switch digital pre-orders set to open later. Players who pre-order the Deluxe Edition will earn a 48-hour Early Access before release and a special color variation for Killua (PS5) and Hisoka (PC).

<p>At launch, HUNTERxHUNTER: NENxIMPACT includes sixteen characters from various arcs of the 2011 anime adaptation of the series. The first DLC character will be Nephelpito from the Chimera Ants arc. Players will be able to obtain Nephelpito by either purchasing the DLC separately or by buying the Deluxe version of the game. He is also the first character (out of four) available in Season Pass 1, set to be released in Winter 2025.</p>
<p>Offline modes include Free Battle, Training mode (which allows players to practice with their characters in any situation, also coming with various settings and a “Record” function), a Replay section that allows players to rewatch their favorite matches, and the Story mode that gives the opportunity to relive famous scenes from HUNTERxHUNTER and play against the CPU based on set situations. Some stages also act as tutorials to help players understand how to play on top of enjoying the 2011 anime’s iconic moments.</p>
<p>The Single mode, on the other hand, provides a variety of challenges, including the “Sky Arena” featuring a series of matches against the CPU to become the “Floor Master”. Each character also comes with a “Combo Trial”, which will challenge players to perform several combos.</p>
<p>The Story and Single modes also serve to collect “Titles,” “Profile Icons,” and Greed Island Cards - G.I. Cards - to fill your Collection and help you personalize your profile online.</p>
<p>The multiplayer supports a quality rollback netcode. Online modes include Player Matches, which are meant for casual fun, and Ranked Matches, where players can try to become “Triple Hunter”, accumulating Rank Points and scoring as high as possible. Both modes also allow players to challenge each other to gain G.I. Cards.</p>
<p>HUNTERxHUNTER: NENxIMPACT was included in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-fighting-games-of-2025-off-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most anticipated fighting games of 2025</a>, so look forward to our review in due time.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/epic-games-bans-fortnite-cheater-forces-them-to-apologize-and-give-back-winnings.1111728/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/epic-games-bans-fortnite-cheater-forces-them-to-apologize-and-give-back-winnings/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Epic Games is not letting Fortnite cheaters off the hook, and those caught doing so at the competitive level are getting the strictest punishment: total embarrassment. The punishments levied by Epic are being cheered by the community, with some fans wishing other games would follow suit.</p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-pro-caught-account-sharing-gets-embarrassed-by-epic-games">Fortnite Pro Caught Account Sharing Gets Embarrassed by Epic Games</h2>



<p>A player caught account sharing in Fortnite has been banned from all tournaments by Epic, forced to donate their prize winnings to charity, and had to make an apology video. </p>



<p>By sharing his account with another Fortnite player, Australian pro Morgan “RepulseGod” Bamford unfairly qualified for the 2023 Fortnite Championship Series (FNCS) Grand Finals. In a 30 second description-less video, RepulseGod <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XouE9KalIVA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted</a> his actions, and explained that he has received a permanent ban and has to forfeit his winnings:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Epic took legal action against me and now I’m banned from participating in Fortnite tournaments forever. I also have to pay a monetary settlement, which includes the prize money I received but did not fairly win, which Epic will donate to charity. Cheating in tournaments ruins the fun for the players who earned their spot in tournaments and I apologise to the Fortnite community for my actions. I won’t ever cheat in Fortnite again.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Epic Games <a href="https://x.com/FNCompetitive/status/1891564240604999725" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted this update</a> and a link to the player’s video on their official FNCS account, effectively laying out a warning to anyone else who cheats. In a similar method as Valve took with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/counter-strike-pros-caught-matchfixing-finally-unbanned-after-10-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the iBUYPOWER match fixing scandal</a>, Epic is setting a very high punishment standard in an attempt to deter future cheaters.</p>



<p>Many players online have now seen this from Epic and want to see it implemented in other titles, such as Call of Duty. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-ranked-play-cheaters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The release of Black Ops 6’s ranked mode was plagued by a prominent amount of cheaters</a>, and many would like Activision to take a firmer stance like Epic’s. Since RepulseGod cheated to qualify for tournaments and win actual money, their punishment was more severe, but Call of Duty fans still want to see cheaters shamed like this.</p>



<p>What other games should see this sort of anti-cheat action? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-reportedly-planning-fortnite-roblox-style-ugc-push/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier today, the website DigiDay <a href="https://digiday.com/media/rockstar-games-talks-with-top-metaverse-creators-with-an-eye-on-making-grand-theft-auto-the-next-creator-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Rockstar Games has been meeting with Fortnite and Roblox creators, in addition to existing GTA content creators, about GTA VI and its purported push into user-generated content. The creators would be allowed to modify the game, presumably in the online component, to create wholly custom experiences for their fans.</p>
<p>According to the report, which comes from three anonymous insider sources, the conversations are still at an early stage. In fact, it's unclear if Rockstar would offer a cut of the revenue from their creation, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-is-getting-the-full-unreal-editor-later-this-year-creators-will-be-able-to-monetize/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as is the case in the aforementioned games</a>.</p>
<p>Still, the developer has been making steps towards that direction for a while. The most significant instance was, of course, <a href="https://wccftech.com/previously-banned-gta-5-fivem-and-rdr2-redm-creators-are-now-part-of-rockstar-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the acquisition of Cfx.re</a>, the team behind the exceedingly popular Grand Theft Auto RP FiveM mod.</p>
<p>Pete Basgen, global gaming and esports lead for WPP agency Wavemaker, told DigiDay:</p>
<p><em>It is my firm belief that the reason that they purchased FiveM is exactly that — to spin up a metaversal universe of custom-built experiences, and potentially UGC items, with an attached UGC creator economy. It will essentially occupy that adult-enumerated space at the top of the ecosystem; there’s a very natural place there for people that graduate from Roblox and Minecraft.</em></p>
<p>Chad Mustard, COO of UGC gaming studio JOGO, added:</p>
<p><em>If Rockstar embraces UGC, it’s a game-changer, plain and simple. The demand for creator-driven experiences is already massive, and this could unlock unprecedented opportunities for studios like ours. The economics are proven, the audience is there, and we’re ready to build. This is the moment GTA creators have been waiting for.</em></p>
<p>Perhaps this could explain why, according to the Corsair Gaming CEO at least, GTA VI <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-pc-might-launch-early-next-year-according-to-corsair/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">might be launching sooner than we thought on PC</a>. If Rockstar really intends to push on the metaverse side of the game, it would be better to do it with as wide an audience as possible, especially since UGC and PC are practically synonymous.</p>
<p>It does seem like more developers are embracing user-generated content. Studio Wildcard did the same with ARK: Survival Ascended, opening up premium mods even on consoles. When we <a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-survival-ascended-premium-mods-on-consoles-qa-by-2030-time-spent-on-ugc-will-be-way-bigger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chatted with them</a>, we learned from their partner (Overwolf's CurseForge) that they estimate playtime spent on user-generated content to be much&nbsp;bigger by the end of this decade.</p>
<p>Do you think this would be the right path for GTA VI? Let us know in the comments.</p>

Joining similar crossovers with <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/mtg-x-fallout-mutant-menace-review-and-improvements" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Fallout</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/doctor-who-commander-decks-will-have-50-new-cards-each" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Doctor Who</em></a> are official <em>Final Fantasy</em> Commander decks, bringing iconic characters from the RPG series to the acclaimed card game.</p>

<h2>The <em>Final Fantasy</em> Commander Decks Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official report <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-commander-deck-reveal-spoilers" rel="nofollow">from IGN</a>, Wizards of the Coast have announced several <em>Final Fantasy</em> Commander decks coming to Magic: The Gathering. The release will include a draftable, Standard-legal set alongside four premade decks made of 100 cards. Those cards will include reprints of certain cards featuring Final Fantasy art as well as brand new Commander-format cards.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-commander-deck-character-artwork.jpg?itok=fkcYgrJO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-commander-deck-character-artwork.jpg?itok=FXj942O_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In a slight change in model, the <em>Final Fantasy</em> Commander decks aren't based around certain characters or themes, but on iconic entries of the Final Fantasy franchise.</p>

<p>The first deck, Revival Trance (Red, White, Black), is based on <em>Final Fantasy VI</em> and showcases Terra, the herald of hope. The second, Limit Break (Red, Green, White), is <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>-themed featuring the iconic Cloud Strife. Deck number three, Counter Blitz (Green, White, Blue) is based on <em>Final Fantasy X</em> and the underwater football star, Tidus. The final deck, Scions &amp; Soulcraft (White, Blue, Black) revolves around <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> and Y'shtola from the Shadowbringers expansion.</p>

<p>The report includes an interview with Wizards of the Coast about how they chose to adapt the world of <em>Final Fantasy</em>. Each deck came with its own set of challenges.&nbsp;</p>

<p>How do you translate the expressive but minimal pixel art of <em>Final Fantasy VI</em> into the more expressive painterly style of <em>Magic</em>. When adapting <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>, do you prioritize the PS1 original or the retelling/reimagining/remixing of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em></a>? What storyline or character do you focus on from the sprawling MMO world of <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>?</p>

<p>Principal Narrative Designer Dillon Deveney had some answers to these questions. For <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>, they ultimately decided to capture the spirit of the 1997 original release while taking some aesthetic inspiration from the Remake games. Alternatively, the artwork for <em>Final Fantasy VI</em>&nbsp; was a combination of Yoshitaka Amano's original character concept art and the original sprite artwork.</p>

<p>The <em>Final Fantasy</em> Commander decks will be available June 13.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/elden-ring-nightreign-preview-night-fever<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>might be cursed with an unrepresentative name. Sure, it plays like&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, looks like&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, and even has tons of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s enemies and assets, but if there's one thing I've learned about&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>,&nbsp;it's that this ain't&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>.</p>

<p><em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is very much its own beast. Rather than the careful, methodical exploration of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>- and, indeed, of previous FromSoftware titles (from which you'll <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-dark-souls-enemies-confirmed" rel="nofollow">also spot a few enemies and bosses</a> here) -&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>'s action is fast-paced and frenetic from the off.</p>

<p>I managed to get a few hours with&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>during its recent network test, and what I experienced was fascinating, if initially overwhelming. I'm confident this could become a real hit for Bandai Namco and FromSoftware, even if it might alienate some fans of the original.</p>

<h2>What the Heck Is&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, Anyway?</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-preview-explanation.jpg?itok=lUvGrMFS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-preview-explanation.jpg?itok=_xrLI839 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>isn't the easiest game to figure out to begin with.</figcaption></figure><p>At first glance - and, indeed, even after a few minutes spent running around like a headless chicken in Limveld - it's hard to know exactly what&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is. In essence, it's&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>meets&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/fortnite" rel="nofollow"><em>Fortnite</em></a>, with a dash of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/risk-of-rain-2" rel="nofollow"><em>Risk of Rain 2</em></a>&nbsp;thrown in for good measure.</p>

<p>Don't worry, though; you won't be fighting any of your fellow players, and this isn't a battle royale game. Each round of&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>spans three days, although you'll only actually be exploring the map for two of those days. On the third, you'll fight the boss you selected as your hunt for this session.</p>

<p>In the case of the network test, that boss is Gladius, a three-headed dog you'll battle in an arena that resembles the one in which you fought Starscourge Radahn in an age past. I'm assuming the main game will come with many more beasties to wrangle.</p>

<p>Each session sees you and two other players (it is possible to play solo, but I couldn't do so during the network test) sprinting around Limveld, exploring key locations for loot while fighting whatever monsters and minibosses have taken up residence in those places.</p>

<p>The goal is to level up enough to stand a chance of taking on a bigger miniboss when night falls, and eventually to amass enough levels and gear that you can fight Gladius (or whichever boss you've elected to take on) when the three-day cycle ends.</p>

<p>As you explore, a circle will constantly shrink towards a point on the map, and being outside that circle will cause you to take constant damage, just like in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>. Once the circle has shrunk to its smallest size, the boss will appear at its epicenter.</p>

<p><em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>even has roguelike elements; runs, whether failed or successful, will net you trinkets you can use to add bonuses to your characters that persist between sessions.</p>

<h2><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>Feels Uncanny at First</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-preview-knight.jpg?itok=JSp8YHYB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-preview-knight.jpg?itok=hq4j1Lq5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You might be a little put off by&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>'s paucity of context, but stick with it.</figcaption></figure><p>My first impression of&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>'s gameplay loop was dizzying and confusing. Don't make the mistake of jumping in without checking out the tutorials available in the Roundtable Hold; if you're anything like me, you won't have the faintest idea what's going on, especially if your fellow players insist on sprinting ahead without waiting for you (which they probably will!).</p>

<p>Eventually, you'll get a handle on&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>'s zippy core loop. Get any thoughts of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>out of your head; there is no room for careful, slow exploration here.&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is all about killing as many enemies and looting as much as you can, all while watching that ever-present&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>-esque circle drawing in.</p>

<p>Rather than creating your own character, you'll have access to one of eight archetypes, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.</p>

<p>I spent the most time with Wylder during the network test, simply because his grappling hook allowed me to close distances and zip around the map that much quicker. There should be archetypes for all play styles, though; the Guardian is a slower-paced tank, for instance, while the Recluse slings spells from a distance.</p>

<p>I won't lie: at first, I really thought I was going to hate&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>. I'm a massive fan of the original (as well as FromSoftware's other games), and&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>feels eerie and uncanny to begin with.</p>

<p>It feels like being parachuted into a particularly well-made mod; seeing Limgrave's inhabitants plopped into this space, devoid of context, felt instinctively wrong. When Margit, the Fell Omen himself appeared, I felt despair, not joy; how could this proud, stoic warrior be stripped of his backstory and forced to fight in this narrative-free arena?</p>

<p>Eventually, though, I grasped what&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is trying to do and found myself sinking into it. This isn't meant to replace FromSoftware's lore-heavy action RPG excursions; it's an accompaniment, a side dish, a little extra to tide you over while Hidetaka Miyazaki cooks.</p>

<h2>Gameplay Is King in&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-preview-spider_0.jpg?itok=rNZq4b6g 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-preview-spider_0.jpg?itok=0J27cDEL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is a gameplay-first experience, and that gameplay is... pretty fun, actually.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is all about its frantic gameplay, or at least that's the impression I got in the network test. Very little care seems to have been taken to explain what&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls</em>' Centipede Demon is doing in Limveld; instead, it's all about how you and your team are going to take him down.</p>

<p>Once you've gotten rid of that pesky voice asking why this isn't just more&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, you can start to settle into what&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is, and it turns out that&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is a tremendous amount of fun.</p>

<p>Speeding through Limveld dispatching enemies and grabbing loot without worrying about whether it'll suit your meticulously crafted build feels like cracking&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>wide open and discovering the power fantasy within.</p>

<p>Margit gave me no end of trouble in the base game, but here, my team and I took him down inside a few minutes, despite the crafty extra moves FromSoftware have outfitted him with.</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong; this is still a very challenging experience, but the challenge comes from how much you were able to do inside the time limit you were given rather than from careful observation and mistake punishment.</p>

<p><em>Elden Ring</em>'s core combat remains intact, too. This is still a Soulslike, so if you're an&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>veteran, the basic ideas of the gameplay will be familiar to you, even if the crushing pace of the experience might be overwhelming at first.</p>

<p>The one brand new boss in the network test, the aforementioned Gladius, feels like he could stand toe-to-toe with some of <i>Elden Ring</i>'s better bosses, too. There's even a rather enjoyable moment where FromSoftware nods to the fact that it's specifically designed&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>around three-player excursions.</p>

<h2>I Want to Play More&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-preview-gladius.jpg?itok=UQ_dChOJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-preview-gladius.jpg?itok=vEHCu30J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I want to play more&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>A full&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>excursion, if done right, will probably take you less than two hours, and while I felt like the end couldn't come soon enough when I first started, I was desperate for more by the end.</p>

<p>In many ways, this is one of the most interesting moves FromSoftware could have taken. This is a company known for savvy asset reuse, after all, and&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is arguably the savviest. It's not just reusing visual assets; it's recontextualizing gameplay concepts as well.</p>

<p>I'm very excited to find out what other creations FromSoftware has cooked up for the full game, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nighreign-release-date" rel="nofollow">arrives on May 30th</a>. In the meantime, I'm just sore I can't head back into Limveld for one more fight against Gladius.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/avowed-dawnshore-lighthouse-obsidian-microsoft-xbox-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Avowed </em>is a vast game with some <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/papapishu.bsky.social/post/3lif7buua4s2n" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weirdly complicated progression elements</a> about which the jury’s still out, but I want to praise a moment of pure, perfect simplicity. Near the beginning of the game, you encounter a lighthouse. It calls to you, not via a quest but by virtue of looking really cool and being very tall. It rules.</p><p>The lighthouse lies just off the beaten path of a harbor you arrive in after completing the game’s opening tutorial. Let’s start with the glaringly obvious: It’s a Ghibli-ass lighthouse. That, unto itself, was enough to ensnare me in its gravitational pull. My newly-acquired companion, Kai, was happy to tell me that it’d been abandoned under mysterious circumstances, which only provided additional incentive to climb it.&nbsp;</p><p>This lighthouse is ideally placed in terms of both physical location and when it appears in your journey. By this particular point, you probably haven’t jumped all that much; you’re still coming to grips with how far a regular leap will take you, how much a sprint will add to that, etc. The lighthouse is by no means a complicated climbing puzzle, but it includes just enough dicey jumps to make you tense up every time – especially as you ascend ever higher. It’s quietly thrilling in a way it wouldn’t otherwise be if it came later in the game.&nbsp;</p><p>It also wordlessly conveys a series of important mechanical messages: first and foremost, that there’s gonna be a lot of jumping and clambering in this game! More than you’re maybe used to from others in the genre. But it’s all very intentional. <em>Avowed</em>’s setting feels carefully handcrafted in a way open worlds – often characterized by interminable expanses, map size for map size’s sake – don’t always, and verticality is a big part of that. Each area is denser than it initially appears. You’ve just gotta look up.&nbsp;</p><p>The visual language of said verticality then takes center stage. Ropes dangle from surfaces you can hoist yourself up onto. Nooks and crannies give way to alternate jumping paths which lead to loot and other goodies, but you’ve gotta pause for a beat and allow your eyes to happen upon them. And, most importantly, chests and other collectibles make a shimmering noise when you’re near them – a fact you may not have internalized in the tutorial area, but which is on full display as you make your way into the combat-free lighthouse’s upper reaches.</p><p>Then you reach the top, and a couple things happen: 1) You find a treasure map, which introduces you to one of the game’s many quest types. 2) You take in the view, which is exquisite.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Obsidian</figcaption></figure><p>It’s a moment not unlike what you’d encounter in an <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> game, except no map markers told you to go there, nor was climbing itself functionally automated. Similarly, I didn’t take in the sights and gain a clearer understanding of the map’s scope because a cutscene grabbed me by the digital eyeballs and said “Look over there!!!” I did so because I’d put real effort into reaching that point, and I decided that I was going to make the most of it. Also, <em>Avowed</em>’s art design is so gorgeous that I found myself compelled to try viewing it from another angle, to test if it could maintain its picturesque quality. It passed with flying colors.&nbsp;</p><p>My business with the lighthouse seemingly finished, I turned my attention to the tall task of getting down. I didn’t really want to retrace my hops, skips, and jumps if I could avoid it, and then I saw precisely what I was looking for: a slight outcropping with some ropes dangling over the edge. Again, in this instance <em>Avowed </em>adds back a small amount of friction that games like <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> remove: No tutorial voice told me to take a leap of faith. In fact, as I gingerly peered out over the ledge, I saw the ocean, but also a whole lot of cliffside that I wasn’t sure even a full-speed sprint jump would allow me to clear.</p><p>But I had to try. And so I ran, leaped, and plummeted. On the way down, my character let out one of the least dignified screams I’ve ever heard from a fantasy hero. Then he crashed into the water, rattled but blessedly intact. In real life, I laughed out loud, exhaling the anxiety I’d kept pent up during both the climb and the descent.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s a palpable human touch to <em>Avowed</em>’s environment design. I’m nearly certain that this is the exact experience a person wanted me to have – the full range of emotions they wanted me to feel – while maintaining the illusion that I’d happened upon all of this myself, in the course of my own exploration, and made each granular decision of my own accord. It is, like climbing an abandoned lighthouse that’s been partially reclaimed by nature, a tricky balancing act. But <em>Avowed </em>both takes the leap and sticks the landing.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/viktor-antonov-art-director-rip"><h3>RIP Viktor Antonov</h3></a><p>Antonov was one of the driving forces behind the art style of Half-Life 2 and Dishonored</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Today, Warhorse Studios <a href="https://x.com/KingdomComeRPG/status/1891487774571626904" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> via the official Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 social channels that the game has sold over two million units in the first two weeks on the market. It had only taken one day to <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sells-1-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">break one million units sold</a>, although that was obviously with the help of pre-orders.</p>
<p>We don't have an official platform breakdown of the sales. However, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1771300/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Steam data</a>, owners on the largest PC platform are estimated between 1.46 million and 1.72 million, making up the vast majority of the user base. When it comes to the concurrent player peak, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 has reached 256K concurrent Steam users, which is just enough to get it on the All-Time Top 50 chart ahead of Team Fortress 2.</p>
<p>During <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ_GnoOjxU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last week's live-streamed Q3 2024/25 earnings call</a>, Embracer Group CEO Lars Wingefors publicly praised developer Warhorse for their achievement, which is surpassing the publisher's expectations:</p>
<p><em>I'm just so happy and pleased with Warhorse and what they have executed. They <a href="https://wccftech.com/thq-nordic-kingdom-come-deliverance-warhorse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">joined Embracer in 2019</a>, they had their vision to create a sequel of a fantastic game and we have been allowing them to pull off their vision that they wanted to do and have given them more time and the freedom to really create a masterpiece. The sales are exceeding our expectations and even my a bit higher expectations, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is actually achieving that, so I think it's a 'well done'. I'm really happy to see it. Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, and the first one for that matter as well, will continue generating substantial revenues for us for many years to come.</em></p>
<p>Indeed, Warhorse is <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-will-get-official-mod-support-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planning</a> to release mod tools soon, which should undoubtedly increase the game's longevity on PC. Moreover, there's a whole 2025 roadmap that they already <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-gets-2025-post-launch-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">communicated</a>: barbers, horse racing, and Hardcore Mode in Spring; the Brushes with Death premium DLC in Summer; the Legacy of the Forge premium DLC in Autumn; and the Mysteria Ecclesiae premium DLC in Winter.</p>
<p>For our detailed review of the game, featuring a perfect score from Chris Wray, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">head to this article</a>.</p>
