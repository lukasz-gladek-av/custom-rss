            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-announces-their-first-chaos-vault-drop-for-magic-gathering<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has announced a new Secret Lair drop for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>. But this drop isn't a crossover with <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-magic-gathering-marvel-crossover-details-revealed-including-new-secret-lair-and" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Marvel</a> or packed with <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-pixel-perfect-secret-lair-brings-retro-vibes-to-table" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">retro game vibes</a>. It is part of a new experiment being conducted by the tabletop company, a Secret Lair spin-off known as the Chaos Vault.</p>



<p>The announcement of the Chaos Vault Secret Lair drop was understated. There is a single <a href="https://x.com/MTGSecretLair/status/1866177659492843768" rel="nofollow">social media post</a> on X (formerly Twitter) from the official <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> account. It simply reads, "The Vault Opens. Chaos Reigns." in block capitals alongside artwork and a link.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/chaos-vault-estrid-the-masked-screenshot.jpg?itok=d-w0jhuf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/chaos-vault-estrid-the-masked-screenshot.jpg?itok=SoLDXy7e 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The <a href="https://secretlair.wizards.com/us/product/1107223/the-fairest-drop-of-all-foil-edition" rel="nofollow">store page</a> has a bit more information. The drop is called The Fairest Drop of All and the description states that it will operate differently from other Secret Lair drops.</p>

<p>First, there is only one version of the drop available: in foil. Second, orders are limited to one per customer, possibly to deter mass purchases by scalpers. Third, the drop is noticeably cheaper compared to other foil Secret Lair drops, being sold at an MSRP of $24.99.</p>

<p>As for what is in the Chaos Vault drop, it contains four foil reversible cards: <em>Estrid's Invocation</em>, <em>Steely Resolve</em>, <em>Estrid, the Masked,</em> and <em>Tuvasa, the Sunlit</em>. All four cards feature alternative artwork by artists Jessica Hische, Simen Meyer, Yehrin Tong, and Teagan White.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/chaos-vault-steely-resolve-artwork.jpg?itok=5X9oD2Ks 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/chaos-vault-steely-resolve-artwork.jpg?itok=KamiZSwX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As for the artwork, they all appear to be elaborate titles presented in an Art Deco style. The most elaborate of the cards is <em>Tuvasa, the Sunlit, </em>which gets the full profile treatment.</p>

<p>It is unclear at time of writing if this is the Chaos Vault drop of many. If the name is any indication, the artstyle or cards chosen may not be consistent either. As such, the appeal of these drops may hinge on novelty, scarcity, and fear of missing out. Only time will tell just how chaotic these drops will get.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-updates-will-end-with-season-4/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Rocksteady is officially ending support for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. In a post on the <a href="https://www.suicidesquadgame.com/en-us/community/season-4-deep-dive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game’s official website</a>, it was announced that Season 4 will see the final updates for Suicide Squad moving forward. </p>



<p>Those updates include the addition of Deathstroke along with a new medieval-themed Elseworld, new gear, and an offline mode. The offline mode will be available on December 10 alongside the rest of Season 4 episode 7.</p>



<p>“Offline mode will allow you to experience content released for the game, including the main story campaign and all seasonal story mission content, without an internet connection,” Rocksteady said. “To access Offline mode, you can either create a new profile by starting from the beginning of the game or create a copy of your existing Online profile, allowing you to jump in with all of your progress.”</p>



<p>The final Suicide Squad update will come with Episode 8 in January 2025. That wraps up the promised full year of updates for the game from Rocksteady and Warner Bros. Games.</p>



<p>Despite the updates ending, Rocksteady says that all online features will remain available, including online co-op and all previous seasonal/episodic content. It’s unclear if critical support updates will still come after regular updates are over.</p>



<p>The ending of updates for Suicide Squad brings to a close a controversial era for Rocksteady and Warner Bros. Games. After being delayed into 2024, the game launched with issues that causes it to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rocksteady-pulls-suicide-squad-just-one-hour-into-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">temporarily pulled in early access</a>. From there, Warner Bros. Games revealed that not only did the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-reportedly-says-suicide-squad-fell-short-of-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">perform below expectations</a>, but it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/suicide-squad-cost-warner-bros-200-million-in-revenue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cost them $200 million</a> in revenue.</p>



<p>Rocksteady even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rocksteady-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">underwent a round of layoffs</a> after the launch of the game.</p>



<p>What do you think of updates to Suicide Squad ending after Season 4? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

            <p>
Seven months after announcing development of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-development-has-finally-wound-down-after-three-and-a-half-years">officially ended</a> - and a little over a year since its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-getting-fully-functioning-metro-system-in-next-weeks-21-update">last major 2.1 release</a> - CD Projekt has revealed its open-world sci-fi RPG is getting more "cool stuff" in a suprise new update soon.
</p>
<p>
CD Projekt <a href="https://x.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1866150925678657589">broke the news on social media</a>, revealing Cyberpunk 2077's 2.2 update will be detailed more thoroughly in a <a href="https://t.co/Pd1ztyTLTu">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://t.co/TOS9HhqLi9">YouTube</a> livestream airing Tuesday, 10th December, at 4pm GMT. As to what the update will include, that remains a mystery, but global community director Marcin Momot went some way toward managing expectations in a <a href="https://x.com/Marcin360/status/1866161075281863141">separate post</a>.
</p>
<p>
"A lot of questions about whether <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> support and NG+ are coming with Cyberpunk 2077 Patch 2.2," he wrote. "The answer is no. We do have some other cool stuff in the oven and we'll talk about it tomorrow during the stream — we hope you'll like it too!"

<p>
This isn't the first time CD Projekt has poured cold water on fan hopes for a PS5 Pro spruce-up, of course. The studio confirmed it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-says-no-plans-for-cyberpunk-2077-upgrade-patch-on-ps5-pro">had "no plans" to release an update for Sony's console</a> back in November. But if PS5 Pro and New Game Plus are out, what could 2.2 bring?
</p><p>
It's likely it'll primarily focus on fixes and minor quality of life updates for issues identified during CD Projekt's work on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-is-bringing-cyberpunk-2077-to-macs-early-next-year">Cyberpunk 2077's Mac port</a>, which arrives next year. Anything more substantial seems doubtful, given the majority of the studio is currently focused on its new Witcher game - now officially <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-has-entered-full-scale-production-cd-projekt-confirms">in "full-scale production"</a> - but we'll know more tomorrow.

<p>It could be a matter of days until we’re treated to the second Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer from Rockstar Games, and the community is<strong> </strong>writhing in anticipation. We’ve heard nothing for more than a year, since the launch of the game’s initial trailer, and fans are <strong>starving </strong>for more GTA 6 content from the famed developer.</p>



<p>Recently, ‘GTA VI’ was spotted on the PlayStation store available to add to wishlists, but it’s not the game you’re hoping for.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-art-of-creative-excuses">‘The Art of Creative Excuses’</h2>



<p><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10013590" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Grand Taking Ages VI</a> is a satirical title from Violarte that’s set to launch in May 2025, per a listing on the PlayStation store. The game’s presence was spotted recently by eagle-eyed users, and while it seems unlikely it’s <strong>real</strong>, it’s accompanied by a product description that’s worth a read.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The most anticipated game about making the most anticipated game!</p>



<div><p>You’re now in charge of the biggest gaming disaster… Or masterpiece?</p><p>Run your dream game studio while juggling angry fans, corporate chaos, and endless delays. Fight your way through gaming conventions, dodge ruthless journalists, and master the art of creative excuses.</p></div>
</blockquote>



<p>At first blush, Grand Taking Ages VI (GTA VI) reads like a game dev simulator – which already exists in a few forms. The bio stresses that Grand Taking Ages VI is inspired ‘by real gaming industry events’.</p>



<p>It’ll feature a rags-to-riches story that sees players start in a ‘tiny apartment’ before expanding and growing as their creations succeed on the open market. </p>



<p>It’s impossible to tell if the game is real to any extent – and it probably isn’t – but it’s a funny jab at the wait we’re all struggling with where GTA 6 is concerned.</p>



<p>It’s also far from being the first copycat or parody game to surface on the PlayStation Store. Most recently, a rip-off title mimicking Gray Zone Warfare appeared on the PS Store.</p>

<p>Nobody wants to go up against Grand Theft Auto 6.</p>



<p>The upcoming open-world epic from Rockstar Games is poised to be the biggest single-title launch of all time, and that’s enough to strike fear into the hearts of competing publishers, per a recent report from Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier. It was claimed by Schreier that some competing publishers are preparing to set their own launch dates based on GTA 6’s ultimate release window.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-can-t-compete">Can’t Compete</h2>



<p>Presently, Grand Theft Auto 6 is set to be released in the fall of 2025, which gives it around a three-month window in which it can drop. Typically, GTA games are released in or around October, so it’s a safe bet that GTA 6<strong>, if the schedule is adhered to, </strong>will be released globally in October 2025.</p>



<p>However, some folks in the industry are anticipating a delay.</p>



<p>In a report published in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-09/-gta-6-release-date-will-decide-much-of-the-2025-game-calendar?embedded-checkout=true&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, Jason Schreier explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Anticipation is so high that some competing game publishers are waiting as long as possible to commit to their release dates for the fall, according to people familiar with their deliberations who asked not to be identified because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly.</p>



<p>The publishers want to see whether&nbsp;<em>GTA 6</em>&nbsp;will make its deadline or slip into 2026, these people say, and they’re determined to <strong>keep their own games far, far away.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nobody wants to set a release date for that three-month window between September and November because there’s the chance it could clash with GTA 6. It’ll take a monumental powerhouse of a game to compete with Rockstar Games’ newest iteration in the legendary franchise, and most publishers likely think it’s not worth attempting.</p>



<p>If Rockstar Games or Take-Two were to reveal a delay for GTA 6 tomorrow, then it’s fair game for these publishers to announce their games for fall 2025 – happy days.</p>



<p>Do you anticipate GTA 6 being delayed into 2026? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

Regardless, Ubisoft has previously said that it's not afraid of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-does-not-scare-ubisoft-ceo-says/1100-6520931/" data-ref-id="1100-6520931">dropping games in the vicinity of GTA titles</a>, and that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-gta-6s-release-doesnt-scare-ubisoft/1100-6525143/" data-ref-id="1100-6525143">a big release like Grand Theft Auto 6  is good for the industry</a>.</p><p>Rockstar does have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-scheduled-for-2025-but-rockstar-has-a-history-of-delays/1100-6519700/" data-ref-id="1100-6519700">a history of delaying its AAA titles</a> dating back to 2007. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/grand-theft-auto-iv-review/1900-6202100/" data-ref-id="1900-6202100">Grand Theft Auto 4</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/red-dead-redemption-review/1900-6262899/" data-ref-id="1900-6262899">Red Dead Redemption</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/grand-theft-auto-v-review/1900-6414475/" data-ref-id="1900-6414475">Grand Theft Auto 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/red-dead-redemption-2-review-wild-wild-west/1900-6417019/" data-ref-id="1900-6417019">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> all slipped from their originally scheduled release windows. The Bloomberg report notes that GTA 6 "has already missed multiple deadlines" before Rockstar declared it was on schedule for 2025. That doesn't necessarily mean that GTA 6 will miss that release window, but it wouldn't be out of the ordinary if it happens. The report also suggested that "Rockstar is asking its writers to be less crude toward transgender people and other minorities."</p><p>Earlier this year, Take-Two shared its belief that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-probably-doesnt-matter-anticipation-reaches-fever-pitch-take-two/1100-6523548/" data-ref-id="1100-6523548">it doesn't matter when Grand Theft Auto 6</a> is released. GTA 5 is among the best-selling video games in history with more than 205 million copies sold since its initial release in 2013. Anticipation for the sequel has only grown since the first trailer for GTA 6 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-gta-6-trailer-was-released-one-year-ago-today-and-fans-are-still-waiting-for-anything-more/1100-6528248/" data-ref-id="1100-6528248">debuted just over one year ago</a>. The lengthy delay between GTA 5 and GTA 6 also inspired a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-parody-game-shows-up-on-playstation-store/1100-6528314/" data-ref-id="1100-6528314">recently listed parody game</a>, which may or may not be a real title.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/moxie-robot-ai-dying-llm-embodied<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>AI company Embodied announced this week that they would be shutting down following financial difficulties and a sudden withdrawal of funding. Embodied’s main product was <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/playing-and-learning-with-moxie-the-ai-based-robot-for-kids" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Moxie</a>, an AI-powered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_robot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">social robot</a> specifically made with <a href="https://moxierobot.com/pages/robot-for-autistic-child" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">autistic children in mind.</a> The robot itself cost $799.00 and now, following the closure of Embodied, it will cease to function.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Credit: Embodied, Inc.</figcaption></figure><p>Moxie is a small blue robot with a big expressive face straight out of a Pixar movie. The robot used large language models in the cloud to answer questions, talk, and function. With Embodied out of business, the robot will soon no longer be able to make those calls. This outcome was always likely – any cloud based device is subject to the health of the company and LLMs are not cheap to run. This has actually happened before <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP8NShFU7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with a company called Vector</a>. But the shocking part is that this was not an old device, it was fairly recent, expensive, and still being sold.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Affirmations with Moxie" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ju9yLXoR-3Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>In a <a href="https://moxierobot.com/pages/closing-faqs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Closing FAQ</a> emailed to users and posted on their website, Embodied made it clear that Moxie was likely to stop working within days. No refunds will be given and if you bought the device on a payment plan it’s out of their hands. No repairs and service can be offered and the company has no clear plan for who, if anybody, will take it over. Short of a miracle, customers will be stuck holding the bag.</p><p>The response from Moxie owners seems fairly emotional. Parents have to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MoxieRobot/comments/1h621ag/how_i_told_my_kiddo_that_moxie_was_going_away/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">explain to their kids that Moxie is functionally dying</a>, although the company has “included a letter from the G.R.L. (Global Robotics Lab) to help guide this conversation in an age-appropriate way”. There are videos on TikTok of children and adults crying and asking Moxie what’s going to happen now. On some level I understand that reaction – even outside of dropping 800 bucks on this thing, it’s like watching a friend die. I could see a future in which another owner takes over or even one where these devices are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MoxieRobot/comments/1ha2b7s/currently_working_on_a_replacement_ai_for_when/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hacked for local operation</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>But relying on large language models to socialize children, particularly neuroatypical ones, seems like a bad idea on every single level. I do not think any child should be learning language and social interactions from an LLM, let alone children with special needs. What’s more, this brings to bear a larger issue of the AI bubble: these devices are costly to run and Silicon&nbsp; alley has been attempting to outrun or rationalize that fact. And when this entire thing comes tumbling down, what happens to the people who decided to develop ill-advised relationships with AI?&nbsp;</p><div><figure><div><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@veechip/video/7441801078485617962" data-video-id="7441801078485617962" data-embed-from="oembed"> <section> <a target="_blank" title="@veechip" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@veechip?refer=embed">@veechip</a> <p>I asked Moxie about his creators going out of buisness.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/avowed-lets-you-start-most-quests-however-you-want-says-dev/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Avowed developer Obsidian Entertainment made sure that players will have the opportunity to start most quests in multiple ways. Obsidian's Environment Region Designer Berto Ritger <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/almost-every-quest-in-rpg-avowed-can-be-started-in-multiple-ways-we-want-to-just-constantly-foster-that-sense-of-exploration-wanderlust/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> this in an interview with GamesRadar.</p>
<p><em>I think almost every, if not every, quest in the game has it more than one way to start it. You can do things out of order and pick up items and give them to people that want them, or kill a character or whatever, like, you can play things out of order. You can come at a dungeon or vice versa, from a different direction than you normally would. And we want you to be able to do that just based on however you naturally progress through the world. We want to just constantly foster that sense of exploration, wanderlust and just getting lost pleasantly.</em></p>
<p>In my <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-hands-on-preview-eora-from-a-whole-new-perspective/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hands-on preview with Avowed</a>, I didn't notice this. However, it's entirely possible I may have simply missed it, as there weren't that many quests to begin with. It's certainly great to be able to start quests in any order - for example, if you happen to find a quest item before you've picked up the quest, you can complete it right away.</p>
<p>That said, after playing around three hours of the game, I feel it best to temper expectations: this isn't an open world that lets you explore as much as something like The Witcher 3 or The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. However, there is definitely some room for exploration, even in the starting area. Ritger had previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-dev-says-missable-content-is-core-to-what-makes-rpgs-special/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commented</a> that one of the trademarks of roleplaying games is missable content. It makes them special, as players feel like they're rewarded for exploring the game world thoroughly.</p>
<p>Avowed is slated to launch on February 18 for PC and Xbox Series S|X. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-wasnt-delayed-because-it-was-in-a-bad-shape-phil-spencer-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> it was delayed merely to give it more space out of the busy Holiday season, while the game itself was largely complete.</p>

Currently, few characters are as chaotic as Jeff the Land Shark, the strategist hero who is, at a glance, just a silly little guy. However, as <em>Marvel Rivals </em>players have learned, this happy dude is actually one of the biggest menaces in the game, and god, I hope NetEase keeps him like this forever.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Jeff is a “strategist,” the <em>Marvel Rivals </em>equivalent of a support hero. Most of the time he sprays water from his mouth to patch up teammates and leaves healing-infused bubbles around the battlefield for players to walk through and recover some of their HP. However, it’s his ultimate that has become the bane of most players’ existence. “It’s Jeff!” creates a sizable whirlpool on the battlefield, which Jeff circles before devouring any player inside the area of effect. From here, he can do one of a few things. He can chew on them as he swims around, doing small damage over time. He can spit them out, displacing them. Or, he can do what most players have learned to do and send them off the side of the map.</p><p>At first, my experience with hungry Jeffs was that players would swallow several opponents and then spit them off the map and into a chasm. As a Star-Lord main, this was usually not that big of a deal, as I could just fly right back to safety. However, as more players have used this strategy, Jeff players have wised up and realized that they’ll get more value diving off the side of the map themselves while their foes are still trapped than they will by just spitting them out and risking them returning to safety. It has become such a foolproof strategy that seemingly every Jeff player is utilizing it, and everyone else wants the land shark’s blood.</p><p>While that’s the most common strategy now, sometimes there isn’t a hole nearby, and some players are using Jeff’s ultimate as a way to throw a team off an objective or to set up other more devastating attacks, like grouping together several foes to toss them into Scarlet Witch’s explosive ultimate. Whatever strategy Jeff players are using, the character’s destructive power contrasted with his cute, unassuming demeanor has made him the center of so many jokes in the game’s community just days after launch.</p><p>We still don’t know how NetEase will balance <em>Marvel Rivals </em>in the future, but there’s part of me that hopes it stays this messy, unpolished hero shooter and “unfair,” “toxic” nonsense like Jeff’s ultimate stays in the game. Ultimately, it’ll hinge on what the studio wants for the game. Does it want <em>Marvel Rivals </em>to become a big esports sensation or does it want to keep appealing to the casual player who isn’t getting sweaty and just wants to slam their superhero toys against each other? The latter is preferable to me at this point, and the chaos of Jeff the Land Shark is one of the best examples of it.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-is-developing-an-extraction-shooter-gamemode-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1056159/</guid>

<p>New leaks suggest that Epic Games and Fortnite are working on a new extraction shooter gamemode.</p>



<p><span>The news comes from Fortnite leaker and data miner&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Loolo_WRLD</a>&nbsp;on X (formerly Twitter), who revealed that despite some rumors suggesting that the gam</span>e mode is canceled, it is, in fact, still in development.</p>



<p>While it’s unclear what the game would entail in the Fortnite universe, it will likely follow almost every other extraction shooter in the market with its game loop. Drop into a map, gather resources, extract, and repeat.<a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD"></a></p>



<p>Loolo_WRLD was careful to point out that “things might change,” as is the case with all leaks, so we’ll have to wait and see if the gamemode comes to fruition.</p>



<p>According to leakers, the game mode is currently under development under the codename “Arnold.” </p>



<p>Last week, new rumors surfaced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-og-has-up-to-90-bots-per-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite OG Has Up to 90% Bots Per Game</a> for lower-skilled players. Epic Games has yet to comment officially on the addition of bots and skill-based matchmaking in Fortnite, but if there is an official announcement, we’ll be sure to update this article.</p>

<p>Counter-Strike is one of the most iconic PC titles in the history of gaming. The definitive first-person tactical shooter is synonymous with PC gaming, and has been since the first game released in 2000. Even now, following the release of Counter-Strike 2 in 2023, the series is still a dominant force on computers.</p>



<p>Many multiplayer shooters find success appealing to player bases outside of PC though. Has Counter-Strike finally done the same?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-counter-strike-only-on-pc">Is Counter-Strike Only on PC?</h2>



<p>Counter-Strike 2 has only been officially released on PC. The lack of an official version for players on Mac is surprising, given that the game’s predecessor Counter-Strike: Global Offensive did in fact have official Mac support. CS2 is “playable” on Mac, but not in an official capacity.</p>



<p>CS2 is not available on any console either, though CS:GO still appears to be playable on the older generation. CS:GO released for Xbox 360 and PS3 when it came out in 2013. CS:GO was replaced by CS2 on PC when the current game launched last year, but the Xbox 360 version <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/csgo-xbox-360/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remains online</a>, at least as recently as September 2023.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The game is also playable on Steam Deck, but it is not optimized for Valve’s handheld device. The CS2 Steam Deck compatibility rating states that it shows mouse and keyboard icons, as well as small in-game text that may be difficult to read on a smaller screen.</p>



<p>CS2’s launch without a console version indicates that it is probably not a huge priority for Valve at this time. However, Valve’s competitor Riot eventually <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-consoles-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released a console version of VALORANT</a> years after its launch, so it wouldn’t be unheard of if Valve did the same.</p>



<p>Do you wish CS2 would come out on something else than PC? Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> developer Pocket Pair has released an update for the creature-catching survival game removing the ability to summon creatures by throwing Pokéball-style Pal Spheres - all as its continues to fight Nintendo and The Pokémon Company's patent infringement lawsuit.
</p>
<p>
As detailed in Palworld's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1623730/view/4477236636060484669?l=english">brisk v0.3.11 patch notes</a>, Pocket Pal's latest update means it's no longer possible to summon a captured creature to a specific spot by aiming and throwing a Pal Sphere. Instead, Pals are now summoned directly next to players when Pal Spheres are held out. Additionally, the UI reticle is now only displayed while aiming.
</p>
<p>
Although Pocket Pair is yet to provide a reason for the changes, it's notable the update arrives amid the studio's ongoing legal battle with Nintendo and The Pokémon Company. Nintendo announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">suing Pocket Pair for infringement of "multiple" patents</a> back in September, and it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-seek-injunction-against-palworld-plus-fine-and-damages-developer-says">later confirmed</a> the lawsuit is targeting three patents in particular. These primarily cover throwing an object in a specific direction to either summon a battle character or to capture a creature in the field - mechanics Palworld shared with Pokémon at launch.

<p>
Nintendo is seeking an injunction against Palworld, as well as a fine of 10m yen (around £50k), and "late payment damages". However, Pocket Pair has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-vows-to-fight-nintendo-lawsuit-on-behalf-of-fans-and-indie-developers">vowed to fight Nintendo's claims</a>, insisting it would "continue to assert our position in this case through future legal proceedings". There's been no official confirmation today's changes are related to the lawsuit, but Eurogamer has contacted Pocket Pair for comment.
</p>
<p>
Regardless, Palworld's development continues, and Pocket Pair has teased it'll have some sort of presence during this week's The Game Awards. "You won’t want to miss it!", the studio wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1866170665101152345">message shared on social media</a>.

<p>Path of Exile 2, Grinding Games’ latest action RPG, was going to be a free-to-play title. However, you need to pay $30 to play the game in early access right now. So when does Path of Exile 2 actually become free-to-play? The short answer is when the developers decide to remove it from early access.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-path-of-exile-2-early-access-end-nbsp">When Does Path of Exile 2 Early Access End?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Currently, there is no concrete end date for Path of Exile 2’s early access. However, the developers have provided an estimated period in the game’s <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3587981" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FAQ section</a>. The answer to how long the early access will run is “As long as needed, we expect at least 6 months.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the developers’ estimated window, Path of Exile 2 will seemingly become free to play by June 2025. However, this is not a confirmed window, and as the developers have stated, “as long as needed,” they could take longer or even finish earlier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the moment, you must pay a minimum of $30 to play Path of Exile 2’s early access on Steam, Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. Check out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-can-you-play-path-of-exile-2-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">where to play the game in early access</a> here.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>There’s a lot to love about the PS5 DualSense controller, but there’s also one big oversight--it doesn’t use Hall Effect joysticks. That means it can--and often does--succumb to joystick drift over time, which is less than ideal for a $75 gamepad. Thankfully, Hyperkin has just released a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DN8T9KJW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5 Hall Effect Joystick Replacement Kit</a>, allowing you to <strong>replace both sticks for just $16</strong>.

The main hurdle is soldering, though you’ll also have to use a screwdriver to calibrate its positioning. That means novice modders should steer clear of this operation or ensure they have a professional game shop nearby that can help with the installation.</p>                      </div><p>Hyperkin's replacement joysticks are rated for 5 million rotations and thanks to the way the Hall Effect sensors work, they won't drift over time like the DualSense's base sticks can. At just $16, these are a much wiser investment than buying a new controller--assuming you have the necessary skill to install them.</p><p>If you don't wat to wait for Hyperkin's PS5 joystick replacement kit to restock, another option is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AKNES-Electromagnetic-Replacement-PS5-Controller/dp/B0DHWWF218?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">AKNES GuliKit TMR Electromagnetic Joystick Replacement Kit</a>, which is currently in stock and available for $18.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/forever-skies-co-op-launch-available-today-huge-overhaul-added-in-new-update/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As of today, the co-op update for Forever Skies is officially out and will allow players to group up in teams of four to explore the vast world that the game has to offer. All PC players will be able to play together with the co-op update, where you can work together to gather supplies, fight for survival, and help build up a fully customizable airship to help each other survive on the toxic, post-apocalyptic Earth. For those interested in the game, Far From Home is offering a<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1641960/Forever_Skies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> limited-time discount</a> on Forever Skies on Steam until January 2.</p>
<p>Of course, co-op is not the only thing that has been added to this game, as they have taken player feedback to heart and have reworked some of the key elements in the game, as well as added new content to keep it fresh and exciting for anyone who is joining the game in Early Access. As Early Access continues, new features will be added to the game. For the latest update, that, of course, includes co-op. Also, the gameplay loop has been overhauled in terms of survival, progression, and exploration, allowing players to get a fresh experience that doesn't cause them to feel too samey after playing the game for a while.</p>
<p><iframe title="Forever Skies | World Evolved &amp; Co-op Update Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uHq8D-gxoWE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>To make that possible, they have made substantial world layout redesigns, including overhauled location designs. There will now also be dynamic random encounters to keep you on your toes, whether you're surviving by yourself or teaming up with friends. There are now new additional enemy threats as well that you will have to learn to fight off to keep yourself safe.</p>
<p>For those who enjoy easter eggs from other games, you'll be able to discover new artifacts that have themed items from Planet Crafter, Pacific Drive, Frostpunk 2, and Medieval Dynasty as a fun little addition to the game.</p>
<p>Of course, this isn't all that has been added to the game, as there are also new tools and devices that the players can research and build for themselves, which will allow new ways to progress through the game. This includes new resources that you'll be able to utilize in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>"Launching co-op mode is a huge milestone for us. Forever Skies was built with an emphasis on immersion and exploration, and we believe that experiencing this world with friends adds a new layer of excitement and depth," says Andrzej Blumenfeld, Creative Director at Far From Home.</p>
<p>Forever Skies is currently available on PC, with a single-player demo available to play now on PlayStation 5. Forever Skies is s<a href="https://wccftech.com/forever-skies-full-release-delayed-to-2025-extending-early-access-period/">et to launch from Early Access in early 2025</a> on PC and PlayStation 5.</p>
