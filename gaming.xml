            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-beta-zombies/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>As someone who spent countless hours playing through the round-based Zombies game mode in past Call of Duty titles, learning about its return in Black Ops 6 had me more excited than the campaign and multiplayer combined. Like many of you, I was ecstatic to hop in and play Zombies, first and foremost, but is it available? Does the Black Ops 6 beta have Zombies?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-zombies-mode-in-the-black-ops-6-beta">Is Zombies Mode in the Black Ops 6 Beta?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately,<strong> the Black Ops 6 beta does not include Zombies</strong>. The beta period—Early Access and Open Beta—will only feature the competitive multiplayer mode. That means anyone most excited about playing the co-op Zombies mode or the single-player campaign must wait until the game’s official launch in October.</p>



<p>Of course, there’s always a chance that Activision runs a Zombies beta, but that seems unlikely. Its primary focus is most definitely on the multiplayer side of things.</p>



<p>That said, there were rumors not too long ago—nothing we can corroborate—that Zombies would launch a week early. If that happens, you’ll know where to find me in mid-October!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-modes-does-the-black-ops-6-beta-offer">What Modes Does the Black Ops 6 Beta Offer?</h2>



<p>The Black Ops 6 beta proves somewhat limited. It features only a handful of maps, with many fan favorites, such as Skyline, taking center stage. But regarding the beta’s multiplayer modes, you can play:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Team Deathmatch</strong></li>



<li><strong>Domination</strong></li>



<li><strong>Hardpoint</strong></li>



<li><strong>Faceoff</strong></li>



<li><strong>Kill Order</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>From firsthand experience with the beta, I can say that all the sweatiest players wind up in Domination or Hardpoint. I had the most fun playing Team Deathmatch.</p>



<hr>



<p>After spending some time in the game’s competitive multiplayer modes, I can safely say the XM4 is one of my all-time favorite weapons in modern Call of Duty. Here’s a look at all of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xm4-unlocks-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XM4 unlocks</a>!</p>

<p>There are numerous questions surrounding access to the Black Ops 6 beta, as Activision and Microsoft somehow made the entire event somewhat confusing and convoluted. You can pre-order the game to gain access, but there are other ways to play in the multiplayer beta. So, can you play the Black Ops 6 beta with Xbox Game Pass?</p>



<h2 id="h-does-xbox-game-pass-give-you-access-to-the-black-ops-6-beta">Does Xbox Game Pass Give You Access to the Black Ops 6 Beta?</h2>



<p><strong>If you subscribe to Xbox Game Pass, you’re in luck because you can access the Black Ops 6 beta</strong>. Three specific monthly plans offer access: Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass PC, and Game Pass Console. If you subscribe to any of these monthly plans, you’ll immediately receive access to the multiplayer beta, which you can download from the Game Pass App.</p>



<p>Oh, and yes, this includes early beta access, not just the Black Ops 6 open beta. With Game Pass, you’ll get the opportunity to play alongside everyone who received a code through giveaways and those who pre-ordered the game, starting on August 30!</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-the-black-ops-6-open-beta">When is the Black Ops 6 Open Beta?</h2>



<p>First and foremost, the Early Access beta period runs from Friday, August 30, to Wednesday, September 4. After that, the multiplayer servers will close down briefly, allowing for maintenance and whatever else Activision must complete before the open beta begins. The open beta runs from <strong>Friday, September 6, to Monday, September 9</strong>. It’s a short beta period, running the span of a single weekend, but that should offer everyone a chance to test out the game’s competitive multiplayer modes in earnest.</p>

<p>We’re having a fantastic time with the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 beta so far, though <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/use-your-knife-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wielding a knife</a> is proving troublesome to many players who want to race about the arena with a melee weapon!</p>

<p>I don’t know why, but I always prefer the early firearms in Call of Duty—the weapons you receive a few levels into the game or those unlocked for you by default. They’re often the most versatile, especially when unlocking additional attachments. In Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, there’s one rifle that stands the test of time, and we’re going to explore all of the XM4 unlocks here and now!</p>



<h2 id="h-xm4-unlocks-in-call-of-duty-black-ops-6">XM4 Unlocks in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</h2>

<p>Of the many weapons available in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, the XM4 offers some of the most extensive customization. You can turn it from a stock weapons platform to a highly modified, special operations-level weapon that should see you through most of the game’s player ranks. Here’s a complete rundown of the XM4 unlocks in the game currently!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/31/24232314/star-wars-outlaws-ubisoft-open-world-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There was a moment in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24230628/star-wars-outlaws-review-ps5-xbox-pc">Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft’s <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a> when I was scouring the depths of a creepy cave, just after finishing a dogfight in space and winning a card game in a boozy cantina, that the game clicked for me. The usual Ubisoft drudgery, where icons on maps become weights on the brain, was gone. Instead, there was an organic, self-determined flow as to why I chose to leave the frozen wastes of one planet to dig beneath the surface of another.</p><p>Here was a game reacting to my actions: it was an open-world experience I’d never encountered before.&nbsp;</p><p>I felt elated at this realization, with things happening as a result of the consequences of my own gameplay decisions. The game was organically adjusting to my moment-to-moment play. It works because of two clever systems: <em>Outlaws’</em> faction system where you either grow or destroy your reputation with various criminal syndicates, and <em>Outlaws</em>’ unique approach to ability upgrades.</p><p>Kay Vess, the protagonist, forms relationships with all sorts of shady syndicates, all with their own constantly conflicting agendas. As a freelancer, Kay can do missions for any and all of them, but sometimes stealing documents for one faction means undermining an ongoing scheme for another. This raises Kay’s reputation for one and lowers it for the other.</p><p>Higher reputation nets you discounts, access to syndicate-controlled areas, special gifts, and so on. Lower results in the opposite, primarily restricted access to areas and antagonistic reactions from members of the syndicate.</p><p>As an example, the result of a recent mission for the Hutt syndicate meant that if I wanted access to the Pyke syndicate area, I’d have to sneak in. Or, I could find ways to raise my reputation with the Pykes. A new mission centered around stealing or buying an item in the currently restricted Pyke area on the jungle planet of Akiva. Before embarking on the Akiva mission, I decided to improve my reputation with the Pykes. This took me to the underground caves on a distant moon of Toshara because the Pykes wanted an item there.</p><p>The reason I wanted access to the Pykes in the first place was related to Kay’s abilities. <em>Outlaws</em> ties ability upgrades to collecting specific rare gear and performing certain actions; there is no XP to speak of. I was trying to upgrade Kay’s silent takedown, allowing her to stealthily take out harder enemies instantly. Upgrading that skill required stealing or purchasing that item in Pyke territory. And since my reputation was so bad, I was now on a moon doing a mission for the Pykes to improve things.</p><p>This push-and-pull meant that I was traveling to distant planets and choosing missions based on what would improve my moment-to-moment play. I wasn’t following a preordained path, or filling out a checklist, but approaching the world on my own terms.</p><p>The game is structured like this: open-ended but with clear trajectories depending on your goals, cleanly doing away with the usual Ubisoft open-world bloat. Whereas so many of the developer’s other big games, like <em>Far Cry</em> or <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, often felt like ticking boxes, <em>Outlaws</em> provides a slicker but meatier canvas of play due to this depth and variety while allowing player choice to dictate action.</p><p>The game seems to speak directly to so many players’ frustration at the size and drudgery in Ubisoft games, as seen in, most recently, <em>Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla</em>. <em>Outlaws</em> really does feel as if my experience and choices not only matter but are part of the system. The world reacts, alignments shift, my choice of task changes. While there are legitimate complaints about its stealth system feeling underbaked and missions effectively repeating themselves, my own experience was one of constant joy, due precisely to the ebb and flow of the systems I could play with.</p><p>I didn’t realize how badly I wanted an open world that was actually this reactive until I played <em>Outlaws</em>. Yes, there’s some jank and instability, but by Picard’s beard, it is a blast to play with these systems, with the freedom ripe for manipulation of a gunslinging outlaw like Kay.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
