            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Panzer Dragoon II Zwei: Remake&nbsp;</em>publisher Forever Entertainment has reassured fans that the game is still very much in development, and that a demo will be playable for attendees at this year's Tokyo Game Show.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/ForeverEntert/status/1965340667414184266" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message on social media</a>, the studio revealed that those who visit the Rainy Frog Games booth will be able to check out a demo version of the remake, which, much like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/panzer-dragoon-remake-revealed-at-e3-2019-coming-to-switch-this-winter" rel="nofollow">the remake of the first game</a>, will sport "modern visuals and remastered music".</p>

<p>As for which platforms you'll be able to play&nbsp;<em>Panzer Dragoon II Zwei: Remake&nbsp;</em>on, Forever <a href="https://x.com/ForeverEntert/status/1965355010331709584" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">says</a> the game will be coming to PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch. The studio doesn't mention a native Switch 2 version, unfortunately.</p>

That game was released in March 2020, but its sequel has been largely missing in action until now.</p>

<p>You'll be able to enjoy the remake either with the original controls or a new, updated control scheme, and you can also switch between the game's original soundtrack and its newly-arranged version, which was handled by legendary&nbsp;<em>Panzer Dragoon Saga&nbsp;</em>composer Saori Kobayashi.</p>

<p>News of&nbsp;<em>Panzer Dragoon II Zwei: Remake</em>'s re-emergence is bittersweet for me; I'm a massive&nbsp;<em>Panzer Dragoon Saga&nbsp;</em>fan, so you can imagine that this news almost feels like one tantalizing step closer to a potential remake of that game.</p>

<p>A remake it would have to be, too, and a ground-up one at that; director Yukio Futatsugi has claimed that publisher Sega has lost the source code for&nbsp;<em>Saga</em>, thus making a remake based on the original code impossible.</p>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> has received its first "major" free update, a continuation of the MMO <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> game's story following the revelations of Act 3. What revelations were these? Honestly, lads, I never made it that far. My character is presently a furry chunk of worm jerky, crammed into a half-built shack after accidentally encasing herself in the furniture, so I couldn't spill the beans even if I knew. But I can reveal there are "gruesome murders" to investigate from this point on, and further opportunities to dig up the misbegotten secrets of Arrakis. Here's a trailer.

<p>
Also: fresh looks! "Re-customize your character, discover new contracts, items, character hairstyles and tattoos, and dynamic encounters that breathe more life into the ever-shifting deserts of Dune," comments the press release. That last line about the ever-shifting deserts rings a little hollow in the wake of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sword-of-the-sea">Sword Of The Sea</a>'s grainy tsunamis, admittedly, but you can't squash people with ornithopters in Sword Of The Sea, so let's call it even-stevens.
</p>
<p>
The update accompanies the launch of the paid Lost Harvest DLC, which comprises a standalone story. "Dig deep into the lore of Dune and you may recoil at what stares back," explains the press release. By gawd, it sounds Nietzschean down there! 
</p><p>
Abyssal ruminations aside, the DLC includes "the new Dune Man building pieces, new decorations, cosmetic armor sets and weapons, swatches, and the Thumper emote." All that and a new vehicle, the Treadwheel, this being a kind of doubled-up Penny Farthing with phat treads. It's got "unique animations and handling" but does not, the developers assure, confer any real advantages over the sandbike equivalent in the base game. Here's another trailer so you can watch the big wheely goof do its thing.

Dune: Awakening has fallen down the charts a bit since launch in June. In my case, I lost interest quickly once I clocked that I was playing a survival game, with all of the associated grubbing around for materials and a generic holo-template building system that felt like a massive waste of the Dune fiction. Brendy (RPS in peace) pounded his gavel thusly in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-review">Dune: Awakening review</a>: "The world of Dune is well-realised in multiplayer survival game format, offering a harsh planet of unintentional comedy, braindead NPCs, and plenty of grindy crafting."
</p>
<p>
Funcom are letting people play for free across September 11th-15th, which includes access to all the stuff in this week's update. There's a discount running thereafter, to lure in those who've developed an appetite for the sands. I'm not sure I'll be going back, but I'm interested to hear how you spice miners are getting on. There are two more paid DLCs with new areas and stories coming in the game's season pass.

              <p>Too many things in our life need to get plugged in. Our phones, watches, headphones — damn near everything that isn’t attached to us needs to be charged at the end of the day. And now that it’s gotten even more complicated that everything is moving away from USB-A to USB-C. Sure, USB-C is a better standard and can do a lot more, but now I’ve got a bunch of USB-A charging blocks that are worthless to me. It’s time for a singular solution. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3985/">Anker has its Prime Charger with a clock LCD display one sale for 35% off. Normally, it goes for $170, but for a limited time the price has shot down to just $110.</a> That’s a savings of $60.</p>
<p>Avoid having a ton of clutter and cables running everywhere at your desk or on your nightstand. The Anker Prime Charger has four USB-C ports and two USB-A ports so you can keep all your devices together and nearby when it’s time to charge them. USB-C i universally compatible so use the hub to charge your laptops whether they are Apple or PC, your phone whether its an iPhone, Galaxy, or something else. Charge your earbuds, tablets, and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3985/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Anker Prime Charger is capable of a maximum output of 250W between its six different ports. Three of the four USB-C ports each support 100W individually. The first one is special, capable of an output of 140W. Over that one, you can charge your stuff super quickly. A 16-inch MacBook Pro can go from zero to 50% in just 25 minutes. It will be fully charge in just over an hour and a half.</p>
<h2>Tailor Your Charging With Smart Power Control</h2>
<p>The dial on the side of the hub can be used to adjust the charging priority for your various devices plugged in. You can choose between port priority mode, dual laptop mode, or low current mode. Or just select AI power mode to have it automatically adjust to what is optimal.</p>



<p>The front of the USB hub is equipped with a large 2.26-inch display which can showcase the time and date. This makes it a lovely addition to your nightstand or your desktop while working. When you devices are plugged into any of the front USB-C ports, the display will visualize its charging status with dynamic animation.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3985/">For a limited time, the Anker Prime Charger for USB-C and USB-A charging has dropped in price by $60.</a> Get it now for just $110 before it goes back up.</p>

                <p>The gaming industry has been a forefront for technology since its early days, pushing the expectations of things like handheld computing, online communication, and of course, graphics. For the last seven years, ray tracing has been one of the bleeding-edge frontiers of graphics. But even as ray tracing-capable GPUs proliferate in consoles, PCs, and even handhelds, many gamers are still skeptical of the technology. So what's going on?</p><p dir="ltr">It's a complex question, and answering it requires considering a number of factors. Those include game development standards that make poor or almost invisible use of ray tracing; the fact that ray tracing is a still-nascent technology; shifts in gaming habits and preferences; and the timing of the introduction of ray-tracing graphics cards with regard to shifts in the economy.</p><p dir="ltr">Ray tracing is one of the oldest technologies in pre-rendered computer graphics, but is still in its infancy in real-time computer graphics. Real-time ray tracing uses simulated light bounces to light and render a game scene. This allows for an accurate rendering of lighting and shadows and detailed reflections that don't require a bunch of work by artists beforehand. Let's take a look at how ray tracing has played out in the gaming industry so far.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Are ray-tracing GPUs common?</h2><p dir="ltr">First, let's talk about where we can find ray tracing GPUs out in the real world. If gamers don't have access to ray-tracing capable hardware, publishers and developers wouldn't be interested in incorporating these features into the games they release.</p><p dir="ltr">Anyone who owns a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X|S console has some form of ray tracing available to them, and recent numbers show there are around at least 95 million of those systems in homes around the world (the PlayStation 5 has sold nearly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-sales-reach-80-million-worldwide-in-latest-milestone/1100-6533755/">80 million consoles</a>, and estimates show the PS5 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-shipped-5x-number-of-xbox-series-x-s-consoles-in-past-3-months-analyst-says/1100-6523462/">outselling Xbox consoles</a> anywhere from 2:1 to 5:1). The Switch 2 is also capable of some ray tracing, though in a much more limited capacity than even the Xbox Series S, adding a new, growing install base to the total.</p><p dir="ltr">We also have the many gaming PCs and laptops out there, as well as gaming handhelds. The subset of those that run Steam help to provide some added numbers, thanks to the Steam Hardware Survey, which suggests that about 30% of responding users have graphics cards capable of ray-tracing.</p><p dir="ltr">What that all means is that there are a lot of game consoles and PCs out there that are capable of ray tracing. It's still a demanding technology, and still a fast-evolving one, but no longer qualifies as a niche technology available to a sliver of high-end users.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Are games designed with ray tracing in mind?</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">There are many great showcases for real-time ray tracing in games that show how a game can take substantial advantage of the hardware, either designed from the ground up or, in the right cases, added in later. One of the earliest was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft</a>'s <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/minecraft-is-breathtaking-with-rtx-turned-on/2300-6452689/" data-ref-id="2300-6452689">optional RTX implementation</a> (non-Nvidia cards support ray tracing in Minecraft, but the original implementation was a joint marketing effort between Mojang and Nvidia), which is now carried on mostly by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-minecraft-mods/2900-5234/" data-ref-id="2900-5234">mods</a> like BetterRTX. Minecraft worked well thanks to its simple geometry and dynamic nature. Ray traced lighting completely changes the way Minecraft looks; if you're underground without a light, your surroundings are pitch black, while forests feel like dynamic, lively places.</p><p dir="ltr">When I interviewed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/" data-ref-id="5000-571922">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-hidden-tech-that-makes-assassins-creed-shadows-feel-more-alive-and-not-require-2tb/1100-6532659/">technical director Nicolas Lopez</a>, he demonstrated how ray tracing is accelerating development and adding meaningful features that gamers can see. For example, Shadows' dynamic lighting helped the team enable four distinct seasons and a variety of weather conditions in the game without having to completely rethink and re-light the world. This gave gamers a significantly more varied game and allowed the developers to direct their effort toward making a more interesting game world.</p><p dir="ltr">Other games make simpler--meaning they're easy to spot, but don't change the way you play the game--but still effective use of the tech. Some examples include the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvels-spider-man/" data-ref-id="5000-455396">Spider-Man</a> games and Remedy's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/control/" data-ref-id="5000-483417">Control</a>, which both feature many big, flat panes of glass. All you have to do is walk past, smash through, or climb over a sheet of glass to see an accurate reflection appear and disappear; this was impossible without clever tricks before real-time ray tracing became available. Another Remedy game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/alan-wake-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-547391">Alan Wake 2</a>, uses ray tracing to dynamically bounce light in dark, foliage-dense, flashlight-lit scenes; both the flashlight beam and the foliage the beam reflects off of are in motion, making ray tracing a solution that improves the realism of the scene and reduces developer workload.</p><p dir="ltr">Some games, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/" data-ref-id="5000-525173">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages/" data-ref-id="5000-631964">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, are built to incorporate a certain amount of ray tracing, and ray-tracing hardware is required to play them on PC.</p><p dir="ltr">Many more games, however, make a poor case for the technology. In my <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nvidia-says-real-time-path-tracing-is-on-the-horizon-but-what-is-it/1100-6502837/">primer on ray and path-tracing technology</a>, I go into more depth about this, so make sure to check that out if you're curious. But the short version is that a huge number of games, especially AAA games, don't have a lot of moving parts. Linear games, like first-person shooter campaigns, are more or less theme-park rides waiting for you to trigger animations and enemy reactions, set in a static world. Open-world games have a higher frequency of dynamic moving objects, but their environments are still mostly static, and even their day-night cycles are free from complications like seasonal changes and weather fluctuations.</p><p dir="ltr">There's a world where ray tracing could add real fun to a multiplayer shooter: using reflectivity and shadow to help you spot or hide from enemies, for example. But as it is, these shooters are a poor fit for ray tracing, as it impacts performance but offers little visible benefit if you aren't pixel peeping. Shadows will be somewhat sharper, somewhat more accurate, and reflective things will show more accurate reflections, but many players will be more interested in the game running smoothly than enjoying those cosmetic differences.</p><p dir="ltr">That means that in many of those games, spotting the effects of ray tracing requires active investigation on the part of the player. It's all but invisible when you're not taking a magnifying glass to every surface. On the other hand, regardless of whether the world is well-suited to ray tracing, its simple presence can be a huge performance hit to a game, just to make something like fences look <em>slightly</em> more "fence-y." If those are the types of games you play, it's no surprise that ray tracing might feel like a poor trade-off. Competitive multiplayer games like Call of Duty, Dota 2, and Fortnite are the most popular PC games around right now, and many players tend to prefer turning the graphics down in favor of a higher framerate. And let's not forget the demographic of gamers who prefer smaller indie releases to bigger, more technically complex ones--for many of those gamers, GPU power, let alone ray-tracing capability, is a factor.</p><p dir="ltr">To wit, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a> <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/pc-gaming/battlefield-6-says-no-to-ray-tracing-now-and-in-the-near-future-dev-says-decision-made-to-focus-on-making-sure-it-was-performance-for-everyone-else" rel="nofollow ">won't have ray tracing anytime soon</a>, according to Christian Buhl, technical director on the game. Battlefield games have a reputation for poor launches at this point, so anything the team can do to make sure the game is as performant as possible at launch makes sense, and ray tracing in a game like Battlefield is simply an extra right now.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Ray tracing isn't mature just yet (and gamers can tell)</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">As mentioned before, real-time ray tracing is still a relatively nascent technology, having been out of reach until shortcuts and specialized hardware were available to lighten the substantial computational load required. The ray tracing we have in GPUs these days is still pretty computationally expensive, and requires so much visual clean-up (real-time ray tracing is very noisy) that upscaling and upsampling, done by services like Nvidia's own <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nvidias-dlss-4-promises-big-performance-gains-for-both-new-and-old-hardware/1100-6528680/" data-ref-id="1100-6528680">DLSS</a> (Deep Learning Super-Sampling) and AMD's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amds-new-radeon-9-9070-series-graphics-cards-launch-soon-support-fsr4-upscaling/1100-6528656/" data-ref-id="1100-6528656">FSR</a> (FidelityFX Super Resolution), are needed to make it look good.</p><p dir="ltr">So there's a lot of room to grow in both increasing the capacity for ray-tracing hardware and optimizing the algorithms that do it. For each game that releases with ray tracing features, we see performance comparisons pop up on places like Reddit and YouTube, and these always make note of the performance hit of enabling ray tracing. For many gamers, that makes it a wait-and-see technology, a curiosity and little else, until it matures.</p><p dir="ltr">Further, the simple fact that it all but requires upscaling and upsampling can make it unappealing to some gamers. It's not hard to find people in the comments section of videos about ray tracing and DLSS arguing that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/xo7dwj/isnt_dlss_just_nvidia_making_their_hardware/" rel="nofollow ">upscaling an image is a cheat</a>, and that an image should be a one-to-one pixel rendering of the original image. This is especially apparent on consoles. Instead of flipping a bunch of little switches to tweak performance, gamers are offered a simple choice: Quality or Performance--a higher-quality, often lower-resolution image, or a clean image with a higher, steadier frame rate. This feature preceded ray tracing but is generally how developers address support on consoles.</p><p dir="ltr">The continued strength of the Nintendo Switch and the growing market of handheld gaming PCs both affect perception, too; handheld fans want games that can run on their handhelds, and thus won't want features that could make the game unplayable. While the Nintendo Switch 2 and some handheld gaming PCs are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-will-support-dlss-upscaling-and-hardware-ray-tracing-nintendo-confirms/1100-6530613/" data-ref-id="1100-6530613">capable of some ray tracing</a>, it remains to be seen how frequently these features will be used on devices where users are conscious of battery life. With that said, though, some teams are starting to explore the possibilities; Digital Foundry called Star Wars Outlaws a "ray-traced revelation" in a recent video. It could be a strong feature for the system moving forward.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Bad timing</h2><p dir="ltr">We also can't underestimate the effects of economics on the availability and perception of ray tracing. GPU prices have been anything but stable throughout the last seven years. The first spike arrived alongside (though not because of) ray-tracing cards; Nvidia's RTX 2000-series cards were released in the third quarter of 2018, as the crypto boom was just beginning to wane, which spiked GPU prices. Things stabilized between 2019 and 2020, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/graphics-cards-are-all-set-to-become-more-expensive-very-soon/1100-6485940/" data-ref-id="1100-6485940">another period of instability</a> would kick off with the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p dir="ltr">A new round of GPUs, increased institutional adoption of cryptocurrency, supply-chain constraints, and increased demand resulting from a pandemic-fueled round of PC upgrading, all contributed to the price spiking a second time in 2020. Now, as we head further into an era marked by President Donald Trump's unpredictable <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-price-hikes-announced-for-the-us-every-system-going-up-by-50/1100-6534127/" data-ref-id="1100-6534127">tariff implementation</a>, another price spike is all but inevitable. We'll see GPU prices affected by availability and production cost.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, inflation has generally pushed the cost of everything upward during this period, with high-end cards among those prices increases. That means that staying on the cutting edge of gaming hardware is getting more and more difficult, which puts some of the most appealing features of games out of reach for many gamers.</p><h2 dir="ltr">New GPU feature unlocked</h2><p dir="ltr">Ray tracing (and its constant companion, upscaling solutions like DLSS) is not the first new graphics feature Nvidia specifically has pushed into the marketplace. Back in 2001, Nvidia launched the GeForce 3 GPU--the first card to use <a href="https://thebookofshaders.com/01/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shaders</a>. It's too wide a topic to get into here, but shaders are an integral part of real-time graphics rendering and assist the rendering of the overwhelming majority of games in a variety of ways. Nvidia wants to repeat that with ray tracing and upscaling, making them so common that game developers will want to utilize them in as many games as possible.</p><p dir="ltr">Ray tracing isn't going away, but it still has a few hurdles to overcome at all levels. First and foremost, game development has to change. Games like Assassin's Creed Shadows are finding novel and useful ways to implement it, and developers are learning to incorporate it into the game design process, but even after seven years, it's still relatively early days.</p><p dir="ltr">Cards capable of handling significant ray tracing also need to proliferate. A lot of PC players have ray tracing-capable hardware, but that is by no means everybody. Nvidia RTX cards may make up about 30% of Steam's survey respondents, but the most common card among those users is the RTX 3060, which is now five years old. That's hindered by the rising costs of PC hardware, especially GPUs, and the resulting slowdown in upgrades that comes with that.</p><p dir="ltr">We're nearing the point where penetration of ray tracing-capable GPUs is starting to hit critical mass, but we're not quite there yet. As game development advances and as people are able to update their hardware, ray tracing will become more feasible as a must-have feature and as one that makes a significant difference to gamers. Until then, gamers will continue to be reticent about ray tracing in video games.</p>

            <p>Japanese racehorse Haru Urara, who inspired a character of the same name in popular gacha game Umamusume: Pretty Derby, has passed away.</p>
<p>Haru Urara was 29 when she passed. In human years, she would have been around 90 years of age. According to Japanese outlet <a href="https://friday.kodansha.co.jp/article/438213">Friday Digital</a>, the cause of Haru Urara's death was colic.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-team-cherry-first-patch-makes-early-game-easier/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/team-cherry%E2%80%99s-first-patch-for-hollow-knight-silksong-makes-the-early-game-easier.1292601/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Hollow Knight Silksong is finally out and available for anyone who wants it across all major console platforms and PC, and after years of working on it to get it ready for release, Team Cherry has officially moved to working on it post-release. Earlier today, the studio <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/595159519774039622/">debuted</a> the patch notes for Hollow Knight Silksong's first update, which mainly fix plenty of bugs and progression issues, but also include balancing fixes for players struggling in the early game.</p>



<p>The new update will be out "<em>mid next week</em>" according to Team Cherry, though if you're playing on PC you can access the update right now through the public beta branch on Steam and GOG.</p>



<p>Some of the bug fixes address a few early progression blockers, as well as late game issues that stop players from accessing elements of the game that should be available to them, but the significant additions for players just getting into Hollow Knight Silksong are the balance tweaks to the game's first two bosses.</p>



<p>"<em>Slight difficulty reduction in early game bosses Moorwing and Sister Splinter</em>," the patch notes read, along with a "<em>reduction in damage from Sandcarvers</em>," a "<em>slight reduction in mid-game Bellway and Bell Bench prices</em>," a "<em>slight increase in rosary rewards from relics and psalm cylinders</em>," and an <em>"increase in rosary rewards for courier deliveries</em>."</p>



<p>Hollow Knight Silksong has already surpassed <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-5-million-audience-overlaps-soulslike/">5 million players</a> since it launched just five days ago at the time of this writing. It's easily one of the biggest indie games of 2025, and a game of the year contender in the eyes of many who've already checked it out.</p>



<p>If you are having a frustrating time with Silksong, but don't exactly want to directly tone down the difficulty, there are <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-mods-enjoyable-challenge/">mods already available that add a level of fun to the game</a> without breaking its challenge. </p>

                <p>As hype continues to mount for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a>, a reliable leaker has discovered possible more information about the open-world game that appears to reference parody websites.</p><p><a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/1002286-gta-vi-general-speculation-discussion-vice-city-baby/page/51/#comment-1072587065" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tez2 said in the GTA forums</a> that they recently came across website domains registered on May 27 under Rockstar owner Take-Two that appear to be related to GTA 6. The domains are for things like "what-up.app," "Rydeme.app," and "hookers-galore.com," along with "myboyhasacreepycorndog.com" and "leonidagov.org." People are theorizing that these are domains related to in-game websites.</p><p>None of them are currently online and available to visit, but some believe they will eventually redirect to the main GTA 6 website. Here is the full list of what Tez2 discovered:</p><ul><li>what-up.app</li><li>rydeme.app</li><li>buckme.app</li><li>leonidagov.org</li><li>brianandbradley.com</li><li>hookers-galore.com</li><li>wipeoutcornskin.com</li><li>myboyhasacreepycorndog.com</li></ul><p>Importantly, these domain registrations might not be related to GTA 6 or anything at all, but they certainly do fit the tone of GTA. GTA 4 and GTA 5 also featured in-game websites, including parodies of popular brands.</p><p>In particular, people believe "what-up" might be GTA 6's version of WhatsApp and "leonidagov.org" could be a reference to Leonida, which is the setting of GTA 6 and itself a version of Florida. The "RydeMe" reference could be a reference to Uber or Lyft. It's anyone's guess what "myboyhasacreepycorndog" could be related to.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-4-remaster-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6531466/" data-ref-id="1100-6531466">Tez2 previously leaked a GTA 4 remaster</a>, but it's yet to be confirmed by Rockstar.</p><p>GTA 6 launches on May 26, 2026 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. Rockstar <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-grand-theft-auto-6-character-revealed/2900-6537/" data-ref-id="2900-6537">shared loads of details about the game in May this year to help ease the pain of the delay</a>, but the company hasn't said a word about GTA 6 since then.

            <p>Nintendo's lawsuit against accessory manufacturer Genki, which earlier this year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-leaks-turn-into-deluge-as-dummy-units-shown-at-ces">debuted a mock-up Switch 2 unit before the console had actually been officially unveiled</a>, has come to an end.</p>
<p>Back in May, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-began-working-on-switch-2-shortly-after-the-release-of-switch-1-new-genki-lawsuit-papers-reveal">Nintendo filed a copyright claim against Genki</a>, when it accused the manufacturer of "capitalising" on demand for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> news and giving "contradictory and inconsistent" statements.</p>
<p>Nintendo and Genki have now reached a settlement, without any further need for a trial. As per official court documents, Genki is required to pay an undisclosed amount to Nintendo for damages.</p>

<p>In addition, Genki along with all other subsidiaries of its parent company Human Things are banned from using any Nintendo logo, design or "anything confusingly similar thereto", in "any manner in connection with its business".</p>
<p>Genki is now also prohibited from using approximations such as 'Glitch', 'Glitch 2', 'Genki Direct' and 'Genki Indirect' when promoting its own products, with these of course being very close to Nintendo's own Switch and Nintendo Direct-related branding.</p>
<p>The accessories manufacturer is also no longer able to use colour schemes in any of its products or packaging which are "confusingly or substantially" similar to Nintendo's. The court document states: "Namely, red and white, red and blue, green and pink, blue and yellow, purple and orange, pink and yellow, and purple and green."</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-lg-cloud-gaming-car-app</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/your-car-might-be-an-xbox-soon-thanks-to-new-xbox-lg-partnership.1292547/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox has announced that it's teaming up with tech company LG in order to make its cloud streaming app accessible in a select number of vehicles, so it looks like cars can now be Xboxes as well.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new trailer titled "This Is an Xbox That Goes Vroom", the Xbox Cloud Gaming app (which is still technically in beta) is "coming soon to select cars in partnership with LG".</p>

<p>Essentially, any car that uses LG's Automotive Content Platform will be able to access the Xbox Cloud Gaming app. As pointed out by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/774177/microsoft-xbox-car-lg-partnership-cloud-streaming" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The Verge</a>, that includes the likes of the Kia EV3, as well as the brand's upcoming EV4, EV5, and Sportage vehicles.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-lg-car-cloud-gaming.jpg?itok=-NtyTvt5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-lg-car-cloud-gaming.jpg?itok=04a8nv6E 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Cars running LG's Automotive Content Platform are getting Xbox Cloud Gaming soon.</figcaption></figure><p>Naturally, these vehicles won't actually have Xbox systems inside them; it's just the cloud gaming app you're getting, so you'd better hope you can sustain a decent connection on whatever journey you're planning if you've got one of these cars.</p>

<p>For what I hope would be fairly obvious reasons, this system also appears to be limited to passenger screens. Still, it should help entertain your kids, your friends, or your partner while you're on a long (or short, I ain't judging) road trip.</p>

<p>This is all part of Xbox's ongoing "This Is an Xbox" campaign, which aims to expand the Xbox platform <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-gen-xbox-hardware-sneak-peek" rel="nofollow">beyond traditional console and gaming hardware</a> (although the company is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rog-xbox-ally-release-date" rel="nofollow">still very much putting its stamp on that as well</a>).</p>

<p>Other devices shown off as part of the campaign include smart TVs, VR headsets, and laptops, so it's clear that Xbox is looking to extend its reach beyond its ailing Xbox Series X|S consoles.</p>




<p>Xbox and LG don't provide a date for the debut of Xbox Cloud Gaming on the Automotive Content Platform, instead settling for "soon". Stay tuned for more on this and all other things Xbox-related.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For all the Android-heads out there, you can upgrade whatever you’re working with now to the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip7 for a discounted price.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3984/"> At this time, Samsung’s seventh generation flippable smartphone has dropped by 14% for the base storage option and by 12% for the large storage option</a>. The 256GB Galaxy smartphone is down from $1,100 to $950, saving you $150. Likewise, the 512GB model is down from $1,220 to $1,070, also saving you $150. Amazon has three color options all on sale. Choose between blue shadow, coral red, or jet black.</p>
<p>Samsung first launched it flippable and foldable lines of smartphones back in 2020. If you’ve been afraid to jump on as an early adopter before the kinks have all been worked at, well now we’re on the seventh generation. It’s got quite a bit of updates since then so now’s a good time to get on board.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3984/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>When closed, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip7 can display the time, date, your notifications, and other brief details across its edge-to-edge cover screen.</p>
<p>Take hand-free selfies. Just open the Flip7 at a 90-degree angle so it can stand itself up. now you can use the outer camera lenses to take high-quality selfies (higher than front-facing cameras tend to be). Even use it for recording videos or taking video calls as you’re able to see your video and your callers video thanks to the cover screen. The outside features a 12MP ultra-wide lens as well as a 50MP wide lens capable of 2x optical quality zoom. If you still want to use the inside main camera, that one is 10MP.</p>



<h2>Flip Without Fear</h2>
<p>Now I’d understand your main concern with a flip phone being it’s durability. Plenty of flip phones snapped at their hinges back in the day, so how does the Flip7 hold up? Well, it’s built with Armor FlexHinge which is designed to close thinner while protecting the phone’s hinge. There are seven generations of iteration and innovation at play here. Additionally, it’s protected with Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 and is encased in a strong yet light Armor Aluminum frame.</p>
<p>Though, the most underrated feature is being to hang up dramatically. When’s the last time you yell “Good day!” through the phone and then slammed it shut. Gently pressing the End Call button just doesn’t have the same oomph.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3984/">Get yourself the Samsung Galaxy Flip7 in three stylish colors for $150 off for a limited time</a>. The 256GB model is down to $950 while the 512GB model is down to $1,070.</p>

If you hit it three consecutive times, the sphere enters “SPARK!!” mode, and you can “break” the opponent player to aim for the now-empty goal!</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="SPARK! -PHOTON BLAST- PV" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l9Dv8HtMN2w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/sports-action-game-spark-photon-blast-announced-for-ps5-pc]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="Bubsy in: The Purrfect Collection Review - Screenshot 1 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158576/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>When the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bubsy_in_the_purrfect_collection">Bubsy in: The Purrfect Collection</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/round-up-limited-run-games-showcase-2024-every-switch-announcement-and-physical#bubsy-in-the-purrfect-collection-2025">was announced</a>, the news received hundreds of thousands of shares and millions of cumulative views. This, friends, is a stark reminder of the strength of nostalgia, an evocative sensation that can stir the heart and cloud the memory.</p>
<p>Let’s be clear: Bubsy the Bobcat has never had a good game. While <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/bubsy_the_woolies_strike_back">Bubsy: The Woolies Strike Back</a> (2017) and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bubsy_paws_on_fire">B</a><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bubsy_paws_on_fire">ubsy: Paws On Fire!</a> (2019) are certainly more playable than the '90s titles, they were still met with a lukewarm reception.</p>
<p>At the time of Bubsy’s Super Nintendo debut in 1993, some publications were impressed with its digitised soundbites, character animation, humour, and colourful graphics; while others criticised it heavily for its shortcomings. Regardless, it sold well enough to spawn sequels up to and including the PlayStation era.</p>
<figure><a title="Bubsy in: The Purrfect Collection Review - Screenshot 2 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158575/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Purrfect Collection combines five Bubsy retro titles if counting the Game Boy version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/bubsy_ii">Bubsy II</a> independently, as it’s very different from its console cousins. The frontend presentation is good, cartoony, and fitting, with nice, clean menus and plenty of bonuses, from galleries spanning original advertisements and box art, to recorded developer interviews chopped up into individual questions.</p>
<p>Every Bubsy release is here, including those cross-platform entries on Super Nintendo and Mega Drive. One interesting inclusion is the Super Famicom version with its regional voice acting; the only 16-bit-era Bubsy title released in Japan, after which they presumably couldn't stand the sight of him. There’s a music player for those who enjoy pain, save states, screen adjustments, and wallpaper borders, as well as a somewhat lacklustre CRT filter. The collection also includes a rewind function, and, while this is a feature I generally dislike, here its presence has never been more crucial. After administering it once or twice, one can barely imagine slogging through any Bubsy game without it, in fact.</p>
<figure><a title="Bubsy in: The Purrfect Collection Review - Screenshot 3 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158573/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The first two Bubsy titles run slightly quicker on Mega Drive than Super Nintendo, but with muted colours and weaker sound. All suck. The initial game, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/bubsy_in_claws_encounters_of_the_furred_kind">Bubsy in: Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind</a>, starts you with nine lives - and that’s less a “cats-have-nine-lives” gag and more a crude patch for how broken the controls are and how poorly arranged everything is.</p>
<p>Busby is a one-hit-kill affair, and if you so much as graze anything you shouldn’t, it’s back to a checkpoint. The control inertia is one of the most egregious in any 2D platform game, with Bubsy being breeze block slow from a stationary position, to racing flat-out within two seconds of picking up speed. It’s a game where the design teams seemingly worked on opposite sides of the world: one engineering the character with Sonic-like zip; the other building maps that are totally antithetical to fast movement. Bubsy moves too quickly and too far to the right of the screen to react to incoming obstacles, and the stages are a hellscape of unavoidable, seemingly random pitfalls that require you to either inch along or learn every myriad avenue in a repetitive trial-by-fire.</p>
<figure><a title="Bubsy in: The Purrfect Collection Review - Screenshot 4 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158578/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Bubsy has pitiful aerial mobility and is barely adjustable during a jump, leading to hilarious deaths when trying to land on the head of an inert enemy. It often feels akin to digital bull-wrangling, with you driving your thumb into the D-Pad in a futile attempt to redirect him. The jump's shortcomings are somewhat ameliorated by a glide manoeuvre that sends Bubsy left and right as he travels downward, but this, like everything else, will usually get you killed too.</p>
<p>It’s often difficult to know what can hurt you, what qualifies as a ledge and what doesn’t, and the collision detection is hilariously poor, where in some instances you will pass through an obstacle just fine, only to be killed by the same obstacle on a subsequent meeting. As if all this wasn’t bad enough, the stage designers do utterly nonsensical things like placing traps on rollercoasters that kick you off after a whole two-second ride, or send you spiralling down drawn-out winding waterways to your death.</p>
<p>Beyond all these problems, the absolute worst design decision is that Bubsy — a platform game character — dies if he falls from too great a height. It’s absolutely ridiculous, and even more so in a game where the cavernous layouts and cropped screen parameters mean you rarely know where the next leap of faith will actually take you.</p>
<figure><a title="Bubsy in: The Purrfect Collection Review - Screenshot 5 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158574/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Its sequel, Bubsy II, set in a theme park world with selectable historical zones, carries over many of the same issues. The stages are more enclosed and maze-like, making for a painfully boring game where you move around an endless, samey sprawl of cut and paste backgrounds, battling marginally-improved but still-terrible control inertia, while searching for doors that teleport you to other doors, and then to other doors again, and occasionally back to the beginning door. It’s confusing to know what are platforms versus background art, especially in the Egyptian zone, and the haphazard nature of the placement of everything feels even more prominent this time around.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting also, that Bubsy II has some of the worst music in a 16-bit game, challenging the Mega Drive’s <strong>Taz-Mania</strong> for that particular crown. The routine ear-bleeding cacophony even accompanies your adventure in the music-themed zone, where you’re jumping across saxophones, octaves, and quavers. It’s bewildering.</p>
<p>To Bubsy II’s credit, however, it does away with the much-maligned one-hit-kill and allows the bobcat three health bumps, which eases tensions considerably. It also has a kind-of-fun frog-firing bonus game and sections where Bubsy pilots a space ship and then a biplane through impossible terrain. And, if for some reason you want to endure torture with a friend, local multiplayer co-op still functions here.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/bubsy_ii">Bubsy II</a> for Game Boy is a calamitous mess: slow, horrible, and barely playable. There’s no reason for it to be here except for completeness.</p>
<p><strong>Bubsy in: Fractured Furry Tales</strong> for Atari’s incredibly, truly powerful (no really, promise) 64-bit Jaguar really flexes the big cat's CPU, reusing assets for the third time, having poorer parallax depth than the 16-bit entries, and bringing back the one-hit-kill while maintaining awful inertia controls, tragic jumping mobility, crappy collision detection and flaky hit-boxes. What it does right, however, is get rid of those terrible hacked-together maze stages to make things more streamlined. Yes, it’s still comprised of overly-large maps, but there’s more of a general direction. The music, too, after its predecessor’s keyboard-on-the-fritz oeuvre, is at least listenable. That said, it’s still a hair-tearingly frustrating game, full of terrible enemy placements and myriad stage design problems. You’ll do well to play it more than 10 minutes before throwing in the towel.</p>

<p>Finally, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/bubsy_3d">Bubsy 3D</a> for the Sony PlayStation, infamously awful and the butt of a thousand jokes, rounds off the collection. And, considering the quality up until this point, it’s a wonder anyone expected anything more. Abominably bad, unplayable trash, powered only by its constant and invasive speech, it’s glitchy, the camera is a mess, and it’s woefully imprecise to hit a yawning platform right in front of you.</p>
<p>For this release, though, Bubsy 3D has been given new modern controls, assigning the camera to the right stick to improve the experience. Yet it doesn’t. It’s a game so timelessly terrible that the overhauled inputs do little to improve its bearability. Unless you’re a pure masochist, it’s pointless to even hit start on it.</p>
<p>This, I realise, isn’t exactly a glowing review. But, despite what angry Bubsy enthusiasts may say, it’s an honest one. What Bubsy does best is in its humour, its wackiness, its personality, and the quips that pepper the series. And this is probably what made it interesting in the first place: a catty cat with a '90s wryness and a <strong>Rocko’s Modern Life</strong>-style irreverence.</p>
<figure><a title="Bubsy in: The Purrfect Collection Review - Screenshot 8 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158577/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>But it's also a demonstration of why Japan ruled during this programming era, and why so many Western developers, seemingly incapable of understanding basic jumping weight and inventive stage layouts, struggled to find the mark. To that end, the Bobcat has endured far, far beyond his natural shelf life. If nostalgia alone is really enough to tease that cash from your wallet, be my guest.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>One wonders if the entire Bubsy series wasn’t actually designed as a sort of torture parody; that the intention all along was to pummel unsuspecting children into submission via an innocent-looking, anthropomorphic-bobcat-led platform game.</p>
<p>Picture this: some kid in 1993 got Bubsy for Christmas after the sales clerk told his parents that Sonic and Mario were old hat, and this was the hot new thing. That kid either never forgave his parents for the injustice and the playground bullying they endured as a result, or they committed fully to the Bubsy universe and found a happy place within it. If you’re the latter, then this collection is for you. And only for you.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During this year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/gamescom/">Gamescom</a> I had the chance to try out many different games. While many like <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-gamescom-hands-on-preview-a-promising-return/">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-gamescom-hands-on-preview-setting-up-for-greatness/">Phantom Blade Zero</a> were a known quantity, there were a few other unexpected surprises, like One More Level's <a href="https://wccftech.com/valor-mortis-gamescom-hands-on-preview-an-amazing-standout-and-one-of-the-shows-best/">Valor Mortis</a> and FLASK, a roguelike auto battler by Chop Chop Games to be published by Ghost Ship Games which felt every bit as good to play as it was to look at with its hand-draw style heavily reminiscent of the best comic books.</p>



<p>Already from its simple premise, FLASK shows incredible creativity with that little touch of wackiness that never goes amiss in certain types of games. Embarking on journey through a dangerous, dark medieval landscape, players take on the role of an alchemist heavily in debt who has to collect various flasks to power up an army of homunculus warriors to take on the goblin hordes and earn enough gold to pay off the debt. This journey is conducted via multiple hand-drawn maps featuring randomly generated nodes where players can access shops to purchase flasks, obtain flasks for free, interact with NPCs via which the main story is developed, and fight enemies using the current party of homunculi warriors. At the start of a run, only one homunculus will be available but as the adventure proceeds, players can add more homunculi to their party, up to a total of three, and even save different party configurations to deal with any unforeseen challenge.</p>

<p>Being able to handle any situation on the fly using what's available is the core of any roguelike experience, and from my short time with FLASK, it's evident how the game turns this up to eleven. The game is clearly aimed towards a hardcore roguelike audience, with very challenging auto battles upon which the player has no control, except for the flasks that the homonculi can equip for improved stats and special effects. These flask, which are exclusive to each homunculus type and activate in a set order during combat, have some widely different effects, some a little complicated to come to grasp with in a short amount of time, but the synergy opportunities they offered looked impressive, so much so that, at the end of my time with this early build of FLASK, I had to stop to check out what I had on hand and how I could set them up to win even the most challenging of fights. Better yet, these party setups can also be put to the test against those of other players via asynchronous PvP, which is sure to add another dimension to a game that is setting out to be an incredibly solid addition to the genre.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Loving roguelikes in the vein of FLASK where synergies between different powers are key, I would have spent hours testing out what the game had to offer in this sense, so I was more than a little disappointed when my Gamescom 2025 session ended, cutting my time with the game short. Hopefully, the game will deliver on the potential evident in this early build when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3714280/Flask">Steam</a> sometime next year.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-update-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hollow-knight-silksongs-first-update-will-make-some-bosses-slightly-easier.1292502/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Team Cherry has revealed what you can expect from the first major&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>update, and if you've been having a tough time with a couple of the game's early bosses, you'll appreciate this one.</p>

<p>As revealed in a Steam Community post, the much-hyped Metroidvania's first update is due sometime next week. If you're trying to play&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>completely blind, you may want to avert your eyes for <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/595159519774039622/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">these patch notes</a>, but they shouldn't spoil anything too major.</p>

<p>The first big change is two early-game bosses, Moorwing and Sister Splinter, getting a "slight difficulty reduction". Additionally, some mid-game Bellway and Bell Bench prices have been reduced, which is good news for anyone who's constantly starved for Rosaries (myself included).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-update-boss.jpg?itok=lPylT6fc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-update-boss.jpg?itok=bk8ZMdbo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some of&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>'s early bosses have had their difficulty reduced.</figcaption></figure><p>Relics and psalm cylinders will now award slightly more Rosaries, on that note, as will courier deliveries. Additionally, you should take less damage from Sandcarvers once the update drops.</p>

<p>There are plenty more changes coming as part of this first patch, but they mostly pertain to bug fixes; there arguably isn't anything earth-shattering here, but it looks like Team Cherry is listening to the discussion around&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em>'s difficulty, at the very least.</p>

<p>If you're somehow unaware of&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, it's a Metroidvania that serves as a sequel to 2017's much-celebrated&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight</em>, and it's also one of the most talked-about indie games of the last decade.</p>

<p><em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-september" rel="nofollow">finally released last week</a> after a lengthy period of relative silence from Team Cherry, and the announcement of its release date in August caused several indie developers to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-indie-delays" rel="nofollow">move the release dates</a> of their own games, while its actual launch <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-crashing-storefronts" rel="nofollow">crashed several of the storefronts</a> on which it was made available.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1030300/Hollow_Knight_Silksong/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/hollow-knight-silksong/9n116v0599hb" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and the Nintendo Switch family of consoles. The game's first major update is due to land somewhere in the middle of next week.</p>

              <p>Small gaming accessory maker Genki <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-rumors-genki-ces-2025-official-1851736830">made a big splash at this year’s CES</a> after it flaunted a mockup of the Switch 2 on the show floor at the expo. Nintendo turned around and sued in May, accusing the company behind carrying cases and Joy-Con grips of infringing on its trademarks by using the hype around leaks to market accessories for the upcoming hardware. This week, the two sides reached a “confidential settlement” that, among other things, bars Genki from ever calling one of its promotional livestreams a “Direct.”</p> <p>“[Genki is permanently enjoined from] using the terms ‘Glitch,’ ‘Glitch 2,’ ‘Genki Direct,’ ‘Genki Indirect,’ or any other similar rebranding or approximation of Nintendo’s intellectual property, products, product names, characters, presentations, or marks; i.e. for any accessories compatible or marketed for use with Nintendo’s products, implementing product packaging, product designs, and product descriptions that fail to make clear to consumers Genki’s status as an unlicensed accessory manufacturer,” reads <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.969015/gov.uscourts.cacd.969015.30.1.pdf">part of the agreement</a>&nbsp;ordered on September 8. Genki also agreed to “payment in an agreed-upon amount” in the “confidential settlement” with Nintendo.</p> <p>The legal dispute stems from Genki’s CES 2025 antics which included not just a 3D-printed replica of the Switch 2 for showing off accessories but also the accessory manufacturer’s claims that it had based the designs on access to a genuine piece of Nintendo’s then-unrevealed hardware. The stunt seemingly forced Nintendo’s hand, and the company, <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-reveal-trailer-date-nintendo-mario-kart-9-1851739487">amid a flurry of other leaks</a>, ended up officially teasing the new console later that month ahead of a full Nintendo Direct dedicated to the Switch 2 in April.</p>

 <p>When the Mario maker hit back in May with a trademark infringement lawsuit, Genki wrote in a statement, “What we can say is this: Genki has always been an independent company focused on building innovative gaming accessories for the community we love. We’re proud of the work we’ve done, and we stand by the quality and originality of our products.” The Switch 2 versions of some of those products <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/after-some-early-issues-genki-has-finally-upgraded-select-switch-2-accessories">had minor issues</a> at launch but have since been revised.</p> <p>Was pissing off Nintendo worth it to get the world’s attention for Joy-Con grips and carrying cases? Without knowing the secret terms of the settlement, it’s hard to guess. But Genki is clearly taking it seriously now. The box for the Attack Vector Swappable Grip Case for the Switch 2 carries the following fine print disclaimer on the back: “Attack Vector is not affiliated with, sponsored by, or endorsed by Nintendo.”</p>

                <p>Localizing video games can be challenging, and in the case of Animal Crossing, bringing the distinctly Japanese social-sim to the West in 2002 proved to be a Herculean labor. One of the big obstacles was renaming the game, as its Japanese title of Dōbutsu no Mori had to be changed for its Western release.</p><p>The entire localization job took between six months and a year to complete, former Nintendo of America localization manager Leslie Swan said to <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/interview-we-did-try-to-keep-forest-in-the-name-how-mario-64s-princess-peach-helped-bring-animal-crossing-to-the-west" rel="nofollow ">Time Extension</a>, and one of the proposed titles was Animal Acres, a name that was inspired by the grids of the town. This was ultimately rejected by Nintendo, with the title of Animal Crossing being approved instead.</p><p>The late Satoru Iwata--who was the head of Nintendo's corporate planning division at that time--laughed when he heard that Swan and her team were working on the English localization. Game producer Takashi Tezuka had also warned the team about taking on the task, as they'd need to not only translate thousands of lines of text, but also rename characters, come up with new catchphrases for them, and figure out how to adapt Japanese-specific themes for Western audiences.</p><p>"I was in a meeting with Mr. Iwata and some other heads of the development group, and we were just kind of going around saying, 'Here's what we're going to be working on', and I just said, 'Well, Mr. Tezuka is asking us to work on Animal Forest' and he just burst out in laughter," Swan said. "He just laughed and said, 'I don't know how you're going to do this.' And it's true, just everything in that game was so specific to Japan."</p><p>The last Animal Crossing game, New Horizons, was released in 2020 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ahead-of-switch-2s-launch-animal-crossing-new-horizons-gets-first-update-in-years/1100-6531857/">and it recently got a Switch 2 update</a>. The future of the franchise remains a mystery--even in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic helping to turn <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-huge-sales-figures-we/1100-6477018/">New Horizons into a massive hit for Nintendo</a>--but you can bring the game and your favorite villagers everywhere with you as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/animal-crossing-crocs-let-you-bring-your-favourite-villagers-everywhere-now-available-to-order/1100-6534311/">Animal Crossing Crocs are now available to order</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>
