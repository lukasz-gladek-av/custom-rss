            <p>A Silent Hill remake has just been announced during Konami's Press Start showcase.</p>
<p>The game will be created by Bloober team in collaboration with Konami. As of writing, the only confirmed is that the game is "in development".</p>
<p>The brief reveal trailer was paired alongside the Silent Hill 1 intro theme, further confirming that this is the original game in the legendary horror series being remade.</p> <div>

<p>This remake of the original 1999 game by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a>, the developer responsible for the excellent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>. That game received ample critical and commercial success, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">in Eurogamer's own review of the Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, Vikki Blake noted: "Against the odds, Bloober Team has delivered a remake that both expands <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> in just the right places, and gives careful attention to what it preserves."
</p>
<p>This will be the first time Silent Hill 1 has gotten the remake treatment, although it was reimagined back in 2009 with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-shattered-memories-review">Silent Hill: Shattered Memories</a>. That game, released on the Wii and later ported to the PS2, was an interesting spin on the game that started it all. 
</p><p>
Bloober Team is also working on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bloobers-cronos-the-new-dawn-gets-release-window">which got a release date announcement at Summer Game Fest only a few days ago</a>.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ratchet-clank-rift-apart">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</a>, which was initially released four years ago (four years ago!), has a prototype mini game hidden away so well within it, that apparently nobody found it.</p>
<p>Senior designer Grant Parker showed the mini game off during a live stream on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, though developer Insomniac has since shared the clip on its social media. </p>
<p>
During this Rift Apart stream, Parker explained how to find the Easter egg for a prototype mini game, which would have allowed players to ride the mechanical bull inside Zurkie's (a bar-like establishment).</p>

<p>Like I said, the developer is pretty sure no one has discovered this Easter egg for themselves yet, and having listened to him explain it I can't say that I am surprised. To check it out, players need to head towards the entrance of Zurkie's, where they will see two signs beside the doorway informing patrons not to bring weapons inside. These are the key to unlocking the bull riding Easter egg.</p>
<p>What you have to do is shoot the left sign five times, then the right one four times, before shooting the left one 13 more times. Nothing will happen, or so it would seem as there isn't any mystical bell or anything like that that suddenly chimes to let you know you have uncovered something secret. There is literally "no confirmation, or anything," Parker explained in the video. However, if you mosey on into Zurkie's and head to the bull, you will get a prompt: Hold L2 to Ride Mechanical Bull.</p>
<p>You can check out the "super duper early" prototype mini game via the embed below. "It's just something fun that I thought I'd leave in the game," Parker said.</p> <div>

<p>Eurogamer was full of praise for Rift Apart on its PlayStation 5 release in 2021, with our Chris calling it "another lesson in laid-back, unpretentious fun".</p>
<p>"It's just pure craft, pure fun, pure video games - all the brilliant, bizarre ideas this studio has just thrown at the wall and all of them sticking. The only thing it lacks - apart from maybe a tiny bit of restraint - is pretence," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ratchet-and-clank-rift-apart-review">Eurogamer's Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart review</a>. "There's no self-seriousness, no po-faced melodrama, no insecurity about the form. A game that's happy to be a game, in a familiar, cuddly shape.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/konami">Konami</a> has rather nonchalantly revealed that a <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/silent-hill">Silent Hill</a> remake is on the way. Not only that, Bloober Team – the studio that worked on the recent Silent Hill 2 remake – is back on board.</p>
<p>The Japanese publisher didn’t give us any more information, other than announcing that the project is now in development. However, it did give us another good look at <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill F</a>, with insights from the game’s developers.</p>


<p>They touched its core themes – namely the juxtaposition of gorgeous natural beauty with bone-chilling horror – and its Shōwa timeline, transporting players back to a Japan where customs and superstitions contrast the world of the original Silent Hill.</p>
<p>This new entry is being written by Ryūkishi07, a well known mangaka best known for his visual novel, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni. Silent Hill F will feature a young female protagonist, Hinako, and delves into elements of psychological trauma, Japanese folklore, and health dose of trademark body horror.</p>
<p>It’s been a while since the last mainline Silent Hill games with various spin-offs and no shortage of misfires. Following games such as lukewarm Downpour, the blighted HD Collection, and the PlayStation Vita exclusive Book of Memories, there was a short break before Konami stunned us with P.T. which was the last project Hideo Kojima (Snatcher, Policenauts, Metal Gear Solid) worked on before his departure from the company. More recent Silent Hill games include the The Short Message and Ascension which were both experimental titles that ultimately went nowhere, followed by Bloober Team’s celebrated Silent Hill 2 remake.</p>

<p>Silent Hill F launches later this year on September 25th and will be available on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store).</p>
<p>As for the Silent Hill Remake, it was likely greenlit shortly after the success of Bloober Team’s previous game, but there’s no indication on when it will release or on which platforms.</p>

It’s a cozy slice of life game where you deliver artificial pets. There’s also a mystery to be solved.</p>

<h2 lang="EN-US" paraeid="{280475d0-d510-4868-87d2-14c667b4b7b0}{184}" paraid="278375488" xml:lang="EN-US">Petal Runner's Game Boy Visuals</h2>

<p paraeid="{c3d7e0ce-d02a-4e0b-bcc1-34ba4197aaac}{18}" paraid="447900538" xml:lang="EN-US">My first impressions of <em>Petal Runner</em> were that it looked just like the <em>Pokemon </em>games of my childhood. That is absolutely true and by design, as I was told by Creative Director Brandon Greer, who said he always loved the look of <em>Pokemon Red </em>and wanted to do something inspired by it.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{8730c49a-d8b5-4c50-96b8-acddb7a531f4}{236}" paraid="538743245" xml:lang="EN-US">Greer told me that he was always interested in pixel art and got into learning how to make it as a hobby. That turned into something more, which led to creating the art in <em>Petal Runner</em>. He even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BJGpixel" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">runs a YouTube channel</a> with tutorials if you want to learn as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p paraeid="{4f21161a-8587-48e8-8bdb-14384b1328d0}{137}" paraid="191828718" xml:lang="EN-US">There’s no battling, but there’s also no shortage of Hanapets to befriend along the way. Delivering and calibrating, sometimes coming to repair them by recalibrating, is the name of the game as you play <em>Petal Runner</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{06b0ace7-5ed8-4943-9078-cc6c547b84be}{14}" paraid="1637422151" xml:lang="EN-US">HanaPets come in all shapes and sizes, with their own unique personalities as well. There’s your HanaPet Kira, who is quite cat-like and has a lot to say, and I saw one that was a shark swimming through the air. &nbsp;</p>



<p paraeid="{fe7086e1-21c3-4f2d-bdee-e599a2edc5dd}{106}" paraid="1797208579" xml:lang="EN-US">Instead of battles, you’ll calibrate HanaPets for people as you deliver them. Those come in the form of a series of minigames that are very reminiscent of <em>WarioWare</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{c4991f8b-ccd0-46c2-9c70-beea2366bfe4}{105}" paraid="239729365" xml:lang="EN-US">Each one only lasts a few seconds at most. For example, in one you have to land your parachute guy in the correct area. In another, you use a brush to clean up a dog quickly.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 paraeid="{c4991f8b-ccd0-46c2-9c70-beea2366bfe4}{105}" paraid="239729365" xml:lang="EN-US">A Big Map To Explore</h2>

<p paraeid="{10032f3f-205f-48fd-9b21-b2e7c3a2efa8}{134}" paraid="718244314" xml:lang="EN-US">Most of your time, though, will be spent traveling around the fairly large world of Sapphire Valley. <em>Petal Runner </em>will feature four distinct neighborhoods that you drive through and to on your motorcycle. &nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{e7148687-3ba1-4081-a847-abe8dd14ea3e}{71}" paraid="764631281" xml:lang="EN-US">Each neighborhood will have its own sort of color palette and distinct design, too. It's not just one big sprawling city that is sort of samey, but each neighborhood will have its own personality and look to it.</p>

<p paraeid="{e7148687-3ba1-4081-a847-abe8dd14ea3e}{71}" paraid="764631281" xml:lang="EN-US">You'll have plenty of reason to travel in making deliveries, too, as there are a lot of secrets, sidequests, and side characters to befriend. Exploration is encouraged and rewarded, as just soaking in the world is the biggest appeal of these sort of games.</p>



<p paraeid="{e7148687-3ba1-4081-a847-abe8dd14ea3e}{188}" paraid="73521114" xml:lang="EN-US">I was only given access to a small portion of one neighborhood in my demo, but it had so much for me to see and do. People were boundless, shops and buildings all over, and little paths that are slightly hidden were everywhere Greer said it was a blast to design the world and fill its spaces with a lot of fun interactable characters and items.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{846fb01a-19d7-42b3-8579-091e419aa9e3}{25}" paraid="1917473999" xml:lang="EN-US">One of the areas I had access to was a mall, full of stores I could walk into and interact with customers and shopkeepers. There were shops for music, HanaPets, accessories, and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{3d2877fa-b57c-4e2f-b241-0260da76da1b}{132}" paraid="1218408175" xml:lang="EN-US">It was a great nostalgic trip to the Game Boy years of something like <em>Pokemon</em>, with an elevated pixel art that they can get away with on today's technology. A lot of charm was packed into not a lot of pixels.</p>

<h2 paraeid="{3d2877fa-b57c-4e2f-b241-0260da76da1b}{132}" paraid="1218408175" xml:lang="EN-US">Petal Runner Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

Though it shares a world with Metal Gear Solid 3 Delta: Snake Eater, the “gameplay is completely different.” It’s not just a reskinned Metal Gear Online mode, however; expect it to be “its own, new type of mode” based on the series’ trademark stealth and infiltration mechanics.

            <title><![CDATA[The Alters Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-alters-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-alters-review.1216575/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-alters-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Hey, do you have any regrets in your life? The Alters knows that you do, and that’s why its sci-fi story about morally and ethically questionable cloning on a wildly inhospitable alien planet hits home. It’s comparable to a playable Black Mirror episode (no, not <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/12/28/netflixs-black-mirror-bandersnatch-review"><u>that one</u></a>) that envisions technology run amok, where science has granted us the ability to talk to versions of ourselves who took the road we didn’t travel. It then asks: what if some of those people hate your guts? Also, what if this is all the product of a mad scientist and/or corporate exploitation? Combined with a simple but effective resource harvesting and base management balancing act, as well as the constant specter of approaching death by a scorching sun, it’s an effective pressure cooker of both personal and environmental hazards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When Jan (pronounced Yon) wakes up to find he is the only survivor of a crash landing on an uninhabitable planet, The Alters immediately sets an isolating and eerie tone. This planet is remarkably otherworldly – barren and gray with jagged rock formations, but splashed with shimmering colors from oily-looking water and distortions created by this universe’s brand of Unobtainium, called Rapidium. Soon there’s a striking feature on the horizon: the expedition’s mobile base, which is a distinctive towering wheel that suspends its habitat in the middle. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a palpable urgency as you scrape together enough resources to survive and get the base moving before the sun comes up and broils the surface. It’s not difficult to extract enough organic resources to feed Jan and fuel the base – you simply gather chunks from the surface, build mining machines, and then network them back to your base with powerline towers in a light version of resource games like Satisfactory – but you have to keep an eye on the clock to make sure you’re not overworking him or exposing him to too much nighttime radiation. The planet’s surface is also littered with radioactive anomalies that are initially all but invisible until you’re right on top of them, so navigating the maze-like map has a fair bit of tension to it even though there are no aliens actively trying to eat you. You do soon develop tools to make those anomalies easier to deal with by zapping their moving cores with what feels like a Ghostbusters proton pack, reducing them to rolling balls of resources. However, new and unexpected types are soon introduced that mess with your perception and make you approach them in different ways to keep you on your toes.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>New and unexpected anomaly types are soon introduced that keep you on your toes.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">When you enter the base, The Alters shifts perspective from over-the-shoulder third-person to a diorama-like view, and you move around like a 2.5D sidescroller. It instantly gave me XCOM vibes, except you can actually run around as a character within it, moving between floors with elevators. Laying out the base with the new room types you unlock is a flexible puzzle that usually has very low stakes: there’s no build time when you place a new social room or refinery or store room, you can freely move almost anything around to make the best use of your limited space at no cost, and you can delete rooms for a full (or very generous) refund of resources at any time, provided you have the storage space to accommodate the materials. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s fun to mess around with (for a bit I was moving rooms I needed to access right next to me rather than walking to them) but it does get disorienting: running around wondering “now where did I put that communications room?” got old quickly. You can zoom out to see everything, but can’t move while in that ant farm perspective, so I ended up trying to minimize how much I shifted things around so that I could memorize what was where. It eventually becomes a little tricky as you expand the base and cram in more large rooms and storage, working around an immovable block in the middle, and it can be convoluted to reach an essential room when you need to. But being able to basically start from scratch whenever you want means it’s never too frustrating.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s a little silly at times in that each version of Jan has different hair and a different way of speaking.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the first and most important rooms you’ll build is The Womb, which fuzzy communications with your ethically questionable corporate middle managers tell you to set up to kick off The Alters’ big experiment. Combined with Rapidium and a quantum computer that reaches into a map of Jan’s formative memories and simulates the life he would’ve had if he’d made different choices, it creates clones of him with different specialties and philosophical differences. All of them share an abusive father, but where they go from there is drastically different based on choices like if they left home, went to school, sold their house, met their wife, and other pivotal moments. It’s a little silly at times in that each version of Jan has different hair and a different way of speaking – the gruff, blue-collar Miner and the nerdy Scientist being the product of a few different life choices seems a bit far-fetched – but it’s a fun idea to think about and a great and novel way to explore these characters. Alex Jordan, the actor who plays all the Jans, is clearly having a good time finding ways to set them apart from one another – it reminds me of Tatiana Maslany playing clones in Orphan Black.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I eventually created six clones across the 30 hours it took me to complete the third act, which is not all of the possibilities – you’ll have to play through at least a couple of times to meet the rest, and I’m looking forward to another run where I know all the goals in advance and can optimize my approach to gathering resources and unlocking new technologies. This turns The Alters into a management game that reminds me of Fallout Shelter, where you’re assigning your team of specialists to tasks according to their strengths, but rarely have enough people to do everything you want to as efficiently as you’d like, so you’re forced to come up with the best solution you can. Some of them are essential for every playthrough – you need the Scientist to unlock any new technologies, for instance – but most, like the Doctor or the Guard (who I have yet to create) are optional and will make playthroughs at least a bit different with their unique production bonuses and personality. I do wish the menu for selecting a crewmember to work a job would list where they’re currently working, though. I frequently had to back up a step to make sure I wasn’t taking someone away from an essential role, then go back into the menu and reassign them.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Managing your relationships with your Alters is partially about satisfying their basic needs with good food, enough rest, and some entertainment (such as gathering to watch a series of legitimately funny live-action sketch comedy videos and a simple skippable beer pong minigame), but it’s also a game of getting to know which Jans value compassionate responses and which will thrive with some tough love and bluntness. Some of them have self-destructive tendencies that need to be kept in check – they’ll work fewer hours if they’re unhappy, and can permanently die if they’re abused or left to their own devices. In the first act of the story it’s easy enough to keep the peace, but naturally that can’t last. As wrenches are thrown in the gears of your plan to escape this planet with a stockpile of invaluable Rapidium, you’re forced to make legitimately tough moral decisions that some of your Alters will strongly disagree with. There may well be a way to get through it optimally, but from what I’ve seen it’s very much a Kobayashi Maru: a test of how you deal with a no-win scenario.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Alters certainly cuts corners in how it tells its story – anything that isn’t a one-on-one conversation between Jan and an Alter is shown as a storyboard with voiceover rather than an animated cutscene, and the few characters who aren’t clones are obscured by static in the transmission from Earth so we only hear their voices. Some voice lines are recycled often, like when you present an Alter with a personal item you’ve found among the wreckage of the crashed ship to butter them up. But it does a lot with a little in that respect, and very effectively gets across the moral dilemmas, relationships, and mood. There’s even a musical performance where all the Jans collaborate on a song, and it’s only a little bit cheesy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Every time you move the base to stay ahead of the sun you come to a new map, and each of them is a visually distinct alien landscape and a maze of interconnected pathways to explore in order to open the way forward. There are obstacles to clear and work around, which means unlocking new tools and spending your suit’s limited energy and resources to grapple up high cliffs or vaporize rocks in your path. It’s not difficult, but some of the puzzles you have to solve to gather essential resources for high-level research unlocks require you to uncover and follow a winding trail around the map that can be time-consuming enough to span multiple in-game days. The fast-travel system is a clever way to let you cover more ground and avoid too much backtracking by building out your tower network like breadcrumbs as you explore, and there are special pylon types you can place that are specifically for teleporting around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The mechanic for uncovering deep resource veins to place a mining machine on is a chore, though. You’re required to create polygonal shapes by placing probes, which lets you look through the ground. It’s not hard, but it feels pointless and fiddly because you can just gather your probes and try again if you miss. (I suspect that at one point in development you had to spend resources to make them but that idea was scrapped and the cost was removed.) All it consumes is time, which is a precious resource, and it isn’t a very entertaining use of it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are other hostile environmental hazards that can mess you up, too: The Alters very quickly reminded me of developer 11Bit’s other recent game, Frostpunk 2, with its occasional magnetic storms that make venturing outside for resources all but impossible and force you to rely on your stockpiles while you race to repair escalating damage to the base. Things like that keep the pressure on and force you to consider taking measures like making your team work overtime hours, and prevent you from putting too much of management on autopilot even as you unlock more automated resource extraction tools. Multiple times, gathering enough resources to move the base came down to the wire – I had to be ready to go before the sun caught me, and I made it out by hours, not days.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">The Alters is a highly atmospheric sci-fi character study of one man who meets the effects of the formative choices he’s made throughout his life face to face. Managing Jan’s relationships with his alternate selves while extracting enough resources from a hostile alien environment to survive is a balancing act on top of a balancing act, and it cleverly builds up the pressure over the course of its story. Exploration of these barren but eye-catching maps presents a series of puzzles and threats without resorting to blasting aliens, and the conversations and moral dilemmas that arise from Jan’s clones are a novel way to approach a game like this. It’s clearly not a big-budget game with resources to throw at cinematics and character models, but it does a lot with a little to tell its story effectively, and its occasional interface quirks don’t get in the way of that.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">When I was first asked to check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/spine/" data-ref-id="5000-537140">Spine</a> at Summer Game Fest 2025, I hadn't heard of it yet. I <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1731290/SPINE__This_is_Gun_Fu/" rel="nofollow">looked it up on Steam</a> and thought it looked pretty rad, so I booked an appointment, though I also expected it would kick my butt. Sometimes that's the job, and that's okay. I compared it to Sifu in my mind, which I always found to be really difficult. However, once I got to go hands-on with it, I found it's more like a Batman Arkham game in terms of its combat gameplay. Those familiar mechanics helped me look stylish and deadly in my demo, and put Spine on my radar ahead of its launch next year.</p><p dir="ltr">Spine comes from Nekki, a team that has previously developed mobile games, including the popular Shadow Fight series. Even Spine originally began as a mobile game, but as the project grew and took on a different shape, the team realized it had an opportunity to make its debut on PC and consoles. Inspired by the career works of John Woo and other stylish action movies, Spine is a "gun-fu" combat game in a cyberpunk setting with a simple story setup.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl_9oQgLVLM" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nl_9oQgLVLM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">In it, you play as Redline, a character whose physical look is so cool in my opinion that it got me to book the demo. The punky street artist's origin story is much like John Wick's, though instead of a dead dog, it's her kidnapped brother who compels her to get into ass-kicking mode. The 15-20 hour game is said to start small in terms of Redline's motivation and increase the stakes from there. What she expects is a personal quest to save her brother soon pulls her into a criminal underworld of AI overlords and corrupt people in power across the colorful but troubled city.</p><p dir="ltr">In my time with the game, I lit up bad guys in bars, hallways, and rooftops with roundhouse kicks, haymakers, and blasts of my dual-wielded pistols. The game wears its inspirations on its sleeve. This is a game from people who unabashedly love movies like The Matrix and Hard Boiled. Nekki isn't shying away from that, perhaps best displayed in its hallway fight scene reminiscent of Oldboy. It's leaning into it. But I was happy to see the game uses combat systems more like the Batman Arkham series, in which it's not too tough to chain together attack combos, execute well-timed counters to keep chains alive, and periodically switch to finishing moves performed by pressing a pair of face buttons.</p><p dir="ltr">Redline was fierce and swift, taking down groups of four or more enemies at a time with regularity. I could also use a trigger button to spray-paint enemies huddled around me, much like Batman's cap stun attack. The paint would stick to the enemies and the environment, giving it a nice visual touch in which you literally left your mark on a brawl. I could shoot whenever I wanted to, but it's not a shooter. The guns were best used as combo finishers, which you can see stylish examples of in the trailer above.</p><p dir="ltr">While the game won't necessarily be "easy," it's not meant to send you beating your head into a wall. With people's busy schedules in mind, a developer told me the studio wants players to be able to play for just a short while and feel like they've made progress. If you come home from work and only have a little time to play games, you should be able to load up Spine, crack a few skulls, and feel like you've accomplished something in your short timeframe. And for players who do want more of a challenge, the game will offer a mode in which you have to avoid taking any damage <em>at all</em>. Good luck with that.</p><p dir="ltr">I liked Sifu, but more on the merits of its art direction, story, and, sure, how good the combat looked when I could pull it off. But Spine made me feel just as powerful without the accompanying frustrations, and personally, I'm way more up for that kind of experience. Whereas some games of this sort leave me feeling like a nameless goon at times, Spine made me feel like one of Keanu Reeves' punchiest roles.</p><p dir="ltr">Spine comes to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2026.</p>

            <p>
The Chinese Room's impressively choreographed oil rig horror <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/still-wakes-the-deep">Still Wakes the Deep</a> is making a return, in a brand-new bit of story DLC that'll pick up the action almost a decade after the events of the main game. It's called Siren's Rest, and it's coming to all platforms on 18th June.
</p>
<p>
Still Wakes the Deep's original story transported players back to 1975 and the wonderfully realised Beira D oil rig, located somewhere off the coast of Scotland in the churning North Sea. Eventually, it became clear that unknown forces had dubious designs on the Beira D's crew, and thus began a very difficult day in the life of electrician Cameron McLeary.
</p>
<p>
If you haven't played the main game, you might want to stop reading here, as introducing Siren's Rest requires revealing the fate of Beira D and its crew. You see, Still Wakes the Deep's story DLC time jumps forward over a decade to 1986 when a specialist diving team journeys to the site of the oil rig, now far below the waves. Armed with a cutting torch, crowbar, and camera, this new team is attempting to piece together the final moments of the Beira D, but it just might transpire those unknowable forces aren't quite done playing just yet.

"The Beira D is now a groaning steel catacomb interred in the inky depths of the North Sea," The Chinese Room teases in its announcement. "What really happened that December day in 1975, when communications to the mainland were severed and the rig sank without a trace? What answers can be given to families who still grieve, ten years on?"
</p>
<p>
Siren's Rest, which will supposedly offer around 1.5-2 hours of playtime, has a new writer in Sagar Beroshi (they previously served as narrative designer on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>), and a brand-new cast to go with its brand-new crew. Lois Chimimba (Doctor Who, Shetland) stars as protagonist Mhairi alongside Lorn Macdonald (Bridgerton, The Lazarus Project) and David Menkin (<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a>), and Kate Saxon is once again on voice directing duties, which bodes well given the stellar performances in the main game.

I wasn't entirely sold on Still Wakes the Deep's design <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/still-wakes-the-deep-review">when I reviewed it last year</a>, but there was no questioning its often astonishing artistry - and I'd be lying if I said the haunting fate of the Beira D's crew hadn't stuck with me. So I'm genuinely intrigued to see how Siren's Rest expands on what's come before with its new team and some 80s swagger.
</p>
<p>
Still Wakes the Deep's Siren's Rest DLC launches for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (via Steam and Epic) next Wednesday, 18th June, and it'll cost £9.99/€12.99/$12.99 USD.

		<p><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/konami">Konami</a> has confirmed that <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/metal-gear-online">Metal Gear Online</a> isn’t making a comeback following speculation from its recent Summer Games Fest teaser. Instead, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> will see the debut of a new multiplayer experience within the MGS universe: Fox Hunt.</p>
<p>This is a completely original mode and one that has a clear focus on hiding and using camouflage, no doubt inspired by the popular “prop hunt” subgenre. According to Konami, they assessed whether to created another Metal Gear Online title but ultimately decided against it due to the changing landscape of modern multiplayer games.</p>


<p>That’s not all that was revealed during Konami Press Start. The publisher fully revealed its Snake vs. Monkey crossover mode which will be exclusive to the PlayStation 5 and Steam versions of the game. Meanwhile, Xbox users can test their skill in a new original Snake vs. Bomberman mode. In additional, the Secret Theatre feature will return with players able to collect special clips and videos dropped by enemies in-game.</p>
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is Konami’s hotly anticipated remake of 2004’s stealth action prequel, Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. Originally developed by Kojima Productions, the game is being rebuilt from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5 by one of Konami’s internal studios, in collaboration with Virtuos who recently launched The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered. Like any good remake, Delta will retain the iconic story, characters, and level designs of Snake Eater while significantly enhancing visuals and introducing gameplay improvements and quality of life features to better accommodate modern audiences.</p>
<p>MGS3 isn’t a direct sequel to Metal Gear Solid: Sons of Liberty. Instead it dials the clock way back to the times of Cold War tensions between Russia and the United States with Naked Snake (Big Boss) dropping behind enemy lines with little more than a survival knife.</p>

<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will launch on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on August 28th, 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/date-everything<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Date Everything! Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156765/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/date_everything">Date Everything!</a> is a dating simulator where the dateable people are actually objects, or inanimates, that exist around your home.</p>
<p>You begin Date Everything at work, where you are a recent customer service hire at Valdivian, a major tech company. Almost as soon as your work day begins, you’re informed that your job is being made redundant by AI and that you won't be needed any longer. Then, you receive a mysterious package via a drone at your window: a pair of glasses, dubbed “dateviators”, that allow you to see your home in a whole new light, namely that it’s filled with attractive suitors otherwise known as your furniture.</p>
<p>Each in-game day, you are able to talk to five different inanimates. Through NPC conversations and quests that last anywhere from one to sometimes well over ten encounters, you can earn one of three endings: love, friendship, or hate.</p>
<figure><a title="Date Everything! Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156766/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Every ending nets you five SPECS (Smarts, Poise, Empathy, Charm, Sass) that unlock certain dialogue options and can eventually allow you to “realise” inanimates, turning them into fully fledged human beings that can embark on exciting lives in the real world. While you explore these new horizons, you also receive occasional updates from work, the mysterious figure who gifted you the dateviators, and your friend, Sam.</p>
<p>I'll note here that Date Everything's overall tone is pretty silly and not to be taken too seriously, but I still had a hard time buying into the foundational circumstances of the game. It seems like you are meant to be playing as a younger, recentish grad (with a BFA in Customer Service), but you also apparently own your own home featuring a large bedroom, a home office, a fitness room, a kitchen with a separate dining room, an attic with a safe that has literal cash in it, and even a piano. I was able to suspend my disbelief enough to go on a date with my dishware, but this was a stretch too far for me.</p>
<figure><a title="Date Everything! Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156763/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Speaking of dates, the name Date Everything is not an exaggeration. There are 100 NPCs that are fully voiced. Everything from furniture to substances like water and even your nightmares are generally quite willing to pursue romantic entanglements with you, the owner of the house.</p>
<p>A truly star-studded cast lends its considerable talents to the fully voiced dialogue and scenarios, bringing to life incredibly fun and creative character designs. The best part of the game for me was shooting little hearts at a new piece of furniture to see how Sassy Chap Games chose to depict things like a couch, a laundry hamper, or a furnace.</p>
<p>100 characters is an impressive amount, but it did lead to some interactions shining through more and left others feeling shallow and rushed. I particularly enjoyed the trope-y drama of Lux and Eddie, the house’s electrical box residents, as well as some of the stranger beings like Nightmare, Daemon, and xxXShadowl0rd420Xxx.</p>
<figure><a title="Date Everything! Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156769/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>There are many times where multiple NPCs appear during dialogues or where I was sent to converse with one character in order to complete another’s questline. These moments really illustrated the interconnectedness and community of the house. However, there were times that a character would show up in these moments and seem to not know me even though we had previously met.</p>
<p>There were also some uncomfortable elements that felt underexplored. I was romantically involved with 59 inanimates, and the lack of reaction from any of them about my other flings felt a little out of place, especially since some of the characters express strong feelings about monogamy, polyamory, and cheating. It just felt like, in the context of these conversations, the characters' preferences should have played a stronger role in my relationship with them.</p>
<p>While there are a lot of potential triggers and uncomfortable scenarios, the game's content warning system is really thoughtful and effective. Whenever a potential trigger arises, Skylar—the inanimate affiliated with the dateviators—pops up to offer to skip past interacting with the potentially triggering material. I appreciated the care that went into this particular system but would have loved a little more nuance in my actual relationships throughout the game.</p>
<figure><a title="Date Everything! Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156762/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I had some performance issues throughout that did significantly impact my play experience on the Nintendo Switch. I was often unable to interact with objects, like drawers or faucets, that I needed to use to progress the game. I would sometimes reload to find everything I had tried to interact with suddenly open. During dialogue, I experienced repeated scenes and chat options that didn’t apply to the actual conversation. Later in the game, I began to experience frequent full-blown crashes that required me to reload entirely. Luckily, Date Everything’s autosave runs pretty often.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Date Everything provides an ideal dating simulator recipe: charming characters, a light-hearted tone, and an incredibly disturbing premise. Unfortunately, performance issues at launch also provided a significant obstacle, and I had a hard time getting over some of the narrative ups and downs.</p>
<p>There’s certainly a lot to sink your teeth into with Date Everything, which took me a little over 40 hours to complete, but I was left wondering if all the time spent was really worth it for the level of depth the game provides.</p></section>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/spine-preview-gun-fu-more-like-fun-fu</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/spine-preview-gun-fu-more-like-fun-fu.1216521/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/spine-preview-gun-fu-more-like-fun-fu<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Spine&nbsp;</em>is a gun fu-style action game developed by Nekki, known for the <em>Shadow Fight</em>&nbsp;series. Nekki, a team composed of animation fans, wanted to push its games to the next level by going hard on animations. Deeply inspired by creators like John Woo and films such as&nbsp;<em>John Wick, Spine</em>&nbsp;is an exhilarating one-stop shop for all things action.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We were able to get some hands-on time with&nbsp;<em>Spine&nbsp;</em>during Summer Game Fest 2025. With a developer sitting by my side during the duration, I learned&nbsp;enough about&nbsp;<em>Spine&nbsp;</em>to have me eagerly anticipating its eventual release.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>A Strong Backbone&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Described as a "rollercoaster of gun-fu,"&nbsp;<em>Spine</em>&nbsp;is an adrenaline junky's dream. While much of its inspiration comes from the aforementioned film and filmmakers, the gameplay takes notes from the highly coveted&nbsp;<em>Batman: Arkham</em>&nbsp;series.</p>

<p>Nekki is succeeding creating fluid combat that made&nbsp;<em>Batman: Arkham</em>&nbsp;such a hit. Non-stop, weighty but smooth fighting against seemingly insurmountable odds.&nbsp;<em>Spine</em>'s badass heroine takes on dozens of armed thugs without flinching, fulfilling the power fantasy that lingers in all of us.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The demo essentially guides us through a series of enemy encounters. In a tense cutscene taking place within a bar, shit goes down and heroine Redline jumps into the fray. Armed thugs try to surround her, but her reflexes are superhuman with her "Spine" implant. Like&nbsp;<em>Batman: Arkham</em>, there's a notification when you're about to get hit, giving you time to act.</p>



<p>Though,&nbsp;<em>Spine</em>&nbsp;is very proactive in combat rather than reactive. Instead of waiting for the enemy, you need to jump in and take them out. Beat them up enough and you can do a cinematic finisher involving your gun and/or fists. In many of these brutal executions, she takes these goons out with a close-ranged shot to the head.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In combat, you're also able to use your pistol on enemies no matter the range.&nbsp;<em>Spine</em>&nbsp;does ask you to suspend your disbelief a bit -- pistols don't seem to do as much damage as your punches -- but it's fun to string a few shots together while beating down on enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Locked and Loaded</h2>

<p>During one sequence in the demo, the camera perspective changes from typical third-person POV to overhead. Fans of&nbsp;<em>John Wick 4</em>&nbsp;will immediately see the similarities, and it's just an exhilarating sequence as the music ramps up and you utilize a powerful shotgun against your foes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is but one instance where developer Nekki hopes to surprise players by introducing new spectacles. A scene where you control Redline from the perspective of CCTV footage was teased, which sounds like another exciting scene.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Previously I mentioned shotgun, so know that there isn't just a pistol --&nbsp; there are other weapons too.&nbsp;<em>Spine</em>&nbsp;will feature four main styles of gun fu, so depending on your weapon, your moveset changes a bit. Though, in the case of the shotgun, its ammo is limited. The pistol, however, seems to remain with you when you run out of shotgun (or other weapon types') ammo.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Though it doesn't seem like a requirement to do well in combat,&nbsp;<em>Spine&nbsp;</em>also features a parry system. You can parry regular, non-projectile attacks, but for some enemies with guns, you can also counter those. In some instances, you're able to chain together these parries and take out multiple foes in quick succession, which is immensely satisfying.</p>



<h2><em>Spine&nbsp;</em>Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Our demo ends with a boss battle against a spindly agent with night vision goggles akin to spider eyes. The spider theme is fitting here, as while we dodge the boss's sword attacks, spider mines start coming out, which is another element to dodge around and avoid.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's a tough fight, but one Redline is more than equipped to deal with. It's a satisfying conclusion to the relatively quick demo. There isn't a single dull moment in&nbsp;<em>Spine</em>, and I hope the rest of the game is just the same way. The developer is aiming for around 10 hours of play, which sounds like the perfect length for a bombastic game such as this.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizkids-announces-official-dungeons-dragons-potato-head-beholder-miniature-coming-to<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizkids has announced an official <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> Potato Head Beholder miniature. After creating a Potato Head toy based on the iconic monster, the studio is producing a miniature version for gaming tables and selling it exclusively at the Origins Game Fair.</p>



<p>According to an official press release, there will be two versions of the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Potato Head Beholder miniature. The first of these miniatures is an event-exclusive version for those attending Origins Game Fair this year. Origins Game Fair is one of the oldest tabletop conventions in the industry, and it is hosted by one of the biggest tabletop associations, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/gama-expo-will-be-moving-to-baltimore-in-future" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GAMA</a>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dungeons-dragons-potato-head-beholder-event-miniature.jpg?itok=V-Mz5bhl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dungeons-dragons-potato-head-beholder-event-miniature.jpg?itok=j-ie3NXh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As the promo box art illustrates, buyers are getting exactly what it says on the cover. It's a miniature of a Beholder, one of the scariest monsters in the world's most popular TTRPG, reimagined in a fun, more starchy form. Much like the Potato Head toyline, the miniature even includes attachable accessories to make the monster your own.</p>

<p>There's even an air of hilarity with this version of the miniature sporting a wizard's hat. Beholders in the world of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> are terrifying creatures. They are highly intelligent, incredibly vain, and can cast a deadly arsenal of rays from their eye stalks. But the one thing they cannot do, no matter what, is cast magic. Just don't say that to one unless you want to end up a pile of ash.</p>

This version is a more conventional take on the Potato Head monster concept. It includes the more iconic Potato Head accessories like the top hat, moustache, and giant glasses. It also has a set of scary teeth if your DM wants to make it especially mean.</p>

<p>The retail version of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons Potato Head Beholder miniature is available for pre-order now.</p>

There’s more nuance to this, though. For status ailments like poison and frostbite, the build-up bar on the Executor must be depleted completely before Tenacity’s buffs take effect. For other more immediate ailments like Blood Loss and Madness, Tenacity will activate right away.</p><h2 id="h732632"><a id="2"></a>Ability: Cursed Sword</h2><figure id="" data-id="2e95beef0f070a3124e5662707ddef6e" data-recommend-id="image://2e95beef0f070a3124e5662707ddef6e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Executor approaches an enemy with their sword at the ready." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Executor approaches an enemy with their sword at the ready." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2e95beef0f070a3124e5662707ddef6e" data-recommend-id="image://2e95beef0f070a3124e5662707ddef6e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Executor approaches an enemy with their sword at the ready." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Executor’s character skill is called Cursed Sword. When activated, the Executor will unsheathe his sword and assume a special stance. His movement speed will decrease, but he can now parry almost any attack. However, he cannot deflect magical projectiles and grabs, so be sure to dodge those.</p><p>When parrying attacks, damage will be negated and enemies will suffer stance damage, making them more susceptible to guard breaks and critical hits. After several deflections, his sword will start glowing, making his attacks stronger. You can also use the Weapon Skill to make the Executor do a powerful sword dash attack, depleting the glow.</p><p>Cursed Sword is also a bit different from other character skills. The ability has no cooldown period and the Executor can go into and out of his special stance at any time. Any charge that’s built up in the sword is preserved, even if you exit out of Cursed Sword or die. The only time the charge goes away is when he uses the Weapon Skill.</p><h2 id="h732633"><a id="3"></a>Ultimate Art: Aspects of the Crucible: Beast</h2><p>The Executor’s Ultimate Art is called Aspects of the Crucible: Beast. Here, the Executor unleashes his inner alpha and turns into a gigantic monster. In this form, the Executor attacks with huge arms, covering a wide arc and dealing tons of damage. The block button also becomes a roar, which can help fight enemies from long-range. The Ultimate Art gauge will automatically deplete as he’s in this form until it runs out and he turns back to normal.</p><figure id="" data-id="4d66927311a04d3fddabf7b49d6d9b57" data-recommend-id="image://4d66927311a04d3fddabf7b49d6d9b57" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Executor attacks an enemy as a beast." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Executor attacks an enemy as a beast." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4d66927311a04d3fddabf7b49d6d9b57" data-recommend-id="image://4d66927311a04d3fddabf7b49d6d9b57" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Executor attacks an enemy as a beast." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Turning into the beast will also temporarily increase the Executor’s HP and fully restore it. The beast can also be utilized defensively, as he can constantly attack his teammates to revive them. However, he’s not invincible and can still be downed while in this form, so don’t be too reckless.</p><p>His Weapon Skill in this form sees him charging an energy blade and slicing in front of him, inflicting some big damage. This will automatically drain the entire Ultimate Art gauge, so only use it when the form is about to end.</p><h2 id="h732634"><a id="4"></a>A look at the Executor’s attributes</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>HP</strong>: B</li><li><strong>FP</strong>: D</li><li><strong>Stamina</strong>: B</li><li><strong>Strength</strong>: C</li><li><strong>Dexterity</strong>: S</li><li><strong>Intelligence</strong>: D</li><li><strong>Faith</strong>: D</li><li><strong>Arcane</strong>: S</li></ul><p>The Executor’s best stats are Dexterity and Arcane, which makes katanas his weapons of choice. Not only do they scale well with dexterity, but the Executor’s high Arcane stat impacts how fast status ailments build up on enemies. While on your runs, be sure to pick up a weapon that can inflict a status infect and watch enemies crumble.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-wylder-guide-onslaught-claw-shot-1851783361&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-wylder-guide-onslaught-claw-shot-1851783361"><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>: A Beginner’s Guide To Mastering Wylder</a></span></p><p>The Executor takes a while to learn and isn’t beginner friendly <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-wylder-guide-onslaught-claw-shot-1851783361&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-wylder-guide-onslaught-claw-shot-1851783361">like the Wylder class is</a></span>.

At one point, it looked like the player-count for Stellar Blade would be negatively impacted due to an unknown issue that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stellar-blade-on-pc-has-been-blocked-in-over-130-countries-catching-its-developer-by-surprise/1100-6531596/" data-ref-id="1100-6531596">prevented it from being sold in dozens of countries</a>, but that problem was addressed before launch.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VyeH5uteVk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_VyeH5uteVk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>If you're interested in trying out this action-RPG, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-pc-version-of-stellar-blade-has-a-steam-demo/1100-6531966/">a Stellar Blade demo</a> is available on Steam.
