			<p>Although a PlayStation 5 version of FromSoftware's Bloodborne is nowhere in sight, a recent listing rekindles hope for an enhanced port or remaster.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bloodborne/comments/1dzpav0/playstation_stars_showing_ps5_version_for_the_old/">Bloodborne subreddit</a>, a PlayStation 5 version of The Old Hunters DLC expansion is being listed as one of the rewards of the revamped PlayStation Stars rewards program that is set to launch in select regions in a few hours. Unfortunately, the rewards program is still offline in Italy, so I wasn't able to verify the information, but multiple users on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-stars-showing-ps5-version-for-the-old-hunters.923514/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ResetERA</a> confirmed the listing is still up. Sadly, it's more likely a listing error, but it would definitely be wild for one of the most requested PlayStation 4 to PlayStation 5 ports to be revealed in such a manner.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bloodborne-PS5.png"></a></figure>

<p>Despite having been released almost ten years ago, Bloodborne continues to be among the most beloved and the most popular action role-playing games developed by FromSoftware. The game saw <a href="https://wccftech.com/huge-spike-in-player-count-for-bloodborne-before-elden-ring-dlc/">a huge player spike</a> following the release of the Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree DLC expansion, and getting it to run on <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-4-emulator-shadps4-bloodborne/">PC via emulation</a> seems to have become the main goal of the PlayStation 4 emulation scene. Hopefully, Sony will see how much the game continues to be popular and finally releases the PS5 and PC port that so many have been asking for for years.</p>

			<p>The wait for Call of Duty Modern Warfare III on Microsoft's Game Pass subscription service is nearly over, at least according to a new report from insider Tom Henderson. The report <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/modern-warfare-3-is-set-to-come-to-xbox-game-pass-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">says</a> the game will be added to the library later this month and goes on to state that the original plan was to announce it alongside the Game Pass price increase news that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> a few hours ago, likely in an attempt to soften the blow. The official announcement may come later today.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the Xbox Game Pass for console service will be closed off to new users (existing members with automatic payment renewal will be able to continue with their current subscription). At the same time, starting today for new users and September 12 for existing users, there will be price increases for the Core option (from $59.99 annually to $74.99, although the monthly option remains at $9.99), for the PC option (from $9.99 monthly to $11.99), and for the Ultimate option (from $16.99 to $19.99). A new option called Xbox Game Pass Standard will be priced at $14.99 monthly, but it will only include access to a back catalog of games and access to online multiplayer on Xbox consoles.</p>
<p>Call of Duty Modern Warfare III launched on November 10, 2023. It was made primarily by Sledgehammer Games, although the Zombies mode and Ranked Play multiplayer were handled by Treyarch, and other studios connected to the franchise, like Infinity Ward, Raven Software, Beenox, and High Moon Studios, all contributed.</p>
<p>The game didn't have as much of a success as Activision would have wanted. Fans <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-sees-huge-criticism-from-gamers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">criticized</a> it from the very start, and sales <a href="https://wccftech.com/cod-modern-warfare-3-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">significantly decreased</a> compared to 2022's Modern Warfare II, although the publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/modern-warfare-3-registers-record-engagement-for-new-trilogy-says-activision-twds-rick-michonne-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highlighted</a> 'record levels of engagement in the new trilogy'.</p>
<p>Call of Duty Modern Warfare III launched Season 4 'Reloaded' in late June, adding new maps, modes, playlists, weapons, events, and more. It is the second Activision Blizzard game to be added to Game Pass following Diablo IV.</p>

<p>Jayson Tatum of the Boston Celtics will be the cover athlete on the Standard Edition. A’ja Wilson is the cover athlete for the WNBA Edition. Both of these athletes will be featured together on the All-Star Edition. Finally, Vince Carter is NBA 2K25’s Hall of Fame Edition cover athlete.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The dual-featured cover with Tatum and Wilson marks the first time the series will include both an NBA and WNBA athlete together. </p>



<p>Though NBA 2K 25 launches in September, NBA 2K also revealed pre-order times for different platforms in a <a href="https://x.com/NBA2K/status/1811006712964600120" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">follow-up tweet</a>. </p>



<p>Xbox fans can pre-order the game now. PlayStation fans can pre-order at 7 am PT, and Nintendo Switch players can pre-order at 10 am PT.</p>

            <p>The open world action game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-outlaws-release-date-details-everything-we-know">Star Wars Outlaws</a> is coming out next month and developer Massive Entertainment have already shown off some of the speeder biking and laser-trading in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-outlaws-release-date-details-everything-we-know">various trailers</a>. But recently they've spoken a little more about the player's scummy travels across the galaxy, including how big some of the explorable planets will be, and what happens when you piss off the Hutts. In short, you're going to have a price on your head. Makes sense. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>“Your reputation moving in the positive direction unlocks a lot of things for you,” says Mathias Karlson, game director at Masssive, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-wants-to-be-your-dream-open-galaxy-ign-first">telling IGN</a> all about the various factions in the game. Cosying up to the Hutts, Pykes, Ashiga Clan, and Crimson Dawn will let you enter certain zones without being treated as hostile, for example, or it could unlock landing pads in new places. It might also get you discounts with the more rogueish traders, leading to some "exotic rewards". </p>
<p>"But if you really get on their bad side, that's another thing that you'll feel dynamically in the game because they actually send hit squads out for you in the open world to try and take you out.”</p>
<p>Sounds like some of that emergent gameplay I've heard so much about. But it goes the other way too, with good reputation sometimes causing momentary allies during a fight, says Karlson.</p>
<p>“If you've, for whatever reason, ended up wanted and you're being chased by the Empire, and you cross paths with a syndicate that you have a really good reputation with at the moment, they might join in and help you out,” he says.</p>
<p>That sounds familiar. The Division series (Massive's previous work) often sees different factions getting into small gunfights with one another, and Far Cry's warring freedom fighters often get into scrapes with the enemy when you're around. But neither is fully tied to a reputation system. The hit squads sound interesting too, but again this may remindsome folk of the mercenaries that would hunt you down in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-odyssey">Assassin's Creed Odyssey</a>, for example. Don't get me wrong, open world Star Wars sounds cool. But this is an Ubisoft game after all, and they are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-outlaws-feels-about-as-han-solo-ish-as-well-an-ubisoft-open-world-game">not ones to stray from a formula</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the IGN video, the developers talk about the scale of the planets you'll be zipping across. They compare the size of some planets to two or three zones in Assassin's Creed Odyssey and say you can cross the playable surface of one of these planets, Toshara, by speeder bike in about five minutes.</p>
<p>"[It] doesn't sound like a lot," says Julian Gerighty, creative director at Massive, "but once you're committed it's a fairly large amount and you are always going to be distracted."</p>
<p>Some of that distraction might come in the form of geographical easter eggs, scenery and locales that fans are probably keen to go an visit.</p>
<p>“We can lean into the virtual tourism aspect of, ‘Hey, what is the distance between the moisture farms and Mos Eisley and the cantina?” says Gerighty. “There is a linear roller coaster story, a golden path, if you will. And around that, of course, there's the open world.</p>
<p>"There's a very structured intro that leads you to crash land on Toshara, which is a moon that we created with LucasFilm Games,” he says. “And once you finish the sort of linear narrative on Toshara, the other planets open up and it becomes completely non-linear and you can choose to tackle those [worlds] in any order you want."</p>
<p>Everything I see about Star Wars Outlaws reminds me how much I enjoy the visual design of Lucas' bonkers interstellar opera. But I also have no illusions as to the icon safari usually offered by Ubisoft open worlds. So consider my eye pleased, yet expectations unmoved. The IGN video, on the other hand, is pretty exhaustive and contains an impressive amount of tidbits, so it is worth watching if you're rubbing your Mon Calamari mittens with anticipatory glee. </p>

            <p>
The maker of Pokémon-like monster fighter Palworld has founded a new company, Palworld Entertainment, designed to "accelerate the multifaceted global development" of the game and the brand's further expansion. 
</p>
<p>
Palworld Entertainment is a joint venture with investment from the game's developer Pocketpair and Sony, through its Sony Music Entertainment and Aniplex brands.
</p>
<p>
The latter will stock new Palworld merchandise via Aniplex Online - which should be good news for anyone wanting plush toy versions of their Pals.

<p>
Pocketpair's choice of business partner here to expand the Palworld brand is somewhat ironic, seeing as Palworld launched as an Xbox console exclusive via Game Pass. 
</p>
<p>
That said, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-community-manager-teases-ps5-version">Palworld fans believe a PlayStation release is on the cards</a> following a tease last month by the game's community manager, which appeared to hint at the game arriving on Sony platforms in future.
</p>
<p>
Last month saw <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-gets-new-island-and-more-in-sakurajima-update">the arrival of Palworld's major Sakurajima update</a>, which added a new island and dedicated Xbox servers. 
</p>
<p>
Palworld launched to an enormous 25 million players back in February, many of whom were drawn in by the game's close comparisons to the Nintendo-exclusive Pokémon. (There's no suggestion Palworld is set to arrive on Switch anytime soon.)
</p>
<p>
Still, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-never-followed-up-on-palworld-legal-threat-developer-reveals">Pokémon never followed up on Palworld legal threat</a>, Pocketpair has now said.

<p>Microsoft is set to launch Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 in Xbox Game Pass later this month.</p>



<p>The 2023 Call of Duty title will mark the first of the older Call of Duty games coming to Xbox Game Pass. Developed by Sledgehammer Games, the game generally received positive reviews from the community, but critics found its single-player content too short and lackluster.</p>



<p>It’s understood that the announcement could come as soon as today, which is believed to have been the original plan for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-is-raising-xbox-game-pass-prices-by-as-much-as-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Game Pass price increases and changes</a>. The subscription service price increased by as much as 25% in some regions.</p>



<p>Starting on July 10, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate will jump from $16.99 to $19.99 monthly, a $3 increase. PC Game Pass subscriptions will jump from $9.99 to $11.99 per month and continue to give you access to day-one releases.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming couldn’t verify an exact release date by the time of publication, but several sources have suggested it will be in the latter half of this month. Last week, several new claims said that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-activision-august/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">older Activision games will start to come to the subscription service later this month</a>, including Crash Bandicoot N.Sane Trilogy.</p>



<p>Are you happy that Modern Warfare 3 is making its way to Xbox Game Pass? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

NBA 2K25 will feature three separate cover athletes across four distinct covers, depending on which edition you choose. In addition to revealing the cover art, 2K also provided the first screenshots and high-level details on the upgrades players can expect.</p>

<p>Headlining the cover star lineup is Boston Celtics forward Jayson Tatum. The 26-year-old Tatum is a five-time All-Star, a Gold Medalist at the 2020 Olympic Games, a member of the U.S. Men's National Team for the 2024 Olympic Games, and is coming off his first NBA Championship. Tatum lands on the NBA 2K25 Standard Edition.</p>

</article><p>Meanwhile, those who purchase the NBA 2K25 WNBA Edition will see Las Vegas Aces forward A'ja Wilson on their cover. Wilson is coming off back-to-back championships with the Aces. She won the Finals MVP honors for the 2023 Championship and is a two-time WNBA MVP and a six-time All-Star. Wilson also took home a Gold Medal at the 2020 Olympic Games and will again represent the United States at the 2024 Olympic Games. Together, Tatum and Wilson co-headline the NBA 2K25 All-Star Edition.</p>

<p>The final NBA 2K25 cover athlete is a recent Hall of Fame inductee, eight-time NBA All-Star, and the winner of the legendary 2000 NBA Dunk Contest, Vince Carter. Carter graces the cover of the NBA 2K25 Hall of Fame Edition. You can see all four covers below.</p>



<p>This year's entry signals the return of the MyCareer mode with fresh updates and new MyTeam modes. For the new-gen versions on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (for those with compatible specs), players can expect an added sixth era in MyNBA, a more compact and interactive City, and the return of the women's-focused mode The W. Crossplay will also be offered on newer-gen versions.</p>

			<p>Palworld studio Pocketpair has partnered with Sony Music Entertainment and Sony-owned media company Aniplex to establish Palworld Entertainment Inc.</p>
<p>Pocketpair, Sony, and Aniplex announced the joint venture earlier today through <a href="https://www.sme.co.jp/en/pressrelease/news/detail/NEWS001864.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an official press release</a> from Sony Music Entertainment (Japan) Inc. According to the press release, the joint venture aims to expand the Palworld IP outside of the game itself. "The [joint venture] will be responsible for developing the reach of the intellectual property and for expanding commercial business endeavors, including the global licensing and merchandising activities associated with "Palworld," outside of the interactive game", the press release reads.</p>
<p>According to the release, the joint venture will kick off with the development of exclusive merchandise based on the game. This merchandise will debut at the Pocketpair booth during “Bilibili World 2024” (beginning Friday, July 12, 2024 in Shanghai, China).</p>
<p>On X, the official Palworld X account <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_JP/status/1810850675980652849" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> the following:</p>
<p>"Pocket Pair is pleased to announce that in order to accelerate the diversified development of "PAL WORLD" around the world and further expand the IP, the three companies, Pocket Pair, Sony Music Entertainment, and Aniplex have agreed to establish "PAL WORLD Entertainment Co., Ltd."!</p>
<p>Despite <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-ps5-tease/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teases about a PS5 version of Palworld</a>, the 'Pokemon with Guns' title is currently only available on PC and Xbox Series. Interestingly, back in March of this year, Palworld creator Takuro Mizobe already suggested that he would be open for a partnership or an acquisition.</p>
<p>Palworld is available worldwide now for PC and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <p>Rocksteady has delayed the release of Suicide Squad Kill the Justice League's second season.</p>
<p>The second season was set to kick off tomorrow, 11th July. It will now start on 25th July.</p>
<p>"Thank you for your patience," the developer wrote in a short post on social media platform X last night. It did not give a reason for this delay</p>

<p>The upcoming season is set to bring Mr Freeze's wife, Nora, into the fray. Along with this new playable character, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League's second season will also add new weapons, another map and two episodes with suitably chilly names: Frozen Hearts and Winter.</p>
<p>Rocksteady still has another two seasons planned for the future, as laid out in a <a href="https://twitter.com/suicidesquadRS/status/1749494429768146999">roadmap shared earlier this year</a>, with more playable characters and gear to come.</p> <div>

<p>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League failed to take off the way Rocksteady and publisher Warner Bros. had hoped. Back in February of this year, Warner Bros. Discovery's chief financial officer Gunnar Wiedenfels said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-fails-to-meet-warner-bros-expectations">Rocksteady's release had "fallen short" of its expectations</a>. Warner Bros. went on to attribute a $200m revenue loss to Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League.</p>
<p>A report then followed in July which stated a culture of perfectionism, an ill-suited genre pivot, and a constantly shifting vision were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-flopped-due-to-perfectionism-and-ill-suited-genre-pivot-report">key reasons for the live-service game's failure</a>.</p>

<p>"Rocksteady's talent is so evident in Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, it almost overcomes the terrible decision to try and make it," our Chris wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review">Eurogamer's Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League review</a>. He awarded it three out of five stars.</p>

Sonic Team head Takashi Iizuka would love to make a Sonic RPG before he retires from Sega, though that's just a dream.
</p>
<p>
Iizuka was interviewed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNeWQbiawnk">YouTube channel Good Vibes Gaming</a> for a preview of the forthcoming Sonic x Shadow Generations and discussed whether he'd ever work on a Sonic RPG in future.
</p>
<p>
"Personally, I really like role-playing games," he said. "The RPG game format is a lot of fun and I've even thought to myself 'you know, for the past 30 years we haven't done a Sonic RPG'. And I'm questioning myself. 'Why haven't we done a Sonic RPG in all this time? How have we gotten to 30 years with no RPGs?!'

<p>
"So I'd like to hopefully work on a Sonic RPG at some point before I retire from Sega. But you know, that's just a dream right now. There are no concrete plans at this point."
</p>
<p>
Of course, there has been a Sonic RPG in the past - Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood released on Nintendo DS - but this was developed by Mass Effect and Dragon Age studio BioWare.
</p>
<p>
But Sonic Team making an official Sonic RPG would be huge. There's precedent there too, as the studio have worked on RPGs in the past, in particular the Phantasy Star series. 
</p>
<p>
And that's before you bring in the long-running Mario rivalry - if the moustachioed plumber can star in Square Enix's Super Mario RPG and the ongoing Paper Mario series, why can't Sonic try his hand at turn-based battles?
</p>
<p>
Could we explore a fully open Sonic world? Would Sonic transform into Super Sonic for powerful moves? Would Knuckles summon the Chaotix crew? How would speed affect battles? Would there be classes, or romances? There are so many possibilities!
</p>
<p>
I recently went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-x-shadow-generations-is-the-best-of-00s-sonic-with-a-big-dash-of-nostalgia">hands-on with Sonic x Shadow Generations</a> myself and spoke to Iizuka about why Shadow has become such an enduring character, how Sonic Frontiers has influenced the remaster, and whether Shadow will wield a gun.

</p>
<p>
Also, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-x-shadow-generations-appears-to-be-teasing-another-secret-character">could there be a secret fourth playable character</a>?
</p>
<p>
Sonic x Shadow Generations is set for release on 25th October across PlayStation and Xbox consoles, and PC (Epic and Steam).

			<p>Infinite Inside is a game experience that is overwhelming and atmospheric. This Mixed Reality/VR title is an environmental puzzler that brings the environmental puzzles into your home, and its thoughtful, mysterious world is the perfect setting for an intriguing adventure through space and time.</p>
<p><iframe title="Infinite Inside | Cinematic Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZLxaHT_1Wl0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Depending on where you play, Infinite Inside becomes something of a different experience. If you’re lucky enough to be playing on an <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/apple-vision-pro">Apple Vision Pro</a>, or the latest of the Meta Quest family of headsets (I predominantly played the game on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/meta-quest-3">Quest 3</a>), you can experience the game directly in your home by utilising the passthrough features that allow you to see the world around you. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/psvr-2">PSVR 2</a> and SteamVR players meanwhile will have to settle for a fully VR experience, though the fundamental puzzling that lies at the heart of the game remains exactly the same.</p>


<p>While Infinite Inside can be played stationary, this is a game that really benefits from a room scale setting, though thankfully you won’t really need that much space overall to get the most out of it. A briefcase appears on the floor of your room, and from it springs a monolithic stone structure, the Plinth, replete with drawers, doors, and open sections that allow you to see the consistently changing world within.</p>


<p>This monolith is the literal centre of Infinite Inside, and walking around it in real time gives it a remarkable sense of weight and realism. The draws, easily grasped and opened by their handles, feel like they’re genuinely there, and have the high-class feel of an expensive kitchen drawer or cabinet. Whatever your cutlery draw is like, it probably doesn’t house the kinds of conundrums you soon find yourself involved in. Unless a spatula has wedged itself at a strange angle, that is.</p>
<p>There is a man. I came to call him Tiny Little Man, and latterly Humfrey, but at times, he’s not tiny, he’s the same size as you. His statue becomes a key to shifting between the real world and the internal world of the Plinth, and once inside it, you see the spectre of the Tiny Little Man exploring it in much the same way you are. Sometimes he leads you in the right direction, or teaches you how to interact with something, while at others he seems lost, bereft with his seeming incarceration within this shifting tower. At times he lurks near the edge of the abyss, and I genuinely worried just what might befall him. I forgot to worry about myself.</p>

<p>Much of the puzzling, both within and without the tower, revolves around collecting parts of an object and then putting them together in the right way. At first this is a simple, straightforward object that’s been split into pieces, but soon they balloon to take in more parts, and in more complicated configurations. It’s very reminiscent of Cubism, which has been a highlight of the Quest library for a long time, but which the Meta Quest 3’s improved passthrough has made the most of in recent months.</p>
<p>Infinite Inside is a much more extensive experience than that though, and shifting between the real world and the Escher-esque landscape inside never ceases to impress. The enigmatic and moving soundtrack from Steven Coltart certainly helps, its plaintive tones echoing through both the real world and the fictional one, but the visuals create a real sense of place and height, so much so that at points I felt the effects of vertigo take hold. There are similarities to areas we’ve seen before in the Assassin’s Creed franchise, sharing in a taste for shifting stones and enigmatic tower structures, but this is a new level of solidity for VR and Mixed Reality.</p>

<p>There’s an overarching narrative that Humfrey is embroiled in, but details in the world – a record player, a pot of tea, or a radio that never seems to quite be tuned to a station – help you to build a picture of just what’s going on here. It’s thoroughly intriguing, though at various points I wished that these elements were a little more interactive.</p>
<p>While you walk around the external monolith, inside you use an open palm gesture to grasp a ball of light that teleports you to the next one, and if anything, this is the most frustrating part of the entire game. It’s probably harder to replicate the required gesture with a controller in your hand for a start, but the game didn’t always immediately realise what you are trying to do. Equally, there are points where you can see a more distant teleport point, but you can’t leap to that one straight away, occasionally slowing the pace for very little reason. Here’s hoping a little tweak can be made here.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pc-and-xbox-game-pass-are-getting-a-worldwide-price-hike<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Microsoft have announced global price increases for their Game Pass subscription business across all existing packages on console and PC. They’re also doing away with Xbox Game Pass For Console, while introducing a new Standard tier for console users which includes the Xbox back catalogue but doesn’t offer day-one access to new games.</p><!--more-->
<p>Being an RPS reader, you, of course, care nary a fig nor a figment for Game Pass on console. If those poor misguided Xboxers are getting owned by the megacorp, that’s what they richly deserve for turning their noses up at mouse and keyboard. But you probably do care about PC Game Pass prices going up from $9.99, €9.99 or £7.99 per month to $11.99, €11.99 and £9.99.</p>
<p>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, which includes PC Game Pass alongside first-party games at release, cloud gaming, multiplayer and the back catalogue, is also getting a hike - up from $16.99, €14.99 and £12.99 to $19.99, €17.99 or £14.99 per month. Here’s a <a href="https://assets.xboxservices.com/assets/42/85/42850801-4997-491d-a5bd-69c5bd7948ac.pdf?n=FINAL%20Game%20Pass%20price%20updates%20by%20country%20and%20currency.pdf">Microsoft pdf with a complete breakdown of the price changes by region</a>.</p>
<p>Microsoft have also popped up a <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/subscriptions-billing/manage-subscriptions/game-pass-updates-july-2024">FAQ about the changes</a> with some dates, including a reminder of how to cancel your subscription. The price changes take effect for new subscribers from today, 10th July 2024. As for current subscribers, the price changes come into force from your first recurring billing charge after 12th September 2024. The date at which your billing charges go out won’t change.</p>
<p>Tl;dr Microsoft have altered the terms of the deal. Pray they don’t alter them any further... which they probably will, because <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game-passs-only-outside-shot-for-sustainability-is-to-get-gta-6-or-call-of-duty-says-former-microsoft-senior-pr-lead%E2%80%9D">the ole’ subscription business needs to make a lot more moolah for those mischievous shareholders</a>, especially in the wake of that $68.7 billion Activision-Blizzard acquisition.</p>

		<p>Microsoft has made some big changes to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a>, shaking up what is offered on the “standard” tier and generally increasing prices for subscribers. Most significantly, access to first party Xbox games on day one will now not be included with the incoming Xbox Game Pass Standard for new console subscribers.</p>
<p>Going forward, the prices and general offerings will be:</p>


<ul>
<li><strong>Xbox Game Pass Core</strong> – $9.99 per month or $74.99 / £55.99 for 12 months (previously $59.99 / £49.99) – Includes Xbox online multiplayer and limited game library.</li>
<li><strong>Xbox Game Pass Standard</strong> – $14.99 per month &nbsp;– Includes Xbox online multiplayer, full library of back catalogue games, but does&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;include games released on day one.</li>
<li><strong>PC Game Pass</strong> – $11.99 / £9.99 per month (previously $9.99) – Includes day one games and full library of back catalogue titles on PC.</li>
<li><strong>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate </strong>– $19.99 / £14.99 per month (previously $16.99 / £12.99) – Includes PC Game Pass, Xbox online multiplayer, day one games, full back catalogue, EA Play, cloud gaming.</li>
</ul>
<p>See <a href="https://assets.xboxservices.com/assets/42/85/42850801-4997-491d-a5bd-69c5bd7948ac.pdf?n=FINAL%20Game%20Pass%20price%20updates%20by%20country%20and%20currency.pdf">the full breakdown of price changes here</a>. Xbox Game Pass Standard is “coming soon”, likely by September.</p>
<p>Any one with a current <strong>Xbox Game Pass for Console</strong> subscription will be able to continue paying with recurring billing for the foreseeable future and still have access to the current offering – the $10.99 / £8.99 price will also continue.&nbsp;This includes day one games and the full Xbox Game Pass catalogue, but Xbox Game Pass for Console does not include Xbox online multiplayer, cloud gaming or PC Game Pass.</p>
<p>A further change will come for the ability to stack subscriptions. From 12th September, you will only be able to stack Xbox Game Pass for Console for 13 months, doing so using pre-paid cards and conversions. Anyone with the current maximum of up to 36 months will be able to carry that forward, and other plans will also still have a 36 month stacking maximum.</p>

<p>All in all, this is a canny way for Microsoft to get through a price increase and break the long-standing pledge for all Game Pass subscribers to have day one games, and to make the most of the coming inclusion of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/28/the-game-pass-app-has-confirmed-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-for-day-one/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 as a day one launch game</a> – previous speculation had been that a new higher priced tier would be added specially for Black Ops 6, but Microsoft is maintaining the general structure through this price increase and relaunch.</p>
<p>This appears to fly in the face of promises by Microsoft that Xbox Game Pass would not increase in price as a direct result of the Activision Blizzard acquisition. Microsoft will be able to argue that they are simply following market trends and value, though all effective price increases are greater than inflation from the time of each product’s introduction.</p>
<p>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate will still be the all-in-one package, but now comes at a higher price once again, while the annual price increase for Xbox Game Pass Core (<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/07/17/game-pass-core-will-replace-xbox-live-gold-games-with-gold-in-septembe/">formerly Xbox Live Gold</a>) annual subs is a nasty sting in the tail. However, what’s more interesting is how Xbox Game Pass Standard is morphed out of Xbox Game Pass for Console.</p>
<p>Game Pass for Console previously didn’t include online gaming, so the main upsell to Game Pass Ultimate was to get that, as well as PC games and the option of cloud. Game Pass Standard flips that around, so online gaming is now included, but you don’t have day one games instead.</p>
<p>Of course, all of this will put more pressure on the pockets of gamers, at a time where there are so many subscriptions all vying for customers, and all steadily increasing prices as the market has become saturated.</p>

			<p>FromSoftware's Elden Ring unsurprisingly made its way back to the UK monthly sales chart for June, largely thanks to the release of its one and only expansion, Shadow of the Erdtree, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadow-of-the-erdtree-has-sold-5-million-units-in-3-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> over five million units globally in three days. The GSD data was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/elden-ring-sales-jump-467-on-shadow-of-the-erdtree-release-i-uk-monthly-charts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared today by GamesIndustry</a>, who noted that Elden Ring sales grew by 467% compared to last month.</p>
<p>Even that big of a jump wasn't enough to make it to the top three, though. Those spots were secured by two Electronic Arts sports games (EA Sports FC 24 and F1 24) and Rockstar's evergreen Grand Theft Auto 5.&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/f1-24-qa-codemasters-talks-ai-improvements-confirms-nvidia-dlss-3-frame-gen-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">F1 24</a> is new as well, of course, having launched on May 31. However, its performance probably didn't make EA very happy, as it's 44% below what F1 23 could accomplish in the same timeframe.</p>
<p>The rest of the chart is, once again, dominated by the usual suspects: Hogwarts Legacy, Sid Meier's Civilization 6, Red Dead Redemption 2, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, Grand Theft Auto Online, and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege.</p>

</table>
<p>On the hardware front, console sales fell in the UK by 9% compared to June 2023, with slightly less than a hundred thousand consoles sold this June. PlayStation 5 still outsold the competitors combined, while Xbox Series S|X came out just ahead of Nintendo Switch this month (but Nintendo's and Microsoft's consoles have sold nearly the same amount in 2024 so far).</p>
<p>2024 as a whole isn't looking good for console sales in the UK, with 29% lower unit sales and 31% lower revenue compared to 2023. According to GamesIndustry, this is because PS5 enjoyed a very strong first half of 2023 when its stock finally returned to normal; moreover, the Switch is very old at this point and has largely exhausted its potential customer base.</p>
<p>On the upside, accessory sales increased by 16% compared to 2023. The lion's share was done by the DualSense controller, partly thanks to a discount. Overall, UK customers bought as many DualSense controllers as they did PlayStation 5 consoles; as a reminder, the DualSense is also a great PC controller, and some of those sales definitely came from that userbase.</p>

<p>Like many of these compact concept-driven <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> games do (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slipways">Slipways</a>, my beloved), The King Is Watching started as <a href="https://hypnohead.itch.io/the-king-is-watching">an Itch project</a>. “Once you build something, it only works if it is inside your gaze,” is its unique thingamajig. Your ‘gaze’ starts as three squares on a 4x4 tileset, although you can upgrade it for wider gazitude. If a building falls outside your gaze, it doesn’t do anything. I love this concept so much, casting you as a jobsworth supervisor king constantly leering about his kingdom to scare the serfs into quitting munching on their straw sandwiches and get back to work. The gaze limitation makes you consider which sets of buildings you’re going to want active and complimenting each other at any one time.</p>
<p>So, training soldiers takes wheat, so it makes sense to have a defense-ready quadrant with a field and a barracks. Stick a wall-repairing structure in there too, while you're at it, alongside a mine for the clay you’ll need. Ah, but you’ll also want hardier troops for later waves. But! the training building costs gold, so you’ll want a marketplace to sell wheat…and you can already see how the gaze restriction turns a standard need-and-fulfillment pipeline into a more far more involved and puzzly affair. God save the king's neck as it relentlessly spins o'er hile and vale in perpetual motion.</p>
<p>Days tick down on a timer, and you’ll be attacked by periodic waves of goblins that try to batter down your stone walls with their fists, plucky shitmunchers that they are. Those first waves take time to arrive, though, and I do sort of wish you could increase game speed from the offset. Locking convenience behind upgrades is a long-standing bugbear of mine, but there’s also a soporific rhythm to the default speed - enhanced by the warped bloops of slightly detuned synths - that’d be undercut if this was the case.</p>
<p>Anyway, you throw in a few optional spendables like increased production for ten seconds, plus a roguelike framing that lets you buy upgrades at the end of each run, and I’m hooked. Well, this hook’s big enough for the both of us, reader. Come hang. Worry about the whole impalment thing later. You can grab the free demo on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2753900/The_King_is_Watching/">here</a>. As you can see from the above trailer, the full game looks way more elaborate. Also, the new king's got a Nigel Thornberry thing going on, so there's that too. </p>

            <p>We already know that you’ll be able to romance all your companions in the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>. Sounds a bit synthetic on the surface, right? Even fantastic games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a> suffered from this overly obliging approach to relationships. A game letting you tell your own tales is dandy and all, but those stories don’t mean much if the cast feel like input/output affection bots, ready to drop trou like a clumsy Levis temp once you’ve adequately filled their invisible bonkometer.</p>

<p>However! It seems like The Veilguard’s romances won’t be as simple as spamming the dialogue option for 'the way that darkspawn's cursed blood on your hair reflected the moonlight was hot'. “We wanted to lean into not just the relationships the characters have with you but the relationships they have with each other,” game director Corinne Busche told <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/07/08/how-romance-and-relationships-work-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard">Game Informer</a>. Those relationships extend to romances, says Busche. If you ignore a companion’s affections, it sounds like they might well turn their attention towards other members of your party.</p>
<p>Each companion, write GI, has their own relationship level with Rook, the player character. This will change based on conversations, sure, but also how Rook interacts with the world. I’m less enthused about the idea of ‘ranking up’ your companions' relationship level to unlock skill points. Again, it all feels dryly synthetic, like the way you’d end up effectively grinding moral choices in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect-legendary-edition">Mass Effect</a> series. Still, Busche notes that platonic relationships also contribute to the companion levels and skill points, saying that you’ll “learn who these characters are in how their romances unfold."</p>
<p>Game Informer have published a wealth of detailed information on what to expect from The Veilguard when it launches in Fall 2024. They recently shared some details about the game’s difficulty customisation options, which look <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-the-veilguards-customisable-difficulties-look-genuinely-great-for-accessibility">genuinely great for accessibility</a>. Edwin said he’d make me write nothing but COD update posts (the games blogger equivalent of peeling potatoes in the brig, only less nutritious) until the end of time if I didn’t mention that his own <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-45-minutes-of-dragon-age-the-veilguard-feel-as-much-like-mass-effect-2-as-inquisition">hands-off preview</a> is the only information you really need though.</p>
<p>Former Dragon Age lead writer David Gaider recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-ages-former-lead-writer-has-many-mostly-positive-thoughts-on-veilguards-romance-options-story-and-environments">shared some thoughts</a> on The Veilguard. He was a big fan of how evocative the city of Minrathous was, saying that he wished “we could have done this for Kirkwall or even Val Royeaux. Utterly gorgeous.” Still, he expressed concern about the choice to make every character romanceable. "The Dragon Age writers realized, eventually, that as soon as you make a character romanceable it limits the type of character they can be and the types of stories they can tell. They become beholden to their romance arc and their need to, ultimately, be appealing,” wrote Gaider.</p>
<p>"Why is that a limitation? Because not all character story arcs are defined by being appealing to the player. Even if the appeal of an arc is for a relatively limited audience, the requirement of having appeal inherently restricts the potential stories to a fairly limited band." The line between giving the player what they want and focusing on authorial intent is a fine ol' one indeed, but there's no reason why we can't have both. Probably <a href="https://youtu.be/c06ow9Qe5b8">don't try that</a> in the game though. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/total-war-pharaoh-%E2%80%93-dynasties-is-an-expansion-sized-game-free-for-owners-of-the-original-out-on-july-25.923400/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/total-war-pharaoh-dynasties-is-an-expansion-sized-game-free-for-owners-of-the-original-out-on-july-25/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Creative Assembly and SEGA have announced a surprise for fans of Total War: Pharaoh. Later this month, owners of the real-time strategy game will receive a free expansion-sized standalone title called Total War: Pharaoh - Dynasties.</p>
<p>Game Director Todor Nikolov said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>From the outset of our design journey on Total War: Pharaoh, our vision has always been to deliver a grand-scale recreation of the turbulent Bronze Age Collapse; one brimming with historical intrigue, authentic representations of iconic civilisation, and a sandbox theatre that allows you to rewrite the course of human history. We’re very proud of what we’ve achieved, and whilst this will be our final content addition, we hope it serves as a love letter that encapsulates our continued passion for this wonderful age. Thanks for your support.</em></p>
<p>Total War: Pharaoh - Dynasties will be released for PC on July 25, while Feral Interactive is already preparing the macOS version, which should be released shortly afterward.</p>
<p>Here's a summary of what players can expect in this freebie:</p>
<ul>
<li>4 new major factions</li>
<li>25 new minor factions</li>
<li>150+ new and reworked units, including cavalry</li>
<li>168 new settlements Expanded Campaign map (1.8x bigger)</li>
<li>New battle mechanics e.g., Lethality</li>
<li>New DYNASTIES family tree system</li>
<li>Fixes for Legacy bugs</li>
</ul>
<p><iframe title="Total War: PHARAOH - Dynasties Overview" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6erHiCuh1tQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Do note that Total War: Pharaoh - Dynasties is launched through a separate app from your Steam library and cannot be purchased as a standalone game. Save files won't carry over from the base game, and there is no cross-progression. Dynasties will require around 80GB of free disk space, but the good news is you won't have to keep the base Total War: Pharaoh installed to play it.</p>
<p>The Blood &amp; Sand DLC works with Dynasties. On the other hand, a new version of the Assembly Kit is required for Dynasties mods, so legacy mods for Pharaoh will have to be updated via the new kit and re-uploaded to the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2951630/workshop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dynasties Steam workshop page</a> to work.</p>
<p>Total War: Pharaoh debuted in October 2023. Our resident strategy fan Chris Wray <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/total-war-pharaoh-sands-of-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gave it 9 out of 10</a>:</p>
<p><em>Total War: Pharaoh is a successful return to pure history for the series. While some may not like aspects, such as a limited unit variety and a map that can feel a little narrow in areas, the gameplay is enhanced across the board thanks to a variety of features, increased tactical options in combat, and more.</em></p>

<p>Recently, gamers were celebrating National Video Game Day, and a social media campaign saw many brands asking users what their favourite game of all time was. One unlikely Hollywood star popped into the trend to make his feelings known, revealing a title that’s not representative of the edgy, intimidating characters he’s known to play on the big screen.</p>



<p>Danny Trejo’s favourite video game of all time is Animal Crossing: New Horizons.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-wasn-t-expecting-that">Wasn’t Expecting That</h2>



<p>Danny Trejo is no stranger to the world of gaming. He has appeared in several roles over the years that have taken him from Far Cry to Call of Duty, and his acting career spans more than forty years. It turns out he’s partial to playing games, too – the  80-year-old star revealed that his favourite game of all time is Animal Crossing: New Horizons.</p>



<p>It seems bizarre to some that one of the toughest actors in Hollywood, who is partial to playing utterly badass characters, loves such a cutesy game.</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch-exclusive title was released in 2020 to an overwhelmingly positive reception, with many users pouring onto the platform to create an ersatz life in place of the one they’d had restricted by the COVID-19 pandemic. It became a global sensation, with players worldwide using the freedom of New Horizons to create wonderful islands for others to explore.</p>



<p>Danny Trejo loves Animal Crossing, it seems. Fans of the game took to the comments <a href="https://x.com/officialDannyT/status/1810344789097000974" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">under Danny’s post</a> to ask him a string of questions concerning his island, his favourite villager, or how many bells he’s amassed, but the actor hasn’t responded to any follow-up comments just yet.</p>

<p>BioShock 4 – which isn’t the official name of the developing title – is a long time coming. It has now been more than a decade since the last BioShock game hit the market, and fans of the franchise are <strong>hungry </strong>for something new. Ken Levine’s Judas should help fill the gap for a while, but a new BioShock game is long overdue – and 2K’s Cloud Chamber studio is looking to right that wrong by hiring en masse to flesh out the team working on the game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-just-give-us-something">Just Give Us Something</h2>



<p>BioShock is a fantastic franchise beloved by millions, and the origins of the series stretch back almost twenty years. It’s a three-part franchise that toys with reality, giving players fantastical powers and presenting them with immersive stories that unfold in almost mythical locations: a city deep under the ocean and an entire civilisation living in the clouds on airships, for example. </p>



<p>It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-bioshock-developer-ramping-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">was recently discovered</a> that work on the next BioShock game is ramping up, with 2K Cloud Chamber, the studio working on the project, posting 30 open positions covering everything from cinematics to narrative. With these positions opening up, it seems unlikely that the development of ‘BioShock 4’ is too far down the line, and last year, a report emerged suggesting that the game had found itself in ‘development hell’.</p>



<p>In May 2023, it was claimed that writing a ‘worthy script’ had been one of the biggest issues with the game’s development, but it was also mentioned that the game was ‘on track’ to release in 2025, which now seems unlikely. </p>

<p>Pocketpair has just made two announcements, the first of which concerns a partnership in the form of a joint venture with Sony Music Entertainment and Aniplex focused on the development of Palworld. It was revealed that through this joint venture, Palworld Entertainment Inc. has been founded ‘for the purpose of accelerating the multifaceted global development of Palworld and its further expansion.’</p>



<p>It was also announced that a line of Palworld merchandise is being created and will soon be available to pre-order from Aniplex Online.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-getting-bigger">Getting Bigger</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, Pocketpair revealed the joint venture between itself and Sony Music Entertainment (Japan) that’s poised to ‘promote new developments of Palworld’. Presently, Palworld isn’t available on PlayStation, but recently, comments from the leadership team at the company suggested it’s only a matter of time before it comes to the platform. This partnership could be a step in the right direction.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that this joint venture <strong>specifically mentions </strong>that <a href="https://pwe.jp/news/?article_id=65765">game licenses aren’t included</a> as part of the deal – but that doesn’t mean there aren’t plans to align further down the road. It’s not like PlayStation and Sony Music sit under the same roof, but it’s the closest we’ve been yet to an announcement that Palworld is coming to PS platforms.</p>



<p>It doesn’t end with merchandise, either. Fans are expecting something like a Palworld anime to surface in the future, which would challenge the paradigm established by Pokémon to no end. Despite Nintendo not being bothered by Palworld’s existence, edging into the territory of merchandise could mean that trading cards, plushies, and other items emerge soon that start edging a little too close to Pokémon’s world for comfort.</p>
