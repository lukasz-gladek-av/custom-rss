                <p>Hitman developer IO Interactive is currently putting Agent 47 on the backburner while focusing on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-james-bond-game-first-light-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531773/" data-ref-id="1100-6531773">the upcoming James Bond game</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/007-first-light/" data-ref-id="5000-522472">007 First Light</a>. However, the new Bond title may take some cues from Hitman: World of Assassination' live-service approach by adding new missions post-launch.</p><p>IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak hinted at the possibility of providing Bond with ongoing support during an extended interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/how-hitman-absolutions-wasteful-toilets" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>.</p><p>"We obviously have tons of experience now from World of Assassination, and tons of experience on how to extend a single-player experience by giving desirable free content to players," said Abrak. "The first objective with 007 First light is to come out with the best possible, most impactful journey for gamers. Again, without giving too much detail, you could expect that we'll be applying some of our learnings from World of Assassination to Bond."</p><p>Abrak went on to note that First Light will feature greater stealth, action, and seamless combat options that let players switch between ranged attacks and melee on the fly. He added that Bond will follow his character's long-standing tradition of driving exotic cars.</p><p>"That gives us more challenges to play with," added Abrak. "In Hitman, you have these live challenges. And besides the things that we are able to do in Hitman, we can do more actiony things and more kinetic challenges in Bond."</p><p>The most recently released Hitman elusive target mission may be a good model for any live-service 007 First Light content. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-bond-villain-coming-to-hitman-today-as-elusive-target/1100-6532213/" data-ref-id="1100-6532213">Mads Mikkelsen reprised his role as LeChiffre</a> from the first Daniel Craig James Bond movie, Casino Royale. If First Light can draw upon some of the classic villains from Bond's previous films, then there are ample opportunities to revisit some fan-favorites.</p><p>007 First Light isn't connected to any previous Bond incarnation and features <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/007-first-light-trailer-reveals-the-first-ever-james-bond-origin-story/1100-6532111/" data-ref-id="1100-6532111">the title character during his origin adventure</a>. IO Interactive will release 007 First Light on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch 2, and PC in 2026.</p>

            <p>Sony has announced four new games on the way to its PSVR2 headset, three of which are coming this year.</p>
<p>One of those is Dreams of Another, the next game from Q-Games - the studio behind the PixelJunk games. Dreams of Another is from multimedia artist Baiyon, the director of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pixeljunk-eden">PixelJunk Eden</a>.</p>
<p>The game sees players control "The Man in Pajamas", but has the philosophy of "No Creation Without Destruction". As such, shooting in this game creates the world around you from circular particles.</p>

<p>I was able to play the game (though not in VR) at the Game Developer Conference earlier this year, and found its use of "point cloud rendering" to be particularly mesmerising. I can only imagine how it'll look in VR, in both third and first person. Dreams of Another is due for release later this year.</p>
<p>Before that, though, there's Grit and Valor - 1949. A tactics rogue-lite, players take the role of a commander in an alternate timeline World War 2 to win battles by moving pieces chess-style on a tactical grid. It's due out on 21st August.</p>

<p>Also coming later this year is Hotel Infinity, a follow-up to Manifold Garden from Studio Chyr. This surreal puzzle game has players exploring an abstract hotel to solve riddles. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/manifold-garden-review-rewiring-strange-architecture-in-the-void">Manifold Garden received a rare Essential from Eurogamer</a>, so expect good things from this one.</p>

<p>Last up is <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/24/introducing-meteora-a-cosmic-survival-racer-for-ps-vr2/">Meteora</a>, a "cosmic survival racer" coming to PSVR2 next year. Players will navigate "explosive asteroid belts, electrically charged debris, and icy barriers" as a meteor racing across space. Energy Crystal can increase your mass and Stardust boosts your velocity, but should you focus on survivability or speed?</p>
<p>You can read more about all four games on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/24/reveals-and-updates-on-upcoming-ps-vr2-titles/">PlayStation Blog</a>.</p>
<p>Sony has been criticised for not supporting its PSVR2 headset. In its latest State of Play showcase, only one VR game was included - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-more-than-a-decade-classic-stealth-series-thief-is-being-revived-for-psvr2">Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow</a> - though this will also be released on other VR platforms.</p>
<p>The Meta-owned Beat Games also recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/support-for-beat-saber-on-ps4-and-ps4-ends-shining-a-light-on-psvr2s-lack-of-success">ended support for Beat Saber on PS4 and PS5</a>, what many consider to be VR's killer app.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Microsoft announced it has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-dips-its-toes-into-vr-with-limited-edition-xbox-themed-meta-quest-headset">collaborated with Meta on a limited edition Xbox-themed Quest 3S headset</a>, as the company dips its toes into the world of VR.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-remembers-psvr2-exists-announces-four-new-games-coming-soon]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="DS2 MARIO REF" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b1f45ab2d49ad/ds2-mario-ref.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Kojima Productions</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Yes, as you'll likely know, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/death_stranding">Death Stranding</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-1">Hideo Kojima</a>'s incredibly good walking simulator, has got itself a fancy big sequel this week in the form of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a>, and we've been playing it in what little free time we've got (well, this writer has, at least) over on the old PlayStation side of things.</p>
<p>You'll be pleased to know that this writer has discovered some vague, possible Mario references in the second game, and it's only early days!</p>
<p>The references-of-sorts relate to some Mushroom Badges, which are available to sew onto a backpack in the game from the get-go. There a few different mushroom badges, even a triple set - just like in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart</a>! Can it be a coincidence?</p>
<p>As it turns out these Mushroom Kingdom-styled mushies, rather than just being random as all hell, are actually found in the game world of Death Stranding 2, and its predecessor, (hey, they pop up when you pee!), so it stands to reason that the badges are simply tied innocently to this whole mechanic.</p>

<p>However, we're suspect of this being entirely and purely coincidental, especially given the choice of a Fly Agaric mushroom over any of the millions of other types you could have chosen.</p>
<p>Yes, you may argue that this type of mushroom appears in lots of games, possibly way more than any other, but then you'd be kicking this theory right in the Sam Porters, which isn't very nice. Anyway, the game, as you can see from our images, calls them "Golden Toadstools", so we're still 100% behind our working theory!</p>
<p>If you've played the original Death Stranding, then this probably won't surprise you. You'll already know, possibly by way of a lot of cringing, that the game contains references to Mario and Princess Peach, with one very on the nose line in particular, as seen in the clip below (warning, it's worse than you may remember).</p>

<p>Rightio! There are many discussions online about comparisons between the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/princess_peach_showtime">Mario and Peach</a> relationship mirroring that of the leads in Death Stranding, but we'll let you dig your own hole there.</p>
<p>We'll be sure to check back in if we find any Bullet Bill in Death Stranding 2 in the meantime.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Is this yet more proof that Hideo Kojima is the world's biggest Princess Peach fan? Let us know what you reckon!</em></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/painkiller-reboot-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/painkiller-reboot-release-date-announced-for-october.1227015/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>3D Realms has announced the release date for its upcoming&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>reboot, and if you've been waiting for the chance to try this one out, you'll be able to do so later this year.</p>

<p>First <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/painkiller-revival-fall-2025" rel="nofollow">announced back in March</a>, the&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>reboot, which is developed by Anshar Studios, will be arriving across PC and consoles on October 9th. No mention of a Switch or Switch 2 version of the game has been made.</p>

<p>Since the release date has been announced, pre-orders for&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>are now also open, and if you pre-order the game, you'll get yourself a set of Iron Crusade character and weapon skins into the bargain.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/painkiller-release-date-reboot.jpg?itok=LEL57opS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/painkiller-release-date-reboot.jpg?itok=A7gIWcZu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>is coming to a PC or console near you in October.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>, it's a reboot of the 2004 boomer shooter, which was arguably one of the first games to actively eschew the then-modern trappings of shooters in favor of a more retro-friendly style.</p>

<p>The game was developed by People Can Fly, the studio that's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-e-day-people-can-fly" rel="nofollow">currently helping out The Coalition</a> with development on the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Gears of War: E-Day&nbsp;</em>(and, sadly, also the studio that recently had to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/people-can-fly-layoffs-projects-canceled" rel="nofollow">cancel two projects and lay off staff</a>).</p>

<p>Unlike the original&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>, the new version will revolve around co-op play, and it'll contain hero shooter elements as well; you'll play as one of four characters, each of whom has their own unique perks with which to slay demons.</p>

<p>Make no mistake, though; this version of&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>is still all about killing hordes of rampaging monsters, and it looks like the outlandish weapons and over-the-top feel of the original&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>have made it across to the reboot intact.</p>




<p><em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>arguably shares some challenges with Bungie's upcoming&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>, another shooter that's turned a beloved single-player classic into a multiplayer-focused title. Last week, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shocking-no-one-bungies-marathon-delayed" rel="nofollow">Bungie delayed&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em></a>, citing a need for extra development time to make the game shine.</p>

<p>Whether or not that happens to&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>remains to be seen, but for now, the game is set to launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2300120/Painkiller/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10013491" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/painkiller/9NMSW622HWNH" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on October 10th.</p>

            <p>Microsoft are reportedly gearing up to lay off more staff next week, in what would be the fourth round of major job cuts at Xbox in 18 months.</p>
<p>This is according to a report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-24/microsoft-plans-major-job-cuts-at-xbox-gaming-division">Bloomberg</a>, which says that Xbox managerial staff are "expecting substantial cuts" across Microsoft's gaming arm.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Not yet clear how many people, but it's expected to be big," reporter Jason Schreier wrote in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:2mkgbhbhqvappkkorf2bzyrp/post/3lseaakusns2s">Bluesky post</a> about the report. Bloomberg had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-18/microsoft-planning-thousands-more-job-cuts-aimed-at-salespeople">previously reported</a> that Microsoft was set to cut thousands of jobs next week, with its salespeople being the main folks affected.</p>
<p>The site notes that Microsoft declined to comment on this latest report.</p>
<p>Microsoft has been laying off staff en masse on a depressingly regular basis over the past couple of years, with 10,000 workers being let go in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsofts-mass-layoffs-will-affect-starfield-halo-infinite-and-gears-of-war-developers">January 2023</a>, 1,900 in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-have-aligned-on-the-best-opportunities-for-growth-by-firing-nearly-two-thousand-people">January 2024</a>, and 650 in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-have-aligned-on-the-best-opportunities-for-growth-by-firing-nearly-two-thousand-people">September 2024</a>. They also let go of around 6,000 people across the company <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-is-laying-off-even-more-of-its-staff-with-potentially-almost-7000-workers-at-risk">just last month</a>.</p>
<p>It's a frankly horrifying rate of contribution to the ever-deepening sea of layoffs that the games industry's been drowning in for the <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2025">past few years</a>. A lot of it has come following Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/uk-regulator-provisionally-approves-microsofts-activision-blizzard-buyout-following-ubisoft-deal">acquiring Activision Blizzard</a> – it’s the usual cost-cutting after a massive investment. That said, Microsoft aren’t exactly struggling on the money-making front. They <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/30/microsoft-msft-q3-earnings-report-2025.html">reported net income</a> of $25.8 billion for their most recent financial quarter.</p>
<p>Bloomberg notes that this latest round of Microsoft layoffs would come just before the company rolls into a new financial year after June 30. Is it cool to chuck human beings out of their livelihoods just to make a spreadsheet look a bit tidier?? No, but sadly it keeps happening.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-reportedly-set-to-lay-off-staff-yet-again-with-substantial-cuts-expected-at-xbox]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yesterday, June 23, marked the 25th anniversary of what can convincingly be described as one of the best games of all time. <em>Deus Ex</em>, created by the distinct Austin branch of John Romero’s controversial studio Ion Storm, was a first-person RPG that would change how an entire generation of players and developers thought about video games. It was a game that was built from depths: depths of skill, knowledge, intelligence and narrative. It remains exactly as brilliant today as it was a quarter of a century ago.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196572" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: A Rebirth, A Remake, And A Remaster" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="94" data-playlist="196572,196742,196049" data-current="196572"><div><p>The Week In Games: A Rebirth, A Remake, And A Remaster</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196572/196572_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196572/196572_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196572/196572_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196572/196572_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22127.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>In fact, it works better today than it did ten years back.

A decade ago, doing this required installing a handful of different mods, and there was no way to actually play it in its vanilla version. And right away, I was pulled back in, crazy clip-cloppy footstep sound effects and everything. I feel ready to yet again dive back into this world of overlapping conspiracies, deep philosophy, and juggled morality.</p><figure id="" data-id="5694b9bf4044cd9c414ad680a8f66871" data-recommend-id="image://5694b9bf4044cd9c414ad680a8f66871" data-format="jpg" data-width="1741" data-height="980" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="JC orders a drink at a bar." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="JC orders a drink at a bar." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Eidos / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5694b9bf4044cd9c414ad680a8f66871" data-recommend-id="image://5694b9bf4044cd9c414ad680a8f66871" data-format="jpg" data-width="1741" data-height="980" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="JC orders a drink at a bar." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So what makes <em>Deus Ex</em> so special? I feel like I could spend a dozen articles answering that question. In fact, ten years back, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/is-deus-ex-still-the-best-game-ever&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/is-deus-ex-still-the-best-game-ever" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I wrote six in a row</a></span> when revisiting the game. It’s a combination of so many factors coming together so superbly, with a dream team of developers, financial backing, an exquisitely good story, and a complete lack of expectation from its future audience.</p><p>In 1996, when the economy was booming in preparation for the colossal bursting of the dot-com bubble, John Romero and Tom Hall, flush with success from id Software and its massive gaming series <em>Doom</em> and <em>Quake</em>, set out to create a new Texan developer: Ion Storm. Together, they spent lavishly, fought explosively, and created two compellingly dreadful games. First was <em>Dominion: Storm Over Gift 3</em>, and then the infamously disastrous FPS <em>Daikatana</em>. However, alongside all this, former Looking Glass (<em>Thief</em>, <em>System Shock</em>) developer Warren Ellis had been asked to create a parallel studio, Ion Storm Austin.</p><p>Distinct from Romero’s Dallas studio, Ellis had creative freedom and a pool of money, and quickly hired talent he knew from his days at Looking Glass, including Harvey Smith (<em>Dishonored</em>). In just 28 months, a tiny team of 20 pulled together (albeit with production troubles, serious frustrations, and “knock-down drag-out fights”) one of the most immersive, intricate games the world has ever known.</p><figure id="" data-id="ae4760c5d4af9db9fdc5cf468d3e0c52" data-recommend-id="image://ae4760c5d4af9db9fdc5cf468d3e0c52" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Spoilers!" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Spoilers!" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Eidos / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ae4760c5d4af9db9fdc5cf468d3e0c52" data-recommend-id="image://ae4760c5d4af9db9fdc5cf468d3e0c52" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Spoilers!" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In the original <em>Deus Ex</em>, before its unfairly maligned Xbox-led sequel and its goth-eyed post-2010 prequels, you play as JC Denton, a cybernetically augmented human who works for a government agency called UNATCO. He discovers his brother Paul is working for a terrorist organization, the NSF, all amidst a global pandemic called the Grey Death. Very quickly, your assumptions about good and bad, right and wrong, are questioned, and you’re drawn into an intricate web of conspiracies and conflicting alliances.</p><p>This plays out...kinda how you want it to! There’s obviously a core, unavoidable plot, but how you approach it will dramatically affect the story you allow yourself to be told. It can be an ultra-violent FPS, where you blast through enemies with rockets and explosives, or a super-spy sim as you assassinate opponents, or you can be an unseen stealth pacifist, determined to kill no one, relying entirely on tranquilizers and stun guns. Every mission can be approached in multiple fashions, from spectacularly smashing through the roof of a building for an all-out gun fight, to slipping in through the vents such that no one ever knew you were there.</p><figure id="" data-id="6472ff76f78891a75cf72bb2f1267753" data-recommend-id="image://6472ff76f78891a75cf72bb2f1267753" data-format="jpg" data-width="2002" data-height="1127" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Gunter with his mad red eyes." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gunter with his mad red eyes." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Eidos / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6472ff76f78891a75cf72bb2f1267753" data-recommend-id="image://6472ff76f78891a75cf72bb2f1267753" data-format="jpg" data-width="2002" data-height="1127" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Gunter with his mad red eyes." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I’ve told this anecdote too many times before, so apologies, but it captures the essence of what makes <em>Deus Ex</em> quite so extraordinary: At the time of its 2000 release, I was writing for the UK version of <em>PC Gamer</em>, where the reviews editor was one Kieron Gillen (now best known for his comics work, but once my colleague at <em>RPS</em>). Gillen had played the game for his world-class review (I’d link to it, but Future Publishing treats people’s efforts to archive its magazines with hostility—instead I’m copying out of my physical edition), which contained the words:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Games—like most other forms of entertainment—have a terrible habit of making you less than you are normally, simplifying you into a stripped-down cartoon...<em>Deus Ex</em> is one of the few games that succeeds in making you more than you are. Because <em>Deus Ex</em>’s universe is, obviously, reduced, you feel as if you have more freedom than you do in reality, which, like <em>Fight Club </em>for example, reminds you of your own freedom in reality. It’s a slap in the face, it reminds us how good videoart can be. And this <em>is</em> art. It’s beautiful. And I’m going to stop now before I start to cry...</p></blockquote><p>I was playing it soon after, and occasionally calling Kieron to chat about what was happening. On one call I said to him, “I couldn’t believe it when my brother died.”</p><p>“My brother didn’t die!” Kieron responded in bemusement. And then we both had a moment in silence, realizing that this game was offering even more than we’d already thought.</p><p><em>Deus Ex </em>was a game in which the finest details rung with intelligence, in which every book you found contained provocative ideas or conflicting philosophies, in which characters responded to you in subtly different ways depending upon how you were playing the game; on this micro level it felt malleable and responsive to you and how you reacted to it. But to discover that it was also offering the same flexibility to massive story beats was just mindblowing.</p><figure id="" data-id="0517da25ace10a826de274bd8d8cefbb" data-recommend-id="image://0517da25ace10a826de274bd8d8cefbb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A large stone hand reaching over a globe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A large stone hand reaching over a globe." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Eidos / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0517da25ace10a826de274bd8d8cefbb" data-recommend-id="image://0517da25ace10a826de274bd8d8cefbb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A large stone hand reaching over a globe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The game’s influence on the industry is impossible to overstate. While the circumstances and relative creative freedom afforded to its development are extremely hard to come by twenty-five years on, you can see the game’s DNA in so many of the games we love today. Even beyond the more obvious, all the immersive sims born in its shadow (<em>BioShock</em>, <em>Dishonored</em>, <em>Prey...</em>), so many developers cite <em>Deus Ex</em> as a major source. <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>'s quest director Mateusz Tomaskiewicz named <em>Deus Ex</em> when asked for his main inspirations. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/cyberpunk-2077-quest-director-says-deus-ex-was-a-big-inspiration-and-not-just-the-sunglasses/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/cyberpunk-2077-quest-director-says-deus-ex-was-a-big-inspiration-and-not-just-the-sunglasses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Speaking to <em>GamesRadar</em></a></span> he said,</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>This one had a great impact on me as a developer and player back when I played it for the first time many years ago. And what I really liked about that game was completing the missions in many ways. It was not only based on dialogue decisions, since you also had the things that were on the map and its different points of entry that allowed you to get into buildings, as well as elements that opened different paths in history.</p></blockquote><p>But most importantly, it’s still a hell of a game to play today. Sure, its art is a bit crummy—it was criticized for this when it was released! God, those wall textures. But it matters so very, very little once you’re deep in its story, learning what it has to teach, reacting against what you find abhorrent, embracing what draws you in. (I’ll never forget my moment of pure horror when, working as a youth worker as I also was during the game’s release, one of the teenagers told me how furious he was about being forced to leave UNATCO, as to him they were clearly the good guys. Uh-oh.) </p><p>It’s currently just <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gog.com/en/game/deus_ex&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/deus_ex" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$3.49 on GOG</a></span> (although it often comes down to a lot less than that on both GOG and Steam), and if you’ve never played it, then prepare to have your life properly, actually changed.</p><p>Happy birthday, <em>Deus Ex</em>! Thanks for changing my life too.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/deus-ex-25-years-ion-storm-looking-glass-warren-ellis-1851784985]]></content:encoded>

Its announcement excited fans, with trailers for the game garnering over 1 million views. But fans quickly spotted an AI use disclaimer on its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2958130/Jurassic_World_Evolution_3/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam page</a> that explained generative AI would be used for scientist portraits. Players quickly took to its Steam forums to complain about the use of AI in Jurassic World Evolution 3. Some players went as far as to call the developers "lazy" and "pathetic" for using AI in their game instead of having artists design these portraits. </p><p>Eventually, Frontier Developments responded to <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2958130/discussions/0/599654768975026771/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of these threads</a> and revealed it has "opted to remove the use of generative AI for scientist portraits within Jurassic World Evolution 3." The studio reaffirmed this in a statement to <a href="https://www.gamewatcher.com/news/jurassic-world-evolution-3-no-longer-using-generative-ai-for-scientist-portraits-following-initial-feedback" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Watcher</a>, where it's confirmed that Generative AI was removed "following some initial feedback" and that the game will still make its announced release following this change. The AI disclaimer is also no longer on its Steam page.</p><p>The use of generative AI is currently a very hot topic in the video game industry. It has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-uses-generative-ai-for-some-content-activision-admits/1100-6529691/" data-ref-id="1100-6529691">used by studios like Activision</a>, and even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/aaa-game-development-is-unsustainable-but-generative-ai-can-help-smash-bros-boss-says/1100-6532667/" data-ref-id="1100-6532667">developers like Masahiro Sakurai</a> believe it has uses in game development. Generally, players don't like when generative AI is used in games, though, with this Jurassic World Evolution 3 backlash simply being the latest example.</p><p>Jurassic World Evolution 3 launches on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on October 21.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>At the final, all-virtual E3 in 2021, Koch Media <a href="https://gameinformer.com/e3-2021/2021/06/10/koch-media-shows-off-gungrave-gore-painkiller-and-slate-of-new-ips">announced</a> a reboot of the 2004 shooter Painkiller was in development. Today, we learned players will make their return trip to Purgatory on October 9.&nbsp;</p><p>While the original Painkiller was created by Outriders/Bulletstorm developer People Can Fly, this modern reimagining – simply titled Painkiller – is made by Anshar Studios and published by 3D Realms. Despite the change in creators, the new game shares thematic similarities with its predecessor. Players are trapped in Purgatory and must fight their way out to prevent the fallen angel, Azazel, from invading Earth. Instead of controlling a single protagonist, however, the first-person shooter lets players select from four playable characters: Ink, Void, Sol, and Roch, each with distinct traits.&nbsp;</p><p>Painkiller can be played alone, but it also features three-player online co-op. In addition to blasting apart demons with a variety of supernaturally-enhanced firearms (both classic and new), you can upgrade abilities using tarot cards.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-a4ywaWme2M"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-a4ywaWme2M" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Painkiller will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on October 9. A Standard Edition of the game costs $39.99, and pre-ordering it earns you the Iron Crusade skin pack for characters and weapons. A Deluxe Edition runs for $49.99 and includes the skin pack plus three post-launch DLCs that will include additional character/weapon skins.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/24/the-painkiller-reboot-gets-an-october-launch-date]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Futuristic racer Fast Fusion will receive an update later this week, adding new tracks and a new rendering mode without upscaling.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-fast-fusion-most-technically-impressive-switch-2-launch-title">Digital Foundry reported</a>, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> launch game actually renders at a low image resolution but uses the console's DLSS equivalent to upscale the image. Put simply, the game has been criticised for poor image quality, despite being such a fast game.</p>
<p>Now, developer Shin'en Games is introducing a new render mode called "Pure" that removes upscaling and instead renders at a native 1440p when docked (and 1080p in handheld).</p>

<p>What's more, a new Carbium Cup will be added, including three new tracks: Alpine Trust, Sunahara Plains, Zenshoh Habitat.</p>
<p>Players of previous game Fast RMX may recognise these tracks, though they have all-new graphics and changed layouts to make use of Fast Fusion's Hyperjump feature.</p>
<p>Further additions include: a new particle effect for snow, two new jukebox entries, a lower price to unlock the third cup for easier progression, fixed an issue where the game shut down when changing render mode, while stability and performance improvements have been implemented.</p>
<p>The update will arrive on 26th June.</p>

<p>Fast Fusion is one of the few brand-new launch games for Nintendo's new console. It's the follow up to Switch game Fast RMX, itself an improved version of Fast Racing Neo on Wii U.</p>
<p>Anyone who's a fan of the F-Zero or WipEout series will find much to enjoy here, with the game's high speed thrills, rollercoaster tracks, and techno soundtrack. Indeed, it's a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/f-zero-gx-on-switch-2-is-virtually-unplayable-without-remapping-the-controls">modern day rival to F-Zero GX</a> - one of three GameCube games available on Switch 2 through Nintendo Switch Online.</p>

		<p>Rebellion and Liberty Films have released a set of four stills, giving a first look at the upoming <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/rogue-trooper">Rogue Trooper</a> movie adaptation from Duncan Jones.</p>
<div id="attachment_461224"><p id="caption-attachment-461224">image credit: Rebellion, Liberty Films</p>

</div>
<p>Written and directed by Jones – best known for Moon, Source Code, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/05/26/is-warcraft-the-videogame-movie-weve-all-been-waiting-for/">Warcraft</a> and Mute – Rogue Trooper adapts the cult 2000AD comic book for the big screen, a story that was previously adapted to video games in the mid-noughties (and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/10/17/rogue-trooper-redux-review/">remastered in 2017</a>). The film stars Aneurin Barnard (The Goldfinch, Dunkirk) as the Rogue Trooper, and Jemaine Clement (Avatar 2: The Way of Water) and Matt Berry (What We Do in the Shadows) as battleground looters Mr Brass and Mr Bland.</p>
<div id="attachment_461225"><p id="caption-attachment-461225">image credit: Rebellion, Liberty Films</p></div>
<p>They’ve all donned full motion capture suits for the movie, which is fully CGI, similar to Jones’ Warcraft movie, or the predominantly CG Avatar films. Filming was completed last year using head mounted cameras for performance capture, while imagery and animation partner Treehouse Digital has been feeding all of that into Unreal Engine 5, before Liberty Films then add their own VFX and animation on top.</p>

<div id="attachment_461222"><p id="caption-attachment-461222">image credit: Rebellion, Liberty Films</p></div>
<p>The other still shots give a look at a huge war vehicle on Nu Earth, which is the location of the battle between the Norts and Southers, and we get to see some Souther soldiers who are lost in the toxic wasteland of battle.</p>
<div id="attachment_461221"><p id="caption-attachment-461221">image credit: Rebellion, Liberty Films</p></div>
<p>Producer Stuart Fenegan said, “We are so excited to share a first look of the film and show the amazing fidelity with which the team have used our actors on set performances to drive the animated characters. That level of detail and nuance was a priority from day one.”</p>
<p>Duncan Jones, meanwhile, had this to say: “AHHHHHHHHHHHH! WE’RE ALMOST FINISHED! SEE YOU AT SDCC!!”</p>
<p>He’s going to be at San Diego Comic Con on 25th July for a fan meeting and signing of the Rogue Trooper hero image.</p>

			<p>Neverness to Everness, the open-world gacha RPG in development by Hotta Studio, looks to deliver the anime GTA fantasy that no one knew they wanted, judging from some recent footage.</p>
<p>The new footage was shared as part of a new Containment Test Preview livestream that provided a new look at some of the game's features and mechanics, such as the urban open-world, characters, traversal, and more. As if the urban setting wasn't enough to label the game as a sort of anime GTA, the developer shared during the livestream footage of one of the main playable characters stealing a car and becoming wanted by the police. While the disconnect between the character design and committing crimes is enormous, it's undeniable that there's something charming in seeing an anime GTA experience. Hopefully, the game will be as fun to play as it looks in this early footage.</p>

Powered by Unreal Engine 5, the game will feature cel-shaded graphics like most games featuring Japanese anime aesthetics and will support advanced PC features like NVIDIA DLSS and ray tracing.

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Reportedly Planning Big Layoffs Next Week]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-layoffs-next-week-report</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-reportedly-planning-big-layoffs-next-week.1226964/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report has emerged which alleges that Xbox is planning what sound like sweeping layoffs across the company, shortly before the end of Microsoft's fiscal year.</p>

<p>According to Bloomberg's <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-24/microsoft-plans-major-job-cuts-at-xbox-gaming-division" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Jason Schreier</a>&nbsp;(who, in turn, cites "people familiar with the plans who asked not to be identified discussing nonpublic information"), the planned layoffs at Xbox are part of a "company-wide reorganization".</p>

<p>Schreier's report doesn't estimate how many employees will lose their jobs at Xbox, but he does say the cuts will be "substantial" and that they'll be made "across the entire [Xbox] group", so it sounds like every department has a chance to be affected by the layoffs.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gears-of-war-reloaded-xbox-layoffs-report.jpg?itok=mLR1YWmq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gears-of-war-reloaded-xbox-layoffs-report.jpg?itok=IvoQbyAP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Xbox is planning layoffs across its entire division, according to a new report.</figcaption></figure><p>As Schreier points out, this will be the fourth time Microsoft has engaged in layoffs across an eighteen-month period. Most recently, the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-3-percent-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">let go around 3% of its total employees</a>, with a Microsoft spokesperson then claiming the layoffs were to help the company achieve "success in a dynamic marketplace".</p>

<p>Prior to that, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-layoffs-january-2025" rel="nofollow">another wave of layoffs</a> took place at Microsoft in January. In both cases, Microsoft didn't disclose exactly how many employees lost their jobs, although they did do their employees the courtesy of revealing this information for layoffs <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-gaming-layoffs-september" rel="nofollow">put into effect in September last year</a>.</p>

<p>That's all in addition to almost 2,000 layoffs from the Xbox gaming workforce in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">January last year</a>. Of course, none of this stopped CEO Satya Nadella <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs" rel="nofollow">scoring an eye-watering payrise</a> in October, but then again, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-25-million-income-layoffs" rel="nofollow">t'was ever thus</a>.</p>

<p>Microsoft hasn't officially confirmed this latest round of Xbox layoffs yet, and it didn't provide comment to Bloomberg either, so we don't officially know these cuts are going ahead. It's entirely possible Microsoft may never publicly announce the cuts, too.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see if Microsoft issues an official statement confirming Bloomberg's reported layoffs. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <p>If ever there was a game I didn't expect to spawn a horde of spiritual successors from startup companies of varying dubiety, that game was celebrated commie hangover simulator <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a>. And yet here we are with yet another claimant to the dance floor, Pera Coda. In fairness, it takes inspiration from a lot more than just ZA/UM's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>, but Disco Elysium is mentioned rather prominently in the marketing.</p>
<p>Created by Falan, a Turkish team founded by three architecture students, Pera Coda is a timeloop story set in a "surreal", "neon-noir" Istanbul, in which you play an attorney, Deniz, who is navigating a purgatory inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bardo">Bardo in Buddhism</a>. The city is described as "both a stage and a mirror, where East meets West, chaos meets calm, and each district reflects a piece of your fragmented self." Certainly sounds quite Revacholian. Here's a teaser trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>Combat there is none: instead, you'll solve point-and-click puzzles and make use of a "masking" mechanic, which lets you resculpt Deniz's memories and alter certain objects in ways that persist across loops. The investor pitchdeck I've been sent compares the puzzling to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/outer-wilds">Outer Wilds</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/12-minutes">12 Minutes</a>. Another comparison that springs to my mind is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sexy-brutale">The Sexy Brutale</a>. </p>
<p>The Falan devs have posted a few concept videos of the game on social media, ahead of today's announcements. It's seemingly thanks to the popularity of those early videos that they've now partnered up with Elyzio, a company founded in 2022 by former Ubisoft technical director Anas El Ferachi and Google gaming consultant Dogan Can Yeginer. You might know Elyzio as the publishers of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1689640/Wardens_Will/">Warden's Will</a>, a movement shooter that earned a few thumbs-up from the Steam reviewerati. </p>
<p>Pera Coda's current development team under Elyzio includes game designer Cem Çelik, previously a junior designer at Crytek, technical director Arthur Trouslard, who has worked across Ubisoft, Sloclap and Don't Nod, and Mehmet Ali Şen, formerly of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cultic">Cultic</a>, whose past credits include <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1360390/Cats_and_the_Other_Lives/">Cats And The Other Lives</a>.</p>
<p>Very much speaking as a clueless Anglo European tourist, the thing I find most interesting about Pera Coda is the city, which is "grounded in real iconic buildings and neighbourhoods", but is punctured by hallucinations. I would also like to hear more of the game's interpretation of Bardo, about which I am also clueless. Here are some screens.</p>

<p>If you prefer your Disco Elysulikes to be developed by people who worked (in whatever capacity) on Disco Elysium, may I refer you to the three direct heirs - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-psychogeography-est-of-disco-elysiums-spiritual-successors-is-a-gonzo-journalism-rpg-named-hopetown">Hopetown</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yet-another-studio-formed-of-disco-elysium-alumni-has-announced-a-cerebral-sci-fi-rpg-just-to-confuse-you">XXX Nightshift</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-disco-elysium-devs-are-working-on-a-spiritual-successor-at-new-studio-longdue-though-robert-kurvitz-and-aleksander-rostov-arent-involved">whatever they're making at Summer Eternal</a>. All three were announced within hours of each other, producing what Nic called "an "I'm Spartacus"-ass day of press releases".</p>
<p>The rush continues with games like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2057760/Esoteric_Ebb/">Esoteric Ebb</a>. There are also a bunch of smaller Disco Elysuals on <a href="https://itch.io/c/5746476/disco-elysium">Itch.io</a>. I realise I'm probably doing some or all of these projects a disservice by framing them as Disco Elysium follow-ups, but it does feel a bit mad. Rumour has it that the pigeon currently trapped in your office is also making a Disco Elysium successor in collaboration with Tencent, based on the five minutes it once spent shitting on a ZA/UM staffer's sandwich. Personally, I'm reserving my pennies for the dawning of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/roadwarden">Roadwarden</a>-like trend.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-has-yet-another-heir-in-pera-coda-a-turkish-timeloop-rpg-set-in-a-dreamlike-version-of-istanbul]]></content:encoded>

While Microsoft claimed that no games were canceled in that most recent round of layoffs, developers at studios like <em>State of Decay 3</em> maker Undead Labs were impacted.</p><p>The ongoing cuts come at the tail end of an acquisition spree that culminated in buying <em>Call of Duty</em> and <em>Candy Crush</em> maker Activision Blizzard for $70 billion. The Xbox portfolio now constitutes the biggest gaming content publisher in the world, but at the cost of greater scrutiny and revenue expectations. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer, who usually prefers to talk about his favorite new games, has deflected blowback for the cuts over the last year by reiterating his responsibility to keep Xbox profitable. </p><p>  “Our jobs inside the company is to run a good business,” Spencer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mw26FdfkUDM&amp;list=PL0il2l-B_WwapNQtqa4Fr75ozqe3vHIQi&amp;index=3&amp;t=144s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mw26FdfkUDM&amp;list=PL0il2l-B_WwapNQtqa4Fr75ozqe3vHIQi&amp;index=3&amp;t=144s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said at Summer Game Fest earlier this month</a></span> right after Xbox’s big summer showcase. “We’re accountable to Microsoft for running a good business, a healthy business that continues to grow at both top line and bottom line. That’s kind of a foundation for us. And what that does is it allows us to continue to invest in Xbox for our community of players and creators and that we’re doing it. It does mean we have to make trade offs through the year on things that we’re going to invest more in, things that we’re not going to invest as much in because it is kind of we are the business that we are.”</p><p>The result has been not only bringing major first-party games like <em>Sea of Thieves</em> and <em>Gears of War</em> to PS5, but also raising prices. <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> will be the company’s first $80 game this fall, and the price of the Xbox Series X/S recently spiked due to new tariffs amid Trump’s ongoing trade war with China. It feels like only a matter of time before Game Pass Ultimate, currently $20 a month, also goes up in price again.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/xbox-prices-layoffs-next-gen-hardware-ps5-1851784992]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Journey Into Dreams Shaped by Point Cloud Technology</strong></p><p><em>Dreams of Another</em> is a third-person exploration action game built around the philosophical theme: No Creation Without Destruction. Unlike traditional <a title="Genres > Third-Person Shooter [1,316 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter/tps">third-person shooter games</a> where shooting destroys objects, here, shooting materializes and creates from an otherwise abstract, fragmented world.</p><p>The game’s standout feature is its use of point cloud rendering, where space is visualized as a collection of floating particles. On PlayStation VR2, this technique truly shines, enveloping the player in a dreamlike world where your body feels as though it’s dissolving into the environment. The result is a mysterious and deeply immersive sensation, like traveling within a dream itself. Thanks to VR, players can feel that they physically exist within these worlds made up of nothing but particles.</p><p><strong>A <a title="Games > Myst (2020) [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/myst-2020">Myst</a>erious Story of the Man in Pajamas and The Wandering Soldier</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>At the heart of <em>Dreams of Another</em> is a surreal journey through a dream world, led by two characters, The Man in Pajamas and The Wandering Soldier. But this world isn’t just inhabited by people: trees swaying in the wind, lonely doors, softly glowing streetlights, and all sorts of objects come alive with humorous dialogue that casts a quirky light on the questions of human society. Through <a title="Genres > Virtual Reality [191 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/virtual-reality">virtual reality</a>, they feel as though they’re right there in front of you, drawing you even more deeply in.</p><p><strong>Seamlessly Switch Between First and Third-Person Perspectives</strong></p><p>In the PlayStation VR2 version, players can switch between the third-person perspective used in the <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,795 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> version and a special virtual reality-only first-person mode. The third-person view emphasizes the game’s concept and storytelling, allowing players to watch the narrative unfold while seeing their character. In contrast, the first-person mode offers heightened immersion, placing the world of point clouds directly in front of your eyes and allowing for close-up inspection of every detail.</p><p>We recommend using the DualSense controller for third-person mode and the PlayStation VR2 Sense controllers for first-person mode. Either way, you’ll experience the shimmering, particle-built dream as if you were truly inside it.</p><p><strong>Eye-Tracking Camera Control in Third-Person View</strong></p><p>Third-person mode takes advantage of eye-tracking, allowing players to shoot simply by looking in a direction. This keeps the intuitive feel of the standard PlayStation 5 version while making gameplay even faster and more fluid. Both the regular and VR versions use haptic feedback and adaptive triggers for a uniquely Dreams of Another experience to further deepen the immersion.</p><p><strong>A Variety of Weapons and Quirky Items</strong></p><p>As players traverse the dreamlike landscape built of point clouds, they’ll encounter entities called Auras. These require a variety of weapons such as submachine guns , grenades and rocket launchers to overcome and these are unlocked as you play through. The rocket launcher, in particular, offers a thrilling experience as its immense power scatters wide areas of point clouds, instantly materializing the impact zone.</p><p>Grenades, on the other hand, offer a tense and strategic gameplay experience as players must carefully time their explosions to hit the Auras. VR amplifies the tension and impact of Aura encounters in a different way again, making them feel even more direct and thrilling. You’ll also discover curious items likeSomeone’s wedding ring or A blown fuse that has served its purpose, adding another layer of exploration and wonder to the game.</p></div><p><em>Dreams of Another</em> is due out for PlayStation 5 with PlayStation VR2 support and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3561230/Dreams_of_Another/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> in 2025.</p><p>Watch the trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/06/dreams-of-another-playstation-vr2-gameplay-trailer]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Popular gaming peripheral manufacturer Dbrand has acknowledged a defect affecting a small number of its Project Killswitch <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2?page=2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> cases.</p>
<p>This defect impacts the lip attaching the joycons to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> screen, disconnecting when the console is held up by a singular joycon. Speaking to influencer Nintendo Prime, the company has stated it's in the process of fixing the issue.</p>
<p>"Yep, we're definitely working on it. Ultimately, this is a manufacturing tolerance issue on the small lip keeping the Joy-Con Grips attached to the Joy-Cons (some were a hair too thick)," Dbrand told Nintendo Prime. "We've got a replacement program set up already, where anyone who is affected is able to email robots@dbrand.com with 'July Joy-Cons' in the subject to be added to the list for replacement stock in July."</p>

<p>According to Nintendo Prime, Dbrand also acknowledged this problem was replicable among a "small number of units from their run". Nintendo Prime didn't share the exact number he was told, but reemphasised any defective Killswitch cases could be replaced for free in July.</p>
<p>There are plenty of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-accessories-deals-third-party-jsaux">great third-party accessories for the Nintendo Switch 2</a> - Dbrand's Killswitch included!

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/project-motor-racing-will-speed-onto-xbox-series-x-s-ps5-and-pc-in-fall-2025/">Project Motor Racing</a> developer Straight4 Studios and publisher GIANTS Software have announced that the upcoming sim racing game will arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on <strong>November 25, 2025.</strong></p>
<p>A new trailer showcases Project Motor Racing's career mode and the intricacies involved in how Straight4 Studios is simulating the career of a professional racer, where winning isn't always the most important thing. It's being able to afford the next race, win or lose.</p>
<p>"<em>We wanted to capture the harsh reality of pro motorsport</em>," said the game design director at Straight4 Studios, Austin Ogonoski, in a press release.</p>
<p>"<em>Budgets, repairs, sponsors. Failed overtakes that don't just wreck your car but your whole season. Your career in Project Motor Racing is motorsport with consequences</em>."</p>
<p>The career mode will have you negotiating sponsorships, what you can afford to build out your car, and the choice between giving it your all in each race versus making sure you'll have a car to race with for the next one.</p>
<p><iframe title="Single Player Reveal: Your Career Starts November 25, 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i-TcJHeA_3s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Along with the release date and the introduction of the career mode, publisher GIANTS Software also confirms that the game will launch with full modding support on day one.</p>
<p>The game is being built with the GIANTS Engine, and as the company's head of publisher, Boris Stefan put it in a press release, "<em>Project Motor Racing taps into the same powerhouse modding ecosystem as Farming Simulator. Racing modders will be able to tweak, tune, and transform their experience however they like.</em>"</p>
<p>Pre-orders are now available for Project Motor Racing on all platforms.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/690231/death-stranding-cutscenes-skip</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-skipped-every-death-stranding-cutscene-and-i%E2%80%99ll-do-it-again.1226898/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I beat the original <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20941606/death-stranding-review-ps4-hideo-kojima">Death Stranding</a></em>, but please don’t ask me what happened in it. There was a cataclysm — not quite a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/664492/clair-obscur-expedition-33-twist-spoilers">Gommage</a> — that made the US more divided than ever, and you play as a babysitter-meets-delivery-guy who has special awareness of invisible, hostile creatures called BTs that are “beached,” which isn’t as relaxing as it sounds. There are grenades filled with pee, poop, and blood, and everyone who’s anyone was motion-captured to be in the game. There are whales, Guillermo del Toro (in appearance but not in voice), huge pools of tar, and Geoff Keighley is there, too.</p><p>Sounds like a silly game, right? It is, especially if you skip all of the cutscenes in the game, like I did. And I plan on doing the exact same thing now that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/690468/death-stranding-2-review-ps5">the sequel is here</a>.</p><p><em>Death Stranding</em>’s long cutscenes repelled me from playing through it, and I say that as a longtime fan of the <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> games. After five or so failed attempts at getting past the first episode since the game’s 2019 launch on the PS4, due to trying to play it “right” — which I thought required close examination of every word and frame of this bizarrely written story — I just said “screw it.” I finally beat the game on my Steam Deck (runs great!) just a couple months ago.</p><p>It’s not that the cutscenes are bad, but their plodding, cinematic pacing feels at odds with the game’s overarching design, which is a glorified physics sandbox stuffed with just as much humor as there is desolation. Plus, the gameplay is so good that I didn’t want to wait for my reward of just getting to run around again and deliver stuff. Anything that helps me more quickly get to the ridiculous mid-to-late-game Sam-versus-Higgs boxing match is worth it.</p><p><em>Death Stranding</em>, even when played as an exposition-light adventure, still holds up because the game is good at doling out meaningful upgrades to how you traverse the fractured land. Aside from missions that require speed (such as pizza delivery) or the utmost care (such as nuke delivery), its design embraces open-ended exploration.</p><p>Similar to <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, some early environmental obstacles might prove overwhelming enough to put you on a staid, critical path from time to time, but it rarely forces you to choose one method over another. Put a ladder here, a rope or bridge there, or drift down a mountain on a floating carrier. It’s fun enough just getting to tough-to-reach markings strewn about the world where fellow Porters have… peed. Experimentation breathes levity into a game world that really needs more of it.</p><div><p><cite>GIF: Cameron Faulkner / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Skipping cutscenes allowed me to fully sink my teeth into a game that I would have otherwise missed out on. And you’d better believe that I’ll be playing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/690468/death-stranding-2-review-ps5"><em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em> </a>the same way. Despite the allure of some seriously quirky characters and the potential of this being the last game in the series for a while (perhaps <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/31/24057536/physint-is-the-working-title-of-hideo-kojimas-new-not-a-metal-gear-game">Physint</a></em> will be next from Kojima Productions), I’m holding fast to my playstyle. I’m most interested to see how the sequel evolves traversal, and the interplay of the environment and player choice. Cutscenes are just another obstacle.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/690231/death-stranding-cutscenes-skip]]></content:encoded>
