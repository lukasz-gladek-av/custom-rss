            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Have you heard the news? <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-november-rockstar-games-2000641787"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> has been delayed again</a>. The open-world crime simulator is no longer releasing in May 2026 and will now instead launch in November 2026. So why the delay? According to Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick, it’s because Rockstar Games is seeking “perfection” and the studio’s Metacritic track record is proof that this strategy works.</p> <p>During a November 6 earnings call, Zelnick, who leads Rockstar parent Company Take-Two, was asked about how the <a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-gta6-reaction-news-2000641817"><em>GTA 6</em> delay</a> was affecting the studio and what Rockstar Games was doing at this stage in development. While Zelnick declined to get into the “inner workings” of the developer, he did talk about the company’s culture and focus on making critically acclaimed games.</p>

 <p>“I think the culture of Rockstar [Games] is extraordinary, and we’re all pushing hard to to seek perfection,” said Zelnick during the <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251106169372/en/Take-Two-Interactive-Software-Inc.-Reports-Results-for-Fiscal-Second-Quarter-2026">earnings call.</a> Take-Two’s stock <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/06/take-two-gta-vi-delay.html">sank around 7 percent</a> after news of the delay was made public. The CEO then praised how highly rated Rockstar-developed games are on review aggregator Metacritic.</p>

 <p>“I mean, the Metacritic scores of Rockstar releases are, generally, speaking, not generally I mean, with very few exceptions, have been over 95,” explained Zelnick.&nbsp; “<em>GTA V</em>, as you know, has been the standard bearer, not just for our company, but for the industry through three console generations, and to this day, is still, I would argue, the most technologically advanced title in the marketplace, despite [being more than a] decade old, and that doesn’t happen by accident.”</p>

 <p>I’d quibble a bit here and point out that only seven of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/company/rockstar-games/?sort-options=score">Rockstar’s video game releases have hit 95 and only 4 got a higher score on Metacritic</a>, with most landing in the high 80s and low 90s. But there’s no denying that over the last 15 years Rockstar Games has mostly produced critically acclaimed blockbusters like <em>Red Dead Redemption, GTA V, and Red Dead Redemption II.&nbsp;</em></p>

 <p>Zelnick added that Rockstar and all of Take-Two’s studios are focused on “seeking excellence, teamwork and kindness.” Not sure how reported efforts at union busting factor into that, but it’s a nice sentiment.</p> <p>Of course, the problem is that with each passing year and each delay, the expectations for <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> grow and grow. The video game industry isn’t standing still and waiting for Rockstar to make the next big open-world masterpiece. The genre has continued to evolve thanks to games like <em>Elden Ring, Kingdom Come Deliverance, Far Cry, Tears of the Kingdom, Death Stranding 2, Forza Horizon 5,</em> and others. What people expect from a big, AAA open-world video game has changed a lot since 2013’s <em>GTA V</em> and 2019’s<em> Red Dead Redemption 2</em>. Will Rockstar’s pursuit of “perfection” make it harder for the studio to keep up with the rest of the industry, leading to a game that feels dated? Or will the studio innovate and help reshape the genre it practically created? We’ll find out in November 2026. <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-date-delay-ceo-strauss-zelnick-2000641798">Probably. Maybe. We’ll see.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dyson-takes-a-loss-on-this-v9-vacuum-cleaner-at-55-off-black-friday-kicked-off-early.1346383/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Corded, heavy, and noisy vacuum cleaners should really be a thing of the past by now. If you’re still dragging one of these around every morning, wondering who ever said cleaning was therapeutic, it’s probably time for an upgrade.</p>
<p>Dyson has some of the best options out there, and right now, one of its latest models just hit its lowest price ever. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5380/">Dyson V9 Motorbar vacuum cleaner is now going for just $269 on Amazon, after a massive 55% discount</a>. It comes with multiple attachments to tackle different spaces, and does its job without waking the whole house up. This early Black Friday deal is available to both Prime and non-Prime members, but it ends soon. Get your orders in before the price goes back up to $599, or the stock runs out for good.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5380/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Cleans Multiple Surfaces Like a Pro</h2>
<p>This vacuum is Dyson’s most lightweight model yet, meaning you won’t be left with sore arms after a session. It comes with a whole set of attachments that include a crevice tool, a hair screw tool, a Motorbar cleaner head, and a combination tool; one for every type of surface and mess. The Motorbar cleaner head automatically adjusts to different floor types and is built to de-tangle hair as it cleans. <strong>V9’s high-velocity motor spins at up to 120,000rpm to generate up to 100 Air Watts</strong> of powerful suction, so expect it to handle even the most stubborn dirt and debris like a pro.</p>



<p>You can choose between three cleaning modes based on what you’re tackling; Eco, Med, and Boost. A <strong>single charge gets you up to 40 minutes of runtime</strong>&nbsp;which is enough to sweep through a couple of rooms, plus the living area. There’s a bright LCD screen on top that keeps you in the loop about remaining run time, current power mode, filter maintenance reminders, etc.</p>
<p>Best of all, the <strong>vacuum easily converts into a handheld</strong> for when you need to clean stairs, car seats, upholstery, etc. Once you’re done cleaning, simply press the eject button to empty the dirt into the bin. Then, you can drop it into the wall-mounted charging dock, and it will be ready for the next cleaning session in no time!</p>
<p>This is the lowest price we have seen this new model drop to. On a regular day, it would run you around $599, but you can grab it for $269 if you’re quick.</p>

In the aptly-titled Celeste's Journal quest in Arc Raiders, you'll need to visit two separate locations on opposite ends of the Dam Battlegrounds map to collect this trader's possessions, so strap in for quite a raid.</p><p>If you want to make things easier on yourself for Celeste's Journals, you'll want to equip an augment with a safe pocket, as you'll need to extract with both of the journals and return to Speranza to complete this quest. This can be tough to pull off due to the long trek you'll need to make through potentially dangerous areas to gather both of them, so also be sure to bring a decent gun and enough ammo to keep you feeling safe.</p><p>When you're ready to set off and finish this challenging quest, follow the steps below.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Hi everyone, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA 6</a> has been delayed again. It's now set to arrive on November 19th, 2026, about half a year on from the May 26th date it'd landed on following its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-has-been-delayed-even-though-take-two-boss-kept-telling-everyone-it-wouldnt-be">last delay</a>. November 19th, 2026 will apparently be a Thursday, just in case you were wondering.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This latest delay was announced by Take-Two and Rockstar as part of the former's latest financial report. "We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve," reads a tweet from Rockstar. The tweet begins "hi everyone", which isn't funny, but my evening brain's finding it so, mainly because it makes the post read a bit like a substitute teacher announcing that the regular teacher's stuck in traffic until November 19th, 2026, so can you all please react to that news without erupting into complete anarchy.</p>
<p>Anyway, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick spoken to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-is-delayed-again-until-november-2026">IGN</a> about the delay, which sees the much-hyped crime/love game slip a whole year from its original autumn 2025 release goal. "Rockstar has our full support of course, and we are confident they will deliver an unrivalled blockbuster entertainment experience," he said. Asked what's changed since he said he was confident in that original 2025 goal, the exec added: "It’s- it's all of 2025. We’ve had more time to develop the title. And so we are getting closer to the release. We are grateful that it is still within the same fiscal year. And mostly we’re grateful to Rockstar for constantly seeking perfection."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Hi everyone,</p><p>Grand Theft Auto VI will now release on Thursday, November 19, 2026.</p><p>We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and… <a href="https://t.co/yLX9KIiDzX">pic.twitter.com/yLX9KIiDzX</a></p></div>— Rockstar Games (@RockstarGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/1986540361011880167?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>He's also chatted with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-again?r=52dp8y&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;triedRedirect=true">The Game Business</a>. In that discussion Zelnick stressed that Take-Two "feel really good" about the new date, adding that even though it's a year away, the company's date setting's "not that far in advance if you look at when you need to deliver a game to get it out". In the meantime, the exec said, Rockstar'll keep on plugging with GTA Online so people can get their crime/not as much love fix.</p><p>So, there you go. This latest delay comes on a day which has seen protests outside of Take-Two's London offices and Rockstar North's Edinburgh HQ in response to the studio firing around 30 UK-based workers for "gross misconduct", as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/as-rockstar-accuse-fired-staff-of-leaking-secrets-unions-launch-street-protests-against-publisher-take-two">Edwin reported</a>. The IWGB Union have claimed that this was done as retaliation against an attempt to unionise, while Rockstar have since asserted that the fired staff shared "confidential information on a public forum".</p>

              <p><em>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</em> stars Captain America and Black Panther during World War II and is written by Amy Hennig, one of the masterminds behind the <em>Uncharted g</em>ames. It’s also not coming out anytime soon. It’s been delayed again and doesn’t have a new release window this time.</p> <p>“<em>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</em> is an ambitious project, and we are committed to ensuring it meets the level of quality that our team, players, and fans expect,” Skydance Games announced <a href="https://twitter.com/SkydanceGames/status/1986539089164972440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1986539089164972440%7Ctwgr%5E56ccbf8232d563aa478d6ce3a863eaaa720620aa%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fwp%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost-new.php">on X</a> on Thursday while everyone was preoccupied <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-november-rockstar-games-2000641787">with other game delay news</a>. “To fully realize our vision for <em>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</em>, we’ve made the decision to shift our release window beyond early 2026.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Important update regarding MARVEL 1943: Rise of Hydra. <a href="https://t.co/y3WRSjVmds">pic.twitter.com/y3WRSjVmds</a></p> <p>— Skydance Games (@SkydanceGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/SkydanceGames/status/1986539089164972440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><em>Rise of Hydra</em> was originally supposed to ship in holiday 2025. Then in May of this year, Skydance <a href="https://x.com/SkydanceGames/status/1922275645402337325">announced it would be pushed back</a> to early 2026 so the team could add more “polish.” At this point it seems like there’s more than just additional polish that’s needed.</p>

 <p>For anyone who hasn’t been following the project, <em>Rise of Hydra</em> takes place in Occupied Paris and is based on the limited comic book series <em>Captain America/Black Panther: Flags of Our Fathers</em>. The action-adventure sports a team-up between Steve Rogers, Azzuri, Howling Commandos member Gabriel Jones, and Wakandan spy chief Nanali.</p>

  <p>The game was first confirmed back in 2021, teased at the D23 Expo in 2022, and finally received a full Unreal Engine 5 trailer in 2024. Skydance has been hyping the cast and the cinematics looked great but we’ve yet to see any real gameplay or get a real sense of the caliber of the game. But it would be cool if a new game Hennig worked on <a href="https://kotaku.com/before-it-was-cancelled-star-wars-1313-was-going-to-be-470003660">finally got to actually come out</a>.</p> <p>It’s also the only <em>Black Panther</em> game we’re likely to get for some time. EA <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-panther-ea-cliffhanger-monolith-productions-1851782787">canceled its own</a> and shut down the studio making it. Things were very different when <em>Rise of Hydra</em> was first greenlit as well. Hopefully it arrives before too much longer. Just maybe not during fall 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new update from Battlefield 6 developers reveals that bots are being reintroduced to Verified Experiences. </p>



<p>Battlefield 6 developers have been addressing bots across various modes in their title since the game’s launch. The lead producer recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-bots-system-explained-by-lead-producer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">explained</a> how the bot system works in BF6, the criteria that need to be met, and how they can help the situation. Now, a new update reveals that bots will be returning for their community experiences.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-bots-will-grant-reduced-xp-and-each-game-mode-supports-12-of-them">Battlefield 6 Bots Will Grant Reduced XP and Each Game Mode Supports 12 of Them</h2>



<p>The latest update regarding bots returning to Battlefield 6’s Verified Experiences was shared through an official post from the BattlefieldComms <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1986550835615027359" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter). <span>The developers had&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1981556746482307086" target="_blank">temporarily removed</a>&nbsp;bots from Verified Experiences to support healthier matchmaking in their Community Servers and Portal Experiences update last month,</span> and are now reintroducing them to Conquest, Breakthrough, and Rush. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The post explains that each game mode will support up to 12 bots. If bot backfill is enabled, matches will require eight players to start, with up to 6 bots filling each team. If backfill is not enabled, you will need 20 players to start the match. </p>



<p>Bots will provide reduced XP in BF6, and player XP will remain at 100% (similar values to Multiplayer modes). Moreover, when bots are enabled, players’ statistics, such as hours played, kill/death ratio, and total revives, will not show any gains or losses. The stats system is currently not functioning as intended and is being actively adjusted. Lastly, challenges will remain completable.</p>



<p>In other news, Battlefield 6 players are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-players-turn-off-crossplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">editing game files</a> to turn off matchmaking against ‘overpowered’ aim assist. Additionally, the game has reportedly sold <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-has-reportedly-sold-over-10-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 10 million copies</a> across all platforms.

		<p>Perhaps hoping to bury their bad news behind <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/06/gta-6-has-been-delayed-again-to-november-2026/">the GTA 6 delay</a>, Skydance Games has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a> has been delayed beyond its early 2026 window and has no new release date or window.</p>
<p>In a classic apology text image announcement thing – do these have a technical term? – &nbsp;<a href="https://xcancel.com/SkydanceGames/status/1986539089164972440">the team writes</a>:</p>


<p>“At Skydance Games, our goal is to deliver unforgettable, premium games that honor the characters and worlds we’re fortunate to work with. MARVEL 1943: Rise of Hydra is an ambitious project, and we are committed to ensuring it meets the level of quality that our team, players, and fans expect.</p>
<p>“To fully realize our vision for MARVEL 1943: Rise of Hydra, we’ve made the decision to shift our release window beyond early 2026.</p>
<p>“We’re grateful for the passion and support from the community and players around the world. The team is working hard to create something truly special, and we look forward to sharing more with you as development progresses.”</p>

<p>It’s another significant setback to the Amy Hennig-led superhero game. Announced in March of last year, after originally been teased in 2021, the initial target was a &nbsp;2025 release… but outside of the cinematic reveal trailer last summer, we’ve heard and seen precious little about this game.</p>
<p>You’ve just got to hope they weren’t planning on a November 2026 release, because… that’d be a bit awkward now, wouldn’t it?</p>
<p>Taking the superhero fight back to World War 2,&nbsp;Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra will have four playable characters with the perspectives switching between Captain America, Black Panther, Nanali, and Gabriel Jones. This will give different gameplay aspects too, with Nanali likely having much more sneaking and spying compared to the other characters.</p>
<p>The cast for the game includes Khary Payton as Azzuri, T’Challa’s grandfather and the Black Panther in this game’s timeline, Drew Moerlein taking on the role of Steve Rogers/Captain America, Megalyn Echikunwoke portraying Nanali, a Wakandan spy, Marque Richardson lending his voice to Gabriel Jones, a member of the Howling Commandos, Lyne Renée voicing Julie, a member of the French Resistance, and Howard Stark, Tony Stark’s father, is being voiced by Joel Johnstone.</p>

<p>Over 100 jobs in the UK are potentially affected</p>

<figure data-uuid="73a8897453561"><a title="Final Fantasy VII Remake Cloud" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/73a8897453561/final-fantasy-vii-remake-cloud.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>Reports have emerged that Square Enix is the latest video game company to be hit with layoffs today, with job cuts across "nearly all areas" outside of Japan including roles in sales, marketing, and publishing.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/square-enix-announces-more-layoffs-as-part-of-us-and-europe-restructuring/">VGC broke the news</a> earlier today and reports that Square Enix president Takashi Kiryu held a video call to staff outside of Japan — including Europe, the UK, and the US — to tell employees that a "fundamental restructuring of the overseas publishing organization" will be taking place.</p>
<p>This will involve staff losing their jobs and those that remain will also be required to be present in the office more often. Employees are being told the news today, and staff have already shared posts on social media announcing their departures.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-undergoes-mass-layoffs-as-it-reorganizes-to-consolidate-development-in-japan">IGN</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-06/square-enix-lays-off-staff-in-global-restructuring?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MjQ1ODk3NCwiZXhwIjoxNzYzMDYzNzc0LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNUJMWDNHUEw0MjkwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.8hIi4eIEjJGIFf5pODYhOL8-J_P1II2FnRzzFRYs6BY&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a> have also corroborated this information, with today's <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/news/pdf/20251106_01_en.pdf">progress report</a> stating that the restructuring "Implementation of structural reforms in overseas publishing organizations to further strengthen global publishing capabilities and improve operational efficiency".</p>
<p>According to the Progress Report (linked above), the Overseas Structural Reform is expected to save around 3 billion yen, or around USD $19.6 million.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Square Enix told both Bloomberg and IGN that the decision to make cuts and layoffs was "extremely difficult" though declined to tell the outlet how many jobs this will hit. According to IGN, around 137 jobs are potentially affected in the UK.</p>
<p>The company "extend[s] our heartfelt gratitude" to those affected and that "During this period of transition, we remain committed to treating each individual with the utmost respect and providing extensive support throughout this process."</p>
<p>This news follows the news <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/square-enix-aims-to-automate-70percent-of-qa-with-generative-ai-by-2027">that Square Enix hopes</a> to "Automate 70% of QA and debugging tasks in game development by the end of 2027" using generative AI. Today's layoffs are reportedly unrelated to that announcement, as per <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3m4yebaj5jk2o">Jason Schreier on Bluesky</a>.</p>
<p>But it does come at a time when the video game industry is struggling, and over three years after Square Enix already sold off <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/05/embracer-group-to-acquire-crystal-dynamics-square-enix-montreal-eidos-montreal-plus-ips-for-usd300-million">a number of its international development teams to Embrace Group</a>.</p>
<p>More details are sure to emerge; we wish for all the best for those impacted by today's layoffs.</p>

			<p>Skydance Games and Amy Hennig's upcoming Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra has been delayed once again, and will no longer hit its previously announced early 2026 release window, the studio announced today.</p>



<p>It's the second major game delay to be announced today, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/">Grand Theft Auto VI's delay</a> understandably taking up most of the oxygen. Skydance Games even made its announcement five minutes before Rockstar Games' post went live.</p>



<p>In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Skydance Games wrote, "<em>Our goal is to deliver unforgettable, premium games that honor the characters and the worlds we're fortunate to work with. Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is an ambitious project, and we are committed to ensuring it meets the level of quality that our team, players, and fans expect</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>To fully realize our vision for Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra, we've made the decision to shift our release window beyond early 2026. We're grateful for the passion and support from the community and players around the world. The team is working hard to create something truly special, and we look forward to sharing more with you as development progresses</em>."</p>

<p>We've known that Amy Hennig and Skydance Games have been working on a Marvel project for a while, though its official title <a href="https://wccftech.com/1943-rise-of-hydra-amy-hennig-2025-unreal-engine-5-trailer/">wasn't revealed until March 2024, at which point it was also slated to launch in 2025</a>.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, (shortly after Rockstar first announced GTA VI would launch in May 2026, in fact), Skydance Games confirmed that Rise of Hydra <a href="https://wccftech.com/amy-hennig-and-skydance-games-marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed-into-2026/">would not make its initially set 2025 release window, and pushed the game to early 2026</a>.</p>



<p>Now, its release window seems to be sometime mid-to-late 2026, though we've been given no more specifics than that. Wherever it lands, it's clear that 2026 is shaping up to be a year for big releases.</p>

Zelnick replied, "It’s- it's all of 2025. We’ve had more time to develop the title. And so we are getting closer to the release. We are grateful that it is still within the same fiscal year.

		<p>Rockstar has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> has been delayed again, and is now coming out on 19th November 2026.</p>
<p>“We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait,” <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/ak3ak31a49a221/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-now-set-to-launch-november-19-2026">the studio writes</a>, “but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve.</p>


<p>“We want to thank you again for your patience and support. While the wait is a little longer, we are incredibly excited for players to experience the sprawling state of Leonida and a return to modern day Vice City.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gta-6">GTA 6</a> had previously been <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/02/gta-6-gets-a-release-date-but-its-been-delayed-to-2026/">set for launch on 26th May 2026</a>, and while this was the first firm date that we had for launch from Take Two and Rockstar, it had come after the better part of a year of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/17/gta-6-targets-late-2025-release-date-as-take-two-narrows-launch-window/">Take Two execs assuring</a>&nbsp;that the game was going to launch in 2025.</p>
<p>The studio has, quite awkwardly, been grabbing headlines for what has been lambasted as “brazen” union busting by leaders of the IWGB union who has been helping to coordinate unionisation efforts among employees. 30-40 employees were let go last week, which <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/06/rockstar-responds-to-union-busting-accusations-says-fired-employees-were-leakers/">Rockstar has claimed was for disclosing confidential details in a public forum</a>, though this is disputed by the IWGB. This will no doubt rumble on for a while to come.</p>

<p>The last we saw of GTA 6 came in May with the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/06/grand-theft-auto-vi-gets-a-second-trailer/">the game’s second trailer</a>:</p>
<p><iframe title="Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VQRLujxTm3c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto VI will take us all back to Vice City for Rockstar’s latest crime story, featuring Lucia, the series’ first female protagonist, who’s coming fresh out of prison, and Jason, who works with the local drugrunners after quitting the army.</p>
<p>The trailers have shown off the modern day setting in the fictionalised state of Leonida, with a handful of things like social media influence and excesses feeding into the atmosphere, though that won’t stop there being plenty of iconic classic cars and inspirations from the breadth of American culture in the South East of the country and Florida in particular. From packed beaches to going across the swamps on hover craft, and partying at the tops of skyscrapers, there’s also jokes thrown into the trailer about battling crocodiles in back garden swimming pools, “Floridaman” antics – Leonidaman in the game – and plenty more.</p>

			<p>After it was<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/"> initially set to launch on May 26, 2026</a>, Rockstar Games has announced that Grand Theft Auto VI will suffer at least one more delay, as the game gets pushed from May 26, 2026, to November 19, 2026.</p>



<p>The news was announced in a brief post on X (formerly Twitter) from the official Rockstar Games account. No specific reason is cited for the delay; Rockstar just says that it needed the extra time to hit the level of polish and quality it wants.</p>



<p>"<em>Hi everyone,</em>" the post begins. "<em>Grand Theft Auto VI will now release on Thursday, November 19, 2026. We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve</em>."</p>

</div></figure>



<p>In a reply to the post, Rockstar continues, "<em>We want to thank you again for your patience and support. While the wait is a little longer, we are incredibly excited for players to experience the sprawling state of Leonida and a return to modern-day Vice City.</em>"</p>



<p>Earlier this year, when Rockstar announced its May 2026 date, a little more than a year before it would arrive, it seemed like that could be the final delay for the game. Not only had Rockstar called its shot a year out, <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-reportedly-had-no-chance-of-releasing-in-2025-for-months-due-in-part-to-a-real-desire-to-avoid-crunch/">but reports had claimed it had no chance of arriving in 2025 anyway</a>. It felt like it was always going to have been a 2026 release, so now that we had a 2026 date, it felt fairly set in stone.</p>



<p>That said, this delay is absolutely not surprising, considering how much time, effort, and money has been poured into Grand Theft Auto VI. Rockstar and Take-Two will settle for absolutely no less than what they deem perfect, and will take all the time it needs to hit that quality bar.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-again">The Game Business</a> published shortly after the delay was announced, Take-Two Interactive boss Strauss Zelnick commented on the delay, saying, "<em>When we set a date, we really do believe in it. We said when we set the last date, if a game requires more polish to be the best possible version of itself, then we will give that game more time. And that's exactly what happened</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>We feel really good about this release date. It's in the same fiscal year, it happens to be a great release window, and naturally, we're really supportive of Rockstar's approach</em>."</p>

<p>Your gear determines much of your success while playing a game of <i>Arc Raiders</i>, but so do your skills. The game chops up 45 different skills across three trees, with most skills improving your general mobility and speed, as well as your ability to loot.</p> <p><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-tips-solo-group-recycle-free-loadout-2000641174">14 Essential Tips For Getting Started In <em>Arc Raiders</em></a></p> <p>But with so many choices, it’s easy to get lost. So let me share with you my thoughts on which skills are most beneficial, based on my 60 hours with the game.</p>

 <p>Keep in mind, however, that I’m primarily a solo player, and my choices have often been made with that in mind. And while I don’t shy away from gunfights, I’m a fan of stealth games, so I’m often sneaking around on maps like Sam Fisher. I’ve also not yet weighed in on which of the skills at the very ends of the skill trees are best. The game is still young, so metas have yet to be solidified. Still, you can’t go wrong with the options I’ve laid out here.</p>

 <h2><span id="skill-tree-basics"></span>Skill tree basics<span></span></h2> <p><i>Arc Raiders</i> has a level cap of 75. You get 1 XP per level, which you can invest in a skill tree that covers 45 different skills distributed across three main branches. You can sink multiple points into many of these skills. So, no, you can’t unlock everything in the tree. You also can’t respec easily (you’ll have to wipe your character to do so by completing a project, which requires a ton of loot and has a specific timed window in which to send your character off).</p>

 <h2><span id="10-universally-great-skills-for-(almost)-every-playstyle%e2%80%93solo-or-grouped-up"></span>10 universally great skills for (almost) every playstyle–solo or grouped up<span></span></h2> <p>There are a ton of different ways to play <i>Arc Raiders</i>, with various guns and gadgets to help you live out the fantasy of a sniper, grenadier, shotgunner, or even freerunner.</p> <p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-solo-night-raid-quest-pvp-pve-2000641437">So Much Happens In A Single Hour Of&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em></a></p> <p>Still, there are some skills that will benefit just about anyone. At a minimum, everyone should invest at least one skill point into each of the starting points of each three. For Mobility that’s “Nimble Climber,” which lets you climb and vault faster. For Conditioning that’s “Used to the Weight,” which lets you move faster while wearing heavier shields. And for Survival, “Agile Croucher” lets you move faster while crouching.</p>

 <p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-roadmap-new-map-patch-barricade-2000641734#comments"><em>Arc Raiders&nbsp;</em>Has A Big Roadmap And A New Update But Fans Want Some Things Kept Secret</a></p> <p>You need to buy these skills to progress in their respective trees, but they also should give you a good idea of the general direction each tree will take you. From there, I highly recommend observing what you think your weak points are while playing and what you’d like to improve.</p>

 <p><strong>But from the Mobility tree, everyone should at least snag “Marathon Runner” and “Youthful Lungs”</strong> so you can move and run farther and for longer.</p> <p><strong>From the Survival tree, I recommend everyone at least grab “Looter’s Instincts” and “Silent Scavenger.”</strong> These will help you loot faster and more quietly.</p>

 <p><strong>From the Conditioning tree, I recommend “Gentle Pressure” and “Proficient Pryer.”</strong> These two will combine to make your breaching faster and quieter.</p> <p>Lastly, <strong>everyone should aim to get “Security Breach”</strong> from Survival at some point, as it’s required for looting specific locations.</p> <p>These 10 skills will help you with some of the most consistent activities in <i>Arc Raiders</i>: traveling and looting.</p> <p>In my estimation, the usefulness of every other skill is highly dependent on your play style. For example, something like “Downed but Determined,” found in the Conditioning tree, will let you stay in a down-but-not-out state longer before you get fully knocked out. Personally, I’d rather focus on avoiding being downed and investing skill points into something like “Revitalizing Squat” in Survival, which boosts your stamina regeneration while crouched.</p>

 <p>Again, my playstyle, which is often solo, sees me routinely covering lots of distance, so taking a breather while crouched helps me stay moving–plus, if I’m hunkered down in cover and crouched, I’ll also regenerate stamina faster to get away from whatever bad situation ‘m in.</p> <p>That said, I can still offer some general guidelines for things to consider when selecting your skills based on whether you primarily play solo or in a group.</p> <h2><span id="15-of-the-best-skills-for-solo-players"></span>15 of the best skills for solo players<span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000641791" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641791"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641791">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>All of these skills should be considered in addition to the universal skills mentioned above. In my opinion, Mobility is perhaps the most important skill category for solo players who often need to get the hell out of a bad situation as fast as possible. <b>Consider investing in these Mobility skills if you’re running on your own</b>:</p>

 <ul> <li><b>Slip and Slide</b> (sliding is already pretty generous, so at least one point should work for a while)</li> <li><b>Sturdy Ankles</b></li> <li><b>Calming Stroll</b> (this ability lets you recover stamina while walking at the same rate as if you were still, making it a great way to recover stamina while still heading toward your destination)</li> <li><b>Effortless Roll</b></li> <li><b>Heroic Leap</b></li> </ul> <p>As you can probably guess, this is leaning toward a more parkour-based build, but I’ve found high Mobility is essential to staying alive when you don’t have backup regardless of how much you intend to move around like a typical <i>Assassin’s Creed </i>protagonist.</p> <p><b>From the Survival tree, I recommend the following skills for solo play:&nbsp;</b></p> <ul> <li><b>Revitalizing Squat</b> (lets you regenerate stamina more quickly while crouched, which can help you make your getaway if you’re hiding from an assailant)</li> <li><b>In-Round Crafting</b></li> <li><b>Good As New</b></li> <li><b>Stubborn Mule </b>(good only if you’re okay pushing your luck and exfiltrating with an encumbered status from carrying so much)</li> <li><b>Three Deep Breaths</b></li> <li><b>Traveling Tinkerer</b></li> </ul> <p>I haven’t unlocked some of these skills myself yet, but they’re likely to be the next ones I grab. Again, everything here maximizes stamina recovery and the ability to get what you need to do faster. And crafting in round is a great way to restock restorative items or make up for a poorly chosen loadout.</p> <p>Lastly, there’s Conditioning. As a CrossFit girl IRL, I’m all about conditioning, but I haven’t found it as useful in <i>Arc Raiders</i> for solo play. But your mileage may vary. <strong>I recommend investing in these Conditioning skills for solo runs:&nbsp;</strong></p>

 <ul> <li><b>Unburdened Roll</b> (if your shield pops, especially unexpectedly, this makes a reflexive roll less burdensome on your Stamina)</li> <li><b>A Little Extra</b></li> <li><b>Loaded Arms</b></li> <li><b>Fight or Flight </b>(you’ll need to grab Blast Born before you can buy this, which I don’t find as useful a skill, but them’s the rules of the tree)</li> </ul> <p>Depending on how you like to play the game, some of these skills might be more useful than others. And I’ve also left out some of the “end game” skills, as well as tips on which skills you should sink the most points into after the initial XP cost. The efficacy of any given skill is highly dependent on your own playstyle–and at that point, competency in this game means you should be making your own judgement calls for certain strategies you prefer. For example, I really like being able to breach something as fast as possible, so I’ve been investing more points into Proficient Pryer. But maybe that’s not as important to you, or, you have someone you play with who’s your group’s designated breacher, and so maybe it makes sense for another person to invest in these skills to round out your group’s abilities.</p> <p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-extraction-virgil-watkins-interview-2000639879">I Asked&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em>‘ Design Director If Camping Makes Me A Bad Person</a></p> <p>Speaking of groups, let’s have a look at which skills are going to be the most beneficial for a crew.</p> <h2><span id="4-of-the-best-skills-for-groups"></span>4 of the best skills for groups<span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000641794" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641794"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641794">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Consider these group skills in addition to the universal skills I mentioned above, as well as some of the skills that are suitable for a solo player–being really fast and quiet makes you effective as a lone wolf, but it also makes you an asset on your team.</p>

 <p>When considering group play, we need to consider what actions are impossible when you’re on your own. Here’s one example: You can’t revive yourself in <i>Arc Raiders</i>! If you get downed near an extraction point, you can still potentially crawl your way to safety, but one of the first benefits of having comrades is that they can get you back on your feet. There are a few skills that help you with staying in the game while you’re in a downed-but-not-out state, so those are essential ones to snag. Let’s break it down for each of the trees.</p> <p><b>For Mobility, one skill makes the most sense for group play: Crawl Before You Walk.</b></p>

 <p>Everything else in this branch makes you faster and ups your stamina capabilities. So invest in those as you deem appropriate. If you think your character is too slow and quick to exhaust, then invest in the general skills I outlined, as well as the ones suitable for solo play. But also consider what role you’re going to play in your group. Maybe you’re the designated medic, carrying more restoratives than other people. If that’s the case, then you probably want to be speedy so you can get to a dying teammate as quickly as possible.</p> <p><b>From the Survival skill tree, grab Traveling Tinkerer if you’re typically in a group.</b> In addition to In-Round crafting, this will help you be the go-to person for crafting supplies Topside.</p>

<p>Skydance Games’ Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is delayed and will not release in early 2026, according to the company. A new release date has not been announced yet.</p>



<p>If you are a big Marvel fan, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-gameplay-emerges/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a> has been on your radar for some time. As a showcase for Unreal Engine, the game brings players to 1943 with Black Panther and Captain America to defeat Hydra. With an all-star cast including The Walking Dead’s Khary Payton and Horizon Forbidden West’s Drew Moerlein, it was set to be not only a graphical marvel, but a fun one with a rich narrative. Unfortunately, it seems fans are going to have to wait until later in 2026 to get their hands on it.</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/SkydanceGames/status/1986539089164972440" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a tweet from Skydance Games</a>, the company revealed that Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra will not make its planned early 2026 release. Instead, it will launch at an unspecified date, likely still in 2026. According to the developers, the team wants to ensure that the game lives up to the hype. The delay announcement does come at an inconvenient time, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> pushed its release to November 19th, 2026.</p>



<p>We hadn’t seen much of Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra in quite some time. The last update we had about it was from leaked gameplay and screenshots. Unfortunately, the game hasn’t had a new trailer since 2024, which showed off the story. Early 2026 usually lasts from January to March, so the delay could only have been a month or two behind its planned release. We’ll likely hear more in the coming months, but, for now, our adventures with Captain America and Black Panther are on hold.</p>



<p>What do you think about Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra’s delay? When do you think it’ll come out? What superheroes do you want to see in the game?

<p>Activision has just dropped all the details you need to know about Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Zombies Mode ahead of launch. </p>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is all set to release next Friday, on November 14, 2025. Ahead of the launch, the developers have been releasing all the necessary information players need before entering this mode. Their latest intel drop tells us all we need to know about BO7 Zombies Mode maps, weapons, Dark Aether equipment, Augments and Research, Perk-A-Colas, Ammo Mods, Field Upgrades, Gobblegums, game modes, Wonder Weapons, Customization, HUD, and Dead Ops Arcade 4.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-zombies-maps-and-main-quest-timing">Black Ops 7 Zombies Maps and Main Quest Timing</h2>



<p>Black Ops 7 Zombies Mode will feature seven maps at launch: Janus Towers Plaza, Vandorn Farm, Blackwater Lake, Ashwood, Exit 115, and Zarya Cosmodrome. Moreover, the main quest in Ashes of the Damned is scheduled to start at 10 AM PT on November 14.</p>

<p>BO7 Zombies mode will let players try out a selection of 30 different primary and melee weapons.

Between the two melee weapons, players can choose one to occupy the next slot in their loadout.</p>



<p>Each weapon has the ability to be Pack-a-Punched, have its Rarity increased, and an Ammo Mod applied to it, which adds additional destructive power to it. Moreover, every weapon has an optional Weapon Prestige and Weapon Camo Progression, with Military, Special, and Mastery Camos.</p>

"Eager" is putting it mildly, however, due to the fact that it's been 12 years since the series' last entry and developer Rockstar's most recent game, Red Dead Redemption 2, came out seven years ago. When the game's second trailer dropped, it took the internet by storm, and currently has over 137 million views, but was accompanied by a delay <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/02/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-to-may-2026">into May 2026</a>.

            <p>Tonight, 6th November 2026, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> published its latest financial report, and it had some pretty large revelations about the upcoming game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>. The headline news: instead of launching on 26th May, 2026, the game has been pushed back about half a year to 19th November, 2026. This has also been <a href="https://x.com/RockstarGames/status/1986540361011880167">confirmed by tweets</a> from the offical <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> social media accounts.
</p>
<p>Per Take-Two, this delay is designed to give "some additional time to finish the game with the high level of polish players expect and deserve. Rockstar has our full support of course, and we are confident they will deliver an unrivalled blockbuster entertainment experience."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">This isn't the first delay</a> the game has seen this year. Back in May, it was confirmed that the game had slipped from its previous release date into May 2026.</p>
<p>As a result of this news, we're already starting to see Take-Two stock plummet. The story broke about 9pm UK time, and as of 9.35pm stock has dropped by a massive 8% (see image below). In real terms, that means Take-Two stock is down about $30.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-is-delayed-again-until-november-2026">has spoken to IGN</a> about the delay: "We've had more time to develop the title. And so we are getting closer to the release. We are grateful that it is still within the same fiscal year. And mostly we’re grateful to Rockstar for constantly seeking perfection.
</p>
<p>"We feel really good about this release date. It's in the same fiscal year, it happens to be a great release window, and naturally we're really supportive of Rockstar's approach."</p>
<p>It seems both investors and the general public don't share this same sense of optimism, as stock continues to fall as I'm writing this story.</p>
<p>GTA 6 is currently expected to launch for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on its new date of 19th November. And there's little doubt it's going to be big, even with this new set-bacK: Take-Two confirmed earlier this year that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5-has-now-sold-a-staggering-210m-copies">GTA 5 has now sold an astonishing 210m copies</a> since its release 12 years ago, so it's probably not unreasonable to assume its massively anticipated sequel will manage to do that and then some.

 <p>This is the second delay <em>GTA 6</em> has suffered in 2025. <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta6-grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-delay-may-2026-1851778799">Back in May</a>, the game was delayed from launching sometime in 2025 to May 26, 2026.</p> <p><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> was first revealed, officially at least, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-vi-gta6-first-trailer-gameplay-footage-details-leak-1851005265">in December 2023.</a> That followed a<a href="https://kotaku.com/gtavi-gta-vi-gta-6-grand-theft-auto-leak-video-dump-1849550414"> massive leak in 2022</a> that showed off early, in-development gameplay footage of the upcoming sequel.

<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 has been delayed to November 19th 2026, according to Rockstar Games. The news comes just before Take-Two Interactive was set to reveal the sales report for the year.</p>



<p>There’s no denying that Grand Theft Auto 6 is the most anticipated game of 2026. The third-person open-world shooter is a household name, for good and bad. Rockstar Games’ enormous success with GTA 5 is still going strong even after a decade since release. At a time, when it was slated to release in 2025, developers feared it would release near or with it and get nothing. Despite a delay to May 26th, 2026, the hype hasn’t died out in the slightest. The last trailer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-trailer-2-is-live-featuring-jason-and-lucia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">raked in 137 million views</a> and growing, so it’s clear people are anxious to get their hands on it. Well, it’s going to be a bit longer of a wait.</p>



<h2 id="h-gta-6-delayed-to-november-19th-2026">GTA 6 Delayed to November 19th, 2026</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hi everyone,</p><p>Grand Theft Auto VI will now release on Thursday, November 19, 2026.</p><p>We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and… <a href="https://t.co/yLX9KIiDzX">pic.twitter.com/yLX9KIiDzX</a></p></div>— Rockstar Games (@RockstarGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/1986540361011880167?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In a<a href="https://x.com/RockstarGames/status/1986540361011880167?t=ptQ-g0f12tfyu0M9qfbBQw&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> tweet from Rockstar Games</a>, the company revealed that <strong>Grand Theft Auto 6</strong> is now <strong>delayed to November 19th, 2026</strong>. The game was originally set to come out on May 26th, 2026. In a <a href="https://x.com/RockstarGames/status/1986540444126249252?t=R8mT952wpGMG1v8Lb-jajg&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">statement from Rockstar Games</a>, they said the following,</p>



<p><strong>“We want to thank you again for your patience and support. While the wait is a little longer, we are incredibly excited for players to experience the sprawling state of Leonida and a return to modern day Vice City.”</strong></p>



<p>It has already been a long, long road since Grand Theft Auto 5, so the almost year-long wait now is disappointing for sure. The company seemed adament that it would make the May release earlier this year, but it looks like that isn’t happening. It did seem likely, as there has been no new trailers or marketing since the last trailer. While the finished product will likely be worth the wait, it still stings knowing it’s going to take longer.</p>

                <p>As part of Take-Two's earnings report today, the company confirmed that Rockstar's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> has been delayed and is now coming November 19, 2026.

  </div><p>On Take-Two's quarterly earnings call, Zelnick suggested that pushing Rockstar to hit GTA 6's previously-announced release date could be bad for the game, and therefore, bad for the company.</p><p>"It's always painful when we move a date," he said. "We have done so occasionally in the past, and we've never regretted it in retrospect. I would like to point out that we've had some competitors, in the event where more polish was required and it required slipping a date, they chose not to slip the date, and they did so at their peril."</p><p>GTA 6 has already been delayed publicly once, as the game was originally expected to launch right around now in Fall 2025 before Take-Two delayed it to May 2026. At the time, Rockstar said it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-2026/1100-6531282/" data-ref-id="1100-6531282">needed more time to make a game that exceeded fan expectations.</a> In fact, the game's second trailer was released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-gets-a-new-trailer/1100-6531329/" data-ref-id="1100-6531329">exactly six months ago today on May 6, 2025.</a></p><p>GTA 6 is coming to market with an enormous amount of hype behind it. One expert has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-most-important-game-release-in-industrys-history-analyst-says/1100-6521839/" data-ref-id="1100-6521839">GTA 6 is the single most important game release in history.</a> It's the first new entry in the series since 2013's GTA 5, and is predicted to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/" data-ref-id="1100-6528605">sell more than 40 million units in its first year alone.</a></p><p>Another talking point regarding GTA 6 has been what its price point could be. One industry observer has said there is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-costing-as-much-as-100-could-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-says/1100-6528832/" data-ref-id="1100-6528832">"hope"</a> from some that GTA 6 would come to market at $100 to help give other publishers a reason to raise prices as well. A GTA 5 actor recently said GTA 6 would be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-warrants-a-100-price-tag-gta-5-actor-says/1100-6535876/" data-ref-id="1100-6535876">well worth $100 given the game's size and scope.</a></p><p>Developer Rockstar has found itself embroiled in controversy, as the studio recently fired dozens of employees for what it called "gross misconduct." Rockstar said employees were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-dev-says-it-fired-workers-for-leaking-secrets-not-for-trying-to-unionize/1100-6535987/" data-ref-id="1100-6535987">leaking company secrets</a>, but a labor union says this is baloney and that the affected staffers were fired for attempting to unionize.</p>

                <p>Despite debuting over 20 years ago, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dance-dance-revolution/" data-ref-id="5000-2995">Dance Dance Revolution</a> still has players dedicated to it. Now, one player has taken his love for the game to the next level by breaking a new world record for the longest video game marathon. It only took 144 hours over the course of six days, and years of training before making the attempt.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hEKmxYvdZw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5hEKmxYvdZw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As documented on the official site for <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2025/11/gamer-breaks-iconic-videogame-record-by-playing-dance-dance-revolution-for-six-days" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Guinness World Records</a>, Hungarian gamer Szabolcs Csépe--who also goes by GrassHopper--pulled off his feat between October 23-29, 2024. It's estimated that he danced to over 3,000 songs and burned more than 22,000 calories in that span. The previous record was set in 2015 by American gamer Carrie Swidecki, who set her mark at 138 hours 34 seconds on Just Dance.</p><p>Csépe told the site that his attempt "was the most physically demanding experience" in part because he spent hours moving without stretching. He also noted that he needed the help of a small staff of people to keep him him fed and drinking enough water to see the attempt through to the end. </p><p>"What also added to the challenge was managing and documenting all witness activities and their time allocation by myself; essentially before, during and after the record attempt," said Csépe. "Motivation is always a given with rhythm and music games! Those who love this genre can always tell that there is nothing more encouraging than dancing or doing body workout while listening to your favorite tunes."</p><p>Csépe already secured a handful of world records before this attempt, including the longest video game marathon playing a puzzle game while playing Tetris Effect for 32 hours 32 minutes 32 seconds; and the longest video game marathon playing a racing game for a 90-hour session on Gran Turismo 7. For now, Csépe hasn't decided which record to chase next.</p>
