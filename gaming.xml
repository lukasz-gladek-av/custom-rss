Access is currently limited to friend invite via our playtesters.</p></blockquote></div><p>Valve provides no other details, just an animated teaser image. (You can see a still screenshot of it above.)

By August, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-hero-shooter-deadlock-still-hasnt-been-announced-but-had-16k-steam-concurrent-players-this-weekend">tens of thousands of people were playing the game</a>, as more players invited their friends to check it out. <em>The Verge</em> received an invite and published <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/12/24219016/valve-deadlock-hands-on-secret-new-game">a hands-on preview</a> last week.</p><p>Today, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/deadlock-2016">many streamers</a> are playing the game live, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/shroud">including Shroud</a>, after admin Yoshi said in the game’s Discord that Valve was lifting its rules against public conversation.</p><div><p><cite>Screenshot by Tom Warren / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>While <em>Deadlock</em> seems like another promising addition to Valve’s lineup of big multiplayer games, it’s unclear if it will have sustained popularity like <em>Counter-Strike</em> or <em>Dota 2</em> or will eventually fizzle out <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22314103/valve-ending-development-artifact-tcg-dota-2">like <em>Artifact</em></a>. </p></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/22/24225972/ai-photo-era-what-is-reality-google-pixel-9"><h2>No one’s ready for this</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/22/24225997/microsoft-copilot-rebrand-changes"><h2>Microsoft is rebranding Copilot in the most Microsoft way possible</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/21/24225169/nothing-employees-office-work-mandate-five-days"><h2>Nothing is requiring employees to be in the office five days a week</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/23/24226830/elon-musk-email-x-twitter-stock-grants"><h2>Elon Musk says X staff can get their stock — if they prove they deserve it</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/23/24226684/starlink-satellite-internet-scalpers-fee"><h2>Starlink has a pricey new plan to stop scalpers</h2></a><hr></li></ol></div></div></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kamala-harris%E2%80%99-first-twitch-stream-peaked-at-under-1-000-viewers-some-of-whom-spammed-palestinian-flags.962598/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/kamala-harris-twitch-stream-dnc-palestine<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kamala Harris, current United States vice president and the Democratic Party’s candidate for president, now <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/kamalaharris" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has a Twitch channel</a>. Yesterday evening, her team broadcasted from it for the first time, allowing Twitch viewers to tune into a couple hours of speeches from the final night of the DNC, including Harris’ big coronation. The stream peaked at 933 concurrent viewers, well below the Twitch debuts of other presidential aspirants like Bernie Sanders (7,233) and Donald Trump (12,826).</p><p>During the broadcast, chat was largely in emote-only mode, with many seemingly intended to express enthusiasm (hearts, raised hands, signs that read ‘yea,’ etc). These were sporadically broken up by floods of Palestinian flags, as well as images of letters that spelled out “Free Palestine.”&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Twitch</figcaption></figure><p>This followed a week of thousands-strong pro-Palestinian protests outside the DNC, as well as demonstrations from <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/21/meet-the-uncommitted-how-gaza-hangs-over-democratic-national-convention" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Uncommitted Movement</a>, a group led by delegates representing hundreds of thousands of people who voted “uncommitted” in the Democratic primaries as a result of Biden's seemingly bottomless well – and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-approves-20-billion-weapons-sales-israel-hamas-backs-out-cease-fire-talks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">warchest</a> –&nbsp; of support for Israel. The Uncommitted Movement attempted to negotiate with the Democratic Party to get a Palestinian American speaker, whose <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/08/dnc-speech-uncommitted-movement-harris-walz-ruwan-romman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brief speech</a> would have been vetted, on stage at the DNC, only to be <a href="https://apnews.com/article/uncommitted-palestinian-convention-harris-918812eb0e19b9669f8b9b9cd88c6360" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">turned away Wednesday night</a>. The day before, the DNC handed the mic over to parents of an Israeli American hostage held by Hamas, prompting demands from the left and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/22/g-s1-19169/palestinian-protests-dnc-united-autoworkers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">powerful unions like United Auto Workers</a> for someone of Palestinian descent to be granted the same privilege.</p><p>During her own speech, Harris disappointed those who hoped she might deviate from Biden’s bloody path, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/23/g-s1-19232/kamala-harris-israel-gaza-dnc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saying</a> that she “will always stand up for Israel's right to defend itself” and “will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself.” However, she also acknowledged the “heartbreaking” scale of suffering in Gaza and said that she and Biden continue to push for a ceasefire deal so that "Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom, and self determination." Granted, Biden has been saying things like this for the past ten months, and it has done absolutely nothing to change the material reality of the situation – which is continuous, pointless slaughter of <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/8/gaza-toll-could-exceed-186000-lancet-study-says" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(at least) tens of thousands of innocent people</a>.</p><p>Harris’ poor performance on Twitch does not indicate a lack of interest in her campaign, even on the platform. At the same time as Harris’ channel, Hasan “HasanAbi” Piker, the biggest political commentator on Twitch, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2231129523?filter=archives&amp;sort=time" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">streamed Harris’ speech</a> to an audience that maxed out at nearly 60,000 concurrent viewers. Other, smaller politically-focused channels simultaneously broadcast her speech to thousands more.&nbsp;</p><p>Harris also does not have novelty on her side; when Sanders and Trump joined Twitch, it was nearly unheard of for politicians to do such a thing. Now many have tried to varying degrees of success, from Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with her <a href="https://kotaku.com/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-streams-on-twitch-with-hasan-p-1845431479" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">430,000-viewer <em>Among Us</em> stream in 2020</a> (which included Piker, among many other big-name content creators) to Republican Representative Matt Gaetz’s <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/matt-gaetz-twitch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comically sad six-viewer showing in 2022</a>. More recently, Trump has <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-adin-ross-donald-trump-kick-stream" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cameoed in content from somehow-popular bottom feeders</a> like Kick streamer Adin Ross to the tune of hundreds of thousands of viewers. The DNC, meanwhile, just allowed content creators to attend for the first time, granting special access to 200 and <a href="https://archive.is/AaXVb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even special-er access to a select handful</a>. The RNC ran a similar, albeit more limited, playbook, opening its doors to around 70 content creators in July.</p><p>It’s worth noting that Sanders and Trump’s Twitch channels no longer post numbers even remotely as impressive as they used to back in 2020. These days, Sanders is lucky to break 1,000, while Trump tends to hover between 2,000 and 5,000, with one recent spike that went beyond 10,000. Granted, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24203801/donald-trump-twitch-channel-unbanned" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">until July</a>, Trump was banned from Twitch following the January 6, 2021 insurrection, and nothing boosts numbers on livestreaming platforms like a long-awaited return.&nbsp;</p><p>What these channels and Harris’ have in common is that, so far, they’ve largely been content to broadcast speeches, rallies, and other events rather than directly interact with Twitch streamers or viewers. On Twitch, scanning and responding to chat is the bare minimum, and if you want your channel to grow, the meta these days is to form relationships with well-known streamers with whom you share values and a general vibe. No politician has successfully pulled this off, and the reason why is simple: It’s a full-time job. Politicians – at least, if they’re halfway decent – already have one of those.</p><p>That said, Harris’ team has proven impressively social-media savvy, <a href="https://aftermath.site/charli-brat-kamala-vibes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">embracing the summer’s inescapable brat meme</a> and <a href="https://www.avclub.com/harris-walz-campaign-uses-dril-tweet-in-email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">invoking Weird Twitter legend Dril</a> in a campaign email (although you could argue that <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/dril-kamala-harris-trump-post-1235084267/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that second one ended up backfiring</a>). Perhaps, then, this is just the beginning for Harris’ humble little Twitch channel. Who knows? Maybe Tim Walz will go live tomorrow and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vp-candidate-tim-walz-was-a-big-dreamcast-fan-and-we-think-weve-found-his-favorite-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">play some <em>Crazy Taxi</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Additional reporting by Riley MacLeod.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Popular Tekken 8 competitors, Ulsan and Atif went up against each other today in the Tekken 8 Esports World Cup Grand Final. Though, both fought hard, only one player was to walk out as the Tekken 8 Esports World Cup Champion. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-ulsan-wins-the-tekken-8-esports-world-cup">Ulsan Wins The Tekken 8 Esports World Cup</h2>



<p>The two competitors took the battlefield in a first-to-five competition. Atif, began the tournament with quite a bit of momentum, as the player won the first two rounds of Game 1. Ulsan, though, was not allowing for a sweep, coming back and winning the game 3-2. </p>



<p>Both players played as the infamous Dragonuv.</p>



<p>Going into Game 2, Ulsan did not drag behind from his momentum during Game 1, winning the game 3-1 and putting himself ahead 2-0. Atif, though, desperately wanted a comeback, winning the first two rounds of Game 3. Still, Ulsan proved why he does the best under pressure, coming back and winning the game 3-2.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Game 4 was no different for Ulsan, as the competitor won 3-1, putting himself in a 4-0 lead, with only one more win needed to grab that Esports World Cup victory.</p>



<p>While some fans were probably hoping for a historic comeback from Atif, it sadly did not happen, as Ulsan swept the player with a 5-0 win, certifying himself as the Tekken 8 Esports World Cup Champion and walking out with a whopping $300,000.</p>



<hr>



<h3 id="h-about-ulsan">About Ulsan</h3>

<p>Now, playing for KWANGDONG FREECS, Ulsan continues to push the Tekken esports scene to a new level.</p>



<hr>



<h3 id="h-about-atif">About Atif</h3>

Both models are eligible for the current Amazon deal. Along with superb active noise cancellation and up to 12 hours of battery life (24 with the charging case), PC users can use the Inzone Hub software to fully customize their performance. Those settings, including one of up to 256 sound profiles, can be synced to the earbuds and used on PS5 and other devices. The PS5's audio features, such as Tempest 3D Audio and Dolby Atmos, are fully compatible with the Inzone Buds.</p><p>Like most wireless earbuds, the Inzone Buds have tap/touch controls that work well. You can use the controls to turn ANC on or off, adjust the volume, tinker with the sound mix, and more. Tap controls can be programmed to different functions. If you worry about latency with wireless headsets, the 2.4GHz connection has only 30ms of latency, which helps create a seamless and reliable listening experience. An AI-assisted microphone enhances your voice to help your words ring out clearly to your teammates.</p><p>The gaming earbud space isn't loaded with anywhere close to as many competitors as the established gaming headset market, but Inzone Buds are the best we've used so far. Sony's experience manufacturing high-end earbuds certainly helped when designing the Inzone Buds.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/23/playstation-plus-classics-update-could-fix-major-timesplitters-issue/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>In case you missed it, earlier this week <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/sony">Sony</a> updated its <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-plus">PlayStation Plus</a> Classics lineup with a slew of new arrivals. Among them were TimeSplitters and its two sequels, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/timesplitters">TimeSplitters</a> 2, and TimeSplitters: Future Perfect, making the trilogy fully playable on PS4 and PS5 consoles.</p>
<p><iframe title="TIME SPLITTERS: FUTURE PERFECT - Trailer" width="780" height="585" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ViC2gbGcJhM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>However, it didn’t take PlayStation gamers long to realise something was missing. When Sony first added PS2 games to its growing PlayStation Plus Classics library, each of them (Tomb Raider: Legend, Sly Raccoon, and Star Wars: The Clone Wars) came with full <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-trophies">trophy</a> support. Subsequent PS2 titles including Ghosthunter and Summoner also touted this feature. For some reason, the TimeSplitters games don’t have any virtual silverware for retro FPS fans to collect.</p>
<p>Clearly disappointed, one PSN user (<a href="https://www.truetrophies.com/news/timesplitters-ps2-trophy-patch">via TrueTrophies</a>) reached out to TimeSplitters IP holder and publisher <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/deep-silver">Deep Silver</a> asking about trophy support. Their response was that “trophies are considered and should be available in a future patch” though “currently we do not have an official release date.”</p>
<p>Many trophy hunters will no doubt wait to pull the trigger on the TimeSplitters trilogy until then. Still, the temptation to blast through these time-hopping classics may prove irresistible. While they might pave the way for a welcome trip down memory lane, the trilogy’s return to PlayStation is also a painful reminder of the cancelled TimeSplitters projects that will never come to light.</p>

<p>For those who remember, developer Free Radical had been working on a TimeSplitters 4 though the studio was almost shut down following the PS3 exclusives flop that was Haze. The team was snapped up by Crysis and Hunt: Showdown publisher, Crytek, before later being bought by Embracer Group.</p>
<p>Sadly, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/11/free-radical-design-shutdown-timesplitters-cancelled/">Free Radical closed its doors for good earlier this year</a> amidst a wave of devastating layoffs and closures that swept the industry far and wide. A project titled TimeSplitters Next was cancelled as a result – a modernised, trend-chasing take on the series that later pivoted towards being an expanded TimeSplitters 2 remake before the axe finally fell.</p>
<p>Let’s hope that TimeSplitters isn’t gone for good and that another studio can take a swing at restoring it to its former glory.</p>

<p>The struggle of hero-shooter Concord continues as the game is officially out, and no one seems to care. In its first few hours available worldwide, Concord has yet to surpass even 1,000 players on Steam since launch.</p>



<p>As of writing, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2443720/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">less than 700 players</a> are actively playing the online PvP title.</p>



<p>To be honest, this shouldn’t be too surprising based on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-concord-open-beta-bombed-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">poor open beta numbers</a> when no one had to pay to access the game. Now that you have to spend the full $40 to play, it’s hard to see it becoming a hit out of nowhere.</p>



<p>Obviously the numbers should go up over the weekend as more people have time to play the game. But it’s unlikely we’ll see them go up to a point where both Sony and Firewalk Studios are happy with the numbers. As far as PlayStation 5 player numbers, that information isn’t publicly available. It could be assumed, however, that numbers on the console would be higher than PC. How much higher, though, is unclear.</p>



<p>With all that said, Firewalk seems set to support Concord — a game that has been <a href="https://x.com/sharkeatsman/status/1826122649963245882" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in development for eight years</a> — at least through the winter. The game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/concord-post-launch-roadmap-outlines-new-characters-maps-and-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first two seasons</a> have already been announced as coming in October and January. There’s also a tease for a third season in April. But beyond that, questions are going to continue about the viability of the game that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/concord-hit-with-overly-negative-response-after-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fans seemed to be turned off by</a> right from the start.</p>

This was a controversial move since it drastically altered and restricted what players and creators could do with fan-created <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pathfinder" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Pathfinder</em></a> material. Paizo is now taking steps to walking back this policy, including reinstating the original Community Use Policy.</p>
<h2>The Paizo Fan Content Walk Back</h2>
<p>In an official <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6w469?Updates-on-the-Community-Use-Policy-and-Fan">blog post</a>, Paizo announced they would be making changes to their Fan Content policy while reinstating their original Community Use Policy. In addition, updates and clarifications will be implemented, making the policies easier to parse.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pathfinder-2e-ice-mountain-artwork.jpg?itok=BscKfJnF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pathfinder-2e-ice-mountain-artwork.jpg?itok=JNj3exDJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>For those unaware, Paizo's original Community Use policy was in place for over 15 years. In broad terms it allowed players to create original content for <em>Pathfinder</em> and <em>Starfinder</em>. The only catch was you couldn't charge for access. This was a boon for fan projects since it permitted the use of named characters and locations.</p>
<p>A version of this policy was also in effect for different <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/paizo-announces-pathfinder-second-edition-remaster-project" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Pathfinder 2e</em></a> materials. This included Foundry VTT support</p>
<p>With Paizo shifting to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/pathfinder-creator-paizo-releases-first-draft-of-open-rpg-creative-license-asking-for" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ORC license</a>, the company implemented their Fan Content policy. This was a more restrictive policy since it required creators to remove setting specific characters and terms to comply with the ORC and limited the publishing of work to approved platforms like Roll20 or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/pathfinder-infinite-coming-to-roll20" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Pathfinder Infinite</em></a>.</p>
<p>The post further details the policy changes coming with the Fan Content and Community Use policies. First, the Approved Products List and Community Use Registry have been removed. For the latter, you must include contact information on your product.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pathfinder-rise-of-the-rune-lords-artwork.jpg?itok=xzTyUwgV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pathfinder-rise-of-the-rune-lords-artwork.jpg?itok=dIUZ9r77 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>With these changes, fans can still monetize their creations through the Fan Content policy, just with the freedoms permitted under the Community Use policy. Paizo has confirmed they will be refining these policies to clearly define what commercial uses of their products are allowed.</p>
<p>The post concludes with Paizo apologizing to the community for their misstep with these policies, promising to inform the community as soon as these revised policies go into effect.</p>

                <p>There's never been a better time to be a fan of trading card games, and for those of you who grew up on Yu-Gi-Oh, this special edition booster set is going to have you ready to duel all over again.

The game is playable for the first time to the public, and the amount of information coming out of just that preview build is insane. We’ve learned a <em>lot </em>just from three days of developer interviews and fans collating all the info they’ve gleaned from the demo, and here’s just some of the biggest things we’ve spotted over the past week. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="109b72969ab1299e0392af3a35637068" data-recommend-id="image://109b72969ab1299e0392af3a35637068" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Monster Hunter Wilds showing the new 3D map." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Monster Hunter Wilds showing the new 3D map." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku / Capcom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="109b72969ab1299e0392af3a35637068" data-recommend-id="image://109b72969ab1299e0392af3a35637068" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Monster Hunter Wilds showing the new 3D map." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>As you might expect, a new <em>Monster Hunter </em>game is bound to pack in a bunch of quality-of-life changes that series veterans and newcomers alike will appreciate. One of the biggest tweaks comes to <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>’ map, which is now 3D. In the past, maps have been flat while trying to communicate the sheer density of the different biomes, which made them a bit of a confusing mess for players who weren’t already familiar with the layouts of the areas. Now, it should be <em>much </em>easier to maneuver across <em>Wilds</em>’ huge new environments.</p><p>When you’re in a big fight, you’re typically picking at weak points in the hope of crippling the monster’s movement or abilities and getting monster parts, which used to break off and appear as shiny bits you needed to manually collect. That no longer seems to be entirely the case, and now when you break parts of the monster, you’ll automatically pick up smaller pieces, meaning you don’t have to scramble in or out of combat to get every last scrap now. You’ll still need to carve bigger pieces, like tails, and dead monsters can now be climbed on in order to harvest them. And hey, if you’re hurting after a fight or on your way to another one and don’t want to choose between your different potions, there’s now a dynamic healing option that’ll pick the best fit based on your health.</p><p>Funnily enough, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1ext4ve/barrel_bombs_can_now_be_picked_up_after_being/#:~:text=Xanek-,Barrel%20bombs%20can%20now%20be%20picked%20up%20after%20being%20placed,thrown%20to%20roll%20into%20monsters&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1ext4ve/barrel_bombs_can_now_be_picked_up_after_being/#:~:text=Xanek-,Barrel%20bombs%20can%20now%20be%20picked%20up%20after%20being%20placed,thrown%20to%20roll%20into%20monsters" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explosive barrels</a></span> (which used to be static) can now be picked up and thrown at enemies, and potentially even teammates. There’s a million little changes like this that should make dealing with all the nuts-and-bolts stuff outside of monster-killing simpler and more approachable than in its predecessors. Oh, and as a fun aside that I’ll also chalk up to “quality-of-life changes,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1ext4ve/barrel_bombs_can_now_be_picked_up_after_being/#:~:text=Xanek-,Barrel%20bombs%20can%20now%20be%20picked%20up%20after%20being%20placed,thrown%20to%20roll%20into%20monsters&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1ext4ve/barrel_bombs_can_now_be_picked_up_after_being/#:~:text=Xanek-,Barrel%20bombs%20can%20now%20be%20picked%20up%20after%20being%20placed,thrown%20to%20roll%20into%20monsters" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explosive barrels</a></span> (which used to be static) can now be picked up and thrown at enemies, and potentially even teammates.

If you’re playing the game in single-player mode, you can now pause, which hasn’t been available for a while, and you can even skip the quest-end timer in solo play and multiplayer, assuming everyone agrees to skip it. Finishing a hunt will no longer kick you back to camp either, and on that note, you can also pick up quests in the field dynamically. Just running across a monster can trigger its hunt, so you no longer have to initiate missions from the village.</p><p>It also appears that you can <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/lovebreaddd/status/1826281126283157682&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/lovebreaddd/status/1826281126283157682" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dodge out of certain moves</a></span> or sheathe your weapon mid-animation, which is going to save people tons of time and hardship. Previously, <em>Monster Hunter </em>players have had to simply commit to the animation of whatever attack they unleashed, whether it connected or not, which <em>could </em>open them up to attacks from the massive monsters that they’re charged with hunting. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="89c69ec7add1d701822a12e0ca9cbe63" data-recommend-id="image://89c69ec7add1d701822a12e0ca9cbe63" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Monster Hunter Wilds showing multiplayer gameplay from Gamescom." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Monster Hunter Wilds showing multiplayer gameplay from Gamescom." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku / Capcom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="89c69ec7add1d701822a12e0ca9cbe63" data-recommend-id="image://89c69ec7add1d701822a12e0ca9cbe63" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Monster Hunter Wilds showing multiplayer gameplay from Gamescom." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Monster Hunter </em>games have always been big on multiplayer, typically allowing squads of up to four players (as well as smaller AI companions) to take on hunts and synergize their loadouts to maximize the results of the missions. In a drastic change, <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>now features AI hunters that can support the player in hunts if desired. SOS flares can now be customized to only summon NPCs or players depending on what you want, but by default they will populate the game with NPCs if you can’t find a party to play with. </p></div><div><p>One of the smaller but still significant features to return in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>is the ability to swim underwater. Though it has existed in previous games and underwater combat was included in <em>Monster Hunter 3 </em>and <em>3 Ultimate</em>, water sections have largely been MIA for the last several installments due to the polarizing reception to them in the past. Though <em>Wilds </em>doesn’t have underwater combat, the team seems to be testing the waters (so to speak) by implementing underwater areas again at all, which has some fans hoping that DLC may eventually bring the full feature back. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="28f25574e6cd3effbde039ec1b94924b" data-recommend-id="image://28f25574e6cd3effbde039ec1b94924b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Monster Hunter Wilds showing a hunter with the insect glaive weapon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Monster Hunter Wilds showing a hunter with the insect glaive weapon." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku / Capcom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="28f25574e6cd3effbde039ec1b94924b" data-recommend-id="image://28f25574e6cd3effbde039ec1b94924b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Monster Hunter Wilds showing a hunter with the insect glaive weapon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I used to think that the Insect Glaive, one of <em>Monster Hunter</em>’s more ludicrous and complex weapons, was a very niche loadout, but turns out a lot of people love it and especially appreciate the air acrobatics it allowed players to do. That no longer seems to be the case in <em>Wilds</em>, which appears to have nerfed the bounce that players would get off of a mid-air slashing combo. The thing effectively let you stay in the air forever, and while it looked quite silly, it was also great at making the class visually distinct from others, which are largely terrestrial. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="773b3bdd85a1082af53fbff216a5407f" data-recommend-id="image://773b3bdd85a1082af53fbff216a5407f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Monster Hunter Wilds showing the armor and equipment screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Monster Hunter Wilds showing the armor and equipment screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku / Capcom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="773b3bdd85a1082af53fbff216a5407f" data-recommend-id="image://773b3bdd85a1082af53fbff216a5407f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Monster Hunter Wilds showing the armor and equipment screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In a win for truly everyone, armor is no longer gender-locked in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds. </em>This has never been the case before, and has meant that sometimes a player couldn’t get armor they really wanted because they locked themselves in when choosing their character’s gender as they were customizing them. Now, you can slap on whatever you want. Additionally, armors have bonuses for completing sets, but there will also be bonuses for armor pieces from different monsters as long as they fit a common theme!</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a2bebfdebb1441297a7814c2001a0b34" data-recommend-id="image://a2bebfdebb1441297a7814c2001a0b34" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Monster Hunter Wilds showing a perfect block on an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Monster Hunter Wilds showing a perfect block on an enemy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku / Capcom / PlayStation</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a2bebfdebb1441297a7814c2001a0b34" data-recommend-id="image://a2bebfdebb1441297a7814c2001a0b34" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Monster Hunter Wilds showing a perfect block on an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The <em>Monster Hunter </em>series has some of the most entertaining weapons in all of gaming, and incredibly deep mechanics for each one. Think of a weapon in these games as the equivalent of a fighting game character, complete with their own moveset, unique combos, and latent abilities. Not only are most of them getting tweaked or reworked in some way, but now Capcom is adding perfect-timing mechanics to a slew of them, too.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="46f778e49cd3ef97782fb53fa7add01b" data-recommend-id="image://46f778e49cd3ef97782fb53fa7add01b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of a trailer showing the player and their mount dodging an incoming attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of a trailer showing the player and their mount dodging an incoming attack." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku / Capcom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="46f778e49cd3ef97782fb53fa7add01b" data-recommend-id="image://46f778e49cd3ef97782fb53fa7add01b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of a trailer showing the player and their mount dodging an incoming attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>features dynamic weather effects called Inclemencies that roll through the biomes and drastically change the nature of the arena. The most common one we’ve seen through trailers and previews is a mixture of a sandstorm and thunderstorm, and these will affect monsters and hunters alike. However, even outside of these effects, aspects of the environment can set you up for failure. On one of the developer streams out of Gamescom, the players lured one monster to a sand dune that caused the monster to trip over itself more easily, making it vulnerable to more attacks from the hunters. Another creature that could crawl on surfaces that players couldn’t reach could be toppled and stunned by using the hunter’s slinger (and specifically the grapple ability on it) to bring the column it was climbing on down.</p></div><div><p>In case you haven’t realized, there’s a lot to cover that’s new in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>. For example, you will be able to cook meals that account for changes in the climate, such as whipping up foodthat negates the effects of cold or hot weather. Mounting monsters in this game is also pretty similar to how it functioned in <em>Monster Hunter World </em>and you now have more moves when you’re riding a creature. Alongside the basic dagger plunge, you can now do a heavy attack and a signature finisher based on your weapon. </p><p>That isn’t all either. Large dung pods can be used to disperse herds of monsters, which is going to be especially helpful since <em>Wilds </em>seems to be going in on monsters that have swarms of little minions. There are also now up-close Power Clash moments, such as perfect guarding with a shield which results in a quick-time event where you beat back the monster. When a monster is going to unleash a particularly nasty attack, your life bar will also flash quite dramatically to warn you to guard or dodge out of the way. There’s literally too many cool polishes and changes to count. <br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-review-in-progress.962439/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>At the time I'm writing this, I've put about seven hours into World of Warcraft: The War Within – basically every moment between when it unlocked and when I could no longer keep my eyes open. And that's very early to say anything definitive. But… I have a very good feeling about this one, you guys. From the story, to the environments, to the new features, this is World of Warcraft firing on all cylinders. I'm not utterly blown away or anything that hyperbolic, but compared to the last three expansions' launches, the warm glow of new adventure is hitting different this time.</p><p>I've been taking my sweet time – relatively speaking – so while <a href="https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/news/incredible-world-first-level-80-in-the-war-within-completed-already/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some bedlamites</a> had already hit 80 inside of a couple hours, I logged off for the night at level 73. That pace allowed me to collect three of my new Hero Talents for my Marksmanship Hunter, and I chose to go with the night elf-themed Sentinel over the tortured soul, Sylvanas-inspired Dark Ranger. I'm not super thrilled with these talents yet; we'll see how it feels at 80, but I'm not getting the sense of a significant change in my power or my playstyle with each level like I'd hoped. </p><p>I do like that The War Within doesn't add a bunch of new buttons to my hotbar, though. Part of why I picked Sentinel over Dark Ranger is that the latter makes you incorporate a new attack into your rotation, and I like that I have the option not to have to worry about that.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every IGN World of Warcraft Review</h3></div></output><h2><strong>Setting the Stage</strong></h2><p>If you missed the big announcement last BlizzCon, The War Within is intended as the first part of a trilogy of expansions that aim to tell a larger, complete story. This is something WoW has never done before, and I'm pretty excited about it. Without spoiling too much, the first hour of the story definitely feels like we're going full speed ahead into something sweeping and epic. Some major sacred cows in the lore are actually on the chopping block (not literally – Baine is fine, don't worry). And Xal'atath is a compelling new nemesis – not just because she's a hot goth mommy.</p><p>I mean, it's partly that. But it's not <em>just</em> that.</p><p>I've only seen the first of The War Within's zones, the verdant and picturesque Isle of Dorn, which exists on the surface just above where the other 80 percent takes place. It feels very familiar to a long-time WoW player in a lot of the same ways the Dragon Isles did, and basically all of the best features from Dragonflight are back. You get Dynamic Flying (what used to be called Dragonriding) almost immediately, which I'm still conflicted about just because I think exploring new zones for the first time on the ground gives you more of a sense of place and grandeur. But I'm not conflicted at all about the return of thrilling aerial race courses and the expanded profession system.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Isle of Dorn has some of my favorite music since Wrath of the Lich King.</p></div><p>Dornogal, the capital of the Earthen who protect Azeroth's depths, is one of the coolest hub cities we've ever gotten thanks to its majestic Titan architecture and an interesting political storyline to unravel. It's also quite a bit more organized and easier to navigate than the sometimes disorienting vertical layout of Valdrakken.</p><p>And the music! I can easily say the Isle of Dorn has some of my favorite music in WoW since, dang, Wrath of the Lich King maybe? Since Blizzard’s composers always kill it with their orchestral excellence, it's really something when they release this many tracks that stand out even by their high standards.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><strong>The Long Road Ahead</strong></h2><p>Just like Dragonflight, the smaller zone quests are often memorable and touching. I think the one everybody's going to be talking about this time involves one of the semi-immortal Earthen realizing that his mind is starting to deteriorate, and asking you to help him set his affairs in order as he plans to end his own life in the traditional fashion of his people. I never get tired of being reminded that, for all the world-shaking, high-fantasy shenanigans driving World of Warcraft at the plot level, these kinds of heartfelt and relatable tales are what actually make it special.</p><p>I'm also quite optimistic about Delves, the new solo content that's meant to be something of an alternative to raids and Mythic+ in the endgame, for people like me who don't like to interact with randos and don't have any friends left who still play this game from the group I started out with in 2004. They feature the same kinds of silly and ridiculous temporary power-ups I adored from Torghast, including one that gives you a double jump and another that greatly increases your damage as long as you never fall below half health. If Torghast has only one fan, it is me. If Torghast has no fans, then I am gone from this Earth. So it's great to see some of the things that worked about it coming back.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Len Ranks All the WoW Expansions</h3><p>Every WoW expansion ranked best to worst. Dragonflight is not included since we won't really know for a couple years where it falls.</p></div><p>One delve I played has what are effectively the jump mushrooms from Sonic the Hedgehog, allowing you to explore vertically in a new way, and another features wall-mounted ledges you can zip up to with a grappling hook. The only thing hurting my excitement about these is that they seem really, really short so far – less than 15 minutes in some cases. Part of it is that I haven't unlocked the higher difficulties yet, so I can basically Arcane Shot-spam my way through the entire thing without looking at my health bar. And I've only seen the first three. But I was hoping for something closer to the length of a five-person dungeon experience.</p><p>There's way, way more of The War Within I haven't seen at this point than what I have, but I'm thoroughly enjoying myself so far, and that’s just about the highest praise one can give an expansion at launch. Check back next week for the first big update on my progress, and for a final verdict some time after Season 1 and the first raid unlock on September 10.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Black Myth: Wukong is pushing the accelerator when it comes to the popularity of the title amongst fans worldwide since the game has managed to break records, especially in terms of concurrent players. Recently, we reported on how Black Myth: Wukong <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-hits-2-3-million-concurrent-players-at-steam-surpassing-cyberpunk-2077-elden-ring/">managed to achieve 2.3 million players on Steam</a>, surpassing the likes of Cyberpunk 2077 and Elden Ring, and now, according to the developers of the game themselves, Black Myth: Wukong has now achieved 10 million in sales, which is a massive achievement, probably one of for the history books.</p>
<p>Apart from this, the game has achieved three million players across all platforms, including consoles. If we do some maths here, it becomes evident that a gigantic portion of around 2.3 million players is from those on PC, notably Steam, while the rest of 700,000 users are from other platforms. This is mainly due to the hype of the title in China, which is why the PC platform accounts for the larger share of users.</p>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Black Myth: Wukong has sold 10 million copies across all platforms.<br>(Data as of 21:00 Beijing time, August 23, 2024)</p>
<p>Thanks to all players worldwide for your support and love.<br>Have a great gaming weekend!<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackMythWukong?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BlackMythWukong</a> <a href="https://t.co/mp3mk9JxrX">pic.twitter.com/mp3mk9JxrX</a></p>
<p>— Black Myth: Wukong (@BlackMythGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/BlackMythGame/status/1826985302592049599?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While sentiments about Black Myth: Wukong are mixed amongst the audience, it's safe to say that the title has made an impact on the industry, and Game Science, the developer, is now leading the way to becoming an industry giant. Interestingly, we do expect the sales figures to grow moving into the future, given that the game is approaching its first weekend, and in the longer turn, we are anticipating a release on Microsoft's Xbox platform.</p>
<p>For those unaware of why Black Myth: Wukong is such a huge success, the title's rich storytelling, stunning visuals, and unique take on the action RPG formula have attracted the attention of several gamers. The close attachment of the title to Chinese cultures and traditions is one of the main reasons why there has been a massive portion of players from the region. Along with that, the in-game mechanics and the visually stunning staff-based melee combat system have elevated the title's experience to new levels, not to mention the iconic cutscenes.</p>
<p>The game has received an average <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/black-myth-wukong/">Metacritic score</a> of 81, showing that in terms of the overall experience, it is undoubtedly something to savor and something gamers should look forward to. You can look at our review of the title <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/">here</a> as well, where we have delved into the depths of Black Myth: Wukong.</p>

Here are the most interesting things we learned about the upcoming expansion.<br></p><h2 id="h156532"><a id=""></a><strong>Mercenaries are back, baby</strong></h2><p>A fan-favorite feature from past<em> Diablo</em> games is the ability to call upon allies to fight for you. These NPC soldiers for hire were originally introduced in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/diablo-ii-resurrected-is-mostly-just-diablo-ii-for-be-1847741744&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-ii-resurrected-is-mostly-just-diablo-ii-for-be-1847741744"><em>Diablo II</em></a></span>, and <em>Diablo III </em>had its own version of the system with Followers, who were more fleshed-out characters with stories of their own. <em>Diablo 4</em>’s version of mercenaries seems more in line with <em>Diablo 3</em>, as all four summonable allies have names and detailed backstories Blizzard has already revealed.<br></p><p>You’ll unlock the NPC allies during the main quest and summon them in two ways. You can hire one mercenary to be your main companion to follow you around and designate a second mercenary as reinforcement who will emerge during combat to unleash a special skill when you activate a skill of your own. Each mercenary is unique with their own set of skills. There is the drunken archer Subo, the cursed child Aldkin, the berserker crone Varyana, and the shieldbearer Raheir. With a variety of builds to choose from, you’ll be able to form a party that compliments your own character in combat.</p><h2 id="h156533"><a id=""></a><strong>Take on the Dark Citadel with a friend</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="c6b07e5a0c056295080728ece3acb610" data-recommend-id="image://c6b07e5a0c056295080728ece3acb610" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A group of fighters attempt to take down a large monster" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A group of fighters attempt to take down a large monster" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c6b07e5a0c056295080728ece3acb610" data-recommend-id="image://c6b07e5a0c056295080728ece3acb610" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A group of fighters attempt to take down a large monster" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Described by game director Brent Gibson as a “multi-layered dungeon” during Gamescom, the Dark Citadel is a new co-op PvE mode that sounds like a full-blown raid. This is an endgame dungeon meant to test players in (ideally in a full group of four).<br></p><p>The Dark Citadel is three areas long and includes tough-as-nails boss battles featuring unique enemy mechanics. One example given during a <em>Vessel of Hatred</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAD0Py0I-PM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAD0Py0I-PM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trailer</a></span> includes gathering a special item to reflect boss attacks in the midst of combat. That item needs to be used once by every team member, so it evokes the traditional MMO raid design of managing boss patterns while also dealing out constant damage.</p><p>There will be a special vendor for the Dark Citadel with some incredible loot to earn if you are up for the challenge. Furthermore, Blizzard is introducing a party-finder that makes grouping up with friends and strangers all the easier. It really sounds like the Dark Citadel will amp up the MMO aspects of <em>Diablo 4</em>, but it’s not the only the only interesting dungeon in <em>Vessel of Hatred</em>, as the new time-attack challenge Undercity is also being introduced.</p><h2 id="h156534"><a id=""></a><strong>Nahantu looks stunning (and dangerous)</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="66b0d9ec33b66c2ab9ce071697fa78ab" data-recommend-id="image://66b0d9ec33b66c2ab9ce071697fa78ab" data-format="jpg" data-width="1233" data-height="691" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A figure runs through a lush jungle" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A figure runs through a lush jungle" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="66b0d9ec33b66c2ab9ce071697fa78ab" data-recommend-id="image://66b0d9ec33b66c2ab9ce071697fa78ab" data-format="jpg" data-width="1233" data-height="691" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A figure runs through a lush jungle" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>The Vessel of Hatred</em> will take players to the new region of Nahantu, which is the southernmost area of the eastern continent (that’s the setting of <em>Diablo 4 </em>if you didn’t know, because I didn’t). To date it’s the only part of the continent players haven’t visited in <em>Diablo 4</em>—though it was featured in <em>Diablo 2</em>—so there are sure to be some discoveries, new and old.<br></p><p>Within the region are six areas, four of which are jungle-themed and two of which are canyon-themed. But the jungle isn’t well, as an infection has turned it into a dying area full of new enemies called Hollows and Dregs. Both the jungle and canyon areas of Nahantu look to be incredibly layered, with canyons opening into caverns and massive trees letting you walk on the floor or across large branches in the air. </p><hr><p>If you want to dip your toes into <em>Diablo 4</em> ahead of <em>Vessel of Hatred</em>’s release in October, you can try it for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-free-trial-sale-steam-deck-pc-vessel-hatred-1851630535&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-free-trial-sale-steam-deck-pc-vessel-hatred-1851630535">free on Steam</a></span> this weekend.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

unfamiliar, MySims came out on Wii and Nintendo DS in 2007. It's a spin-off subseries to The Sims and includes other entries like MySims Racing and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-throws-a-party-and-announces-two-new-mysims-games/1100-6234183/" data-ref-id="1100-6234183">MySims Party</a>. They all released on Nintendo platforms, though the games did expand to other platforms, too. GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mysims-review/1900-6178929/" data-ref-id="1900-6178929">MySims review</a> on Wii gave the game a 6.5/10, saying it was "ultimately more successful as a virtual dollhouse than anything else." However, there does seem to be a bit of a cult following for MySims, with people even asking for a remastered version on <a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/EA-Services-General-Questions/My-Sims-Remastered-for-Nintendo-Switch/m-p/10111230" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the EA website</a>.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sims-4-officially-confirmed-for-ps4xbox-one-re/1100-6452027/" data-ref-id="1100-6452027">The Sims 4 came to consoles in late 2017</a> after initially launching on PC in 2014. People have speculated about the game releasing on Switch over the years, but nothing has come to fruition.</p>
