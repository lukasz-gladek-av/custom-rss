    <p><span>New chapter features Qingyi, Jane, and Seth.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 1.1 update for <em><a title="Games > Zenless Zone Zero [15 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/zenless-zone-zero">Zenless Zone Zero</a></em>, dubbed “Undercover R&amp;B,” will launch on August 14, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [168 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-903363"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>Version 1.1 will feature the new challenges soon to be faced by New Eridu Public Security (N.E.P.S.) and the complex story between Qingyi, Jane, Seth, and the criminal syndicate known as the Mountain Lion Gang. Aside from updates to the story and new characters, Version 1.1 will also introduce the new Hollow Zero gameplay experience “Inferno Reap,” where players can jump into battle with Nineveh directly. Also, the New Eridu Public Security area at Lumina Square will be open to players. Furthermore, with various events such as Camellia Golden Week, abundant rewards are awaiting inquisitive Proxies.</p><p>In Version 1.1, Zhu Yuan, Qingyi, and Seth will utilize their talents to fight a battle of wits and courage with the Mountain Lion Gang. However, these criminals always manage to escape arrest with the help of the enigmatic Jane. By further immersing themselves in the world of Special Episode “Undercover R&amp;B”, Proxies will be able to stroll around New Eridu, complete commissions as Jane, and uncover the intricate past between her and N.E.P.S..</p><p>As Proxies become more familiar with New Eridu Public Security (N.E.P.S.), Qingyi will be ready to join players’ squads. As an S-Rank Electric Stun character who can fit in a variety of different squads, Qingyi is skilled at inflicting Daze quickly to stun enemies. While Qingyi’s attack causes electric damage, she can build up “Flash Connect Voltage,” triggering a powerful attack once it reaches a certain level. Being Zhu Yuan’s trustworthy partner at N.E.P.S., Qingyi can also offer significant support to Zhu Yuan in combat.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_903364"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>Assuming a crucial role in Version 1.1’s storyline, Jane’s relationship with the player will be that of both friend and foe. As an S-Rank Physical Anomaly Agent, Jane can trigger “Passion State” by building up Passion Stream, unleashing rapid, multi-stage, and deadly attacks while quickly inflicting Attribute Anomaly on enemies. However, before she joins the players’ squads, Proxies will face Jane as an enemy in combat due to her status as an important member of the Mountain Lion Gang. You can certainly count on her agile combat skills, but you might not feel the same when you are on the receiving end.</p><p>Beyond two S-Rank characters, the A-Rank Electric Defense character Seth is also ready to join combat. Aside from buffing his teammates with a shield, Seth’s weapon can also transform into a large sword he uses to defeat enemies. In addition, new S-Rank Bangboo “Officer Cui” will be able to assist Proxies in the Hollows.</p><p>In addition to regular updates to Shiyu Defense, <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> is introducing new gameplay “Inferno Reap” to Hollow Zero. After completing the “Withering Garden” stage and related commissions, Proxies can enter a time-limited battle with Nineveh. The challenge can be attempted as many times as possible. Successful challenges grant a wide range of in-game rewards.</p><p>In Version 1.1’s themed event “Camellia Golden Week”, Proxies can obtain Polychromes, A-level W-engine, and various materials by completing event commissions. Additionally, a variety of new in-game events and features such as Immersive Tactical Drill, First-Class Customer Service, and upgraded camera function with filters and selfie options will offer players fun new ways to enjoy the game!</p></blockquote><p><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> is available now for for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [7,577 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> via <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009763" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation Store</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [20,790 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/zenless-zone-zero-c7c151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zenless-zone-zero/id1606356401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.Nap&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a></p><p>Watch the version 1.1 trailer and special program below.

<p>"I suspect that anyone who can relate to Anita's fictional experiences from a real-life perspective will have one of two polarising responses to Silent Hill: The Short Message: deep outrage, or deep admiration," I wrote in my <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-the-short-message-review">Silent Hill: The Short Message review</a>, giving it three out of five stars.</p>
<p>"No, it may not be the Silent Hill game many of us were expecting; it may not even be the Silent Hill game some people want. But even with that infuriating chase sequence, I'm very glad it exists."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-is-reportedly-coming-to-mobile">The news adds credence to a recent rumour that Final Fantasy developer Square Enix had linked up with Tencent</a> to develop a mobile version of its fan-favourite MMO, Final Fantasy 14.</p> <div>

<p>The approval of Rainbow Six Mobile is interesting, too. Rainbow Six Siege has never been approved by the Chinese authorities, and its ban extended to livestreams as well as sales.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> is reportedly publishing both the Rainbow Six and Final Fantasy 14 games, whilst NetEase secured licenses for Marvel Snap and Marvel Rivals.</p>
<p>Talking of Final Fantasy 14, director and producer Naoki "Yoshi P" Yoshida recently offered his "sincere apologies" for the issues identified in the early access build of its highly-anticipated expansion, Dawntrail.</p>
<p>In a blog post published shortly after the expansion went live for early access players, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-director-apologises-for-issues-identified-in-the-early-access-build-of-dawntrail">Yoshida thanked players for playing and assured them that the team was "investigating" the causes of the most pressing issues</a>, including transition freezes on Xbox, and broken animations across all platforms.</p>
<p>Don't forget that from now until 28th August, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-and-gong-cha-have-come-together-for-a-tasty-new-collaboration">Final Fantasy fans can enjoy three FF14-inspired teas at participating outlets</a> of Gong Cha, as well as earn "special rewards, including the adorable Porxie King mount".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In all the matches I’ve played in the game’s beta as the Guardians of the Galaxy leader Star-Lord alongside other heroes and villains in the Marvel universe, I find myself using <em>Overwatch</em>’s terminology. Escort matches are “payloads,” Star-Lord’s “Blaster Barrage” ability is a “Reaper Ult” because both have dual-wielding gunners dancing in gunfire and shooting enemies within a small radius. As new players have joined, my friends and I have relied on <em>Overwatch </em>comparisons as shorthand for how different heroes work. <em>Marvel Rivals</em> is pretty unapologetic in inviting those comparisons, but I can’t help but wonder what NetEase’s take on the genre has to offer players if I can’t boot it up without thinking of a different game. Maybe it’s that it doesn’t have ten years of drama and fan in-fighting to shape it yet. - Kenneth Shepard <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-beta-impressions-preview-overwatch-1851610920&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-beta-impressions-preview-overwatch-1851610920">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1bbf364290dc5d9d2900e9de0fa631d4" data-recommend-id="image://1bbf364290dc5d9d2900e9de0fa631d4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Aspyr / Lucasfilm</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1bbf364290dc5d9d2900e9de0fa631d4" data-recommend-id="image://1bbf364290dc5d9d2900e9de0fa631d4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/star-wars-bounty-hunter&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/star-wars-bounty-hunter">In 2002, <em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</em></a></span> launched on PS2 and GameCube.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/full-zombie-list-in-7-days-to-die/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a world full of zombies, seeing one stumbling toward you doesn’t always elicit fear. But in 7 Days to Die, it should. You never know what type of zombie is coming your way until they’re too close for comfort. But knowing your enemy is half the battle. Here is the full 7 Days to Die zombie list!</p>



<h2 id="h-every-zombie-type-in-7-days-to-die">Every Zombie Type in 7 Days to Die</h2>



<p>First and foremost, there are four zombie types in 7 Days to Die: Normal, Strong, Special, and Animal. Every zombie in the game falls into one of these categories. They all also follow the same behavior patterns, becoming more vicious and powerful during the night.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Normal Zombies</strong>
<ul>
<li>Festering Corpse</li>



<li>Departed Woman</li>



<li>Infected Survivor</li>



<li>Infected Mother</li>



<li>Motivated Cheerleader</li>



<li>Plague Nurse</li>



<li>Putrid Girl</li>



<li>Rotting Carcass</li>



<li>Reanimated Corpse</li>



<li>Risen Woman</li>



<li>Skater Punk</li>



<li>Walker Male</li>



<li>Zombie Cowboy</li>



<li>Zombie Farmer</li>



<li>Zombie Janitor</li>



<li>Party Girl</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Strong Zombies</strong>
<ul>
<li>Bloated Walker</li>



<li>Fat Hawaiian</li>



<li>Fallen Soldier</li>



<li>Frozen Lumberjack</li>



<li>Hazmat Male</li>



<li>Hungry Female</li>



<li>Utility Worker</li>



<li>Zombie Biker</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Special Zombies</strong>
<ul>
<li>Burn Victim</li>



<li>Crawler</li>



<li>Demolisher</li>



<li>Feral Wight</li>



<li>Screamer</li>



<li>Spider Zombie</li>



<li>Infected Police Officer</li>



<li>Team Z Football Zombie</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Animal Zombies</strong>
<ul>
<li>Zombie Bear</li>



<li>Zombie Dog</li>



<li>Zombie Vulture</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>







<p>Blood Moon Horde Zombies</p>



<p>Alongside the four typical types of zombies in 7 Days to Die, a few of them also spawn as part of the Blood Moon Horde. They’re more powerful, more relentless, and downright annoying if you’re a new player trying to eke out a living in the zombie apocalypse. </p>



<p>Currently, the Blood Moon Horde special zombies consist of:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Demolisher</strong></li>



<li><strong>Feral Wight</strong></li>



<li><strong>Infected Police Officer</strong></li>



<li><strong>Zombie Vulture</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Of course, Blood Moon Horde also contains various Normal Zombies to help flesh out the ranks, so prepare yourself for a fight!</p>

		<p>Sins of a Solar Empire 2 will be available on Steam from August 15th, Stardock Games has announced. The game was originally an Epic Games Store exclusive, having released in October 2022. The Steam base version will be priced at $39.99 and the Premium Edition will be $79.99. The Premium edition of Sins of a Solar Empire 2 includes the base game, first Content Pass (4 DLC: 1 small, 1 medium, and 2 expansion level) and the Sins of a Solar Empire II soundtrack.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sins of a Solar Empire II | Steam Release Date Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4sbOAP-wKfk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“It’s been amazing to see how hyped fans are for the release of&nbsp;Sins of a Solar Empire II&nbsp;on Steam,”</em> said Brian Clair, Director of Publishing at Stardock Entertainment. “<em>We have seen so many people who were fans of the original Sins, and&nbsp;Sins: Rebellion, sharing their excitement for this long-awaited sequel.&nbsp;Sins of a Solar Empire II&nbsp;will deliver epic galactic warfare and strategy to new players on Steam, and our existing players on Epic Games Store, as they will be continually supported with new content and updates. We can’t wait to share more with you and celebrate the launch of&nbsp;Sins of a Solar Empire II&nbsp;on August 15!”</em></p>
<p>Sins of a Solar Empire 2 contains three playable races which are Advent, Vasari, and TEC. Planets also follow their orbital paths which makes the maps dynamic and makes players have to change tactics on the fly. There are also minor factions dotted around that can be influenced and become allies. Capital ships can have a lot of augmentations to change the tide of battle, and within battles lasers and rockets can be deflected by shields. There is also a mod browser that allows players to easily install various mods.</p>

		<p>We’re getting over the hump of the Olympics this weekend, and Team GB has been doing a generally fantastic job of picking medals through the first half. Oh sure, a few of those came from the horsey stuff (it’s still super strange that horse dancing is an event, right?), but we’ve also done pretty darn well in and on the water, with early biking events, triathlon, and more!</p>
<p>There’s always this kind of scepticism in the run up to the Olympics – invariably from the locals who fear being subjected to local travel and life disruption – but it’s followed by a swell of pride and joy as everyone gets to see their nation’s representatives compete, and this year is no different.</p>
<p>Anyway, on to the video games stuff.</p>

<p>Earlier today, Jordan ‘JKap’ Kaplan revealed that he’s departing the CDL’s LA Thieves after almost four years with the brand as a coach. During his time with the 100 Thieves-backed brand, JKap secured two chips and a ring, winning the 2022 CDL Championship with a phenomenal victory over FaZe Clan during the Vanguard season.</p>

<h2 id="h-pastures-new">Pastures New</h2>



<p>JKap, who is one of the winningest players in Call of Duty history, is relocating to the East Coast, per the video update he posted recently on social media:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>He stressed that this was a mutual split and that he’s parting ways with the LA Thieves on amicable terms. In his video, JKap explained that he wanted to find a way to work remotely with the team, but 100 Thieves insisted that they wanted on-site employees. </p>



<p>In his video, Kaplan explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I don’t have a set plan for what I’m doing – I’m still open to opportunities. I’mn just kind of taking a leap and forcing myself to make this change, as scary as it is, because Call of Duty has been all I’ve known. I was a pro player for about ten years, I’ve been a coach for the last four, and quite literally, Call of Duty has been my whole life.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a dangerous twist to his farewell speech, he mentioned that he’ll now have more freedom over his opinions, and his ‘hot takes’ will start to bleed out as he voices his concerns about the Call of Duty esports scene. With that being said, it’ll be worth keeping an eye on JKap’s socials moving forward for some juicy COD-based tidbits.</p>

<li><em>Truly Unique Gameplay – With the core of a MOBA but the mechanics of a third-person shooter/brawler, Predecessor offers a visceral experience that other MOBAs lack, while rewarding teamwork and strategy in a way many shooters overlook.</em></li>
<li><em>Over 35 playable characters – Predecessor’s deep character roster contains over 30 unique Heroes with distinct play styles and abilities.&nbsp;</em></li>
<li><em>The Only Unreal Engine 5 MOBA – Created in Unreal Engine 5, Predecessor is the only MOBA to be developed in Unreal’s latest engine. This new state-of-the-art game engine produces high-resolution and high-fidelity graphics for current and previous gen consoles.&nbsp;</em></li>
<li><em>Play with Friends, No Matter Where They Are – Predecessor was developed with both console and PC gamers in mind with cross-play functionality so friends can play together regardless of their platform.</em></li>
<li><em>Earnable In-Game Content – Predecessor features a ton of rewards, including custom skins, for players to earn or purchase with in-game currency.&nbsp;</em></li>
</ul>

			<p>Larian Studios made it clear a few months back that their next game wouldn't be set in the Forgotten Realms, but the developer had started working on Baldur's Gate 4 before scrapping the project for a few reasons.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/baldurs-gate/i-call-it-chaos-at-scale-for-the-first-anniversary-of-baldurs-gate-3-we-spoke-exclusively-to-swen-vincke-about-the-past-present-and-future-of-larian-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC Gamer</a>, Larian CEO Swen Vincke revealed that the studio was originally open to the idea of more Baldur's Gate, as they were in a vulnerable state following the release of the third entry in the series. <em>"So if something is super successful, obviously everyone's [asking] you, 'When are you going to make the next one?"</em>, Vincke said. <em>"And when you, as a developer, come out of this little miserable cave that you've been sitting in for many, many hours as you're finishing your thing, you're vulnerable."</em></p>
<p>In the beginning, Larian didn't go on working on Baldur's Gate 4 but rather on an expansion of the third entry in the series because it was considered to be the easiest route to take, as they had the engine and everything else already for the creation of more content. Progress was quick due to the production machine still being warm, but eventually, the project was retooled as a new game, as Vincke and his team didn't feel like working on this expansion for three years was worth it. The same, however, happened when the project became Baldur's Gate 4, and when the idea of scrapping the project was brought to the developers, the consensus was to move on. Sadly, it sounds like we are really missing out, as Baldur's Gate 4 was in a partially playable state, and players would have really loved it, according to Vincke.</p>
<p>Baldur's Gate 3 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about one of the best role-playing games ever released by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/baldurs-gate-3-review/">review.</a></p>
