            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>According to research from analytics firm Ampere Analysis (per <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/consumers-spend-twice-as-much-on-video-game-remakes-than-remasters-according-to-research/">VGC</a>), over the last two years, players spent twice as much on remakes of video games compared to remasters. It's no secret that players are, for the most part, fond of a good remake and remaster. In the last two years (2024-2025), according to Ampere, across Steam, Xbox, and PlayStation, 72.4 million players spent approximately $1.4 billion on remakes and remasters and microtransactions related to them.</p>



<p>Between January 2024 and September 2025, a period during which 15 remakes were released and 27 remasters, on average, players spent 2.2x more on remakes. Of course, there are a lot of factors here, like how remakes cost more to make, and as a result, cost more for players to buy. Remasters can cost less to make, but, as Ampere puts it, they "<em>offer faster turnaround and lower cost, but generally deliver less engagement</em>."</p>



<p>That's not always the case; The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is a huge exception in that period between January 2024 and September 2025, a game that continues to sell well and even as of last week is <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-tops-us-sales-charts-ghost-of-yotei-matched-tsushima-covid-era-numbers/">one of the top-five best-selling premium games in the US in 2025 so far</a>. Over <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-registered-9-million-players/">9 million players</a> have stepped back into Oblivion, and according to Ampere, it reached $180 million in consumer spending and 7 million monthly active users on PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam at its peak.</p>



<p>Senior analyst at Ampere Analysis, Katie Holt added, "<em>As games and IP development costs escalate, publishers are increasingly raiding their back catalogues for cost-effective remakes and remasters. Publishers deciding between a full remake versus a remaster have to balance franchise planning, investment risk, age of content, platform support, and more when choosing which route to take</em>."</p>



<p>Remakes and remasters have become a massive part of the industry over the last decade, and there's no sign of that changing anytime soon. But with this research in mind, it'll be interesting to see if/how the approach to remasters and remakes changes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher AdHoc Studio has revealed that its episodic adventure game-slash-management sim&nbsp;<em>Dispatch&nbsp;</em>has reached a major sales milestone within its first ten days on release.</p>

<p>Over on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:zeyme7h7gsicdx2zt2mjwlu5/post/3m4r2a5kiww23" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, the studio begins by saying that selling "80 million copies" in the space of two days "would've been nice", but that managing to sell a million within ten days is "still pretty good".</p>

<p>That's likely including sales on both PC and PlayStation 5, where the game's first four episodes are currently available. Episodes 5 and 6 will launch tomorrow, while the concluding Episodes 7 and 8 will arrive next week.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dispatch-sales-1m-management.jpg?itok=c7K4awwQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dispatch-sales-1m-management.jpg?itok=PhR3MRTT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dispatch&nbsp;</em>isn't just a Telltale-esque adventure game, but a management sim as well.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Dispatch</em>, it's a "superhero workplace comedy" created by AdHoc Studio, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-telltale-employees-go-on-to-form-adhoc-studio" rel="nofollow">formed from the ashes</a> of Telltale following <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/updatedtelltale-games-begins-closing-entering-assignment-proceedings" rel="nofollow">the latter's dissolution back in 2018</a>. The studio also incorporates former personnel from studios like Ubisoft and&nbsp;<em>Oxenfree</em>'s Night School.</p>

<p>As the name suggests,&nbsp;<em>Dispatch&nbsp;</em>sees you playing as a dispatcher who must send superheroes around the city to combat crime. It's up to you to decide which hero's power set and personality best match each crime as it comes up.</p>

<p>Of course, this being a game created by former Telltale staffers, there's also a choice-based adventure element in which you'll buld relationships, learn more about your colleagues, and make decisions that affect the way the story progresses.</p>

<p><em>Dispatch&nbsp;</em>boasts a pretty prestigious voice cast as well as its all-star development team; actors like&nbsp;<em>Breaking Bad</em>'s Aaron Paul,&nbsp;<em>Hades II</em>'s Erin Yvette, and <i>The Last of Us II</i>'s Laura Bailey are part of the cast, among other big names.</p>




<p>You can grab&nbsp;<em>Dispatch&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2592160/Dispatch/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10013259" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, where the first four episodes are waiting for you.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-dk-bananza-switch-2-sales</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mario-kart-world-nears-10m-sales-donkey-kong-bananza-at-3-5m.1343200/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has released its financial statement for the second quarter of the 2025-26 fiscal year (as well as the first half of the year as a whole), and it looks like Switch 2 games like&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>are selling pretty well.</p>

<p>As part of its <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251104_4e.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">fiscal results</a>, Nintendo has revealed sales numbers for games released within the last few months, and&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>is currently sitting pretty at 9.57 million sales. Given that the Switch 2 itself has sold just over 10 million units to date, that's a pretty high adoption rate for the racer.</p>

<p>3D platformer&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, meanwhile, has racked up 3.49 million sales for itself, and given that&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong&nbsp;</em>is perhaps not quite as powerful an IP as&nbsp;<em>Mario&nbsp;</em>when it comes to moving units (although there's a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-super-mario-odyssey-team" rel="nofollow">developer in common</a> in this case), that's not bad at all.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-financials.jpg?itok=GuYQhjjn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-financials.jpg?itok=eNCRXiI2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sales of&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>have been pretty strong so far.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, in the same period, <i>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&nbsp;</i>still managed to rack up 1.37 million sales, and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/super-mario-party-jamboree-whole-party-and-then-some" rel="nofollow">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>&nbsp;</em>wasn't far behind, likely boosted by the Switch 2 Edition that launched back in July.</p>

<p>This quarter saw Nintendo's sales and operating profit leap when compared to the same period last year, as you'd probably expect given that the Switch 2 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">was released in June</a> (which technically sits in the first quarter of the year).</p>

<p>According to Nintendo, sales slowed slightly during this quarter "compared to the high demand seen immediately following" the Switch 2's launch, but the console still managed to shift 4.54 million units between July and September.</p>

<p>All told, it's more good news for Nintendo, and it suggests the company might well have been justified in reportedly asking for 25 million Switch 2 units to be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-25m-production-report" rel="nofollow">manufactured by March next year</a>.</p>

We'll have to wait and see how they affect the company's third-quarter financials.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-offloads-the-quest-3s-at-a-record-low-with-a-45-bonus-now-cheaper-than-metas-official-store-2000641054</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-offloads-the-quest-3s-at-a-record-low-with-a-45-bonus-now-cheaper-than-meta%E2%80%99s-official-store.1343194/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>VR headsets open up gaming, entertainment and productivity in ways that a regular screen just can’t match but the entry price usually makes you hesitate. The Meta Quest 3S 128GB normally sells for $299 on Meta’s official website with nothing extra included.: Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4500/">undercuts that price by $10, dropping it to $289, and throws in an exclusive Cardboard Hero Bundle for Gorilla Tag worth $45</a> that includes the Handiwork Helmet, Handiwork Armor, and 1000 shiny rocks.</p>
<p>You’re essentially <strong>getting $55 in extra value compared to buying directly from Meta</strong>, which explains why Amazon moved over 10,000 units in the past month alone. And you also get a 3-month Meta Horizon+ trial subscription.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4500/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Mixed Reality That Actually Makes Sense</h2>
<p>The Quest 3S brings mixed reality right into your living room and merges digital objects with your real environment. You could place a virtual screen on your actual wall, play a game where aliens climb through your real furniture or set up multiple browser windows floating around your desk while still seeing your keyboard and coffee mug.</p>
<p>The Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processor gives the Quest a double boost in graphical performance for smoother-running games with sharper details, and less stuttering during extreme action scenes. The high-definition resolution makes text readable when you’re browsing the web or working in the virtual space, solving one of the biggest complaints about earlier VR headsets where everything looked fuzzy.</p>
<p>The <strong>128GB storage gives you room for dozens of games and apps</strong> without constantly deleting things just to make space. Most VR games run from 2-10GB, so you can have your favorites installed alongside your productivity apps, social platforms, and entertainment content. Wireless freedom means no cables tethering to a PC or gaming console-just put on and jump into what you want to do.</p>



<p>With Touch Plus controllers, you get precision in games and apps while realistic haptic feedback lets you feel textures, impacts, and interactions. Ditch controllers entirely and use hand tracking to swipe through menus, grab virtual objects, or gesture in social spaces. The flexibility of switching between controller precision for gaming and natural hand movements for casual browsing makes the system adapt to whatever you’re doing, not force you into one control scheme.</p>



<p><strong>Home Theater Mode turns any room into your personal cinema</strong> with a massive virtual screen in front of you while it dimmers your surroundings. You can watch movies, sports, or YouTube on a screen that feels bigger than most people’s actual TVs while you lounge on your couch. You can plug in any standard headphones using a USB-C adapter into the 3.5mm headphone jack or plug in USB-C headphones directly for private audio that doesn’t disturb anyone else in the house.</p>
<p>The <strong>3-month Meta Horizon+ trial subscription</strong> includes access to a rotating catalog of games with new additions each month, giving you plenty to explore right out of the box without buying individual titles immediately.</p>
<p>The Amazon-exclusive Gorilla Tag bundle adds immediate value for one of VR’s most popular multiplayer games. Gorilla Tag has millions of players running around virtual playgrounds using arm movements to climb and jump, and the Cardboard Hero gear gives your character a unique look right from the start. The $45 value of this bonus content combined with the $10 price reduction makes Amazon’s deal mathematically better than buying from Meta directly.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nintendos-patent-in-palworld-dispute-is-being-reexamined-by-uspto/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo%E2%80%99s-patent-in-palworld-dispute-is-being-reexamined-by-uspto.1343191/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A significant development has transpired in Nintendo’s patent infringement lawsuit against Palworld, as one of their patents is being reexamined by the US Patent Office. </p>



<p>For those wondering, in September 2025, Nintendo <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-acquires-another-patent-for-character-summons-as-palworld-lawsuit-continues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired a patent</a> amid its lawsuit against Palworld. The patent in question, US Patent No. 12,403,397, relates to summoning characters and allowing them to engage in combat against one another. Now, the USPTO director has personally ordered the office to reexamine the patent. </p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-s-patent-against-palworld-is-being-reexamined-due-to-two-prior-art-references">Nintendo’s Patent Against Palworld is Being Reexamined Due to Two Prior Art References</h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://gamesfray.com/huge-blow-for-nintendo-head-of-u-s-patent-office-takes-rare-step-to-order-reexamination-of-summon-subcharacter-and-let-it-fight-in-1-of-2-modes-patent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesFray</a>, USPTO Director John A. Squires has&nbsp;personally&nbsp;ordered,&nbsp;at his own initiative, that the organisation reexamines Nintendo’s patent against Palworld due to two older US patent applications. US Patent No. 12,403,397’s claims 1, 13, 25, and 26 are the ones under review, and if they fall, then the other ones will fall as well, like “a house of cards.” The reexamination is being conducted due to the failure to cite prior art references in support of the issuance of this patent </p>



<p>The two prior art references have been specified as well. Nintendo’s ‘397 patent is related to character summons in combat, and it seems Konami and Nintendo itself have patents that can be considered prior art. Konami’s patent application was filed in 2001 and published in 2002. The other is Nintendo’s own patent application, which was filed in 2019 and published in 2020. Both of these prior art references “teach a player being allowed to perform a battle in a manual mode and in a simpler, automatic mode.”</p>



<p>For those wondering, reexamination doesn’t mean the patent will be revoked. Nintendo will have two months to come up with a response, and during that time, third parties can also present challenges through other prior art references. Moreover, if Nintendo tries to sue over patent ‘397 in a United States District Court, the “court would stay the proceedings pending the outcome of the reexamination.”</p>



<p>The director initiated the order for Ex Parte Reexamination to address the element that the original examiner believed made Nintendo’s patent distinct from the prior art. Moreover, there might not be any more developments in Nintendo’s lawsuit against Palworld in this calendar year. But, 2026 should see some decisions come into play by Presiding Judge Motoyuki Nakashima. </p>



<p>Regarding the lawsuit, one of Nintendo’s anti-Palworld patents was recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendos-anti-palworld-patent-application-gets-rejected-in-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rejected in Japan</a>. Additionally, the Switch 2 has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-10-million-sales-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surpassed 10 million units sold</a>.

Banana hero Peely, hotdog man The Brat, and rapper pickle Big Dill were spotted by fan <a href="https://twitter.com/Reetlol?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1985521856028565880%7Ctwgr%5Ecf08f4a5fb977123883191ca1ce2b3f06cd9c585%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Ffortnite-chapter-seven-teases-kill-bill-crossover-points-to-usa-setting" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reetlol</a>, and can be seen holding signs saying "Game 7 first, Chapter Seven Next!!," "Seven," and "Nov 29" — a date fans now think is when we'll get a first glimpse at Chapter Seven.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="qme" dir="ltr">👀 <a href="https://twitter.com/Fortnite?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Fortnite</a> <a href="https://t.co/GHAsz9OuzC" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/GHAsz9OuzC</a></p>— JOGO Reet (@Reetlol) <a href="https://twitter.com/Reetlol/status/1985521856028565880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 4, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite has always labelled the different incarnations of its battle royale map as different "chapters" of the game (which are then sub-divided into seasons). But this one, fans have noticed, is being referred to as Chapter <em>Seven</em>, spelt out, rather than the usual Chapter 7 numbering.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Seven holds a big significance in Fortnite lore (and thankfully no, it's nothing to do with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/skrilla-claims-viral-hit-doot-doot-6-7-is-in-gta-6-im-going-to-be-my-own-person-on-there-playing-my-own-music">the 6-7 meme</a>). Throughout Fortnite's first five years, The Seven were slowly revealed as a heroic team of characters who defended the game's multiverse, and who led the charge during the game's big story events (such as the one where the original Chapter 1 Island got sucked into a black hole). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over the years, The Seven's helmeted heroes were revealed to include characters played by Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson and Brie Larsen, though after Chapter 3's grand finale, the team's story was abruptly concluded, with their members seemingly defeated and dispursed. More recent Chapters have acted as something of a reset of the game's narrative, following the departure of Epic Games' previous creative lead Donald Mustard, though fans have long held out hope of seeing The Seven once again. In a Chapter named after them, surely it's finally time?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Separately, numerous Fortnite leakers have claimed that the Chapter Seven map will include a large desert biome, with mention of an "Area 51" style location. FortniteLeaks, meanwhile, has specifically reported that the game will feature a weapon called the Gambler Shotgun — "which is related to one of the major themes of the map."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, fans are putting two and two together and arriving at the idea of Chapter Seven featuring a Nevada-style location, and have suggested a crossover with another upcoming franchise: Fallout. The game has already featured Fallout in the shape of an outfit sporting the franchise's power suit. But with new episodes of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/fallout-the-series">Fallout TV series</a> scheduled to debut from December 17, fans have wondered whether a larger collaboration is also now on the cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Until then, there's three weeks left of Fortnite's really very enjoyable The Simpsons era to enjoy, before a big live event on November 29 that's expected to usher in Chapter Seven — and whatever it holds — in style.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Medios y Media/Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Grand Theft Auto fans have known for some time that Rockstar Games worked on a single-player DLC for GTA 5 that would have seen Trevor assume the role of a secret agent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year, voice actor Steven Ogg said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-5-had-trevor-dlc-before-rockstar-scrapped-it-voice-actor-steven-ogg-says">Rockstar originally planned to make a story expansion focused on his character, Trevor</a>, with it thought to have fallen by the wayside as the developer focused on the cash cow that was GTA Online.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ogg was joined by Michael actor Ned Luke and Franklin actor Shawn Fonteno in a Questions and Answers session with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtW3WXxA0pY" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Streamily</u></a>. The trio shed light on what they claimed was scrapped downloadable content for GTA 5 that starred Trevor as a Federal Investigation Bureau agent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Originally they were gonna do continuing stories of Michael, Franklin, and Trevor," Luke said, and Ogg expanded on his version. "We also had that really cool s**t of — and I forget if it was DLC, I have no idea — but where Trevor was gonna be undercover, he works for the FEDs," Ogg said. "And we did shoot some of that stuff with James Bond Trevor. He's still kind of a f**k up but he's doing his best. And we shot some stuff and then it just disappeared and they never followed up on it."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Celebrity in GTA 5 and GTA Online</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Also last year, Joe Robino, who was a senior camera artist and virtual cinematographer working at Rockstar’s New York office from 2010 to 2016, spoke to <a href="https://youtu.be/Uikfph7oQoE?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>the SanInPlay YouTube channel</u></a> about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-5s-kick-ass-story-dlc-scrapped-because-gta-online-was-so-much-of-a-cash-cow-ex-rockstar-dev-claims">why the GTA 5 story DLC was canceled</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A lot of the team went to do Red Dead Redemption 2 right away and I took on this other project that was a standalone DLC for GTA that never came out and it was kick ass,” Robino revealed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That was my thing. I was one of the main editors, camera artists, and on-stage stuff. We split our teams into two. I stayed on GTA Online and then this DLC, which Steven Ogg [the actor who played Trevor Philips] was a very important part of.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And then some of the team overlapped and went to RDR2 early on, and then we just kind of did this [flipped motion], because when that game got shelved, we spent so much money… a lot of that stuff though did end up making it I believe into later iterations of GTA Online, I think. So it’s not like they wasted it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was really really good. But when GTA Online came out it was so much of a cash cow and people were loving it so much that it was hard to make an argument that a standalone DLC would outcompete that. I think looking back now you could probably do both. But that was a business decision they made. I was a little upset about that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That actually was a lot of the reason for me being a little sour at that time. Because I was like yo, WTF guys? This s**t’s awesome. Let’s keep going. Let’s finish this s**t.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have had snippets of information about GTA 5’s fabled story DLC over the years. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/with-gta-6-waiting-in-the-wings-fans-find-possible-evidence-of-cut-gta-5-story-dlc-canned-bully-2"><u>GTA dataminers have also discovered a reference to Trevor with a jetpack</u></a>, which suggests story mode DLC was repurposed into GTA Online, as Robino said. In 2018, Rockstar finally unveiled <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/gta-5/The_Doomsday_Heist"><u>GTA Online's Doomsday Heist missions</u></a> alongside the Thruster jetpack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, speaking on the <a href="https://youtu.be/o3gbXDjNWyI?si=-F5wXQ6TeJHbbkfI" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lex Fridman podcast</a>, Rockstar Games co-founder and former lead writer Dan Houser has addressed this DLC for the first time, insisting that if the developer had continued with it, it wouldn’t have been able to make 2018’s Red Dead Redemption 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The internet knows we made a DLC… single-player DLC for GTA 5 that never came out,” Houser said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was one when you played as Trevor, but he was a secret agent. It was cute. It never quite came together, and it was never finished. It was about half done when it got abandoned. But I think if that had come out, we probably wouldn’t have gotten to make Red Dead 2. So, there are always compromises.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s the first time Houser has addressed the canceled GTA 5 story DLC, but it turns out there’s another project he would have loved to have made while he was at the studio: GTA Zombies. “I liked the idea of it, it was a GTA zombie game,” he said. “That would have been funny. I think that could have been quite fun.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every GTA Game Ranked</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA fans often lament the loss of single-player story DLC for GTA 5 after it did so well for previous GTA games. Houser said he remains a big fan of single-player DLC, and is hoping to make some as part of his new company, Absurd Ventures.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I like making the stories,” he said. “For me, I love the model of GTA 4 when you had the extra stories coming afterwards, or Red Dead 1 when you had the zombie pack coming afterwards. I like just doing these extra things. So, I would personally like to have done more of that in that company. And with stuff we’re doing in the future, we’re going to try and come up with worlds where we can add more stories.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I like single-player DLC. I just think the audience loves it, and it’s really fun to make.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/04/gettyimages-2237849657-1762257766339.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Dan Houser at 2025 Los Angeles Comic Con.

In September, he said he felt "absolutely nothing" inside for GTA 6 because he’s never been a fan of video games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a number of revelations in Lex Fridman’s Dan Houser interview, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-question-if-you-can-even-make-a-good-open-world-spy-game-rockstar-co-founder-dan-houser-finally-explains-why-agent-never-happened">the fate of canceled PS3 exclusive Agent</a>, and Houser’s thoughts on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/you-needed-guns-you-needed-these-larger-than-life-characters-rockstar-co-founder-dan-houser-explains-why-grand-theft-auto-wont-leave-the-united-states">why GTA won’t leave the United States in terms of setting</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

                <p>Microsoft has debuted a new advertisement for Xbox Game Pass aimed at reminding people that they don't have to wait very long to play more games. The "New Games Added All The Time" ad focuses on a sad-looking, tired person sitting inside a disc-return box waiting for someone to return a game so they can play it. This is meant to highlight how people used to rent games at places like Blockbuster but had to wait, in some cases at least, for people to return their copies.</p><p>"That was then," the ad states before cutting to the person sitting at their desk at home and booting up a game from the Game Pass library. "Now, new games are added all the time," the ad says.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5IJn83bV_8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Q5IJn83bV_8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Microsoft normally adds games to Game Pass across two waves each month, and there are currently <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 850 titles</a> available to Game Pass Ultimate subscribers.</p><p>While it's true Microsoft adds more and more games to the Game Pass library on an ongoing basis, the company also removes games twice a month as well. For October, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/games#consoleleavingsoon" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the titles set for removal is Stalker 2</a>, and some people are complaining about this given it was heavily promoted by Microsoft as an Xbox console exclusive.</p><p>It's being removed this month presumably due to the expiration of an agreement, as the game lands on PS5 on November 20, which is exactly one year after the game came to Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>Microsoft recently announced a huge price hike for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, raising the monthly cost from $20 to $30. Most major retailers have not adopted the price hike, though, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-sign-up-best-deal-available-now/1100-6535504/" data-ref-id="1100-6535504">Game Pass Ultimate remains $20 at GameStop, Amazon, Best Buy, and others.</a></p>

            <p>
Dispatch, the acclaimed superhero workplace comedy from a group of former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/telltale-games">Telltale Games</a> veterans, has sold over 1m copies in just 10 day - an impressive feat considering even the big players in the episodic narrative adventure genre have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-double-exposure-was-a-large-loss-for-square-enix-report">struggled to make much of an impact</a> in recent years.
</p>
<p>
Dispatch - which very much follows the classic Telltale choice-and-consequence formula - tells the story of Robert Robertson, a sort-of-superhero (played by Breaking Bad's Aaron Paul), who takes an office job as a superhero dispatcher after his inherited mecha-suit breaks down. It's the work of AdHoc Studio, founded by primarily by former Telltale Games staff, whose credits include the much-loved <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tales-from-the-borderlands">Tales from the Borderlands</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-wolf-among-us">The Wolf Among Us</a>.

<p>
Like those Telltale classics, Dispatch is being released episodically, one new instalment arriving each week following an initial two-episode start on 22nd October. That means we're now four episodes into its eight-episode run. And things are going well! AdHoc announced Dispatch's 1m sales milestone in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/adhocstudio.com/post/3m4r2a5kiww23">post on social media</a>. "Two days, 80 million copies sold. Would've been nice," it joked. "We sold one million in ten days though. Still pretty good."
</p><p>
Eurogamer's Robert Purchese <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remember-episodic-gaming-former-telltale-devs-are-bringing-it-back-for-the-release-of-dispatch-and-theres-a-chance-it-might-work-this-time">had a chat with AdHoc prior to Dispatch's release</a>, discussing, among other things, the studio's approach to the episodic release model and Critical Role's involvement in the game - a partnership which likely helped give Dispatch some additional exposure. They also discussed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-wolf-among-us-2">The Wolf Among Us 2</a>, which the studio was involved with at one time. And if you're curious about <em>that</em>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/even-the-studio-that-wrote-the-wolf-among-us-2-doesnt-know-whats-going-on-with-it">Bertie has you covered elsewhere</a>.

            <p>The team behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a> will be making the full transition to current gen consoles in just over one week's time, meaning it will no longer be playable on Xbox One and PS4.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://pubg.com/en/news/9355">new blog update</a>, the developer stated the PS5 version will also have its own trophies, so previously earned trophies will be reset. "We explored various options with Sony Interactive Entertainment to make trophy transfer possible, but due to the large volume of related data, we confirmed that it is technically difficult to implement," the PUBG team explained. "We kindly ask for your understanding."</p>

			<p>Time has gone very squiffy in Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment. Set during <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/11/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review/">Tears of the Kingdom</a>, and following Zelda’s disappearance into a sinkhole beneath Hyrule Castle, Zelda awakens in a clearing in the forest. This isn’t her Hyrule though, and it soon becomes clear that she’s travelled back in time, all the way to Hyrule’s very beginning. There she meets King Rauru and Queen Sonia, the original founders and rulers of the iconic kingdom, and they take her in, lost as she is.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Imprisoning War begins November 6th – Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment (Nintendo Switch 2)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hVIiqYwp7PY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Since Breath of the Wild, the Legend of Zelda timeline has become deeper and more interconnected than before, and Age of Imprisonment is the next step in furthering the series’ lore and Hyrule’s history. It’s been interesting to see Hyrule Warriors becoming an integral part of Nintendo’s flagship series, and here that connection between the mainline entries and the spin-off are closer than ever.</p>


<p>Here in the past, you see the origins of Hyrule, and the initial union of the Zonai and Hyrulean people, while getting a different perspective on the Constructs and Zonai technology we first saw in Tears of the Kingdom, but there’s also further ties back to Breath of the Wild. At the start of the game, the realm is beset by Shades, and these lead to the construction of the shrines that come to litter the world, built to hold back these nightmarish shadows. It’s an interesting little bit of history for returning fans who have spent hundreds of hours in the shrines’ hidden depths.</p>
<p>With the arrival of Ganondorf, though, there’s a crushing sense of inevitability to the opening hours. Age of Imprisonment charts the war between Ganondorf the Demon King, and the rest of Hyrule, and the game spends a great deal of time bringing the different races together in preparation for the final showdown. In terms of character building, I don’t think I’ve ever truly hated the red-haired Gerudo leader as much as in Age of Imprisonment. He’s manipulative, deceitful, cunning and two-faced, and while he’s always ostensibly been these things, he feels like a true villain in Age of Imprisonment, rather than a faceless big bad, who’s evil because we’ve been told he is.</p>


<p>The large cast of characters, led by Zelda, are immediately fascinating, and you’ll undoubtedly enjoy spending time with them, particularly if you’re a longtime fan of the series, or even if you’re just coming to this straight from Tears of the Kingdom. The regal Zonai King Rauru, who is as powerful on the battlefield as he is in the throne room, swiftly became my favourite character, while his sister Lady Mineru brings a different flavour to combat, commanding Construct weaponry while riding around on a tiny chariot.</p>
<p>Zelda herself feels more settled and rounded than ever before, and her distant ancestors teach her a great deal about her own strength and the power that resides in her bloodline. On the battlefield she becomes capable of utterly ruining entire battalions, and she feels hugely powerful. No one can do it alone though, and one of the greatest joys of Imprisonment is switching between characters, exploiting enemy weaknesses, and teaming up for massive damage.</p>

<p>While Musou games are notoriously single minded, and fundamentally repetitive, the team at Koei’s team at AAA Games Studio have added as much to the formula as possible to keep boredom at bay. Elemental weaknesses are a great way to implement the different Zonai devices, and as you unlock dispensers on the map, you can slot them into your special skills, with the only limitation being your battery charge.</p>
<p>So, if you come up against water-based creatures, you’ll have more effect with ice or electricity, while being close to a body of water will amp up the effects even more. You can mix effects together, setting down fans and then combining them with fire or the other elements to create devastating tornados. It’s an organic and clever way to enhance combat, and does a good job of replacing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/18/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity-review/">Age of Calamity’s</a> Sheikah Slate runes.</p>

<p>The only issue about this is that if you don’t have the devices slotted in – and that often means replacing a skill or two – then you’re hopping in and out of menus, pausing the action as you go. While that is also true for both its inspiration and its predecessor, it breaks the flow of combat to the point I ended up mostly relying on a single device and my character skills, rather than mixing the device effects together. It’s an option though, and some enemies will fall much quicker if you utilise them.</p>
<p>The Musou, 1v100 combat is as crunchy and enjoyable as it’s ever been, and as you increase your roster, they each introduce unique mechanics into the mix. You can’t help but smile at being able to play as Korok Calamo, decimating armies with a tiny leaf chap, whose ultimate attack involves throwing a beehive at the bad guys. Other characters introduce perfect parry techniques into the mix as well, and combat is at its best as you move back and forth, utilising each character’s different techniques, and watching the kill count stack ever higher.</p>

<p>The only real downside at this point is that very little of Age of Imprisonment feels wholly new. The narrative is well told, the visuals excellent – performance is also mostly very stable on Switch 2, though one Rito character’s moveset seems to stress the engine more than everybody else – and there’s been a lot done to further amalgamate the Musuo fundamentals with Tears of the Kingdom, but there is a sense of familiarity which lurks around every corner that you bump into yet another Moblin. That familiarity is mostly staved off by the steady feed of new moves, characters, weapons and ingredients, but after Age of Imprisonment, I feel as though the Breath of the Wild/Tears of the Kingdom arc is now done.</p>

<figure><a title="Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment Review - Screenshot 1 of 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160015/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>Back in 2014 when I picked up the very first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/hyrule_warriors">Hyrule Warriors</a> on Wii U, my expectations were set somewhere around 'Give me mindless musou action wearing its best Legend of Zelda costume and I'll be a very happy boy.' A simple boy, for sure, but a happy one.</p>
<p>And I was a happy boy. I played through Hyrule Warriors in a delirious blaze over a weekend (I had just become a dad for the first time, so my son spent some of his earliest days on earth watching his auld pa tear Moblin armies a new ar...mour hole), therefore this is a spin-off series that's got a special place in my heart; it gives me my musou fix, it rocks Zelda vibes immaculately, and it provided me with a nice family memory. Hooray!</p>
<p>Fast-forward six years, and its sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_age_of_calamity">Age of Calamity</a>, tightened things up on the battlefield and ensured the story played a more integral role. Some people still prefer Hyrule Warriors, as it's got more content, and I'd usually be on that boat with a game of this type. I mean, how deep can it get? I want to smash people, not fall asleep during cutscenes.</p>
<figure><a title="Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment Review - Screenshot 2 of 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160022/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The thing is, though, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Zelda</a> series is on such a massive high right now, certainly in terms of its lore, and so I want the narrative in my balls-to-the-wall action game. I want the plot, the drama, the surprises, the cameos, the deep lore references. And since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> is 100% bona fide canon material, that's exactly what they've delivered for this latest slice of Hylian...eh...hellaciousness?</p>
<p>Age of Imprisonment rolls with Calamity's clever refocusing to deliver a game that balances best-in-class musou combat with a story that will have Zelda fans locked in. I won't spoil any of it, but any niggles folk had with Age of Calamity's ending shouldn't cause any stress this time.</p>
<p>Nor do you need to stress the game's performance or graphical prowess. Age of Imprisonment is a showcase for your shiny Switch 2. Yes, even in co-op mode. We've finally broken free from the prison of sketchy frame rates and blurry resolutions! <em>*Does Moblin victory dance*</em></p>
<figure><a title="Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment Review - Screenshot 3 of 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160012/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In main campaign mode, we're looking at smooth 60fps action, and whilst I'm no Digital Foundry boffin, I can't say I noticed a drop anywhere. For co-op play, 30fps is the target and it feels super-smooth, even if it is a step down switching from 60.</p>
<p>Now, let's rewind a bit to where Age of Imprisonment picks up the action within the overall franchise framework, as I got a bit excited to tell you about performance. This latest effort takes place right back at the kingdom of Hyrule's formation. Princess Zelda has accidentally travelled back in time using a secret stone and is thrown into the mix during the Imprisonment Wars, which every self-respecting Zelda fan has studied exhaustively.</p>
<p>Given that the story has got the full and official blessing of the lords of Hyrule, and is therefore 100% Pure Canon™, the devs have taken advantage and given us an adventure that consistently wows in its diligent attention to detail. Again, I am at pains to spoil nothing, but if you're into taking an action-packed and informative tour of Hyrule's past, one that happens to invite you to a blistering square-off against Ganondorf and his filthy armies, then prepare to have a very good time indeed.</p>
<figure><a title="Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment Review - Screenshot 4 of 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160016/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Old familiar places and faces abound, and the story that evolves around them is an exciting and satisfying one; one that lives up to the rich — and heavily scrutinised — universe of which it's now a part.</p>
<p>This attention to detail pans out across the game's menus and UI, flawless copies of those found in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a>, and extends to the in-game map, split into distinct regions that need to be wrestled back from the clutches of Ganondorf's freshly-formed armies.</p>
<p>As it goes on, this map gets super-cluttered with quests, aside missions, and challenges, and Age of Imprisonment pulls off another nice balancing act here. Story missions are meaty affairs, and they give you all the pomp, ceremony, and production values you expect from a mainline Zelda. This is the main meat, and it's powered by top-notch combat melded with a genuinely great story.</p>
<figure><a title="Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment Review - Screenshot 5 of 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160019/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Then you get to liberate yourself with uncomplicated beatdowns. You know, the stuff musou fans turn up for: challenging fights against hordes of baddies on repeat until we whittle our times down and kill everything in sight without taking a hit.</p>
<p>Koei Tecmo's new team, AAA Games Studio, has also cleverly leveraged aspects of the Zelda games to create the illusion of a much grander adventure. The cooking is here, and it works into camps that keep your team going during long quests. The Zonai device dispensers are also here, ready to have parts pumped into them in return for traps for use in battle. It all adds up to something that <em>feels</em> epic, even though, at its heart, it's still just running around in circles, battering wee guys like you were doing years ago in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dynasty_warriors_8_empires">Dynasty Warriors</a> (or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fire_emblem_warriors_three_hopes">Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes</a>, another recent stunner from KT's musou maestros, Omega Force).</p>
<figure><a title="Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment Review - Screenshot 6 of 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160018/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>So, we're in excellent shape so far in terms of presentation, then, and you can go ahead and add stellar voice-acting in the English dub and an excellent soundtrack to the mix. It's top-notch stuff across the board. Heck, you can even play tracks at your leisure in a music player in the menus.</p>
<p>With combat, we're building on a concept that Koei Tecmo's teams have got down pat at this point. I considered Age of Calamity the best Musou game I'd played back in 2020, in terms of just how much depth and polish it added to the overall fighting package without spoiling the fun for folk who want mindless railing against huge crowds of dumb enemies. This game does all of that, and more besides.</p>
<p>This is musou that aims higher than simply button-mashing. Shielded foes require consideration, bosses can be tough, and your roster of heroes can pull off specific moves to counter aerial assaults or heavily defended units, so there's a 'right' way to do things for maximum stylishness. You also now have Sync Strikes to add to an already heady mix.</p>
<figure><a title="Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment Review - Screenshot 7 of 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160024/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Sync Strikes become available as a gauge fills by attacking and fighting well, and once your chosen character's gauge is flashing blue, you just need to get into position (nearby an ally) and hit 'L' to join forces for a fancy smackdown. It's very addictive, there are different strikes for different character pairings, and it fits in perfectly without ruining that magical musou flavour.</p>
<p>These new Sync Strikes also introduce a fresh flow to the core of the game that gives it a strategic lift. In Age of Calamity, or at least how I played it, my units would be split up and taking over points alone a lot of the time. Now, however, you need to consider whether or not to keep allies nearby for when you need a Sync Strike.</p>
<p>There are countless moments along the way, as you slice and dice across some amazingly detailed depictions of Hyrule's famous landmarks in their infancy, where the sheer number of Moblins, Constructs, and Gorons onscreen is incredibly impressive. I'm sure these are the biggest crowds I've cut through in a game, and boy oh boy, with that smooth frame rate, it feels glorious to twirl and whirl through the lot of them. They're also incredibly well-animated and detailed.</p>
<figure><a title="Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment Review - Screenshot 8 of 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160017/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Those Zonai devices I briefly mentioned are another well-handled aspect of the fun, with all characters able to share in the action once a device has been unlocked. Rather than bringing up your Sheikah Slate with the 'R' button, you now bring up a menu of character-specific attacks and Zonai device slots. These can even be freely swapped out during scraps. So, Zelda has her light sword and bow attacks, her signature moves, and she can then swap in a bunch of Zonai tech to aid her.</p>
<p>Further to this (yes, there's more), Zonai tech can eventually be slotted to the ends of combos, so you can throw out a bunch of light hits, then press 'X' to switch into heavy flow-ups that end with a Zonai device attack.</p>
<p>Honestly, it's all so complex on paper, and just to <em>think</em> about, really, but as soon as Mineru shows up early in the campaign, once you get a shot at how this stuff works, you'll want to use it all the time. Hey! That's how I felt about the building and crafting in Tears of the Kingdom, too, so I guess they really have nailed the vibe.</p>
<figure><a title="Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment Review - Screenshot 9 of 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160021/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>You can drop stuff into the environment, as well, like a time bomb or a flame emitter, to get a little extra clever. Why smash someone with your sword alone when you could be smashing them while they are set alight and moving in slow motion? I have to say, too, that while some parts of Age of Calamity felt cumbersome when they gave you large machines to pilot, here any new means of locomotion (and there's plenty this time out) handle much better.</p>
<p>On a negative note, as nice as the levels look across the board, and as amazing as it is to have The Depths in the mix — <em>and</em> to see so many franchise landmarks from a new perspective — the maps are essentially the same old straightforward boxes to run around in. There's no real effort to deviate from the usual structure of corridors and wide open spaces.</p>
<p>Whilst the overall look of everything — from the world map presented on a Purah Pad to the vistas you'll pass by as you scrap — is perfect, the ebb and flow of charging from one scrap to the next is still as basic and repetitive as it ever was beneath the fancy set-dressing.</p>
<figure><a title="Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment Review - Screenshot 10 of 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160023/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Map design niggles aside, though, it really is hard to find fault otherwise. Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment gives us a canonical prequel packed to the rafters with slick action, some great story stuff for the fans, and surprises, cameos, and fun around every corner. Once the campaign is done, there's lots to dig into, too, and the devs ensure plenty of replayability thanks to built-in achievements and harder difficulties that really up the ante and force you to play more cleverly.</p>
<p>I won't/can't go into the Mysterious Construct character and their Korok pal (even though they are easily the coolest part of the trailers) - you're just gonna have to find out for yourself. I also won't/can't go into any spoilers on the roster. What I will say is that you won't be disappointed. The whole thing absolutely belongs, and feels as though it belongs, in terms of its polish and presentation, as part of the series proper.</p>
<p>Considering the series in question is one of the greatest of all time, that's quite the accomplishment. The best musou game out of Koei Tecmo thus far, then? You betcha.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment is a stunning slice of action, and my favourite musou game so far. Lessons have been learned from both Hyrule Warriors and Age of Calamity, resulting in a game that balances big-time story with top-notch combat that's got proper depth to it.</p>
<p>With Zonai devices to play with, a cracking roster, tons of sexy Sync Strikes to pull off, and a ludicrously slick recreation of early Hyrule to set about kicking ass in, this is dream time for hack-and-slash fans and Zelda enthusiasts alike. Yes, map layouts are still a bit bland, and co-op mode is 30fps, but everything else here combines to make for the best entry in this spin-off franchise to date.</p></section>

			<p>Hyrule Warriors has grown from a spinoff to a full-fledged series in its own right relatively quickly, with the soon-to-be-released <a href="https://wccftech.com/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-release-date-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> being the third Zelda-themed Musou game to arrive in roughly a decade. Age of Imprisonment once again serves up a hearty helping of Dynasty-Warriors-style hack ‘n’ slash action while promising to fill in some key details of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>’s backstory.</p>



<p>Is Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment a smashing good time? Or can you safely pass on this particular prequel? Time to wade into the fray.</p>

<p>The previous entry in this series, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity-not-exactly-next-gen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity</a>, also made lofty promises about filling in the backstory of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, with some fans ultimately feeling disappointed when it turned out the game was really more of a reality-hopping multiverse tale than a simple prequel. Thankfully, those looking for a story that builds on The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom in a more straightforward way will find Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment a much more traditional prequel. No alternate timeline shenanigans here.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The events of Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment are set in motion when Zelda is sent hurtling back in time at the beginning of Tears of the Kingdom. Our time-displaced princess is soon discovered by Rauru and Sonia, the ancient King and Queen of Hyrule, who kindly take Zelda in while she tries to figure out this whole time travel thing. At the same time, our old friend Ganondorf is plotting, and while Zelda warns about the danger he’ll become, Rauru’s ego convinces him he can contain the villain, which results in (SPOILERS for something already revealed in Tears of the Kingdom) the loss of both Rauru’s kingdom and his wife.</p>



<p>While this is happening, we also meet a pair of new characters: a Mysterious Construct who bears a striking resemblance to Link and his Korok sidekick, Calamo. As these things tend to go, an evil mirror construct brought to life by Ganondorf’s power has also been set loose on the world. While this Mystery Construct clearly serves the functional purpose of adding a Link-like fighter to a game without messing up the timeline, Age of Imprisonment actually manages to build some sense of mystery and drama surrounding this construct, and while I won't spoil it, the hows and whys of his existence actually make a decent amount of sense.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Following this initial setup, we see Rauru, Zelda, and their allies, and the Mysterious Construct, Calamo, and their allies, battle Ganondorf’s forces on various fronts, both separately and together. This story is well-told through often meaty cutscenes, which don't shy away from the character-driven emotional beats that Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom largely avoided. Characters really only presented as archetypes in previous Zelda games are properly fleshed out here — I was particularly happy to see Ganondorf actually getting a legitimate turn as a villain in this game after being reduced to a vaguely-defined evil force in Breath of the Wild and spending most of his time hiding in a hole in Tears of the Kingdom. This all builds to one of the most satisfying finales to a Zelda game in quite some time.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As for what happens between the cutscenes, those who played Age of Calamity, or really any of Koei Tecmo’s Warriors games (also referred to as “Musou” games by fans), will know what to expect here in broad terms. This is yet another Warriors-style hack ‘n’ slash with players mowing through literally thousands of Moblins, Lizalfos, and other pawns, as well as more challenging minibosses and bosses. That said, while Age of Imprisonment generally sticks to the Musou blueprint, some tweaks have been made to set this game apart.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As in all Warriors games, players can pull off combos using the Y and X buttons, but this time around each character also gains access to various Unique Skills, which can be triggered instantly by pressing the R button in conjunction with one of the face buttons. Typically, each characters Uniques include anti-air, anti-rush, and shield-breaker attacks, which lends the game an additional small measure of strategy.</p>



<p>Players can also now wield a variety of Zonai devices, many of which inflict some sort of elemental damage (fire, ice, electricity, etc.) which can be used to counteract enemies of the opposing type. Once unlocked, Zonai devices can be shared between multiple characters and their effects can interact with each other and other attacks, with, say, electricity and wind combining to create a lightning-charged cyclone. While you don't actually need to get too fancy with Zonai devices to win most battles, there are some interesting synergies that can be created with them.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Ultimately, though, teamwork is the core focus of Age of Imprisonment’s combat. Past systems, like the Rune abilities from Age of Calamity, have been cut, with the new big moves that can change the course of a battle being Sync Strikes which see you and your teammates combine forces to unleash powerful and distinctive attacks. Sync Strikes are flashy and fun, and it’s really quite impressive that there are individual combo attacks for nearly every character combination in the game, considering the roster is nearly 30 fighters strong.</p>



<p>Beyond the Sync Strikes, Age of Imprisonment just generally encourages frequent character switching. Unique Skills are on a cooldown timer, so it's often a good idea to switch characters on the fly if they happen to have, for instance, a needed anti-air attack ready to go (you also get big bonus damage if you change to another character at key moments). Of course, all of this can be done with a friend via local co-op with GameShare, allowing someone to join in on a second Switch (or even an original Switch), even if they don't own the game. While my ability to test out co-op was limited, performance felt much more consistent than Age of Calamity on Switch 1.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Age of Imprisonment is an across-the-board technical step up from Age of Calamity, which often felt like it was pushing the Switch 1 to its breaking point (and beyond). While Age of Imprisonment isn’t always a looker from an artistic standpoint, it pushes <em>a lot</em> of stuff on screen (much more than Age of Calamity at its peak) and does so at a mostly-smooth 60fps, only faltering occasionally during particularly crowded, effects-laden battles. More aesthetically pleasing are the game’s many prerendered cutscenes (story bits regularly run for 10 minutes or more at a time), which are well-directed and appropriately flashy, although as best as I can tell, they seem to run at only 30fps, something that sticks out when they appear alongside 60fps gameplay.</p>



<p>So, Age of Imprisonment’s combat feels and looks nice, which is a good thing, because you’re not going to derive much excitement from the game’s level design. If anything, things have been simplified this time around, with some of the basic exploration and puzzle elements found in Age of Calamity now gone. Most stages are just a series of narrow corridors connecting battle arenas together and mission design follows a very predictable formula -- smash enemies to free bases, set up camp there to heal your party, then move on until you face some sort of boss.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Granted, said bosses can pose a fairly solid challenge and, much to my surprise, Age of Imprisonment also throws in some Star-Fox-style on-rails shooting segments that see the Mysterious Construct transform into a magic-powered jet to take down enemies. So, there is some variety here, but there's no denying that the game can feel somewhat one-dimensional at times. While I never had a bad time playing Age of Imprisonment, it was usually the story that was compelling me onward, rather than the gameplay.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>But hey, if you enjoy smashing things, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment serves up a hell of a lot of things to smash. While the core campaign is perhaps a bit short by Warriors' standards, lasting around 12 to 15 hours, there's <em>a lot</em> of extra stuff to do (the mission selection map is littered with enough icons to make Ubisoft blush). Those looking to fit it all in may find themselves wishing for time travel powers of their own.</p>

				<p>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment does a lot to address the story and technical shortcomings that held back its predecessors while making some modest yet welcome tweaks to the series’ combat. Age of Imprisonment remains relatively shallow compared to core Zelda games, but that’s largely inherent to the Musou genre, and those happy to bliss out while bashing Bokoblins will find a well-told tale worth tussling with long term.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Power outages always seem to happen at the worst time—during a winter storm when you need your heat, in the middle of cooking dinner, or right when you’re on an important video call. The problem is solved with gas generators but includes exhaust fumes, constant noise, and the hassle of storing fuel. Portable power stations give you clean backup power without the headaches, and the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5131/">EcoFlow Delta 3 Classic just dropped to $399 from $599 on Amazon</a>. This thing pumps out <strong>1800W with a 1024Wh LiFePO4 battery that lasts over a decade</strong>, charges from empty to 80% in 45 minutes, and kicks in automatically in under 10 milliseconds when the grid goes down. You’re basically getting backup power that costs less than a decent budget gas generator but works indoors, runs silently and doesn’t require you to drag out gas cans every time the lights flicker.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5131/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Real Power for the Devices You Need</h2>
<p>The 1800W continuous output handles most household essentials. Your refrigerator keeps running during an outage so you don’t lose a freezer full of food; your space heater keeps one room comfortable when the furnace goes down, and you can make coffee with an electric kettle or run a microwave to warm up meals. The 3600W surge capacity covers those brief power spikes when devices first turn on, like when your fridge compressor kicks in or you fire up a power tool. EcoFlow’s X-Boost technology even pushes the system up to 2600W for heavier loads and opens possibilities for running larger appliances that might trip smaller power stations.</p>
<p>That 1024Wh capacity translates into very real-world runtime that actually matters: You can run a modern refrigerator for about 12 hours, keep a laptop charged through multiple work sessions, power LED lights for days, or run a CPAP machine through several nights of sleep. Winter camping or RV trips become way more comfortable when you can run an electric blanket, charge multiple devices and still have power left for morning coffee.</p>



<p>X-Stream fast charging fills the battery from 0 to 80% in just 45 minutes, meaning you are not waiting all day for it to be ready. Most portable power stations take four to six hours to reach a full charge, so shaving that time down makes a huge difference when you need backup power in a hurry. The UPS function-all under 10 milliseconds-switches automatically to battery power the instant it detects an outage to protect computers, routers, medical equipment, or anything else that can’t handle sudden power loss.</p>



<p>The battery chemistry LiFePO4 lasts more than 10 years with daily use, which is in another league compared to the cheaper lithium batteries that degrade after a couple of years. EcoFlow uses the same EV-grade battery design utilized in electric cars, and a smart Battery Management System prevents overcharging, overheating, and other issues that prematurely kill batteries. You invest in something that works reliably year after year instead of replacing it every few seasons. The system remains safe at extreme temperatures, handles the stress of frequent charging cycles, and maintains consistent power output even while aging.</p>
<p>At $399, you’re getting emergency backup power, camping comfort, and energy independence for less than most people spend on a basic gas generator that sits in the garage leaking fumes.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pioner-open-beta-fallout-live-now/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-like-mmo-%E2%80%98pioner%E2%80%99-launches-open-beta-on-steam.1343116/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>PIONER is an ambitious, post-apocalyptic MMO FPS that fuses PvE and PvP mechanics, crafting, and customization to bring players a memorable experience that’s just a <strong>bit </strong>reminiscent of other games. It has been compared to a combination of Escape from Tarkov and Fallout in the past, and it’s easy to see why.</p>



<p>In PIONER, players contend with a grim, desolate world teeming with threats, all while exploring an immersive story that promises to offer stacks of opportunities to dig into the game’s ecosystem. The developer, GFA Games, has just announced that PIONER’s open beta is available now, exclusively on Steam.</p>



<h2 id="h-pioner-s-open-beta-is-live-now">PIONER’s Open Beta is Live Now</h2>



<p>If you want to sample all the dark, destructive things that PIONER has to offer, you’ll want to jump in now and explore the open beta, available on Steam until November 11.</p>



<p>In a press release, the team at GFA Games said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Players can now explore the dangerous and mysterious Tartarus Island and experience the game for free ahead of its full release, planned for late 2025. This is the next step in the ongoing development of this highly anticipated title, following a series of successful closed beta tests to which selected players have been invited over the past few weeks.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>GFA Games is a Serbian studio made up of developers who formerly worked on games like STALKER and Atomic Heart.</p>



<p>PIONER’s open beta will offer around 30 hours of content, including the first five acts of the story campaign, which will give players the lay of the land when it comes to factions, points of interest, and more. There’s a hefty PvE raid available, as well as a PvP deathmatch portion for the players who want an added challenge.</p>



<p>Players can explore three huge missions, taking on a world boss and getting a taste of the full scope of PIONER.</p>



<p>PIONER is set to be released later this year, but doesn’t have a confirmed date at present. It’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3105890/PIONER/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">coming to Steam</a> first, but GFA Games has promised that console versions are coming later.</p>

                <p>A new study has revealed its findings on the carbon footprint of physical video games, and unsurprisingly, digitally downloaded games are considered to be more environmentally friendly in comparison to physical. French carbon-accounting firm Greenly studied the environmental impact of various systems and the production of video games, finding that physical copies of games are "100 times more carbon-intensive" than their digital counterparts.</p><p>According to Greenly, the manufacturing and transportation of physical games--with 1 million discs being used as an example--could produce 312 tons of carbon dioxide, while 1 million downloads of the same game--if it were 70GB in size--would equal three tons of carbon dioxide emissions.</p><p>"Although cloud-based gaming can be detrimental as a result of its need for continuous access to energy-hungry data servers, we also cannot neglect the continued impact of manufacturing and packaging physical video games," study author Stephanie Safdie explained to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/manufacture-and-shipping-of-physical-games-is-100-times-more-carbon-intensive-than-digital-new-study-finds" rel="nofollow ">GamesIndustry.biz</a>. "Ultimately, downloading a digital copy imposes emissions linked to electricity use at home, as well as the energy use of the concerned data center--but it does not have the same impact as the emissions created by the industry in terms of landfill and excessive waste, which are primarily still accounted for by physical consoles and hard disc copies of games."</p><p>Ultimately, the production of a physical game disc involves the extraction of rare earth metals and the production of plastic, which in turn requires the usage of machines, processes, and labor that contribute to the drain on resources. This includes the manufacturing of consoles, with Greenly estimating that these devices consume 3.9 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity a year in the US and are responsible for the production of 1.6 million metric tons of CO2e (Carbon Dioxide equivalent). Factor in television sets also running on electricity, and the ultimate impact of gaming across traditional consoles, mobile devices, and cloud gaming is significant.</p><p>So what's an environmentally conscious gamer supposed to do? Greenly found that handheld systems produce far fewer emissions--13.8kg CO2e per year with the Switch, for example--and the firm also suggested that companies look at methods to reduce their overall energy consumption.</p><p>This has been an area where <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-series-x-energy-saving-graphics-modes-reportedly-being-explored-by-microsoft/1100-6508943/">Microsoft has been heavily focused</a> with its use of recycled materials and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-series-x-s-consoles-can-now-download-updates-in-energy-saver-mode/1100-6501492/">energy-saving power modes</a>.</p>

            <p>Auroch Digital has just announced Warhammer Survivors, a new Rogue-Like Survivors game created with the blessing of both Warhammer and Poncle (Vampire Survivors). It's set to release sometime in 2026.</p>
<p>The game, much like Vampire Survivors, will feature endless hordes of Warhammer enemies, which you must take down with a variety of weapons and playable characters. You'll be able to choose between the grimdark universe of Warhammer 40k, or the fantastical Warhammer: Age of Sigmar, each with their own unlocks to pursue.</p>
<p>40K characters revealed include Malum Caedo from another beloved Auroch Digital Warhammer game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warhammer-40000-boltgun">Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</a>. There's also Cadian soldier Trooper Kozlowski, as well as Space Marine Intercessor Brother Luca. Warhammer: Age of Sigmar fans can look forward to playing Neave Blacktalon, Gotrek Gurnisson, and Sharynn Azurwrath.</p>

<p>There are some fun Easter eggs in there too for Warhammer fans, including Nuln Oil paint (a trusty Warhammer shade paint handy for pretty much everything) which will seemingly be an item you can use to fend off encroaching enemies. There's apparently going to be a vast roster of similar treats for fans of the franchise, so keep an eye out.</p><p>The game is available on Steam, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3669620/Warhammer_Survivors/">and can be wishlisted now</a>. There's no word on when exactly in 2026 it'll be released, but more announcements regarding Warhammer Survivors are on the way, so it's certainly worth keeping tabs on in the coming months.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Following a successful final beta event, Embark's ARC Raiders launched to excellent initial figures, <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-surpasses-200k-concurrent-players-on-steam-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">easily surpassing the concurrent user peak reached by the studio's previous game</a>, The Finals, which is even more impressive given that the latter is a free-to-play game, whereas the former is not.</p>



<p>This past weekend, the third-person PvPvE extraction shooter even surpassed that peak, settling around 354K concurrent players two days ago, an absolutely respectable figure that currently places the game at the 38th spot in Steam's all-time chart.</p>



<p>What really matters to game developers is sales, though, and there's good news on that front, too. According to estimates based on SteamDB data, ARC Raiders might have already sold between 1.6 million units (as estimated by <a href="https://gamalytic.com/game/1808500?utm_source=SteamDB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamalytic</a>) and 1.9 million units (as tracked by <a href="https://vginsights.com/game/1808500?utm_source=SteamDB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VG Insights</a> and <a href="https://playtracker.net/insight/game/119059?utm_source=SteamDB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayTracker</a>). Considering that the game is also available on the Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, it's not inconceivable that it might have sold close to three million units by now in total. Sure, the $40 budget price helps, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-sold-over-7-million-units-3-days-biggest-franchise-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many shooter fans had already spent $70 on Battlefield 6 a couple of weeks ago</a>, and yet they deemed it worth spending more money on this one as well.</p>



<p>While we wait for official sales figures from Embark, the studio has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/embark-studios-arc-raiders-2025-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared</a> the post-launch roadmap for ARC Raiders. Later this month, players can look forward to a new map called Stella Montis, new Quests and gameplay items, new Arc machines (Matriarch and Shredder), and a community unlock event. In December, the developers will introduce more Quests, a new Raider deck, the Snowfall map condition, an event titled 'Flickering Flames', and the Expedition departure window. Other ongoing improvements without a specific timeframe include new feats and trials, more map conditions, cosmetics, and quality of life updates.</p>

              <p>Nintendo has announced that its brand new console, the Switch 2, has now sold over 10 million units in the first four months on sale. That makes it the most successful console launch ever by quite some margin. And the two flagship games,&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em> and&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, each have their own extraordinary figures to boast of.</p> <p>The Switch 2, launched June 5 after a peculiar and obfuscated build-up, went on to <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-sales-fastest-selling-console-ever-1851784293">sell an extraordinary 3.5 million units</a> in just its first four days on sale. Now, obviously that number includes <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-preorder-walmart-target-best-buy-nintendo-1851777604">pre-orders that built up rather chaotically from April</a>, on top of post-launch sales in the opening days, so it was always going to be the most dramatic number. At the start of August, Nintendo revealed things were still going extremely well, with <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-sales-figures-2000614194">a total of six million Switch 2s sold in its first month</a>. While numbers from rival console manufacturers are often more hazy, this fully confirms the hybrid gaming device as the most successful console launch ever, dwarfing the already impressive numbers of the original Switch, and beating the PS5 to 10 million sales by a full four months. Which is to say, the Switch 2 has sold twice as fast as Sony’s behemoth.</p>

 <p>Come <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251104e.pdf">the latest financial filings from Nintendo</a>, noting sales up to the end of September, the company reports that by September 30 it had sold a total of 10.36 million Switch 2s. Which is astonishing.</p> <p>Meanwhile,&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em> has nearly doubled its sales since its first month, with a total of 9.57 million copies sold (and that’s actually <em>sold</em>, rather than just shipped), while July 17’s <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> has shifted 3.49 million carts.</p>

 <p>All these massive numbers have given Nintendo cause to <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251104_2e.pdf">increase its sales expectations for the end of the financial year</a>. It was originally banking on 15 million Switch 2s sold by the spring, but that hope has now been raised to 19 million. Even this may still be a cautious under-estimation, given we’re just now entering the holiday season—a time period most rival consoles deliberately launch directly into. On top of that, the Switch 2 has already sold for two more months after these reported numbers, and with <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-sales-stock-holiday-price-tariff-2000636565">Nintendo’s plan to flood the stores with stock for Christmas</a>, “only” another 8.5 million units by March 2026 could easily be reached.</p> <p>Nintendo also announced that it has sold 1.89 million more original Switches in the same time period, and made a mind-blowing 61.56 million software sales across those six months. The Switch 2, with its far smaller user-base, still sold 20.62 million games, although as you will note, three fifths of that is made up of two games!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Clears Out This 20,000mAh 87W 3-Port Power Bank, Now Selling for Pennies]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-clears-out-this-20000mah-87w-3-port-power-bank-now-selling-for-pennies-2000641031</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-clears-out-this-20-000mah-87w-3-port-power-bank-now-selling-for-pennies.1343083/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>You know that sinking feeling when your phone hits 10% battery and you’re nowhere near an outlet? Or when you’re at the airport and every charging station is packed with people camping around power strips? A good power bank solves that problem but most of them either charge too slowly, run out of juice after one phone charge, or force you to carry a bunch of cables.</p>
<p>Anker just dropped the price on their <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5324/">20,000mAh power bank with a built-in USB-C cable down to $44 from the usual $69 on Amazon</a>. This thing <strong>pushes 87W across three devices at once</strong> and can charge a MacBook Pro to 50% in under 40 minutes.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5324/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Power That Keeps Up With Your Day</h2>
<p>That 20,000mAh capacity gives you <strong>multiple full charges for your phone</strong> or enough juice to top up a laptop when you’re working remotely and can’t find a seat near an outlet. In real terms, that’s four charges for an iPhone 17 or enough to fully charge your MacBook Air and still have juice for your phone and earbuds. The <strong>battery pack itself recharges in just 1.5 hours</strong> when you plug it into a 65W charger which means you’re not waiting around all night for it to be ready the next morning.</p>



<p>That all changes with <strong>its built-in USB-C cable</strong>: You won’t be rummaging around in your bag for the correct cable or realize it was still lying on your desk at home. Simply pull out the power bank, unwind the cable and plug in your device-done. It charges an iPhone 17 Pro to 58% in 30 minutes, or a MacBook Air to 52% over the same time, which is fast enough to get you through the rest of your workday or a particularly long flight.</p>



<p>The <strong>87W total output splits across three ports&nbsp;with a single device maxing out at 65W</strong>. That means you can fast-charge your laptop through the USB-C port while your phone and wireless earbuds charge from the other two ports at the same time. The setup works for anything: iPhones, Samsung phones, iPads, Nintendo Switch, or any USB-C device you’re carrying around.</p>
<p>Anker designed <strong>this power bank to meet airline regulations</strong> so you can toss it in your carry-on without any drama at security. The 20,000mAh capacity sits right at the limit most airlines allow and gives you maximum power without crossing into the restricted zone.</p>
<p>For $44, you’re getting a power bank that actually covers the situations where you really do need backup power: long travel days, outdoor events, working from coffee shops, or just the peace of mind that your devices won’t die when you need them most. The<strong> 18-month warranty supports it</strong>&nbsp;so if anything goes wrong, you are covered.</p>

              <p>The release calendar is finally dying down a bit, but only just barely. November means it’s officially <em>Call of Duty</em> season, but there are tons of games coming out this month that aren’t called <em>Black Ops 7</em>. Switch 2 exclusives (<em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em>), neat indie RPGs (<em>Demonschool</em>), and overdue PS5 ports (<em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2</em>) abound. Here are 46 games releasing this month, complete with descriptions and trailers.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-high-spec-hp-laptop-4tb-ssd-64gb-ram-is-70-off-and-selling-for-pennies-amazon-clears-final-stock-2000641026</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-high-spec-hp-laptop-4tb-ssd-64gb-ram-is-70-off-and-selling-for-pennies-amazon-clears-final-stock.1343065/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Laptops with serious power usually carry a price tag equal to a small fortune. You know how it goes: you look at the specs you actually need, check the price, and immediately start compromising. Maybe you don’t really need that much storage, right? Well, HP just threw an early Black Friday sale on Amazon that changes the game completely. This <strong>17.3-inch laptop comes with 64GB of RAM, a 4TB SSD, and an AMD Ryzen 5 processor</strong>-basically the kind of setup that normally runs close to $4,000. The good new is that right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5323/">it’s sitting at $1,199 after a 70% discount</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5323/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The <strong>17.3-inch touchscreen gives you breathing room</strong> that smaller laptops just can’t match: If you have ever tried to work on a 13-inch screen and felt you were playing Tetris with your windows, you will appreciate the reason size matters in this respect. The HD+ anti-glare panel means you can set up near a window without spending half your day adjusting the angle of the screen so that you can actually see what you’re doing. The touchscreen aspect really does speed things up when scrolling through long documents or just generally navigating about<strong> Windows 11 Pro</strong>.</p>
<h2>Specs That Matter in Real Life</h2>
<p>The Ryzen 5 7430U processor <strong>runs 6 cores and 12 threads and hits speeds up to 4.3GHz</strong> when you need it. In plain English, this means you can video call your team while updating a presentation with Slack pinging in the background and your music playing without your laptop freezing up or fans screaming like a jet engine. The integrated Radeon Graphics handle streaming and everyday visual tasks without breaking a sweat. It’s not a gaming rig, but it covers everything most people actually do on their computers day in and day out.</p>



<p>But here’s where it gets interesting: 64GB of RAM is absurd for most laptops and that is precisely why it’s so great. Most computers ship with 8GB or maybe 16GB, which forces you into this constant dance of closing programs to free up memory. With 64GB, you just stop thinking about it: Keep your email open all week, run that resource-hungry video editing software, open 50 browser tabs for your research project and the laptop just handles it.</p>
<p>The 4TB SSD storage means you are done with that “delete old files to install new programs” routine. Your whole photo collection from the last decade, work projects, personal files, software and backups can all live on one drive. And SSDs load everything faster than old hard drives so your programs open in seconds instead of you watching that spinning wheel for what feels like forever.</p>



<p>In Windows 11 Pro, there is Microsoft Copilot, the AI tool that helps draft emails, summarize long documents, or even brainstorm ideas when you’re stuck. Built-in AI image features let you edit photos without downloading extra software. Windows Hello logs you in via facial recognition which means no more typing passwords every time you open your laptop.</p>
<p>At $1,199 for this configuration, you’re getting a laptop that doesn’t force you to choose between the features you want versus the ones you can afford.</p>

Squires, who only became director of the USPTO in September, has personally ordered a reexamination after he "determined that substantial new questions of patentability have arisen" to certain claims made by the patent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's Squires' description of the claims in question:</p><blockquote>"The '397 patent issued with claims drawn to controlling the movement of a player character in a field of a virtual space, causing a sub character to appear in the field, controlling a battle in a manual mode when an enemy character is present in the location the sub character has appeared, and when an enemy character is not present in the location the sub character has appeared, automatically moving the sub character, and controlling a battle in an automatic mode when an enemy character is placed at a designated location."</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">In his order, Squires pointed to two older U.S. patent applications — one filed by Konami in 2002, the other by Nintendo itself in 2019 — as “prior art” references. Both, Squires said, would be “important in deciding whether the claims are patentable,” and each “raises a substantial new question of patentability.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mueller, writing for Games Fray, said Squires' order was down to the “public outrage” at the award of the patent, and concerns about the reputation of the U.S. patent system as a whole. While this reexamination isn’t a revocation order, Mueller insisted it is now “highly likely” that the USPTO will revoke Nintendo’s ‘397 patent. Nintendo has two months to respond.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Pokémon Spin-off Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What does this mean for Nintendo and The Pokémon Company’s high-profile legal battle with Pocketpair over Palworld? Mueller said it “further undermines the credibility” of Nintendo’s patent assertions against Pocketpair's game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the latest legal blow for Nintendo in its battle against Palworld. Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-companys-monster-capture-patent-rejected-may-signal-problems-for-their-palworld-lawsuit">one of the Nintendo patents related to its monster capture patents filed last year</a><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-companys-monster-capture-patent-rejected-may-signal-problems-for-their-palworld-lawsuit"> was rejected by the Japan Patent Office (JPO) for lacking originality</a>. The office’s reasoning for the rejection made reference to older games with similar mechanics that were released even before 2021, including ARK (released in 2015), Monster Hunter 4 (2013), and Japanese browser game Kantai Collection (also 2013). Ironically, Pocketpair’s Craftopia (2020) and Niantic’s Pokémon Go (2016) were among other examples of games that were used to argue that the patent lacks originality.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The case involves <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20241108" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>three main patents</u></a> granted by the JPO: two related to monster capture and release, and one related to riding characters. All three patents were filed in 2024, after Palworld came out. However, they are actually derived from earlier Nintendo patents dating from 2021. In other words, it seems that once Palworld came on the scene, Nintendo filed divisional patents that were geared to fight specifically against Palworld’s alleged infringement of the original patents.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, Pocketpair <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20250508" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>has made changes</u></a> to Palworld’s disputed mechanics. The November 2024 patch removed the ability to summon Pals by throwing Pokéball-like Pal Spheres (now Pals just materialize next to you when summoned). In May this year, another Palworld update changed how you can glide in the game — instead of directly grabbing onto Glider Pals, now you just simply use Pal-buffed Glider equipment. The case has rumbled on, with Nintendo even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-rewrites-patent-mid-case-in-ongoing-lawsuit-against-palworld-dev-pocketpair-but-why?_gl=1*9gbndy*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTEzNjgzNTkxNi4xNzYxODIzODEz*_ga_4L6HY9G8XE*czE3NjE4MjM4MTQkbzEkZzAkdDE3NjE4MjM4MTQkajYwJGwwJGgw"><u>rewriting a mount-related patent mid-lawsuit</u></a>, and arguing that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-says-mods-dont-count-as-prior-art-as-theyre-not-full-games-attempting-to-sway-judge-in-palworld-lawsuit"><u>mods should not count as prior art</u></a>.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/04/gettyimages-2174642895-1762250885224.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pocketpair is soldiering on with Palworld development despite the Nintendo lawsuit.

Mueller said there may not be any further developments this calendar year relating to Nintendo’s lawsuit against Pocketpair or patents that are related to it. But decisions are expected next year. All eyes will be on Presiding Judge Motoyuki Nakashima, who leads the patent division of the Tokyo District Court. “It is ever more likely that Nintendo will lose,” Mueller said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the Game Developers Conference (GDC) in March, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-communications-director-speaks-on-generative-ai-controversy-online-struggles-and-why-palworld-is-misunderstood"><u>IGN sat down for an extended conversation with John “Bucky” Buckley, communications director and publishing manager for Palworld developer Pocketpair</u></a>. We spoke following his talk at the conference, 'Community Management Summit: A Palworld Roller Coaster: Surviving the Drop.' During that talk, Buckley went into candid detail about a number of Palworld’s struggles, especially the accusations of it using generative AI (which Pocketpair has since debunked pretty soundly) and stealing Pokemon’s models for its own Pals (a claim that the person who originally made it has since retracted). He <a href="https://www.vg247.com/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit-shock-to-pocketpair-no-one-considered-patent-infringement" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>even commented</u></a> a bit on Nintendo’s patent infringement lawsuit against the studio, saying it “came as a shock” to the studio and was “something that no one even considered.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-capcom-designer-yoshiki-okamoto-sparks-backlash-in-japan-by-saying-palworld-has-crossed-a-line-that-should-not-be-crossed"><u>former Capcom game developer Yoshiki Okamoto issued comments seemingly against Pocketpair and Palworld in the legal battle</u></a>, sparking a backlash from viewers.

It now expects to shift 19 million units of its new console before the end of March 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To put Switch 2's success into perspective, Nintendo has doubled the launch sales of Switch 1 (which sold 4.7 million units in its first six months back in 2017) and is also well ahead of the PlayStation 5's own impressive arrival (which sold 7.8 million units back in November 2020, though was limited by stock availability).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, the Switch 2's flagship launch game, has now sold 9.57 million copies, with 8.1 million units of that total from the console's bundle. (So yes, more than a million people paid $80 to buy it separately.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo's second biggest Switch 2 title, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, has notched up 3.49 million sales since its July debut. Super Mario Party Jamboree — Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, meanwhile, has sold 1.16 million copies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's no word in today's data on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a>, which launched too recently to be included.

But can the aging console shift another six million units to finally dethrone the best-selling console ever, PlayStation 2? Nintendo says it expects Switch 1 to have reached a lifetime total of 156 million by the end of March 2026, so it will come close.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
