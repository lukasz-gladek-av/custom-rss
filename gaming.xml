<figure><a title="Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157316/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>I have to admit, I was really nervous about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4</a>. I played the first ‘<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tony_hawks_pro_skater_1_plus_2">1 + 2</a>’ collection back in 2021 and absolutely loved it, but my early teenage years were shaped by the Birdman’s third and fourth console outings. So to say that a lot was riding on Iron Galaxy’s remake would be an understatement, and early concerns regarding THPS4’s shift in structure definitely rattled me.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I can wholeheartedly say that this latest nostalgic revisit to what I would argue was the peak of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-tony-hawk-games-of-all-time">the Tony Hawk’s series</a> is a success – albeit with a few caveats.</p>
<p>So let’s start with the pink elephant in the room. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/tony_hawks_pro_skater_4">Pro Skater 4</a> has been drastically altered to fit more in line with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/tony_hawks_pro_skater_3">Pro Skater 3</a> (and THPS1 + 2, for that matter). So instead of roaming about each level at your own pace and triggering missions by speaking with the local citizens, you’re instead racing against the two-minute clock, with missions completed organically as you make your way around.</p>
<figure><a title="Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157319/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s a bitter pill to swallow for veterans hoping for a more 1:1 remake of the original, but I have to admit that it still works pretty well as is. Yes, the levels in THPS4 are much larger than those that came before, and so tasks like collecting the S-K-A-T-E letters might prove more difficult with the ticking clock. But having the entry align more closely with the third <em>does</em> make for a more cohesive experience; one I’m certain newcomers will appreciate.</p>
<p>Speaking of cohesion, despite development moving from the now-defunct Vicarious Visions to Iron Galaxy, THPS3+4 feels instantly familiar to those who played the original games and the 2021 remake of 1 + 2. It plays exactly how you’d want, with slick, responsive controls, outrageously over-the-top combos, and heaps of potential when it comes to player and board customisation.</p>
<p>You’ve got a really solid selection of skaters to choose from, including Hawk himself, Zion Wright, Chloe Covell, and more. Unlockable characters include Bam Margera and <strong>TMNT</strong>’s Michelangelo, while if you opt for the Digital Deluxe Edition, you can also play as <strong>DOOM</strong> Slayer and the Revenant, with additional bonus music tracks included.</p>

<p>Each skater has various advantages and disadvantages, but by collecting stat points hidden around each level, you can boost everything from speed to lip balance. The good news is that if you switch skaters, you can immediately apply all stat points previously collected, so there’s no need to go through the motions again and again.</p>
<p>As for the levels themselves, they’ve been absolutely wonderfully recreated. Unlike the first two entries, 3 + 4 really leans into the whole <strong>MTV</strong> / <strong>Jackass</strong> influence and includes some truly ridiculous missions that make use of the additional NPC characters located throughout each stage. So, you can ‘Bury the Bully’ in Canada, ‘Stop the Pickpockets’ in Airport, and ‘Photobomb the Tourists’ in Alcatraz. Some missions have been altered somewhat, so don’t expect to see Ollie the Bum hallucinating pink elephants. They’re still around, but the context has been switched up a bit.</p>

<p>In addition to the familiar favourites, Iron Galaxy has also seen fit to create a few new tracks of its own, and I’ll be honest, they’re <em>awesome</em>. Waterpark in particular is a true highlight, with the myriad waterslides and empty pools making for a proper skateboarding playground begging to be combo’d into oblivion. It gives me hope that Activision could soon green-light a brand new Tony Hawk’s game, but I’m not going to hold my breath.</p>
<p>One thing I do want to call out, however, is the music. And to be clear, the soundtrack here is <em>banging</em>; really good stuff. You’ve got Iron Maiden’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qbRHY1l0vc"><strong>2 Minutes to Midnight</strong></a>, Sex Pistols <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ah1JM9mf60"><strong>Holidays in the Sun</strong></a>, Mastodon’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv_QcNplLxM"><strong>Precious Stones</strong></a>, and <em>so</em> much more. The problem, however, is that music is a powerful source of nostalgia, and the majority of the originals’ tunes have been left out, with only six tracks represented from THPS3, and four from THPS4.</p>
<p>I want to reiterate that the soundtrack is really rather good, and ultimately many newcomers will discover some life-long favourites here, just like I did back in the early 2000s. But why couldn’t Iron Galaxy appeal to both crowds? I broke into a massive stupid grin when Bodyjar’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18P614-bnS4"><strong>Not the Same</strong></a> kicked in for the first time, and I just wish that the collection included a few more nostalgic hits.</p>
<p>Moving onto multiplayer, you’ve got a few options to keep you busy once you’re done with the single-player portion. One of the highlights is the new ‘HAWK’ mode, which sees you hide H-A-W-K letters around levels before riding around to locate your opponent’s letters. It’s a cool little mode, and it’s nice to see something that’s not just 'see who can score the most points'.</p>

<p>That said, while multiplayer works well, actually finding a match can take a little while. It’s early days, in one sense, but if the game’s struggling to find matches at launch, then I dread to think what it might be like in a year or two.</p>
<p>In addition to the standard multiplayer, you’ve also got the Create-A-Park mode. Here, you can try out custom parks from a hefty selection, though it’s safe to say that some of the early designs leave a bit to be desired. Heck, I can’t talk, I wouldn’t be able to do much better, but I’m definitely looking forward to seeing a few creations that don’t just rely on silly gimmicks.</p>
<p>The actual creation tool is pretty fun and intuitive, with assets selected with the D-pad and placed on the ground with the analogue sticks. You can rotate pieces, zoom in, pan the camera around – all sorts. It’s a neat little tool if you’ve got a flair for park creation, but ultimately I can’t see myself using it that much.</p>

<p>Finally, looking at how the game runs on Switch 2, I’m mostly very impressed. In handheld mode, there can be a little bit of aliasing, but by and large the game is remarkably on par with the likes of the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, hitting what feels like a solid 60fps with some gorgeous reflection technology on display with puddles.</p>
<p>The lighting looks great in levels like Tokyo and Foundry, and pop-in is thankfully kept at a minimum. Some of the NPC characters can look a little goofy at times, sure, but if anything, this felt like a callback to the original games. That’s my excuse at least – deal with it.</p>
<p>Finally, you can view some of the scenery with the game's photo mode, which works really well and adds in a number of cool little filters and effects for good measure.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 is another welcome return to the franchise's glory days, presenting the third and fourth entries with revamped visuals across the board while retaining the same slick gameplay. Some folks might be unable to get over the structural changes to Pro Skater 4, and I have to admit to being a little disappointed at the lack of classic music tracks, but overall, the positives absolutely outweigh the negatives.</p>
<p>If you're looking to inject a hefty dose of nostalgia into your life, or you simply want to see what the Tony Hawk series was like at its absolute peak, then this should prove a fine addition to your Switch 2 library.</p></section>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/datamine-leak-points-to-ea-hosting-a-battlefield-6-open-beta.1241769/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Spotted by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-spotted-in-new-datamine/">Insider-Gaming</a>, a datamined leak points to EA hosting an open beta for its next entry in the Battlefield series, which we only know as Battlefield 6 for now, since its official title has yet to be revealed. </p>



<p>While datamining Battlefield Labs, the program through which EA is testing new features for the next Battlefield game and consistently playtesting the new entry, the datamining group 1BF Telegram Group found "<em>Battlefield 6 Open Beta</em>" added in the most recent update, though no further details came with the phrase. </p>



<p>It's not the biggest shock that EA would plan an open beta for its next major shooter, since that's the common pattern for how multiplayer-focused games are launched. The beta not only gives the developers a chance to stress-test the servers, it gives players a chance to get a feel for the game ahead of its proper launch. </p>



<p>We've seen a number of leaks for Battlefield 6, including videos of the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-gets-new-alpha-leak-video-of-rush-mode/">Rush Mode</a>, and footage of its <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-campaign-footage-has-leaked-online-from-the-latest-battlefield-labs-update/">campaign</a>, and EA has even <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-showcases-destruction-next-battlefield-game-and-it-looks-like-old-school-destructible-environments-back/">officially shared clips</a> from the Battlefield Labs playtests to show how development is progressing. </p>



<p>A full, proper reveal for the game is all we're missing at this point, which, according to EA, is <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-battlefield-game-will-be-revealed-this-summer-new-battlefield-and-skate-due-to-release-by-april-2026/">due to arrive sometime this summer</a>. It could be that alongside the full reveal, EA will announce the open beta and the dates it'll be live, but for now, we'll have to wait and see. </p>



<p>When the reveal does happen, hopefully, it goes well, as EA reportedly has extremely high expectations for this new shooter. A recent report pointed to <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-targeting-100-million-players/">EA executives setting a target of 100 million players</a>. It also claimed that the budget for this new game has hit an eye-watering $400 million, which at least partly explains why EA executives are hoping the game can reach such high player numbers. </p>

                <p>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 comes loaded with plenty of levels, including every stage from the original versions of both games as well as a few brand-new stages, like Movie Studio and Pinball. However, developer Iron Galaxy actually created several more levels--11, by our count--that you can find via the Create-A-Park mode.</p><p>Select Create-A-Park and you'll see a whole bunch of user-created courses. Thus far, they are ... well, they aren't good, to put it mildly. Most are simply advertising an easy way to earn a few of the game's hardest achievements, and offer little else. However, scroll down and you'll see a "Developer" section, where all the levels were designed by Iron Galaxy itself.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> You Win Some, Lose Some - Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 GameSpot Review</p>

<p>Now, to be clear, these stages lack the complexity--both visual and mechanical--of the "real" stages in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4, but their simplicity and emphasis on performing nearly impossible tricks helps to make them a good contrast after you've had your fill of the others. Iron Galaxy even put in collectables and other goals to make things more interesting, albeit ones that are fairly easy considering the small size of these stages.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4530352-thpsextrastage.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4530352" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4530352-thpsextrastage.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4530352"></a><figcaption>Skateboarding is totally legal in whatever dimension this is.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4530352-thpsextrastage.jpg"></figure><p>However, be careful not to select one stage in particular: Torment Nexus.

            <p>
Ghost Town - the spooky, 80s-set VR puzzle-adventure from the studio behind the acclaimed The Room series - is a genuine treat, and one that's poised to shake off its former Meta Quest exclusivity very soon. Developer Fireproof Games has announced Ghost Town's paranormal delights will be available on PC via Steam VR from next Tuesday, 15th July.
</p>
<p>
Ghost Town whisks players back to the London of 1983, where protagonist Edith Penrose - who runs a paranormal detective agency halfway up a South London council block with her tech savvy flatmate Rina - is attempting to find her missing brother, Adam. The ensuing urban fantasy adventure takes players first to a remote Scottish island and then around various immaculately realised London locales, which I won't spoil here.
</p>
<p>
It's fantastic stuff, full of clever puzzling, satisfyingly tactile environmental interactions (if you love The Room series, you'll feel right at home here), and just a brilliantly cinematic approach to its storytelling as Ghost Town leaps through time and its wonderfully orchestrated set-pieces. There's a bit in a lighthouse that might be one of my favourite gaming moments this year! It helps, too, that its small cast of characters is brought to life by some stellar performances.

<p>
Ghost Town originally launched for Meta Quest (amid plenty of critical acclaim) back in April, with Fireproof promising a PC VR and PSVR 2 release would follow at a later date. There's still no update on that PlayStation VR 2 version, but the studio has now confirmed Ghost Town is coming to Steam VR in just a few days time, on 15th July.
</p>
<p>
It's unclear if Ghost Town's PC release will bring any improvements to take advantage of the potentially beefier hardware at players' disposal, but I've asked Fireproof and will report back if I hear anything. Until then, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2496180/Ghost_Town/">wishlist Ghost Town now</a>, and a demo's available too.

                <p>A long-requested feature is finally sailing to Sea of Thieves, but players will have to shell out some cash to take advantage of it. Custom servers, along with other unannounced "benefits," are included in a subscription service coming to Rare's live-service pirate game in early 2026. Developers from Rare made the announcement during a Community Direct video on Wednesday.</p><p>Sea of Thieves is dependent on emergent encounters with both computer-controlled enemies and real players, both of whom can engage in hostilities with players. With custom servers, players can create their own "private customisable sandbox" with adjustable options for loot and enemy spawns. Private servers can also run "Safer Seas Fleets," allowing players to invite their friends, free of beligerent randos. Rare has not stated how much this subscription model will cost.</p><p>Rare was one of the many studios hit by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/" data-ref-id="2900-6726">massive layoffs at Microsoft</a>, which also resulted in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-a-decade-rares-everwild-canceled-as-part-of-xbox-layoffs-report/1100-6532912/" data-ref-id="1100-6532912">cancellation of the studio's project Everwild</a>. Gregg Mayles, a veteran of the company who served as the creative director for both Sea of Thieves and Everwild, reportedly departed Rare following the latter's cancellation.</p><p>The nearly hour-long Community Direct did not address the layoffs, the fate of Everwild, or Mayles' exit from the company. Instead, the video featured five members of the Sea of Thieves team addressing the health of their online game and detailing additions coming in the next several months.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKQiiI3ElkU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NKQiiI3ElkU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Rare also touched on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sea-of-thieves-season-17-introduces-smugglers-faction-and-new-weapons/1100-6532263/" data-ref-id="1100-6532263">already-announced Season 17</a>, which introduces a new faction called The Smugglers' League and additional loot to the game's sandbox. Seasons overall will have a more monthly structure, introducing new content and events every month rather than throwing everything new at the players upon the season's debut.</p><p>With Season 17 specifically, the first month will properly introduce The Smugglers' League, the second month brings a "heist" live event, and the third month will refresh the map's Skeleton Forts. The developers also briefly teased Season 18, which centers on the perilous Devil's Roar area of the game's world.</p><p>And in a move that might excite devoted players, Rare is lifting the NDA from the game's Insider Programme, which provides preview builds showcasing upcoming updates to Sea of Thieves. The developers describe the move as a "first step" in opening larger conversations with the game's community.</p><p>It's been rough waters for Rare, but the studio appears keen to reassure Sea of Thieves players that the game still has wind in its sails, hopefully for years to come.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/why-disability-journalism-in-games-needs-to-evolve-beyond-marketing.1241730/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It wasn’t all that long ago that accessibility was barely a concern for many video game companies. Some time in the past half decade or so, major publishers realized they could augment their marketing efforts with good old-fashioned back pattery, and now here we are. But there’s more to games than products and features. On the latest Aftermath Hours, we talk about the ways disability journalism surrounding games needs to evolve.&nbsp;</p><p>This time around, we’re joined by award-winning disability reporter <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/supercrip1994.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grant Stoner</a> to discuss Disability Pride Month, as well as his own <a href="https://www.ign.com/person/Hotwheels94" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">growing body of investigative work</a> in the accessibility space. Grant draws a line from the early days of companies largely ignoring accessibility-related concerns to the moment they realized such options could serve as a marketing hook – and then up to the present, which Grant argues would be better served by journalism that goes beyond praising PR-friendly features.&nbsp;</p><p>After that, we move on to the horse girl sensation that’s sweeping the nation: <em>Umamusume</em>. Chris, like the whole internet, is obsessed. He explains why this oddity speaks to him, and then we grapple with how the game’s newfound fandom has <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/racing/horse-girl-gacha-gamers-are-so-obsessed-with-pink-racer-haru-urara-that-the-farm-that-owns-the-real-life-horse-shes-based-on-who-never-won-a-single-race-had-to-respond/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">impacted real horses</a>. Finally, we decide that anyone who pastes into a document (or email or what have you) with formatting is a deviant who deserves to be confined to the deepest reaches of hell.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that Aftermath can buy a horse and then have an <em>Umamusume</em> horse girl named after it.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Grant: </strong>I think a lot of stories about advocates and consultants are usually through a positive lens. They tend to focus more on the work they do to benefit the company. I think the biggest example is <em>The Last Of Us II</em>. When that game came out, they really put their consultants on sort of a press junket where they were shopping them around to different outlets and showing the good work they did and everything.&nbsp;</p><p>We saw that again with <em>Forza Motorsport</em>, with their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7aVUqmQ_Sc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blind driving assists</a>. [Accessibility consultant] Brandon Cole, who sadly is no longer with us, and Phil Spencer and the Turn 10 team went everywhere, to every publication to talk about the work that they did and the work that [Cole] did.&nbsp;</p><p>But we rarely see what those advocates and consultants go through on a daily basis to be able to do their jobs. I think if we could humanize that, it’ll help maybe not developers and publishers, but it’ll help the community better understand what it actually takes to perform these jobs. As for what I want the industry to start doing: shift away from [only covering] studios that develop these games and create these features, because you can read those pieces everywhere. I think we should instead focus more on disabled people in the industry – whether that’s workers, players, or developers – and how they interact in this space.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>Also, a developer is not permanently good. That’s not a condition of the developer; that’s a condition of the people who’ve worked there. [A studio] could just get shitty. It’s a very real and meaningful impact that can happen.</p><p><strong>Grant:</strong> That’s what spawned <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-employees-community-members-allege-ablegamers-founder-fostered-abuse-behind-closed-doors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my AbleGamers piece</a>. The work they did there was good, but then over time it allegedly became a toxic environment that made it so that you couldn’t really highlight the good work anymore without acknowledging the harm that they were doing.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> My guess is that a lot of stories like that go unreported, especially in vulnerable communities. I think you often find a lot of abuse in vulnerable communities. Do you feel, Grant, like disabled communities are uniquely vulnerable to this type of abuse?</p><p><strong>Grant:</strong> The disability community, in my experience, we treat each other like a monolith or a family unit. And when that family unit is disrupted in any way, the disability community often struggles to accept that. Because for years, we’ve been cast aside. We’ve been not given the same space as other people. We’ve always had to fight harder than most to belong, especially in the gaming industry. So whenever stories like this highlight that there are some messed up things going on, oftentimes the community itself struggles to accept it, because we’ve conditioned ourselves to believe that we’re all one big happy family.&nbsp;</p><p>I also tend to blame marketing departments for big companies that make us feel that way. Like Xbox’s tagline “When everybody plays, we all win,” I argue that has done more harm to the greater movement because it makes us act like we’re all friends – which then allows these bad actors to come in and make victims out of the particularly vulnerable. So I think there’s different layers to why disabled people feel the way they do about these stories, but mostly it’s the fact that we struggle to have individualistic agency. We’re mostly led to believe that we’re all one big happy family and that no one would do this to us because we’re all one big happy family.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/plushie-lawsuit-emotional-support-chicken-nuggets-what-do-you-meme"><h3>Plushie Maker Suing Over ‘Emotional Support Chicken Nuggets’</h3></a><p>It’s a pretty standard copyright and trademark infringement case, despite being about stuffed chicken nuggets.</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-disability-pride-last-of-us-forza]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rimworld">RimWorld</a> is boldly going where no acclaimed sci-fi colony sim with a weird cannibalism obsession has gone before: up a bit. RimWorld is leaving the ground behind and heading into space for the first time in its new paid Odyssey expansion, which launches today on PC.
</p>
<p>
Core to Odyssey's heft of new <em>stuff</em> is the ability to built a gravship; essentially a mobile colony players can slowly expand to include the likes of living quarters, labs, workshops, and pretty much anything else they might need. Things start small, though, and initially you'll be using your gravship to explore the planet, landing anywhere you can reach in search of food, fuel, treasure, special weapons, even souvenirs such as exotic birds.
</p>
<p>
And to add some variety to your jaunts, Odyssey introduces new biomes, including the fungal glowforest, gaseous scarlands (home to mechanoids and toxic rain), the bountiful grasslands, the blizzard-ravaged glacier plains, even the molten lava fields - all making use of a new landmarks system said to 'transform' world generation with the likes of cliffs, chasms, fjords, islands, and more. And to spice things up even further, Odyssey introduces 40 new animals to tame, train, trade, or even eat, including sparrows and bluebirds, wolves and scimitar cats, seals and otters, even porcupines and prairie dogs. Oh, and there's fishing now too.

<p>
As you explore, you'll encounter trap-rigged reactors, insect-infested caves, and downed orbital platforms - all potentially home to gravcores you can use to grow your ship and travel further still. And, yes, it'll eventually be possible to leave the planet's atmosphere to start a new chapter in orbit: mining for ore on asteroids, or exploring orbital platforms and hollowed-out satellites (just watch out for scavengers). And tying this together are new multi-part quests players can pick up from ancient maps, passing visitors, and anonymous signals.

"Space is a harsh place," warns developer Ludeon Studios in its Odyssey announcement, "so build your ship to survive. Airtight walls protect your colonists and their pets from the vacuum of space. Heaters keep the interiors warm, while oxygen pumps provide life support. Build airlocks with vac barriers to prevent depressurisation of the ship, and equip spacefaring colonists with vac suits before they exit into the void."
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, there's new gear and weapons - think AI-assisted rifles and sawn-off shotguns - plus new enemies, including hunter drones, wasp drones, ancient sentries, and the cyclops mechanoid. That's all leading up to a new late-game threat in the form of the hateful mechhive. "When you reach the inhuman mind behind this terror, you face a choice," Ludeon teases. "Will you destroy it and shut down every mechanoid for good - or take control of its power?"

Odyssey - RimWorld's fifth expansion since its  release all the way back in 2013 - is available through <a href="https://rimworldgame.com/odyssey/">Ludeon's website</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3022790/RimWorld__Odyssey/">Steam</a> right now, costing £19.99/$24.99 USD. And if you've yet to pick up the base game, it's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/294100/RimWorld/">currently discounted by 20 percent</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been nearly a year and a half since we <a href="https://wccftech.com/judas-is-finally-unveiled-by-bioshock-creator-ken-levine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heard from BioShock creator Ken Levine</a>. As you're probably aware, ever since disbanding Irrational Games, he has founded a smaller studio called Ghost Story Games. For the last eight years or so, they have worked on a game that we now know to be titled <a href="https://wccftech.com/judas-announcement-trailer-bioshock-creator-ken-levine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Judas</a>, a game that is based on <a href="https://wccftech.com/ken-levines-new-game-is-small-scale-open-world-sci-fiai-themed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Levine's concept of 'narrative LEGOs'</a> to be endlessly replayable, at least in theory.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, the BioShock creator <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njzERtlBcB0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was featured in a video interview with Lawrence Sonntag from Nightdive Studios</a>. In the hour-long conversation, Levine promised that Judas would be an old-school single player games and expressed gratitude to parent company Take-Two Interactive that they weren't forced to add any live service elements with additional monetization like microtransactions.</p>



<p><em>I grew up playing single player games, and I grew up before certain types of monetization existed. And again, I'm not here at all to say this is bad or this is good, right? That's not really my thing. I know the kind of games I like to make. Judas is a very old-school game. Like, you buy the game and get the whole thing. There's no live service, because everything that we do is in service of telling the story and transporting the player somewhere. This is no diss on any developers who've done that, because look, games are expensive to make, and we're very fortunate that we work at a company where they believe at least in us enough where they will say okay, you're going to work on this thing for a long time, and it's going to cost a reasonable amount of money, and we're not going to push any of that stuff on you.<br></em></p>



<p><em>But I understand why it happens, right? And I don't blame anybody for trying to make a living, but I like making the games I want to play, and the kind of games I want to play are I just want to have an experience with a game and have that game be just that. All it wants to do is entertain me, right? It's got no other ulterior motives and Judas and our games have not had ulterior motives. And I'm lucky that we've been able to do that. It's a difficult time in the industry, as you know, and not everybody is as lucky as we are that we get to make a game that can really just pursue the player's joy. I think unwisely the industry has decided that you need all these elements, but if you look at the games that have really landed in the past couple of years, they are the games providing this, whether it's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/baldurs-gate-3-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</a>, or <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, or even <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyberpunk 2077</a> or The Witcher III: Wild Hunt. These are really traditional single player games and they don't have that kind of monetization in them, and I think the audience has rewarded those games, especially in the AAA space, because it gets so expensive that people want other methods of monetization. I'm just grateful that we're allowed to not have to do that because that just frees us to purely design the game for the player's experience.</em></p>



<p>Understandably, the Ken Levine creator does not really reveal any significant new details about his next game, Judas, which remains without a release window. That said, for all we know, it could change either at Gamescom or at The Game Awards. Here's hoping anyway, as the actual new BioShock installment <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-bioshock-was-rebooted-again-last-summer-says-leaker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still seems far from launching</a>.</p>

Not the kind that swoop and screech and dive around your car in New Games Journalism articles that lean a bit too obviously on Hunter S. Thompson - bless our hearts, we've all done it - but the kind who labour at the forge and rejoice when their colleagues crumble and may even drive other workers out in order to make themselves feel better.</p>
<p>On the whole, I think I prefer the Fear and Loathing variety. Anyway, here's the trailer for Against the Storm's second DLC expansion, Nightwatchers, which will release on PC via Steam, GOG, Epic Games Store and the Microsoft Store on July 31st.</p><!--more-->

<p>"The Bats despise weakness and tend to thrive where others fail, making them unique but volatile companions on an expedition into the wilderness," says a press release of the new DLC faction. "Their Manorial Court ability is used to expel a member of another species, leveraging this harsh punishment to motivate the rest of the workforce. They also gain resolve when other species leave the settlement." </p>
<p>While the bats may not make for great neighbours, publishers Hooded Horse and developers Eremite Games claim they'll stand you in good stead when exploring the DLC's two new biomes. The Rocky Ravine is a treeless waste where you'll find a lot of metal and stone, plus "merciless merchants who won't think twice about exploiting you for their gain". There's a new Black Market to exploit here, defined by "highly volatile prices and goods availability, all hidden from the watchful eyes of the Scorched Queen."</p>
<p>The second biome is Bamboo Flats, a place of heavy precipitation in at least two senses. "Though the constant rain has left these regions devoid of any fertile soil, the giant Fluffbeak is able to produce copious amounts of fertilizer to enrich the soil and help establish a flourishing settlement, provided it's well taken care of," the developers explain. "Manage its hunger, thirst, and warmth to reap rewards." OK, this sounds like the more interesting part of the DLC, actually: keep Rodan happy so that it'll shit on you regularly enough to hold starvation at bay.</p>
<p>The DLC will also include new orders, world events, rewards, and music. It will accompany the game's 1.8 update, which introduces a new Smouldering City upgrade, a legendary cornerstone and various other bits and pieces, none of them as instantly compelling as the prospect of founding a colony on birdpoop. I wonder if the bats feel happier when they're being crapped on - it seems like the kind of rough living they'd enjoy.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/top-city-builder-against-the-storm-gets-a-grumpy-bat-faction-and-giant-pooping-birds-in-its-next-dlc-this-july]]></content:encoded>

The repair experts—who champion repairability, sustainability, and quality—didn’t mince words about Nintendo’s new and expensive controller. </p><p>For example, it’s “absurdly” difficult to replace the controller’s built-in battery, which will eventually fail—like all batteries—and will need to be replaced. To do so, you have to do all of this: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Remove the top plastic face plate held down by tons of adhesive to reach seven screws. Then remove finicky plastic wedge sections. Then, using more force than expected, yank off the two thumbsticks. Next, remove more screws. Then remove another plastic covering. After that, remove the bumpers. Then take out more screws and disconnect the rumble packs. Finally, remove a few more hidden screws, and now you can remove the internal guts of the controller and reach the battery pack.</p></blockquote><p>Yeah, that’s a lot of work to simply replace a permanently dead battery. And to reassemble the controller, you have to source your own adhesive to reinstall the front plate properly, or it will rattle while gaming. </p><p>And it gets <em>worse</em>. To remove the joysticks completely is a “pain in the ass” and requires more digging into the controller’s guts. And what iFixit found in there is alarming: some very low-profile joysticks that are prone to drifting. What’s more, the sticks appear to be using the same components found in the cheaper Joy Cons. The only good thing iFixit had to say about the controller was how easy it is to replace the headset jack. </p><p>The company suggests gamers <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-best-controllers-wireless-wired-pro-1851784358&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-best-controllers-wireless-wired-pro-1851784358">buy third-party controllers</a></span> that contain easier-to-access batteries and better thumbsticks, like the Elves 2 Pro from Gulikit. “A cash grab riding high on the Nintendo brand” is how iFixit summed up the Pro Controller 2. And yeah, seems like it. While the controller feels great in your hands and has some nifty extra buttons, it seems it’s far from being “Pro” grade hardware. </p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-pro-controller-piss-poor-stick-drift-ifixit-1851786109]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The first <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> had a black-and-white option called Kurosawa Mode. The tribute to the legendary film director was meant to add a vintage aesthetic and heightened gravity to the samurai adventure’s panoramic vistas and cinematic showdowns, to varying levels of success. To be honest, I don’t think it worked that well.

The lo-fi beats mode was arranged by <em>Cowboy Bebop </em>and <em>Samurai Champloo </em>director Shinichirō Watanabe. Based on the brief preview, it sounds not unlike what you might get by streaming a lo-fi beats playlist on the PS5 Spotify app in the background while playing the game. This one just happens to be incorporated directly into it, and with Watanabe’s input, it will hopefully include some unique tracks that complement the open-world exploration and fighting taking place on screen. </p><p>It’s another gimmick, sure, but unlike the Kurosawa mode, it’s not being used as a visual shorthand to impart unearned meanings and depth to the game’s world, characters, and story. Instead, it’s a nod to the way people actually play big open-world games full of backtracking and side content. For every dramatic scene, emotional relationship, or thematically rich detail, there are hours, sometimes dozens, spent doing fun, weird, and extremely repetitive gamer shit. While immersive environments and organic exploration are part of the appeal of the open-world genre, so too is the <em>PowerWash Simulator</em>-like serenity and satisfaction of methodically cleaning up every enemy camp and collectible icon on the map. </p><p>Lots of people already listen to other stuff while doing this busywork. Sometimes it’s turning the game’s soundtrack off and putting on other music. Sometimes it’s catching up on five-hour-long podcasts. Some people even watch other shows and movies entirely during these activities. Sony designed an entire $200 accessory exactly for this purpose called the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/playstation-portal-the-kotaku-review-1851015770&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-portal-the-kotaku-review-1851015770">PlayStation Portal</a></span>. It sold unexpectedly well. The lo-fi beats mode doesn’t just accept this, it embraces it by trying to add<em> Ghost of Yotei</em>’s own bespoke take on the practice. </p><p>This is basically how radio stations function in the <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> series. Zipping around Rockstar’s cities would be completely different without the deep catalog of licensed tunes players can flip through while getting to the next mission marker or dodging the cops. More games deserve them, whether they make fictional sense or not. Who knows if <em>Yotei</em>’s lo-fi beats mode will be as good. Fans are hoping for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wK27xW4OFI&amp;list=RD2wK27xW4OFI&amp;start_radio=1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wK27xW4OFI&amp;list=RD2wK27xW4OFI&amp;start_radio=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">at least one Nujabes track</a></span>, among others. But it’s a worthwhile acknowledgement of the way people actually engage with games.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ghost-yotei-tsushima-2-cowboy-bebop-lofi-1851786114]]></content:encoded>

It’s not often I get to put on that old hat for this job, but watching professional musicians react in real time to some of the bonkers compositional choices Fox makes in <em>Deltarune</em>’s soundtrack has been a marriage of two of my passions. The first time I heard “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f1RK1m7qvc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f1RK1m7qvc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Third Sanctuary,”</a></span> one of the incredible tracks from <em>Deltarune</em>’s latest chapters, was when a video of game music cover band <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GzU4BlZcS8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GzU4BlZcS8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lame Genie’s</a></span> drummer, Kyle Sawaia, blind reacting to its odd, shifting time signature, crossed my For You page.</p><p>First off, props to Sawaia for keeping up with those time signature changes on the fly. Second, Fox’s compositions didn’t need to go that hard, and yet he did it anyway. I still don’t really know the context for when this track plays, but it is not only a compositional feat; it also evokes a frantic, emotional battle between two tragically opposing forces. Is that what’s happening when you hear the song in-game? I have no idea, but hearing it out of context only made me want to boot up the game more to find out.</p><p>Lame Genie isn’t the only group of musicians in awe of “The Third Sanctuary” and the rest of <em>Deltarune</em>’s incredible soundtrack. Dozens of reactions from musicians have been sprouting up on TikTok and YouTube.</p><p>I’m the type of person who can listen to a song hundreds (if not thousands) of times on loop without getting tired of it, but eventually you do lose that initial awe you feel when you hear something for the first time. Watching others experience something is about as close as I get to feeling that again, which is why I’ve started watching more reaction videos to music and other media. In cases like <em>Deltarune</em>, musicians reacting to it drew my attention to something I hadn’t really been paying attention to. Most of my exposure to Fox’s music has been through his work on the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1v1sAYXQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1v1sAYXQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Pokémon </em>franchise</a></span>, but it’s nice to be reminded that he’s cooking when he’s working on his own stuff, too.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/deltarune-ost-soundtrack-music-third-sanctuary-reaction-1851786110]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">A better world is possible today.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/overwatch-2"><u>Overwatch 2</u></a> Game Director Aaron Keller has addressed criticisms that Blizzard Entertainment “dropped the ball” when it comes to things like story content, PvE, and animated shorts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The face of Blizzard’s popular hero shooter opened up about the team’s struggles during an interview with content creator<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20r5IX0UEnM" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <u>Jay3</u></a> and Overwatch 2 voice actor Conor McLeod. Although the multiplayer title is largely known for its team-based gameplay, Keller recognizes that some story content will need to "come back" for Overwatch 2 to be "firing on all cylinders."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“One of the things that we hear our players talk about a lot, you see online… it feels like Overwatch has dropped the ball when it comes to story and lore,” Keller said in response to a question from McLeod. “You kinda see that. We used to put a few more of the big animated shorts out than we do nowadays.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/gLo6fdyWhQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/gLo6fdyWhQ</a></p>— Laurence @ Drawing💙 (@volskayadottxt) <a href="https://twitter.com/volskayadottxt/status/1943491882979312119?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 11, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Overwatch animated shorts are a sore spot for fans. Blizzard originally built excitement with a series of high-quality cinematics from 2016 to 2023, with each highlighting abilities for characters like Reinhardt, Hanzo, Genji, Mei, Bastion, and more while also showing how many of its 43 playable characters fit into the larger story. What began as somewhat frequent lore drops eventually started to fizzle out around the release of Overwatch 2 in 2022. It’s been nearly two years since fans received a 3D-animated cinematic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Frustrations with the lack of animated shorts reached a boiling point when Blizzard announced it would be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-pve-hero-mode-canceled-a-difficult-choice"><u>scrapping its PvE Hero ambitions in summer 2023</u></a>. With a long-promised story-driven mode canceled and animated short releases crawling to a halt, Blizzard had to start from scratch. Although it’s been years without a significant update, Keller says the Overwatch 2 team hasn’t completely left story behind.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“To speak frankly about it, we did have a big plan to go after story in the game. That was the PvE side of it with the campaign and everything like that,” he added. “That didn’t work out. So, it was kind of a bit of a reset moment for us when that happened, and we would like to get back to it. I think one of the best parts of Overwatch is the universe and the characters that are there. That’s definitely a goal of ours to get back to it. There’s been a bit of a step backwards that we had to take in order for us to be able to start moving forward on it again.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I think for us to say that Overwatch 2 is firing on all cylinders, we need to have some of that come back.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard announced a gameplay facelift for Overwatch 2 in February of this year. During its breakdown, the studio announced a major new PvP game mode called Stadium as well as the return of free loot box cosmetic rewards, two new Heroes, and a gameplan for the next year of content. Many of these additions, including a fundamental gameplay change called Perks, have launched since, signaling that Blizzard has found its footing as it makes good on significant promises.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of these changes have been accepted with open arms by the Overwatch 2 community, but as new players flock to see why fans are suddenly talking about the 2016 hero shooter again, the desire for story content still echoes across Reddit threads and X/Twitter posts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One idea many fans – including McLeod – would love to see is an Overwatch TV series. Keller says he’s not opposed to the idea, going as far as to say “we’d love to do that.” It’s unclear how, when, or if Keller and the Overwatch 2 team will be able to enter another golden age. One thing is clear: Keller knows Overwatch fans want more story content.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think for us to say that Overwatch 2 is firing on all cylinders, we need to have some of that come back,” Keller said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Overwatch 2 is currently in the midst of Season 17: Powered Up, which features a selection of retro-gaming-inspired skins, Mythic cosmetics for Reaper and D.Va, new Stadium Heroes, and crossover content with G.I. Joe.

                <p>IO has acknowledged the performance issues on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hitman-world-of-assassination/">Hitman: World of Assassination - Signature Edition</a> that have mired its release as a Nintendo Switch 2 launch title.</p><p dir="ltr">As one of a few third-party releases that was supposed to showcase the new console's ability to run graphically intensive current-gen titles, the port has been criticized for its many technical issues. In our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition-disappoints-on-switch-2/1100-6532229/">impressions</a>, we noted that its uncapped frame rate resulted in "uneven" performance that "fluctuates wildly," surprisingly mitigated in handheld mode due to the display supporting built-in Variable Refresh Rate (VRR).</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfKQgglhaBU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FfKQgglhaBU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Speaking in a <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/io-addresses-hitman-switch-2-performance-issues-and-says-fixes-are-on-the-way/" rel="nofollow ">VGC</a> interview, IO's franchise director Jonathan Lacaille has addressed these issues, saying, “The team is working on some of those performance issues right now, and they are addressing it over the summer." A specific date for when exactly these fixes will go live is not yet known.</p><p dir="ltr">Lacaille also took the opportunity to assuage doubts over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/007-first-light/">007 First Light</a>, which is also being developed for Switch 2 alongside the other, more powerful platforms.</p><p dir="ltr">“It’s, of course, good learning for us to bring to First Light as well--so all of this will be learnings we bring to the next title.”</p><p dir="ltr">The Hitman series has previously come to Switch 1 with a cloud version of Hitman 3, as well as a port of older title Hitman: Blood Money, but Lacaille assures that "the Switch 2 is a powerful device--powerful enough for us to bring First Light to it natively.”</p><p>The Switch 2 version of Hitman: World of Assassination isn't the only recent IO release plagued with technical issues. The company also published MindsEye from developer Build A Rocket Boy, and it's one of the worst-reviewed games of the year, with performance issues so bad that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-players-say-theyre-getting-mindseye-refunds/1100-6532383/">PS5 players were getting refunds</a> from the PlayStation Store.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>At the time of writing, we're now just a few short weeks away from the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/no-sleep-for-kaname-date-from-ai-the-somnium-files">No Sleep For Kaname Date - From AI: THE SOMNIUM FILES</a> for the Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>25th July 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>It's the third entry in the <strong>AI: THE SOMNIUM FILES</strong> series following the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ai_the_somnium_files">the original game</a> in 2019 and its direct sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ai_the_somnium_files_-_nirvana_initiative">nirvanA Initiative</a>, in 2022. The series so far has been met with widespread acclaim, and the developers over at Spike Chunsoft seemingly have no desire to stop anytime soon – happy days for us, then!</p>
<p>This year's new entry puts a lot of the focus back on investigator Kaname Date following fan feedback from nirvanA initiative. It also sees developer Kazuya Yamada take the reigns as director and scenario writer, with veteran Kotaro Uchikoshi serving as series director and scenario supervisor. We recently caught up with both to find out more about the game, their roles in its development, and what kind of wacky dreams they've been having recently...</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life: How would you define No Sleep For Kaname Date? How does it fit in with the overall story of the series?</strong></p>
<figure><a title="Kaname Date 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/644782d36828c/kaname-date-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Director and scenario writer Kazuya Yamada — <em>Image: Kazuya Yamada</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Kazuya Yamada:</strong> Our mission was to "listen to as many opinions as possible from our fans," and the development team, myself included, has become part of the fan base. In that sense, I think the theme of this project is something like, "Let’s all have a fan appreciation event together." That said, I believe we've created a number of settings that could be used as the series continues. If Uchikoshi-san can make good use of them, I'll feel satisfied.</p>
<p><strong>Kotaro Uchikoshi:</strong> When I first heard from the producer, I remember him saying, "It's going to be something like a companion piece." But in reality, it turned out to be more of a true sequel, so much so that it could have been officially the "3" in the series. That applies not just to the overall game, but also to the storyline as well. I'm sure fans will be satisfied with the game, so please look forward to it!</p>
<p><strong>No Sleep For Kaname Date puts a lot of the focus back on the titular protagonist as a playable character - can you tell us more about the story and how you came up with it?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yamada:</strong> The story begins when Date, who is once again the protagonist, receives a call from Iris who has been abducted by a UFO. As Date searches for Iris's whereabouts, he comes across a mysterious device with a sign attached to it that reads "Psync me." While investigating, he finds a connection to the place where Iris is being held captive.</p>
<p>The story follows his journey to unravel these mysteries, rescue Iris, and solve the case. The story this time was built around the requirement of "making Date the protagonist." We explored a variety of ideas and, taking Uchikoshi’s feedback into account, made adjustments little by little—like carving a sculpture.</p>

<p><strong>Yamada-san, you have moved into the role of Director for this game. How has this experience been for you, and what support have you received from Uchikoshi-san?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yamada:</strong> I served as both director and scenario writer, and in a word, it was hell. I was honestly impressed that Uchikoshi-san was able to take on such an outrageous workload. I'm even thinking of putting up a sign in the office that says, "Don't be both director and scenario writer, or it may prove fatal."</p>
<p>Despite his busy schedule, Uchikoshi-san not only pointed out things about the scenario but also gave me suggestions like, "If you do it this way, it'll be more interesting." I'm eternally grateful to him. Of course, I appreciated all of his feedback, but more than that, he also knew exactly how much to praise and flatter me, just the right amount. It really helped me stay sane.</p>
<p><strong>Uchikoshi:</strong> I supervised the plot that Yamada-san wrote. For example, I gave him advice on the AI series setting, such as, "The introduction needs to have more impact, so how about this?", "This part is too similar to the last game. Why not try changing it like this?", "As a mystery, it might be better to make this character less suspicious", "It would be better to deliberately hide this fact", "The story would probably develop better if this character didn't know this", "How about making this character the one who orchestrated a certain event?", "As part of the AI series, there’s a certain essence missing, so it would be best to add this", and so on.</p>
<p><strong>There are three distinct gameplay elements in No Sleep For Kaname Date - Investigate, Somnium, and Escape. How do you find the balance between these to ensure the player is entertained and not overwhelmed?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yamada:</strong> One of the series's trademarks is that we aim to have just the right amount of confusion, but we were also careful to structure the game so that players can focus on the task at hand, whether it's an Escape or Somnium section, while keeping the information organised and easy to follow. The difficulty has been fine-tuned as well, so whether you're confident or not, you should be able to progress at a level that suits you. (If you set the difficulty to the lowest setting, you should be able to complete it even while drunk.)</p>

<p><strong>You've developed the game for the Switch 2 alongside the Switch - what have you been able to achieve with Nintendo’s new console that wasn't possible on the original Switch?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yamada:</strong> On the original Nintendo Switch, it was extremely difficult to maintain processing speed, and there were parts we had to give up on. However, with Nintendo Switch 2, the hardware capabilities have simply improved, allowing for smooth performance.<strong><br></strong></p>
<p><strong>Are there any games outside of the AI SOMNIUM series that you've looked to for inspiration for this latest release?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yamada:</strong> I don't think there's much of a direct influence, but I do think that the <strong>Metal Gear Solid</strong> series, the <strong>SaGa</strong> series, and the <strong>Yakuza</strong> series have influenced my approach to game development and scenario writing. What I think they have in common is their willingness to go beyond expectations and include twists and elements that make you think, "Wait, are they really allowed to do that?"</p>
<p><strong>What kind of feedback have you received from fans of AI SOMNIUM and how has this influenced your approach with this new game?</strong></p>
<figure><a title="Kaname Date 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/103d544e5e3a9/kaname-date-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Series director and scenario supervisor Kotaro Uchikoshi — <em>Image: Kotaro Uchikoshi</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Yamada:</strong> We received a range of feedback, from how the characters are handled to the quality of life of the gameplay system. Among these, the most impactful piece was, "I wanted to see more of Date’s exploits." Based on this, Date returned as the protagonist.<strong><br></strong></p>
<p><strong>Uchikoshi-san, I recall you saying that you came up with the story for The nirvanA Initiative from a dream. Have either of you had any further dreams that might have influenced this new game?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yamada:</strong> I had a dream where I was kidnapped by members of the mafia who make movies as a hobby. I was forced to write a script under 24-hour surveillance and couldn't leave the room until their boss was satisfied. Meanwhile, I watched my wife being seduced right in front of me, and I cried uncontrollably. It was too sad, so I didn't use it as any kind of reference.</p>
<p>The part about being confined and forced to write a script kind of came true later on, so I strongly hope and pray that the latter part never comes true. Every day, I try to do good deeds and build up my karma.<strong><br></strong></p>
<p><strong>Uchikoshi:</strong> Yamada-san wrote the scenario, so it doesn't include any elements from my dreams. However, I once had a dream in which a man with his lower body exposed was lying on his back on a conveyor belt, and the part of him that was erect--let’s call it “D”--was wearing medieval armour. As the conveyor belt moved forward, D swung and mowed down these approaching monsters. If there’s an opportunity, I might use that somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>How many more stories could potentially be told in the AI SOMNIUM series? Do you have an ending in mind at all?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yamada:</strong> From my perspective, with a work like this one, I can expand the scenario and develop it endlessly if there’s even the slightest chance. So if given the opportunity, I believe it could continue for a long time, just like <strong>The Simpsons</strong>.<strong><br></strong></p>
<p><strong>Uchikoshi:</strong> There are about as many stories to tell as there are in <strong>One Piece</strong>. I'll probably still be writing them by the time the Anunnaki aliens return, so I'd like to think about the ending after that.</p>
<p><strong>Uchikoshi-san, you worked closely with Kazutaka Kodaka on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">The Hundred Line</a>, and he also has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shuten_order">Shuten Order</a> launching later this year too. Do you discuss your individual projects with each other and provide feedback?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Uchikoshi:</strong> We hardly ever talk about individual projects, but every now and then, Kodaka will casually mention an interesting idea for something I'm working on, and I kind of keep those ideas in the back of my mind.<strong><br></strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Eremite Games and publisher Hooded Horse have announced the release date for city builder&nbsp;<em>Against the Storm</em>'s upcoming&nbsp;<em>Nightwatchers&nbsp;</em>DLC, and it's arriving pretty soon.</p>

<p>Per a Steam news post,&nbsp;<em>Nightwatchers&nbsp;</em>launches across all platforms on July 31st. It'll bring a brand new species, two new biomes, and plenty of other features if you decide to pick it up, although it is paid DLC rather than a free update.</p>

<p>The Bats are "a stern and fiercely devoted species with unmatched resilience and exceptional metallurgical skills", according to the two studios, so make sure you're leveraging their unique skills if you decide to play as them.</p>

The Ravine's landscape, in particular, is described as "unforgiving", but you can take advantage of the new Black Market feature to keep your settlement afloat even in this harsh landscape.</p>

<p>In the Bamboo Flats, meanwhile, you'll find a new creature by the name of the Fluffbeak, and you can keep an eye out for its "hunger, thirst, and warmth" to effectively care for it and receive fertilizer to help your soil along in return.</p>

<p>Other new features coming as part of the&nbsp;<em>Nightwatchers&nbsp;</em>DLC include new World Events, which will grant powerful new rewards in turn, as well as new Modifiers, new Legendary Cornerstones, and a ton of other good stuff that should make your&nbsp;<em>Against the Storm&nbsp;</em>experience all the more satisfying.</p>

<p>You can check out the&nbsp;<em>Against the Storm&nbsp;</em><em>Nightwatchers&nbsp;</em>DLC release date trailer, which gives you a sense of what will be in store for you if you decide to grab the expansion, right here.</p>




<p><em>Against the Storm&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1336490/Against_the_Storm/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10011016" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/against-the-storm/9nrlrjpv4hwl" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/against-the-storm-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and the&nbsp;<em>Nightwatchers&nbsp;</em>DLC will launch on July 31st.

            <p>Big piratey thing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a> will be getting custom servers as part of a paid subscription service in "early 2026", developers Rare have announced during a first-ever community direct for the game. That's far from all of the studio's plans, with wider shakeups also in the pipeline.</p>
<p>This outlining of plans to make sure the good ship SOT is not only seaworthy, but can successfully broadside the many other vessels competing for its players' attention comes with some depressing and un-piratey context. It follows Rare being one of the studios affected by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">Microsoft's mass layoffs</a> earlier this month, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/everwild">Everwild</a> being among the number of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rares-mysterious-nature-sim-everwild-has-been-cancelled-as-part-of-xbox-mass-layoffs-according-to-reports">in-development games cancelled</a> as part of the cuts.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In the hour-ish of their community direct and accompanying <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172620/Sea_of_Thieves_2025_Edition/">Steam blog post</a>, Rare acknowledged that they've got some work to do to keep folks invested in the game. "We know we haven’t hit the mark our players were hoping for in terms of game health and performance, especially when it comes to being reactive to cheating and the game experience on PC," they wrote, "We’re also cognisant that we could be more attuned to the desires and experiences of our player base, and we’ll be working hard to remedy this in future."</p>
<p>Cue some changes to how the teams working on SOT are structured, with Rare saying it's expended the team focused on "improving the core playability and stability of the main game". Alongside this, the studio's taking a different approach to how they structure three-month seasons, with new stuff arriving every month so the players always have something fresh to do.</p>

<p>While seasons 17 and 18, both of which were teased here, are coming soon, those custom servers will be arriving early next year. They'll be deployed as part of a new subscription's "premium package", which'll also include other benefits. You'll be able to tweak the seas of your custome server to suit your every whim, spawning enemies, turning off enemies, running safer seas fleets, messing about with the devs' cinematic camera. The place oysters come from is your oyster.</p>
<p>"Although this subscription service is landing next year, we’ve taken the decision to announce it nice and early so that our Partners and creative communities can start making plans sooner rather than later," Rare wrote, "We want to build this toolset in partnership with the community, and running it as a subscription model means that we can ensure ongoing investment into and development of custom servers as a platform."</p>
<p>So, there you go. Sea of Thieves is sailing on. Hoist the mainsail.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sea-of-thieves-is-getting-paid-custom-servers-next-year-and-rare-are-switching-up-their-approach-to-seasons]]></content:encoded>

<p>The intricacies of dino-bonking appear largely in line with bake-the-potato mechanics in similar <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> management games. You will need to construct and place a nest at a tasteful remove from visitors, with comfort levels sufficient to set the mood for the species in question. Dinosaurs have a fertility level that varies according to age, health, and how recently they've roasted the broomstick. From the looks of it, when they're up for some slophockey they'll go perch on the nest and do saucy toodle-oo noises. Then you just need to find or flash-grow an appropriate mate, and assign a boffin to officiate the Chesterfield rugby. </p>
<p>The result will be an individual with a particular combination of genes and traits, such as faster growth, greater aggression and a need for more living space. As is generally the case in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jurassic-park">Jurassic Park</a>, you may come to regret letting your terrible lizards have kids. "While fascinating for park guests to behold, introducing juveniles also brings new challenges thanks to their unique social needs, as well as changes to the wider herd dynamic," the developers caution in a press release.</p>
<p>It's hard to get much sense of the possibilities from 90-odd seconds of very restrained and managerial T-reXXX footage, but the hope, of course, is that the system will lead to sudden overpopulation punctuated by a few total genetic disasters. I want to turn my back for five minutes and discover that the triceratops have become the equivalent of parakeets in London, and that all of the young velociraptors are vegetarians. Going by the developer's prior work, I don't think it'll be quite that adventurous, but, as Geoff Goldblum likes to say, life finds a method.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-jurassic-world-evolution-3-breeding-trailer-explains-the-fine-art-of-dinosaur-bonestorming]]></content:encoded>
