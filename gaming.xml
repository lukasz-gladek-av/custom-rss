<p>Available in Coral Red and Translucent Black, the Elves 2 is a different proposition from its 'Pro' variant, (which is already available - you can check out our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/gulikit-elves-2-pro-controller-for-switch-and-switch-2-a-small-yet-refined-saturn-tribute">full review for all the details</a>). The new model is missing a few key features, such as APG recording and custom thumbstick sensitivity, but it's still got gyro support, three levels of rumble intensity, and those all-important Hall Effect analogue sticks with removable caps.</p>
<p>The Elves 2 is priced at $29.99 and is available from Amazon now in the US and Japan, with Europe to follow "soon". Select global retailers will also offer the pad, though pricing may vary depending on region.</p>
<p>"We’re proud to be the first controller brand globally to support wake-up functionality on the Switch 2 at launch," said Gulikit in its press release.</p>
<p>Here's an overview of the pad's key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- Retro-Inspired Ergonomics:</strong><br>
Shaped after the Sega Genesis controller for comfortable, fatigue-free play. Compact and lightweight for gaming on the go.</p>
<p><strong>- World-First Switch 2 Wake-Up Support:<br></strong>Instantly wake up your Switch 2 from sleep mode—GuliKit is the first controller brand to offer this feature out of the box.</p>
<p><strong>- Dual Hall Effect Joysticks:<br></strong>Drift-free performance with 2200-level high precision and long-lasting durability.</p>
<p><strong>- Advanced Haptics with Asymmetric Dual-Rotor Motors:</strong><strong><br></strong>Three levels of responsive vibration feedback for immersive gameplay, similar to Xbox's tactile feel.</p>
<p><strong>- Universal Compatibility:<br></strong>Works seamlessly with Switch 2, Switch, Windows, iOS, and Android.</p>
<p><strong>- Classic Floating D-Pad:<br></strong>Perfect for fighting games, with precise actuation and fast combo execution.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-deep-dives-into-ea-sports-fc-26-clubs-changes-including-archetype-revamps-support-for-multiple-clubs-and-more.1258551/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>EA has just <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-fc/fc-26/news/pitch-notes-fc26-clubs-deep-dive">published a deep dive</a> into the changes it made in EA Sports FC 26 to Clubs, with revamps to archetypes and archetype progression, support for multiple clubs, dynamic Club Rush Live events, and more.</p>



<p>Regarding archetype progression, consumables are the new introduction to help players earn XP for their archetypes outside of playing matches or skill games, and to help players who didn't jump into FC 26 on day one and start building their clubs right away catch up to those who did. You'll unlock consumables through season pass and objective rewards, or through the Clubs Store. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>And while there will be multiple kinds of consumables available, some of the ones EA is introducing are Archetype XP multipliers and Direct Apply AXP, both of which boost AXP either through match rewards or just a direct boost. Archetype unlocks are exactly what they sound like, letting you unlock any of the remaining 12 archetypes you didn't pick when you first jump into clubs, and the same goes with Archetype Resets, which let you reset your attribute points and redistribute them.</p>

</figure>



<p>FC 26 also introduces signature perks, which, according to EA, "<em>encourage you to embody your chosen archetype or specialization whenever you step onto the pitch</em>." Every archetype comes with two perks that you unlock through archetype progression, and a third can be applied when you have a specialization active.</p>



<p>Some perks are action-focused, which means they're based around you performing specific actions on the pitch, while others are mechanic or team-based. Mechanic perks focus on improving elements of your game, like your passing, while team-based perks improve how your computer-controlled teammates receive passes and control the ball.</p>



<p>Live events coming to Clubs are one of the other major changes in FC 26, with new events coming to Clubs regularly through single-elimination knockout rush tournaments. That said, you do have multiple attempts to make it out of the first round if you lose a match when starting a rush tournament. You're truly eliminated when you lose each attempt.</p>

</div>
</figure>



<p>Some of the rush tournaments will have house rules like Rugby Rush, which is basically a 'no fouls' mode, or a Designated Scorer mode, where goals only count if they come from a designated player.</p>



<p>Players can now also be a member of up to three clubs at a time, switching between them at will through the Clubs menu, but that doesn't mean you'll earn rewards for all three when playing a match for one of them. So make sure you have the right club selected if you're trying to earn rewards for a specific one.</p>



<p>The big promise with this year's entry into EA's long-running football series has been to "<a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-26-gameplay-deep-dive/"><em>make gameplay better</em>,</a>" and address the myriad of issues that players have had with the game for years. It's clear that EA is putting in some kind of effort from these deep dives and its marketing, but whether it's all sizzle and no steak is something we won't know until FC 26 launches on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2, on September 26, 2025.</p>

Square Enix have announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a>, a prequel to the genteel 2019 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> Katharine Castle <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/octopath-traveler-pc-review">hailed</a> as... "a bit of a slog"?? "A big old anticlimax"??? I thought it was quite good!</p>
<p>This is an outrage! I'm going to tell Katharine she sucks at writing and is terrible at video games. What do you mean, she doesn't work here any more? Well in that case, I'm going to tell Graham he should never have hired her. What do you mean, he doesn't work here any more? Who <em>does</em> work here any more? Oh screw it, just roll the trailer.

<p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/octopath-traveler">Octopath Traveler</a> Nought takes place in the first game's Orsterra, a medieval fantasy confection with a few Steam Age flourishes, and sports the same "HD-2D" visual direction - a calculatingly throwback  blend of chintzy sprites and lushly illuminated 3D environments, much like a grandfather clock equipped with a wifi speaker.</p>
<p>It brings back the first game's battle system, which saw you Breaking (aka, staggering) enemies by filling a bar, and spending Boost points to enhance actions performed in each turn. Characters still get unique Path Actions when interacting with townsfolk, too. 
</p>
<p>
So where does it differ? Well, you can now customise your protagonist and rebuild your very own hometown, Wishvale, after somebody inconsiderately burns it down in the prologue. It's not yet clear how this might affect the rest of the game, but I imagine you'll be able to shop in Wishvale and give your party members places to live. It's what I'd do, if I were Enix, Esquire.
</p>
<p>
Octopath Traveler Nada launches on December 4th this year. That dirty, no-good Katharine also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/octopath-traveler-2-review">reviewed the second game</a> before she left us languishing in the arms of Ian Games. She remained unimpressed, concluding that "bar a couple of very minor evolutions, this is effectively the same Octopath Traveler as before". I confess, the first game's story does drag on, but I greatly enjoyed the alchemy of the Boost and Break systems. I do think Square Enix have run the HD-2D look into the ground at this point, though.

Its tale of the cutthroat, vindictive side of the entertainment industry may be oozing true crime flair, but outside of the jump scares and darker turns, is the story it tells really <em>that </em>different from any real-life horror story you might have heard about the challenges struggling artistss sometimes face when they’re trying to make it?</p><p>If you want a game to talk about the trials and tribulations of actors, it’s worth having some incredible talent to get the message across. <em>Dead Take </em>stars <em>Final Fantasy XVI </em>and <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> lead Ben Starr and Astarion from <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> himself, Neil Newbon, as two struggling(?) actor friends(?), Vinny Monroe and Chase Lowry. Both actors auditioned for a role in the latest movie by visionary director Duke Cain, but Vinny was the one who landed the job. While Chase is clearly not thrilled by this turn of events, he and Vinny seem to still be on good terms, up until Vinny stops answering his phone after a party at Cain’s luxurious mansion. Chase, in an effort to find his friend, goes to Cain’s home and finds only the aftermath of a party long over.</p><figure id="" data-id="bc168987eef4072045f926f40732eea8" data-recommend-id="image://bc168987eef4072045f926f40732eea8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1536" data-height="864" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Chase looks into the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Chase looks into the camera." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Surgent Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bc168987eef4072045f926f40732eea8" data-recommend-id="image://bc168987eef4072045f926f40732eea8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1536" data-height="864" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Chase looks into the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Most of <em>Dead Take </em>plays out as a kind of large-scale escape room. Cain’s mansion is full of locked rooms with mysteries and unpleasant answers on the other side. The game is a mostly solitary affair, as Chase seems to be the only soul in the building, but Starr, Newbon, and a few other surprising big actors in the video game space get some real face time through found footage. So even if Chase is alone, every supporting character’s presence is still felt in their absence. There are plenty of text logs and environmental cues that give you a sense of what’s going on, but the bulk of the story is told through FMV video files you search for and watch in Cain’s lavish home theater. There are some puzzles even within that, some requiring you to use video editing software to find hidden footage within the files you’ve already discovered. It’s nothing as demanding as what you find in a Sam Barlow game like <em>Her Story </em>or <em>Immortality</em>, but it’s just enough to make you feel like even the videos you find aren’t the full story, and that there are hidden meanings to be found within even the most innocuous footage.</p><p>Starr’s performance is the standout for me. Vinny is a driven but privileged nepo baby who is drinking Cain’s Kool-Aid as if the man’s films were plopped into theaters by Christ himself. But that’s not even a character flaw that’s specific to him. Everyone<em> </em>in <em>Dead Take </em>is lapping up everything this man puts down, and they’re willing to sabotage others to bask in his light.</p><figure id="" data-id="d3881f02474225a64efce3e83644add6" data-recommend-id="image://d3881f02474225a64efce3e83644add6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1536" data-height="864" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The video editing interface in Dead Take." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The video editing interface in Dead Take." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Surgent Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d3881f02474225a64efce3e83644add6" data-recommend-id="image://d3881f02474225a64efce3e83644add6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1536" data-height="864" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The video editing interface in Dead Take." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>We’re seeing this all through Chase’s eyes, and his voyeuristic role in this whole ordeal means we see more of Vinny’s character than probably anyone else, with much of the footage we see of Chase being taken from his initial, unsuccessful audition. <em>Dead Take </em>has the perspective of someone who has been pushed out or denied entry into a sacred, elite space, and by god, it sure speaks to the feeling of trying to break into a competitive artistic field where certain auteurs are put on a pedestal by just about everyone. Yeah, this is the kind of shit Hollywood has to deal with, but it’s also universally applicable to most creative industries. Whether you’re an actor, an artist, a musician, or hell, even a journalist, there’s a perception that there’s an in-crowd and that some people are so legendary that they cannot be so much as be questioned. To say a word against them is to incur their wrath, and that of the people who stand to gain something by being in their proximity. <em>Dead Take</em>’s horrific vision of these ideas is extreme, but it’s rooted in something so real that I had as much of a visceral reaction to the notes I found as I did to any of the more straightforward horrors I encountered in the self-aggrandizing museum Cain calls a home. I won’t spoil some of the mysteries I uncovered, but suffice it to say, <em>Dead Take</em>’s rancid vibes don’t just come from the tense, isolating atmosphere.</p><p>All that being said, the more straightforward scares are my biggest issue with <em>Dead Take</em>. I can handle a jump scare. I can handle two, even. My problem is that <em>Dead Take</em>’s use of them feels incredibly cheap and artificial. I know it’s currently in vogue to point out that “good” or “elevated” horror doesn’t rely on loud bangs and creepy monsters jumping out of walls to scare a viewer or player. While I think those critiques are often overblown and can carry an air of pretentious elitism, almost all of <em>Dead Take</em>’s jump scares are sudden distorted visions of Starr’s screaming face that appear on the screen without warning or any real diegetic context. This happens over and over, with increasing frequency as the game goes on, and I got pretty sick of it by the time I reached the final sequence. Sure, I could charitably read these as manifestations of Chase’s gradually decaying psyche, but they become so frequent and yet impossible to anticipate or connect to anything specific happening in the game that eventually, they no longer feel like real scares rooted in the world you’re moving through. All they did for me was disrupt my nervous system to the point where I had to brace myself every time I walked into a room, and eventually, I had to pause the game before I moved on because I knew I’d probably get a random bit of Starr screaming at me while I’m just trying to find a key or a USB stick.</p><figure id="" data-id="710917357cdc309b029094d23ccb1a1c" data-recommend-id="image://710917357cdc309b029094d23ccb1a1c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1536" data-height="864" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A hallway covered in movie posters with Vinny and Chase both depicted as the leads." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A hallway covered in movie posters with Vinny and Chase both depicted as the leads." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Surgent Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="710917357cdc309b029094d23ccb1a1c" data-recommend-id="image://710917357cdc309b029094d23ccb1a1c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1536" data-height="864" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A hallway covered in movie posters with Vinny and Chase both depicted as the leads." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s a shame those stuttering screams are littered throughout a game I was otherwise drawn into. If you have the tolerance for jump scares, especially ones that have no real basis in the world, have at it. For everyone else, you might need to take some breaks walking through Cain’s mansion like I did, but once you’re past them, there’s a pretty compelling escape room mystery here, elevated by great performances from its two leads. <em>Dead Take </em>is scariest when it’s rooted in something real, and even if there’s a disclaimer assuring everyone it’s not based on anyone specific, know that Duke Cains walk among us.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/dead-take-review-ben-starr-neil-newbon-horror-game-1851787439]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>These days, many video games either tell you an extravagant story that you’ll play through once and then ditch, or they urge you to open your wallet and delve deep for cosmetics and battle passes on the free-to-play front, presumably forever. But if you venture over to the indie side of gaming, you’ll find genuine gems. One such is <em>RimWorld</em>. It’s a story-generator, according to its creator, Tynan Sylvester, in which the pawns you control and your choices create the ongoing tale. With the launch of the game’s latest expansion, <em>Odyssey</em>, introducing gravships, additional biomes, new animals, and more quests and rewards to uncover, it’s an excellent time to delve into <em>RimWorld</em>. I may be biased as I’ve spent nearly 700 hours with the game. But stick with me and you too might come to see what makes this game so special.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196918" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why You'll Fall In Love With This Indie Horror Romance Mashup" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="118" data-playlist="196918,196358,195579" data-current="196918"><div><p>Why You'll Fall In Love With This Indie Horror Romance Mashup</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196918/196918_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196918/196918_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196918/196918_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196918/196918_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22475.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h795486"><a id=""></a>So what is <em>RimWorld</em> all about?</h2><figure id="" data-id="aa175e61b0af28305889b80e5a6229b3" data-recommend-id="image://aa175e61b0af28305889b80e5a6229b3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A colony set in an active volcano surrounded by lava in RimWorld." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A colony set in an active volcano surrounded by lava in RimWorld." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ludeon Studios</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="aa175e61b0af28305889b80e5a6229b3" data-recommend-id="image://aa175e61b0af28305889b80e5a6229b3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A colony set in an active volcano surrounded by lava in RimWorld." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The colony sim genre went through something of a resurgence with the launch of <em>RimWorld</em>. Before that, it was relatively niche, but still popular in a cult following sort of way, thanks to <em>Dwarf Fortress</em>. It’s not about an overarching story; it’s about the tales you craft in the moment. In <em>RimWorld</em>, intelligent AI storytellers, like Randy Random, alter the experience based on how you’re faring in the moment. If you’re doing too well, with abundant food and resources, you might soon endure a horde of man-eating chinchillas ravaging your base and its crops. It’s all part of the experience.</p><p>This randomness is why most people who enjoy <em>RimWorld</em> really enjoy <em>RimWorld</em>. They don’t play for ten or twenty hours; they play for <em>thousands </em>of hours. They want to see what’s going to happen in the next episode of cannibal colony meets <em>The Sims</em>!</p><p>To give you an idea of what can happen in a colony, here’s an excerpt from a review I wrote on Steam about the game, which I think perfectly encapsulates the <em>RimWorld </em>experience:</p><p>“I started an ice sheet challenge with a single colonist. Thanks to the abundance of mods, my colonist soon discovered a talking tree in the wastes. His mind was forever altered. It wasn’t long before the kindly Lafayette was muttering to himself and chanting in odd tongues. He began to worship Cthulu in the mountains - alone and with supplies dwindling. It mattered not. The old god required sustenance of his own. Raiders came to pillage; none survived. They were placed upon the sacrifice table and offered to the tentacled one.”</p><h2 id="h795487"><a id=""></a>New player tips to help you avoid a colony crisis</h2><figure id="" data-id="7a12b1468b64620e336ff6a79b46ee06" data-recommend-id="image://7a12b1468b64620e336ff6a79b46ee06" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A late-game base with storage and base defenses in RimWorld." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A late-game base with storage and base defenses in RimWorld." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ludeon Studios</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7a12b1468b64620e336ff6a79b46ee06" data-recommend-id="image://7a12b1468b64620e336ff6a79b46ee06" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A late-game base with storage and base defenses in RimWorld." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’re a new player who recently picked up <em>RimWorld </em>on sale, I’m sorry. No, not welcome or ‘nice to have you here’. Just, I’m sorry. You’re about to either lose many, many hours of your free time or rage so hard as your first colony crumbles into dust that you’ll never pick up the game again.</p><p>If you’re in the former camp, then here are a few tips to help you survive the onslaught of Randy Random and Cassandra Classic:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Don’t hesitate to pause the game</strong>. While the default game speed isn’t overwhelmingly zippy, there’s a lot of map to explore, including under-mountain areas, colonists to manage, animals to hunt, and monsters to flee from. Your attention will be pulled in ten different directions simultaneously every few seconds, so pause to give yourself some breathing room.</li><li><strong>Defend your colony to the death</strong>. Upon crash-landing planetside, there are a few necessities to consider first: food, shelter, and safety. These three pillars are paramount to your colony’s success, but so many new players overlook safety. They think building in a mountain like a dwarf secures their existence. It doesn’t. You’ll want to consider traps, sandbags, etc.</li><li><strong>Build for efficiency, not aesthetics</strong>. Once you’re more experienced, then you’ll start designing bases that incorporate vibes or whatever Reddit says these days. For now, focus on efficiency. Wood burns, granite doesn’t. Your refrigerator and kitchen may remain in the same room to eliminate wasted time. Your Research Bench isn’t like other workbenches, in that it requires a sterile room to boost your colonists’ research rate, so separate it from the rest of the rabble.</li></ul><p>I could go on endlessly, but these tips will start you off strong.</p><h2 id="h795488"><a id=""></a>A look at <em>RimWorld</em>’s wild side: modding</h2><figure id="" data-id="f6afbdc16eb09b7cabf9b1c1cc731739" data-recommend-id="image://f6afbdc16eb09b7cabf9b1c1cc731739" data-format="png" data-width="1145" data-height="718" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A look at the front page of the RimWorld Workshop on Steam." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A look at the front page of the RimWorld Workshop on Steam." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Valve / Ludeon Studios / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f6afbdc16eb09b7cabf9b1c1cc731739" data-recommend-id="image://f6afbdc16eb09b7cabf9b1c1cc731739" data-format="png" data-width="1145" data-height="718" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A look at the front page of the RimWorld Workshop on Steam." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>RimWorld </em>draws in tens of thousands of players daily and has an all-time peak player count of over 62,000. It’s safe to assume people love the game. And as it’s on PC, the modding community is obsessively active. Seriously, you can find total conversion mods that turn <em>RimWorld </em>into <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> or <em>The Witcher 3</em>. Anything you need or want, the modding community delivers!</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Quality of Life mods</strong>, such as better storage solutions, greater pawn control, pawn editors, an improved camera, and the must-haves, like interaction bubbles that add flavor to your characters.</li><li><strong>Content mods</strong>, such as additional weapons, vehicles, animals, workbenches, hygiene, oil production industries, sushi cooking, fishing, mining, refrigerators, a Roomba, giant crops straight out of Stardew Valley, and of course, anime women.</li><li><strong>Total conversion mods</strong>, such as for <em>Dune</em>, <em>The Witcher</em>, <em>Warhammer 40,000</em>, <em>Killzone</em>, a medieval setting, a zombie apocalypse, and much more.</li><li><strong>Adult mods</strong>, such as…you know what, I checked out the offerings at Loverslab specifically for this bullet point, and I feel gross. There’s a lot, from furry content to animated erections for colonists.</li></ul><h2 id="h795489"><a id=""></a>What do people think about <em>RimWorld</em>?</h2><figure id="" data-id="b40b8703318cfacec2931d356128940b" data-recommend-id="image://b40b8703318cfacec2931d356128940b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A closer look at the Overwhelming Positive reviews for RimWorld on Steam." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A closer look at the Overwhelming Positive reviews for RimWorld on Steam." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Valve / Ludeon Studios / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b40b8703318cfacec2931d356128940b" data-recommend-id="image://b40b8703318cfacec2931d356128940b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A closer look at the Overwhelming Positive reviews for RimWorld on Steam." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Well, for starters, it’s one of the highest-rated titles on Steam.

Over on Steam, one user by the name of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198262566904/recommended/294100/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198262566904/recommended/294100/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detrail</a></span> said: “This is quite simply, the best game ever made.

These are even rarer than Enchanted and feature full alternate artwork, unique foil pattern, and foil hot-stamped text and stats. Kicking off this new rarity will be Minnie Mouse - Sweetheart Princess and Mickey Mouse - Brave Little Prince.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These cards not only look great, but they also complete a picture when placed together. Furthermore, Minnie's Royal Favor adds Support to any Mickey Mouse cards, meaning their love for each other will also help you in-game!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another new rarity being added with Fabled will be Epic, which are rarer than Legendary but more common than Enchanted, and one of these new cards will be A Goofy Movie's Stand Out. A Goofy Movie's arrival in Lorcana was long-requested, and Stand Out will celebrate this moment alongside Powerline - World's Greatest Rock Star and I2I.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dumbo is also getting some love in the new Fabled set, as Dumbo - The Flying Elephant, and Timothy T.

For Disney Lorcana lore hunters, this set will introduce Whispers, which are partially-formed Glimmers that we'll encounter in the "depths of the Great illuminary." To find these Whispers, certain detective Glimmers like Mickey Mouse, Judy Hopps, and Nick Wilde will need to lend their expertise to the cause.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We were given a look at a few of the Zootopia cards that will be part of Whispers in the Well, including Judy Hopps - Uncovering Clues, Nick WIlde - Persistent Investigator, and Putting It All Together. The Deck and Booster Pack art was also revealed, and they feature such characters as Daisy, Demona, Gaston, Simba, Megara, Judy Hopps, and Robin Hood.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Winterspell Promises 'Flurries of Fun' With Stitch, Angel, and More</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/31/stitch-1753964680733.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In Q1 2026, Disney Lorcana will be releasing Winterspell, a new expansion that promises "Flurries of Fun."

More details will be shared in the future.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Disney Lorcana Puzzles From Ravensburger Feature Original Art from the TCG</h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Disney Lorcana Puzzles from Ravensburger</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Disney Lorcana is venturing into the world of puzzles as it will be presenting six 1,000-piece puzzles from Ravensburger - one for each Ink color, that will feature original art from the TCG and each will even come with a Disney Mickey Mouse - True Friend promo card.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"I'm happy I won. I didn't find anything particularly difficult."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Recently, a 73-year-old woman (playing as the pink version of Panda no less) beat a 73-year-old man in the finals of the Tekken 8 portion of the 11th biannual Amigo Club Cup, an esports competition for elderly care home residents in Japan. YouTube livestreams and videos of this feat have drawn attention to the event, and the benefits that gaming can give players, regardless of their age.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with Japanese news site <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/07/13/154970.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Game*Spark</u></a>, the tournament’s winner, Yoshie Murabe revealed that she chose to main Panda purely for the reason that she likes the animal. Murabe picked the pink version of the character; however, opponents should not be fooled by this cute appearance. Murabe’s winning bout shows her taking good advantage of Panda’s slow yet powerful attacks, giving her the edge over her opponent Sadayuki Kato, who picked King as his fighter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Murabe revealed that Tekken 8 is the first video game she has played in her life and that she really enjoyed her tournament debut. Asked about her feelings while playing games and whether she found anything difficult, Murabe’s answer is equally badass: "I'm happy I won. I didn't find anything particularly difficult." She added that she'd really like to try playing other games competitively too.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/31/screenshot-2025-07-31-151536-1753971354672.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">73-year-old Panda main Yoshie Murabe won the Tekken 8 tournament. Image credit: Care eSports / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/y0LlKhMAuZo?feature=shared">YouTube</a>.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Murabe and her fellow geriatric gamers got the chance to throw punches in Tekken 8 thanks to an organization called the Care eSports Association. It was founded in 2019 to give elderly citizens in Japan a new way to engage with others during the pandemic. They started out with slow-paced video game versions of board games like Shogi and Othello, but then decided to shake things up by adding Tekken 8 into the mix, starting with the 9th edition of the tournament.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/07/13/154970.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Game*Spark</u></a>’s interview with the Care eSports Association's PR rep Shimpei Hama, this came about due to his background as a pro Tekken 8 player (he is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8ouiuUxYqxlHBi6GAtgTuA" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Rox3Gaming’s Hama-chan</u></a>). He decided it would be interesting to see how the seniors got on with Tekken 8. Hama said the elderly residents, some of whom have dementia, reported that they really enjoyed it. Many became attached to their characters, showing determination to win at least once, with some staying up late to practice in the run-up to tournaments. He also thanked the carers for their hard work in introducing their residents to video games and the concept of online tournaments. “None of this would have been possible without the dependable cooperation of the staff onsite,” Hama noted.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/31/screenshot-2025-07-31-151832-1753971530210.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Yoshie started strong. Image credit: Care eSports / YouTube.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Tekken 8 first showed up in the Amigo Club Cup as an exhibition match in the tournament’s 9th iteration back in June 2024. However the recent 11th tournament is the first time it has been played competitively by care home residents. Livestreams and videos of the matches were posted on Care eSports Association's official YouTube channel, attracting attention online. Acknowledging the views, Hama noted, “We received way more feedback than ever before,” with voice actors and streamers among those who praised the event. Champion Yoshie Murabe is actually one of the younger participants in the tournament — there was also a <a href="https://youtu.be/3j-MdwkihME?si=ZbAHEgi2p2RchJhg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>fast-paced match between two 93-year-old women playing as Lili and Steve</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During the process of introducing Tekken 8 to the Amigo Club Cup, Hama realized that "care home residents are more interested in video games than I thought." He said they plan to continue to offer Shogi and Othello, but would also like to add other fighting games, as well as "games that everyone can enjoy more casually — something like Geoguessr." He noted that some residents were not keen on the idea of fighting in a game. Geoguessr, a non-violent Google Maps deduction game, would be a good way to engage more residents and help them to keep their brains sharp. At the moment, Care eSports Association’s activities are limited to three Japanese prefectures but they eventually aim to hold a national tournament (source: <a href="https://careesports.com/careesports/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Care eSports official website</u></a>).</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/31/screenshot-2025-07-31-152225-1753971751223.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Yoshie ended up victorious.

All of this goes to show that age is just a number when it comes to enjoying video games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Care eSports / </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/y0LlKhMAuZo?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>YouTube</em></a><em>.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Square Enix [5,359 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has released the official story trailer for <em><a title="Games > Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</a></em>, introducing the “journey of honor, betrayal, and sacrifice that will shape the future of the kingdom of Ivalice.” <span id="more-981142"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Square Enix:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>The dramatic tale of ambition, betrayal, and honor will come to life with an updated and enriched script with fully voiced dialogue, alongside improved graphics that bring a new level of immersion and playability to the battlefield. Additionally, the enhanced version brings quality-of-life updates like new difficulties, a revamped UI, auto save, and more that make the game more accessible to newcomers. The game features strategic, turn-based combat and an elaborate character progression system that makes every battle exhilarating and filled with unexpected twists.</p><p>Hailed as one of gaming’s greatest stories, in this standalone game, players will step into the Kingdom of Ivalice—a medieval world steeped in political conflict—in which players uncover the truth behind the young noble Ramza Beoulve, whose role on history’s stage has been buried from view.</p><p>The new key art of Ramza and Delita, the two heroes of this story, is drawn by Akihiko Yoshida. The art depicts the complex relationship of the two individuals—whether they stand together to protect one another, or the start of a departure as they walk divergent paths. Above them, Ovelia and Alma, both of whom have strong ties to Ramza and Delita, solemnly look into the distance, foreshadowing the direction that fate will lead them.</p><!-- AD: content -->

However, Capcom's franchise has hit some serious turbulence in the form of declining sales, which may be why the publisher is releasing Monster Hunter Wilds' expansion sooner than expected.</p><p>Capcom has moved up the release of Wilds' expansion from the end of September to August 13. This update will introduce a new level of difficulty, a new rewards system, adjustments to weapons balance, and more.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/monsterhunter/status/1950139099160949156" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">An update on release date and content of update Ver.1.021<br>The expansion of endgame content which was originally planned as part of Title Update 3 in late September will now be released ahead of schedule as part of the Ver.1.021 update.

Between April 1 and June 30, Wilds sold only 477k copies, which was only slightly above its predecessor, Monster Hunter Rise, with 389k copies. Even Devil May Cry 5 outsold Monster Hunter Wilds in that period, with 1,782,000 copies. The high number for that game may be due to the Netflix anime adaptation.</p><p>According to Capcom's report, Monster Hunter Wilds has sold 10,585,000 copies since its release earlier this year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Today's Nintendo Partner Direct showcased a rather dense line-up of upcoming third-party games for Switch platforms. Specifically, the Year 1 line-up for Switch 2 received a shot in the arm with several confirmed new titles. If you missed the Direct live, we rounded up every announcement to offer a quick summary of what you missed.&nbsp;</p><h2>Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection - 2026 (Switch 2)</h2><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SxR3M-FwlWU?rel=0&amp;controls=0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SxR3M-FwlWU?rel=0&amp;controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The next entry in the popular RPG spin-off series tells the tale of two nations gearing up for war, until the birth of a Rathalos, long-thought extinct, gives hope. Unfortunately, it’s born with a twin, signaling a prophecy heralding these beasts as harbingers of civil war and destruction. In addition to Switch 2, Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection is also coming to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p><h2>Once Upon A Katamari - October 24 (Switch)</h2><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Wo0qRu5EPM?rel=0&amp;controls=0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Wo0qRu5EPM?rel=0&amp;controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>This brand new entry in the popular (and strange) series sees the Prince rolling his signature ball through time itself. To rebuild the night sky, you’ll roll up anything and everything across various eras, such as the Jurassic Period, the Ice Age, and historic Japan. Once Upon a Katamari features new tools such as a magnet to attract nearby objects, a competitive online multiplayer mode called KatamariBall, and a new, original soundtrack. Thankfully, plenty of retuning tracks will appear, as well.</p><h2>Just Dance 2026 Edition - October 14 (Switch)</h2><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9kTZDfeR-Lg?rel=0&amp;controls=0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9kTZDfeR-Lg?rel=0&amp;controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>If you’ve been looking for a Switch game that lets you dance like a maniac to Smash Mouth’s “All Star”, Just Dance 2026 has you covered. The next entry in the annual rhythm game features 40 new tracks, including Dua Lipa’s “Houdini”, Madonna’s “Hung Up”, and One Republic’s “Counting Stars”. You can also grab a dance partner in the new co-op party mode.</p><h2>Dragon Ball Sparking! Zero - November 14 (Switch 2, Switch)</h2><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bx1bXpseMas?rel=0&amp;controls=0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bx1bXpseMas?rel=0&amp;controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The 2024 fighting game and new entry in the Tenkaichi series is instantly transmitting to Switch platforms. Now you can bring all 180+ characters (most of which are probably variations of Goku) anywhere you go. Additionally, a free update allows owners of the Switch version (physical and digital) to play the game on Switch 2 with visual enhancements.</p><h2>Plants vs Zombies: Replanted - October 23 (Switch 2, Switch)</h2><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zv1Q0_x93ZM?rel=0&amp;controls=0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zv1Q0_x93ZM?rel=0&amp;controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The original Plants vs Zombies is receiving a much-welcomed and overdue remaster.

We don’t know when it will release beyond the vague Winter window, but for Zelda fans, there was some interesting wording. They specifically used the word “canonical” when referring to the game’s story. The previous Hyrule Warriors game, Age of Calamity, was more or less not canon, which led to a very underwhelming conclusion for the game.</p>

<p>So far, the trailers for Age of Imprisonment have not featured Link at all, which, considering the timeline of the game, makes sense. But the tease at the end of the trailer could potentially be a reference to the Ancient Hero. I won’t go into detail on what that means here, but if you don’t mind some very, very late game (like well after you’ve beaten the game) spoilers for Tears of the Kingdom, you can head here.</p><h2>Madden NFL 26 - August 14 (Switch 2)</h2><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fnFJDh4-9w8"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fnFJDh4-9w8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The annual football game finally returns to Nintendo hardware.

			<p>2025 is shaping up to be the year of Ninja Gaiden. NG2 Black was released in January, the highly anticipated Gaiden 4 is due out in October, and now we have the return to the series’ 2D roots, Ragebound. While the 3D series focuses mainly on extreme difficulty and punishing gameplay, Dotemu have opted for an approach that takes clear influence from the NES games but benefits from much greater fluidity and quality of life improvements. The extreme difficulty is there if you want it, but here it’s an unlockable extra rather than the default.</p>
<p><iframe title="NINJA GAIDEN: Ragebound | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/II9CmTRac8M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As I laid out in my <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/10/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-is-the-perfect-mix-of-nostalgia-and-modern-game-design/">preview of Ragebound</a>, this game takes a departure from the usual protagonist, Ryu Hayabusa, and instead features Kenji Mozu – a redheaded protégé. Chronologically the game takes place during the events of the NES games when Ryu heads to America to follow the will of his dead father. As soon as Ryu sets out his village is attacked by demons and it is up to Kenji to fight them off. Along the way, Kenji finds out the origins of the attack but also has to team up with a member of the notorious Black Spider clan in order to defeat the Demon Lord.</p>


<p>Ragebound looks fantastic, with beautiful pixel graphics and smooth animation throughout. Layers of depth are added through the backgrounds whilst visual effects such as flames and lasers look how I remember 16-bit graphics looked – as opposed to how they actually look when you replay them. Enemies are varied and new forms of demon atrocities are introduced steadily throughout the game from possessed soldiers to eldritch monstrosities. Speaking of monstrosities the bosses are fantastically designed both visually and mechanically with each really challenging you to master the full range of your abilities.</p>
<p>Kenji himself has a small but effective range of skills with his katana being a powerful attack for most foes. Along with simply slashing enemies you can use a guillotine attack to bounce on enemies or obstacles to do damage but more crucially to navigate larger gaps and make more difficult jumps. This works surprisingly similar to the classic pogo attack in Duck Tales which is a NES influence I wasn’t expecting heading into the game. Later in the game you’ll also have access to a ranged attack as well as secondary weapons and powerful magic. To do so, however, requires a pact to be made with a long-time enemy.</p>


<p>A short while into the game, Kenji will track the enemy down to a demonic gate through which the mighty Demon Lord is hoping to emerge. To enable this, the Demons are collecting crystals which power the gate and Kenji must track down and destroy the powerful lieutenants holding each of these. At the same time Kumori, a Spider Clan assassin is sent to forge a deal with the Demon Lord. The two ninjas’ stories collide as each is mortally wounded and so they must link their souls in a magical rite in order to fend off the demon invasion. This narrative twist is neat but also unlocks a range of new abilities for Kenji.</p>
<p>Kumori exists as a spirit within Kenji and can be called upon to offer ranged attacks, the aforementioned secondary weapons which range from axes to umbrella shields, and, perhaps most importantly, powerful magical abilities which can prove the difference in boss battles. The first of these is the titular Ragebound attack and this does high damage to enemies across the screen. You can unlock further abilities through collecting items and successfully completing missions in each level, with new unlocks being blocked by specific ratings in a given level. I opted for a handy healing ability and this saw me through some of the more challenging encounters but a more offensive approach may suit you better.</p>
<p>As well as offering Kenji new abilities, Kumori can be controlled directly whenever Kenji interacts with demonic alters that release her spirit. These areas play out as timed platforming puzzles since Kumori’s energy is constantly depleting. Finding the optimal route through these areas whilst also shooting energy crystals to recover health provides some of the most memorable platforming parts of the game and the final boss requires you to have mastered this aspect to triumph.</p>

<p>Every level has hidden skulls and scarabs – the latter being the currency for buying new equippables from the merchant – as well as set objectives to complete as missions. These range from killing a certain number of a specific enemy to finishing the level without dying. Completing these and collecting all of the hidden items goes towards your ninja rank for each level and there is a great deal of replayability to be found in aiming for the best ranks – some of which can only be obtained through equipping items that offer severe disadvantages such as removing health pickups or even checkpoints entirely. Alternatively, there are accessibility options that enable you to tweak things if certain parts prove too frustrating</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound is a perfect entry in the series that makes for a great entry point and a standout experience in its own right. Smooth controls, fantastic level design and some perfectly judged boss battles make for one of the best 2D action-platformers you’ll find. With the extra layer of replaying levels for better ranks and the unlockable hard mode for the bravest ninjas, Ragebound provides plenty of enjoyment and challenge for those who want it, while also being approachable for newcomers.	</p></div>

            <p>Some people don't like cockroaches. I've always found them to be reliable mounts for the tiny gnome army via which I'll one day conquer the world. Anyway, forget I wrote that. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grounded-2">Grounded 2</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grounded-2s-early-access-gets-off-to-a-flying-start-as-obsidian-detail-the-next-year-of-updates">come out this week</a>, and as such folks have fired up their modding machines and got to work tweaking the garden survival extravaganza to their liking.</p>
<p>Let's see here, we've got some of the usual useful changes, texture swaps, and...ah. A mod designed to help folks who're afraid of cockroaches. It'll do just that, provided you're not also terrified of clowns, or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grounded-2-red-soldier-ant-egg-location">bugs</a> vaguely dressed like them.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I'm starting off with <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/grounded2/mods/20">this roach mod</a>, put together by gallant Arthurian knight/modder Sir_galahad172. They've had a good idea. Save the folks with phobias by arranging the cockroach equivalent of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grounded-2-arachnophobia-mode-spider-differences">arachnophobia mode</a> the game has to change eight-legged enemies into something less spidery.</p>
<p>Here's the thing, though. At first, I just saw the party hats and painted eyes they've given the roaches and thought oh, ok, they must be going for a Saturday night under the floorboards sort of vibe. Then I clocked the goofy shoes on each spindly limb and the red nose. Putting two and two together, this has to be a roach clown. Is it clowny enough to go off the deep end in the other direction and give nightmares to folks who can't sit through IT? I'm not sure, but you get a mixed review of your valiant attempt at making people un-scared, Sir Galahad.</p>
<p>To cut them some slack, I can throughly appreciate the fact they've swapped the SCAB scanner for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>'s <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/grounded2/mods/15">Pip-Boy</a>, in some Xbox brand synergy so synergistic Phil Spencer's probably just had to reach for the tissues. Ditto their spooky, scary skeletonising of the player character.</p>
<p>As you'd expect, they're not the only one at it. There are bunch of tweaks to the likes of <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/grounded2/mods/8">stack size</a> (all the way up to 999 if you want), <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/grounded2/mods/9">difficulty</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/grounded2/mods/13">player stats</a> from modder Caites. You can also chuck in a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/grounded2/mods/14">hasty port of an item spawner</a> for the first game and some <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/grounded2/mods/10">Mod Organiser 2 support</a>.</p>
<p>Overall, aside from the roach clown, it's close to what you'd expect for most big-ish games that've recently debuted on PC. We'll have to see if <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grounded">Grounded</a> 2 has the insect legs to outdo the fairly titchy total of 144 mods planted in its predecessor's backyard.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grounded-2-modding-kicks-off-with-cockroaches-dressed-as-clowns-which-is-good-for-bugphobes-so-long-as-they-arent-also-circusphobes]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>The Maxwell, Pascal, and Volta GPUs won't be totally abandoned after 2025; Nvidia says it will release quarterly security updates for these cards through October 2028. These updates won't optimize performance or fix bugs in any new games, but if you still have an older or hand-me-down PC using one of these cards to play <em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em>, you won't be leaving yourself open to GPU-related security exploits.</p>
<p>Nvidia has dropped hints that the end of support for these older GPUs was coming. The company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/nvidia-winding-down-support-for-older-gpus-including-the-legendary-750-ti-and-1060/">announced back in January</a> that CUDA support for the Maxwell, Pascal, and Volta architectures was considered "feature complete" and was being frozen. This is the first time since 2021 that Nvidia has dropped support for older GPUs.</p>
<p>As for Windows 10, Microsoft has been pushing users toward Windows 11 for years, including by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/microsoft-pushes-full-screen-ads-for-copilot-pcs-on-windows-10-users/">using full-screen ads</a> encouraging people to buy new Copilot+ PCs, but the older operating system still has a sizable user base. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/directx/">According to the Steam Hardware Survey</a>, Windows 10 is in decline, but it still powers over a third of the PCs in the survey as of June 2025, compared to a little over 60 percent for Windows 11.</p>

                <p>Persona 3 Reload is officially coming to Nintendo Switch 2 on October 23, 2025, as announced during Thursday's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-july-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6828/" data-ref-id="2900-6828">Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase</a>. This version arrives well after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/persona-3-reload-review-burn-your-dread/1900-6418171/" data-ref-id="1900-6418171">the game's initial release in February 2024</a> across PlayStation 4/5, Xbox One, Series X|S, and PC. Preorders will be available later today on the eShop.</p><p>Persona 3 Reload follows a high school student who transfers to Gekkoukan High and discovers a mysterious hidden hour known as the "Dark Hour," which occurs between one day and the next. During this time, the world transforms into a twisted, shadow-infested realm, and only a select few can remain conscious. The protagonist joins SEES (Specialized Extracurricular Execution Squad), a group of students who use powerful beings called Personas to battle Shadows and uncover the secrets behind the Dark Hour, Tartarus (a massive tower that appears only during this time), and a looming catastrophe tied to death itself.</p><p>A Switch port had been rumored for a while now, with Atlus initially <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/persona-3-reload-and-metaphor-refantazio-are-coming-to-switch-2-atlus-insider-claims/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">deciding against a Nintendo Switch version</a>. Developers previously admitted that "the idea is there" if the team opted to pursue it, but it was never truly planned for the original hardware, citing "performance concerns."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVcHF5_UtM0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hVcHF5_UtM0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Those same concerns aren't an issue for Switch 2. Persona 3 Reload was built using Unreal Engine 4, which presented some challenges when trying to port to the Switch. Switch 2, with updated hardware specifications such as 4K support, higher CPU/GPU performance, and increased memory bandwidth, seems to be better suited for the game's overall visuals.</p><p>Reload also contains additional scenes not featured in the original game or any of its re-releases, including new party interactions, dialogue, and fully voiced cutscenes. Every Social Link route is now completely voiced as well. Even exploration within Tartarus also features additional dialogue amongst the party, depending on who is taken into the dungeon at the time.</p><p>On its original release last year, Persona 3 Reload <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/persona-3-reload-is-atluss-fastest-selling-game/1100-6520927/" data-ref-id="1100-6520927">became Atlus' fastest-selling game</a>, with a million copies in its first week.</p>

            <p>Krafton has admitted that "talk about legal proceedings" surrounding the company following the delay of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> and changes within the development team could lead people to believe its internal milestone process is being "mismanaged".</p>
<p>However, Krafton's chief financial officer Dongkeun Bae wants to assure this is not the case, and actually somehow this is all a <em>good </em>example of how the company is managing its milestone process.</p>

<p>During an investor<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lghT4WUpgZQ"> Q&amp;A following Krafton's recent earnings report</a>, Bae said:</p>
<p>"For you to think that, regarding Subnautica 2 and looking at that case and thinking that within Krafton our milestone and development pipeline is not being well managed… there is a bit of, I believe, a reasoning leap or gap between those two points. I say that because the actions that we have taken on Subnautica 2 actually represent that things are effectively being managed inside Krafton when it comes to milestone management."</p>
<p>Bae added that because the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> IP has a large following already, he believes that as long as Krafton markets the sequel and then releases it, the game will get good sales regardless of any company politics.</p>
<p>"What we are seeking to do is, we want to make sure that we satisfy the highest level of satisfaction that the gamers have," Bae continued. "Because we have managed the whole milestone process very rigorously within the company, we were able to make the decision that we made regarding Subnautica 2."</p>
<p>The exec said Krafton did not believe Subnautica 2 was "up to par" or the "level" it had wished it to be, so the decision was made to delay the release. "I think that case goes to show that our milestone process is being rigorously managed," he concluded.</p>

<p>The story of Subnautica 2 has become quite a saga. Krafton initially delayed the release of Subnautica 2 from this year into 2026 earlier this month. Just prior to this, Krafton - which is the game's publisher - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-studio-leadership-replaced-by-krafton-despite-looming-early-access">ousted key members of the development and leadership team at Unknown Worlds</a>, including Charlie Cleveland, who was game director on the original Subnautica.</p>
<p>Krafton told Eurogamer the decision to delay Subnautica 2's early access release into 2026 was "under discussion" prior to any leadership changes at Unknown Worlds, adding feedback from playtests had "highlighted a few areas that could benefit from further refinement before release". At this time, Krafton claimed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-delayed-by-publisher-krafton-just-months-before-alleged-250m-payout-to-developers">delay wasn't to do with a reported bonus for the Subnautica 2 team should they have reached previously determined revenue targets</a>.</p>
<p>Soon after his dismissal, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lryw9o/what_is_a_wave_but_a_thousand_drops/">Cleveland shared a statement on reddit</a>, where he called recent events "quite a shock". In this same post, he said Subnautica 2 was in fact ready for its early access debut, despite what Krafton had suggested. Cleveland along with his fellow ousted leaders then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-drama-escalates-ousted-developers-launch-legal-action-as-krafton-accuses-them-of-abandoning-project">announced legal action against Krafton</a>, after the publisher shared a statement accusing the former employees of 'abandoning' the underwater survival sequel. A few days later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kraftons-ready-to-take-on-subnauticas-creators-in-court">Krafton said it "look[s] forward to defending itself in court"</a>.</p>
<p>We will keep you abreast of any further developments as and when they happen.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/krafton-defends-itself-amidst-subnautica-2-fiasco-says-milestone-process-is-being-rigorously-managed]]></content:encoded>
