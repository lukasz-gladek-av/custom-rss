		<p>The hardcore survival simulator Road To Vostok will launch into early access on April 7th, developer Antti has announced. To mark the announcement a new trailer has been released showing off new parts of Road To Vostok, including environments and dynamic events. The game will also launch with a discount of 25%, with the price set as €14,99, but that will rise to €19.99 two weeks after Road To Vostok’s launch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Early Access Trailer | Road to Vostok" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OTFgTRsz43Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Road To Vostok is a single player experience set in a post apocalyptic border area between Finland and Russia, and the are is called Area 05. In this region, players need to learn to survive, loot items, deal with other survivors, and plan every step before heading to Vostok. Preparation is heavily encouraged because once the first steps are taken into Vostok there is no going back, as it is a permadeath zone. While there are story elements around the world, Road To Vostok is a primarily sandbox experience so players can experience their own stories. The game will also support mods so there may also be new stories to experience created by the community.</p>
<p>When Road To Vostok eventually gets its full release it will feature 10 Area 05 maps, 10 Vostok maps, 10 Crossing Points, 10 Shelters, three trader types including generalists, gunsmiths, and doctor, three enemy types including bandits, guards, and the military, special NPCs like driver, grandma, shaman, fisherman, and scientists, over 300 weapons, and over 30 weapons. Road To Vostok will be launched on PC first, but console versions are being considered. In terms of multiplayer, no PvP content is being considered but Road To Vostok may eventually get co-op depending on the success on the single player release.</p>

<figure data-uuid="cc13a4900cb14"><a title="Red Alarm - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cc13a4900cb14/red-alarm-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Howdy, Virtual Boy fans! Welcome to another edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-duel-super-mario-advance-3-yoshis-island">Last time</a>, we matched up a pair of covers for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/super_mario_advance_3_yoshis_island">Super Mario Advance 3: Yoshi's Island</a>, and it was a pretty close-run contest. The classic SMW2 art came out on top in the end, though, with North America taking 59% of the vote, leaving the pretty Japanese variant with 41%.</p>
<p>This week, to mark the announcement of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/nintendo-announces-launch-line-up-for-switch-online-virtual-boy">Virtual Boy's Nintendo Switch Online launch line-up</a>, we're taking a look at one of the titles that you'll be able to play from 17th February: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/red_alarm">Red Alarm</a>. This <strong>Star Fox</strong>-style space shooter joins the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/teleroboxer">Teleroboxer</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/virtual_boy_wario_land">Virtual Boy Wario Land</a> on the service right from the jump, so it seems only right that we all become acquainted with its box art ahead of time.</p>
<p>Being a Virtual Boy title, there's obviously no European cover to look at this week, but the North American and Japanese designs make for a neat head-to-head. So, let's get into it.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/retro/related-articles:3793,196709 @ 1769944056 -->
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure data-uuid="9b139dcf8dc29"><a title="Red Alarm - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9b139dcf8dc29/red-alarm-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/14253-red-alarm">Nintendo / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The North American box art is just about as bright and colourful as they come. It's packed full of action with ships, explosions, a trench run backdrop vaguely reminiscent of the Death Star, and one of those green-outline maps that you only ever find in spy thrillers. Sure, it couldn't look less like the actual game, but it does a good job of selling the experience</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure data-uuid="a58c1fe1dc9df"><a title="Red Alarm - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a58c1fe1dc9df/red-alarm-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/14253-red-alarm">T&amp;E Soft / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ooooh, the Japanese design goes full <strong>Top Gun</strong>. This is less about action and more about looking cool (something that's not so simple with a Virtual Boy headset strapped to your noggin). Be it the muted colour palette of blacks and reds — a more realistic image of the vibrancy you'll see in game — or the badass ship reflection in the central pilot's visor, this cover oozes cool.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/mmorpg-ashes-of-creation-suddenly-implodes/</link>
            <guid>1422085</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Fantasy MMORPG <strong>Ashes of Creation</strong>, developed by <strong>Intrepid Studios</strong>, has suddenly imploded: with several key members already resigned and mass layoffs incoming, <strong>the game's future seems dead</strong>. A few hours ago, people started noticing that many employees had changed their LinkedIn status to 'open for work', including Director of Communications and Marketing <strong>Margaret Krohn</strong>, who only hinted at the circumstances <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7423531204198436864/?originTrackingId=7VqOggD80HGyVa1KG3AfeQ%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a LinkedIn blog post</a>:</p>



<p><em>As for how this all ended… I don’t really have the words. It wasn’t what I expected. But I’m holding onto the good because there was so much of it.</em></p>



<p>More information came to light when finally founder, CEO, and Creative Director <strong>Steven Sharif</strong> shared the following message in the official Ashes of Creation Discord channel:</p>



<p><em>I can make a limited statement in my personal capacity and not on behalf of the company, regarding the situation. Control of the company shifted away from me, and the Board began directing actions that I could not ethically agree with or carry out. As a result, I chose to resign in protest rather than lend my name or authority to decisions I could not ethically support. Following my resignation, much of the senior leadership team resigned. Following those departures, the Board made the decision to issue WARN Act notices and proceed with a mass layoff.</em></p>



<p><em>I cannot responsibly speak to further details at this time due to ongoing legal and governance matters. What I can say is that the developers and staff acted in good faith and deserved better than the uncertainty they are now facing. I am incredibly dismayed by the situation.</em></p>



<p>Sharif says in his statement that <strong>the Board made decisions that he did not feel comfortable carrying out</strong>. However, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AshesofCreation/comments/1qsm3r2/the_board_composed_of_me_and_my_husband/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to public records from the State of California</a>, <strong>the Board includes only him (as CEO and Secretary) and his husband, John Moore</strong>, who is listed as Chief Financial Officer.</p>



<p>Originally announced in 2016, Ashes of Creation <a href="https://wccftech.com/ashes-of-creation-funding-massive-mmorpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was funded on Kickstarter the following year</a>, <strong>earning over $3.2 million in pledges</strong>. Intrepid Studios then continued selling pre-release access to the game for a long time, and <strong>it did not take long for some users to warn that it could be a scam</strong>, especially because of the founder's past in the shady world of <strong>Multi-Level Marketing (MLM)</strong>. However, the development team posted regular updates, and the game did seem to be progressing, albeit very slowly. In late 2021, the studio <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ashes-of-creation-mmorpg-is-the-latest-game-to-upgrade-to-ue5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">switched from Unreal Engine 4 to Unreal Engine 5</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Eventually, last month, Intrepid made the decision to <strong>launch the MMORPG on Steam Early Access</strong> while it was still technically in Alpha. It was a controversial decision, especially because Sharif maintained that the game just needed more feedback from a wider player base, while funding was supposedly not an issue, as Sharif would contribute his own money, as he had from the start.</p>



<p>However, due to the game's blatantly incomplete state, reception to Ashes of Creation <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4124950/Ashes_of_Creation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam</a> was 'Mixed'. User reviews, both recent and total, sit at 51% right now. According to SteamDB, the MMO only reached a concurrent player peak of <strong>31.8K</strong> at launch and has dwindled ever since. Overall, sales estimates range between <strong>220K</strong> and <strong>320K</strong> units. This means the game earned between <strong>$11</strong> and <strong>$16</strong> <strong>million</strong> on Steam, although with Valve's 30% cut, the money that actually went to Intrepid ranges between <strong>$7.7</strong> and <strong>$11.2 million</strong>.</p>



<p>There's one last tidbit that dismayed backers have pointed out: in the original Kickstarter campaign, Intrepid <strong>had promised to refund all backers in full if the game did not launch</strong>. But it did launch, and people are wondering whether that wasn't simply a way to 'fulfill' that promise (which, however, was not legally binding).</p>



<p>Whatever the case, it's yet another blow <a href="https://wccftech.com/is-the-mmo-genre-dead-for-western-aaa-developers-we-asked-three-industry-veterans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to a genre that was already flailing</a> after several high-profile closures, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-gets-killed-off-amazon-just-as-people-were-returning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon's New World</a> and its in-development <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-game-studios-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-cancelled-again-amidst-mass-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new The Lord of the Rings MMO</a>. Speaking to <strong>Wccftech</strong>, two industry veterans, <strong>Greg Street</strong> and <strong>Jack Emmert</strong>, who also recently had their MMOs cancelled after NetEase pulled funding from their studios, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-model-future-western-mmo-jack-emmert-greg-street/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pointed to Warframe as the best model for Western developers</a></strong>: start small and slowly expand.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/vitality-push-bcgame-lower-bracket-iem-krakow/</link>
            <guid>1422076</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>IEM Krakow yielded a long-awaited clash between BC.Game’s Oleksandr ‘s1mple’ Kostyliev and Vitality’s Mathieu ‘ZywOo’ Herbaut this weekend. It was the first time in almost three years that the pair had met on the competitive stage, and it ended with s1mple’s squad being forced unceremoniously into the lower bracket at IEM Krakow.</p>



<p>It was almost a predictable outcome, and it comes after s1mple declared ZywOo as being the closest Counter-Strike pro player to his own ‘prime’ status, back in the day.</p>







<h2 id="h-into-the-lower-run-for-bc-game">Into The Lower Run for BC.Game</h2>



<p>BC.Game opened the series against Vitality with the upper hand, but quickly faltered, with Vitality shutting the door on the team in rapid fashion. The ZywOo-led squad dropped just <strong>one round </strong>before closing out the map in the second half, going on to eliminate BCG from the upper bracket with a decisive 13-5 finish.</p>



<p>Both ZywOo and s1mple held their own, with the former edging out the latter in the numbers, but it’s a team game at the end of the day, and Vitality was the better unit on stage.</p>



<p>Before IEM Krakow, the two superstar competitors hadn’t met since Gamers8 in 2023, hosted in Saudi Arabia. The event has long since been rebranded as the Esports World Cup, but it was the last time that the two gamers shared a stage on opposing sides of the table.</p>



<p>Despite the loss, BC.Game’s journey in Krakow is far from over. They’re now in the lower bracket of their group, and while they have to focus squarely on survival, they have a chance to produce a huge upset over FaZe Clan tomorrow, February 2nd. The squad, featuring the talents of broky, karrigan, frozen, jcobb, and Twistzz, was also pushed into the lower run, but by a dominant 3DMAX side.</p>







<p>What are your expectations for BC.Game at IEM Krakow? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>VALORANT’s next Night Market event lands on February 5th and runs to March 2nd, allowing players to secure sweet skins for a discount. The trouble is, you won’t know what skins are in<strong> your </strong>Night Market until the event kicks off, as players are offered <strong>six randomized skins</strong>, rather than the option to choose a specific selection.</p>



<p>Below, we’ve outlined the full spread of VALORANT skins coming to the Night Market this February. Take a look and see if there’s anything you’re hoping to unlock.</p>







<h2 id="h-full-list-of-valorant-night-market-skins">Full List of VALORANT Night Market Skins</h2>



<p>VALORANT’s Night Market is a sought-after and anticipated event that surfaces a few times a year. It offers some deep discounts on the game’s best skins and allows players to secure skins that might have long since disappeared from the active store rotation.</p>



<p>Typically, the Night Market <strong>only </strong>features skins from a select few tiers of the ecosystem, locking out Exclusive and Ultra skins, which are much more valuable and boast higher price tags that Riot Games just doesn’t want to discount!</p>



<p>If you’re waiting for the full list of Night Market skins for February’s run, you don’t have to look any further than <strong>right here:</strong></p>

<p>ConcernedApe has addressed concerns (does that work?) surrounding Haunted Chocolatier, the next major release from the developer of Stardew Valley, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stardew-valley-smashes-steam-record-portal-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most positively rated game</a> ever released. In a recent blog post, ConcernedApe came out to answer questions and quell fears from fans about Haunted Chocolatier’s lengthy development cycle.</p>



<p>It has been years since Haunted Chocolatier was announced, but ConcernedApe stressed that, while it’s taking a while to finish, it’s <strong>absolutely </strong>still coming.</p>







<h2 id="h-i-am-not-going-to-abandon-haunted-chocolatier">‘I Am Not Going to Abandon Haunted Chocolatier’</h2>



<p>ConcernedApe, whose real name is Eric Barone, released Stardew Valley almost a decade ago, in February 20216. His second game, Haunted Chocolatier, has a similar vibe and was unveiled in 2021. In <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/2026/01/28/update-im-still-working-like-always/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent blog post</a>, Barone admitted he announced it way too early, but he ‘had his reasons’.</p>



<p>He then went into more depth about some key concerns regarding the game, such as the leading worry that it might have been abandoned by the solo developer, and the scrapped content would be pulled into Stardew.</p>



<p>He said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>No. First, I am not going to abandon Haunted Chocolatier. But even if I did, I am not going to add it to Stardew Valley. Stardew Valley and Haunted Chocolatier are separate games. </p>



<p>It doesn’t even make sense from a technical perspective, as Haunted Chocolatier is written from scratch, it’s not the same “engine” as Stardew Valley. You can’t just copy and paste Haunted Chocolatier into Stardew Valley.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Barone has turned his attention to Stardew Valley again, working on a critical update to appease the millions of people who still play the game. He said that he’s only working on Stardew again because it’s such a drastically popular game and he ‘still has additional ideas for how to improve it.’</p>



<p>In the closing sections of the blog post, Barone confirmed that Haunted Chocolatier still doesn’t have a release window, but it’s <strong>not </strong>cancelled or abandoned.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ashes of Creation is an ambitious MMORPG that was released in early access in December 2025. The launch came after almost a decade of playtests, production, and evolution, but it has met a vicious end as the entire studio behind the game has crumbled. In this guide, we’re answering a clear question: ‘Is Ashes of Creation shutting down?’</p>



<p>It seems like the writing is firmly on the wall with Ashes of Creation, which was released just weeks ago by Intrepid Studios onto the Steam platform, but what’s the truth of it?</p>







<h2 id="h-what-happened-to-ashes-of-creation">What Happened to Ashes of Creation?</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ashes-of-creation-collapse-entire-intrepid-studios-laid-off/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ashes of Creation <strong>imploded</strong></a><strong> </strong>around February 1st, 2026. On social media, reports surfaced of Intrepid Studios, the game’s developer, facing complete and indiscriminate layoffs after the studio’s leadership team collectively resigned.</p>



<p>Ashes of Creation’s Steven Sharif, Intrepid’s founder and the game’s creative director, explained in a statement that ‘the Board’ wrestled control of the company away from him, prompting <strong>his </strong>resignation. However, a subsequent investigation determined that Sharif might have been the <strong>sole member </strong>of the Board.</p>



<p>Ashes of Creation’s team has been completely laid off, and what’s worse, the company’s financial position meant that final paychecks couldn’t be processed. This is despite the game selling approximately 250,000 – 300,000 copies on Steam, under a $49.99 price tag.</p>



<p><strong>A global shutdown of Ashes of Creation is almost guaranteed</strong>, but at the time of writing, the game remained live on Steam. Intrepid Studios, however, has collapsed, and as of this point, has no staff to work on the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-ashes-of-creation-refund">How to Get Ashes of Creation Refund</h2>



<p>If you’ve played Ashes of Creation for less than two hours on Steam, you can collect a refund via Valve’s internal support channels, but if you’ve played for <strong>more </strong>than two hours, you’re not entitled to an instant refund.</p>



<p>However, you can still <strong>try </strong>to go through the customer support channels, as this is an extraordinary circumstance.</p>



<p>Many have predicted that class action lawsuits will surface, especially given the suspicious timing of the Ashes of Creation shutdown. The game’s Kickstarter always stated that if the game didn’t launch on Steam, full refunds to all backers would be issued. Even though it was only live on Steam for mere weeks, that clause was effectively fulfilled.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ashes of Creation, an old-school MMORPG that dropped in an alpha state on Steam after <strong>years </strong>of development, has imploded this weekend. The game has been struck with a total collapse, as the team at Intrepid Studios has either resigned or been laid off. It was just two days ago that the team at Intrepid was posting updates and promising a roadmap of improvements to the game.</p>



<p>In a recent message on the game’s Discord server, the company’s founder and creative director for AoC, Steven Sharif, made a damning statement about the situation. He stressed he was forced to resign after ‘control of the company’ was shifted away from him, prompting a walkout that ultimately led to the entire remaining company being laid off.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-ashes-of-creation-shutting-down">Is Ashes of Creation Shutting Down?</h2>



<p>It’s almost <strong>guaranteed </strong>that Ashes of Creation, the ambitious, old-school MMORPG that was in development for almost a decade, will disappear forever. In his statement on the AoC Discord server, company founder <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1qsldun/ashes_of_creation_has_just_been_canceled_all/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steven Sharif wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I can make a limited statement in my personal capacity and not on behalf of the company, regarding the situation.</p>



<p>Control of the company shifted away from me, and the Board began directing actions that I could not ethically agree with or carry out. As a result, I chose to resign in protest rather than lend my name or authority to decisions I could not ethically support.</p>



<p>Following my resignation, much of the senior leadership team resigned. Following those departures, the Board made the decision to issue WARN Act notices and proceed with a mass layoff.</p>



<p>I cannot responsibly speak to further details at this time due to ongoing legal and governance matters. What I can say is that the developers and staff acted in good faith and deserved better than the uncertainty they are now facing. I am incredibly dismayed by the situation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On Steam’s community forums, users came forward to declare the situation a ‘pump and dump scam’, with some suggesting that class action lawsuits should be sprung up to chase refunds.</p>



<p>However, that might be easier said than done. In a video shared on social media, an internal communication was shared, explaining that ‘all job titles and all positions’ would be hit by an ‘entire and permanent plant closing’. It was then explained that the expected payroll set to run on February 1 will <strong>not </strong>happen because of the company’s financial position.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>𝐀𝐒𝐇𝐄𝐒 𝐎𝐅 𝐂𝐑𝐄𝐀𝐓𝐈𝐎𝐍 𝐋𝐎𝐎𝐊𝐒 𝐓𝐎 𝐁𝐄 𝐒𝐇𝐔𝐓𝐓𝐈𝐍𝐆 𝐃𝐎𝐖𝐍</p><p>What some players thought would be the answer to all their MMO questions has come to an abrupt end with Game Director for Ashes of Creation (<a href="https://twitter.com/StevenJSharif?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@StevenJSharif</a>) stepping down.</p><p>The news comes after more… <a href="https://t.co/q1q53dJX0x">pic.twitter.com/q1q53dJX0x</a></p></div>— N_Tys (@N_Tys26) <a href="https://twitter.com/N_Tys26/status/2017792177167036842?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 1, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>That means that employees under the WARN notice will <strong>not </strong>be paid, which will undoubtedly prompt financial suits.</p>



<p>If you load <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4124950/Ashes_of_Creation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ashes of Creation’s Steam page</a> <strong>right now</strong>, you still have the option to purchase it for £41.99 ($49.99). According to SteamDB’s aggregate systems, as many as 319,000 people may have purchased Ashes of Creation, which averages out to around $14 million.</p>



<p>Those customers who picked up this early access title that has now been dropped just a month after release will be <strong>demanding </strong>satisfaction and compensation.</p>



<p>Popular creator ‘Pirate Software’ addressed the situation on socials, standing up for the developer somewhat:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Not really. At that time in development the game was doing just fine. Stuff was moving forward and the areas of the game he showed weren't actually flat featureless environments as he described.</p><p>It wasn't until the last 6-8 months that shit really hit the fan and fell apart.…</p></div>— Pirate Software (@PirateSoftware) <a href="https://twitter.com/PirateSoftware/status/2017849283043827851?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 1, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Bizarrely, the situation took <strong>another turn </strong>when eagle-eyed and investigative fans turned up registration information for Intrepid Studios that confirmed <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1qsnhhx/intrepid_studios_board_of_directors_is_just_steven/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steven Sharif as the sole Board member</a>. This was taken from a filing made on December 30, 2025, and it lists Sharif as the CEO and an individual named John Moore as the CFO. </p>



<p>Sharif is the only named director on the Board, per the document. </p>



<p>On social media, users noticed a troubling clause <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1791529601/ashes-of-creation-new-mmorpg-by-intrepid-studios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in the game’s Kickstarter</a>, which explained that if the game <strong>doesn’t launch on Steam</strong>, full refunds will be issued to all backers. Well, guess what? The game <strong>launched on Steam,</strong> so that promise was effectively fulfilled. Coincidence?</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-february-1-966/</link>
            <guid>1422037</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s a whole new month, and that means it’s time to smash another batch of NYT Connections puzzles! I’m here as always to provide you with the best NYT Connections hints and solutions so you can start February on the upswing with a series of instant successes. Below, you’ll find all the hints and tips you need to get through today’s NYT Connections as quickly as possible.</p>



<p>Enjoy!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-february-1">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (February 1)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will prompt your brain to take action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #966:</p>



<ul>
<li>WEDGE</li>



<li>HYPE</li>



<li>MORGAN</li>



<li>FLAT</li>



<li>BOP</li>



<li>THORN</li>



<li>BOOST</li>



<li>MULE</li>



<li>HEATER</li>



<li>SHARP</li>



<li>JAM</li>



<li>PLUG</li>



<li>GLUTE</li>



<li>CLOG</li>



<li>PITCH</li>



<li>BANGER</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Ways to talk something up</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Footwear with a twist</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> –<em> Tracks that absolutely go off</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Hidden instruments</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, February 1:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-explained-for-today-february-1-966">NYT Connections Answers Explained for Today, February 1 (#966)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– BOOST, HYPE, PITCH, PLUG</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – CLOG, FLAT, MULE, WEDGE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BANGER, BOP, HEATER, JAM</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – GLUTE, MORGAN, SHARP, THORN</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a> is a whole new take on the world of Pokémon, where you'll be able to farm, grow veggies, collect resources, build things, decorate, and of course, make friends with many different Pokémon.</p>
<p>With the game scheduled to arrive on the Switch 2 on <strong>5th March 2026</strong>, more pre-order bonuses are now beginning to surface online. As highlighted by Serebii.net, the latest one is available on Amazon in the US and Best Buy in Canada.</p>
<p>If you order the game from either of these places before the release date, you'll get a download code for a 'Flat Leaf Plant' item, which can be used to decorate spaces in the game. The same bonus has been previously made available on the Amazon store in Japan.</p>

<p>If you're not planning on getting Pokémon Pokopia from these stores, you'll apparently still be able to get this plant through regular gameplay. So no trainer should miss out!</p>
<p>Once again, Pokémon Pokopia launches exclusively for the Switch 2 this March. You can see what other <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/where-to-pre-order-pokemon-pokopia-for-nintendo-switch-2">pre-order offers and bonuses</a> there are in our guide here on Nintendo Life, and find out more about the game in our previous coverage.</p>

            <p>
Crafting a world that begs to be explored is a tricky thing to do, especially when the world is kind of sucky, doubly so when it's woven mostly through words with only supplementary imagery to provide a broader context. Yet <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/citizen-sleeper">Citizen Sleeper's</a> is one I'm often thinking about because amongst all the grand sci-fi concepts is a grounded sense of reality that you'll always find in the best of the cyberpunk genre. And here I am, a year on from the second game's release, tempted to return once more, but this time in a form based on its tabletop origins.
</p>
<p>
Citizen Sleeper: Spindlejack is not technically a new game, it actually came out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/citizen-sleeper-now-has-a-free-solo-tabletop-rpg">last May</a> as a free-to-download mini-RPG, but now through Lost in Cult it is being turned into a tangible, physical thing you can add to your dragon's hoard of tabletop RPGs. Spindlejack takes place in a particular corner of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector">Citizen Sleeper 2's</a> world, on the Far Spindle, a place where the airbike riders are "notorious." It's a solo TTRPG, where you fly around said airbike making tricky deliveries for "cryo, reputation and fun."

<p>
Where this release mainly differs is obviously the physicality, coming with a set of 10 themed D6 dice, some fancy bits of informative paper, and stickers, but it also comes with a couple of additional modules. One is Sprocket's Shop, which comes with new upgrades and items for some added tactics and techniques. The other is a story-based one, Kadet's Climb, where you play as Kadet from the original video game, who is "trying to survive on the far Spindle as she rises up through the ranks of the station's most infamous delivery couriers."
</p><p>
I am certainly quite tempted by such a luxurious item, but again, none of us have to feel FOMO as it's available to play for free through <a href="https://jump-over-the-age.itch.io/citizen-sleeper-spindlejack">itch.io</a>. If it is something you're interested in however, <a href="https://www.lostincult.co.uk/citizensleeper2">here's a handy link for you</a>.

            <p>
There are not enough games in the world where it feels like the initial concept was born from the thought, "wouldn't it be funny if…" I'm no fool, I know this is because developing a video game is akin to getting hit by a car, miraculously coming away from it unscathed, only to be hit by six more cars as you continue your journey. In any case, this is still how I would like to imagine Trust Me, I Nailed It was born, a turn-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game where you have to make cool video edits of some warrior to make him seem like a monster slaying legend.
</p>
<p>
This is, through and through, a ridiculous concept, one that aesthetically maybe doesn't mesh entirely well, but I am still clowning with all the same. This is one of those fake OS kind of games a la <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hypnospace-outlaw">Hypnospace Outlaw</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/her-story">Her Story</a>, with the main bit of faux software you use being World Movie Weaver (i.e., Windows Movie Maker).

<p>
On your timeline, rather than finding the usual video section and audio section, there is an enemy attack pattern section, pre-filled, showing you exactly where an enemy will strike on the grid-based battlefield, and the warrior's attack pattern section, which you are dictating in the edit. You can drag different clips to make the warrior move, perform different types of or block attacks, there's "post-processing" modifiers that let him teleport, or even just take no damage at all. It's movie magic, baby.
</p><p>
Little bits of story are then relayed through emails and posts on MSN (Mana Scroll Network (nice once)), where you can see whether people believe this actually quite cowardly hero is as cool as you've edited him to be or not.
</p>
<p>
The lack of aesthetic meshing I mention is because the hero scenes are all sort of generic fantasy, and the fake OS honestly just looks straight up like Windows 98. I wish there was a stronger sense of identity, what would an operating system look like in a fantasy world? How would technology impact the world, and magic, in kind? This is just a small gripe, though, the concept is fun enough that I won't lose sleep over it. Plus it'll be free! Can't complain about free.
</p>
<p>
It's also due out really soon, as it's currently slated for release next week on February 6th, so in the meantime, you can wishlist it right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4311000/Trust_Me_I_Nailed_It/">here</a>.

<p>The latest trailer for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26/" id="172879">WWE 2K26</a> highlights some gameplay changes and showcases a version of CM Punk that has never officially appeared in a video game.</p>



<p>During the WWE Royal Rumble event, a new gameplay trailer premiered for the upcoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/wwe-2k26/" id="3461">WWE 2K26</a> video game. The trailer showcased the returning Inferno Match, the debut of the Dumpster Match, the return of the ability to stack tables, and the return of thumbtacks in WWE games for the first time since WWE Legends of WrestleMania in 2009.</p>



<p>Another key focus was the reveal of CM Punk’s Ring of Honor gear. CM Punk was shown in a square-off with his younger self. Ring of Honor is a promotion that launched the careers of wrestlers like CM Punk, Samoa Joe, and Bryan Danielson. The CM Punk model also featured his blonde hair from the early days of his career, from 2002 to 2003. This is the first time that this young version of CM Punk has been officially on display in a wrestling game.</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>As first reported by Insider Gaming, the WWE 2K26 Showcase campaign features the career of CM Punk. It will also be narrated by CM Punk and tease some what-if matches that could have taken place had Punk not left WWE nearly a decade back in 2014.</p>



<p>CM Punk is also the cover Superstar this year. His first time on the cover since WWE ’13 back in 2012. That game also featured a spotlight on the WWE Attitude Era, as this game will. The WWE Attitude Era edition of the game will cost $129.99. See all game prices at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-pricing-revealed-for-all-editions/" id="172964">this link.</a></p>

            <p>
You know, I'm surprised that EA has never made a Sims reality show where contestants have to act out odd, Simish challenges on a Truman Show-esque production lot, given how much the games themselves feel like simulators for the trashiest (said lovingly) TV show genre. In the meantime, while it isn't at all themed reality shows, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4's</a> next expansion, Royalty &amp; Legacy, seems like a perfect fit for a fictitious one of your own making.
</p>
<p>
A new gameplay trailer showed off how the packs dynasty system works, which is very much about family values. Starting your own dynasty begins with things like choosing your family crest, those aforementioned values, and the family members (or otherwise) you want included. There's also a prestige and unity meter, which can be affected in different ways, like, say, stabbing a mannequin, or getting a promotion because you're a nepo baby.
</p>

<p>
Your Sims also have personal ranks, and lowering the prestige and unity meter may also lower their rank, and another member could challenge your leadership. And then you can just start a new one, so who gives a hoot! There's even some conspiracy nonsense, affairs, scandals to take advantage of, can you see why I think this is ripe for a reality TV show scenario? That'll be up to you to figure out though.
</p><p>
Alongside all of that, there's three new neighborhoods to shape to your will, each of which is already ruled by a pre-established dynasty. Sims can now perform powershifts, which "add fantasy, storybook twists to your royal tale," according to a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/royalty-and-legacy-expansion-pack">blog post</a> about the expansion pack, where they might pull the sword in the stone, or flirt with a fancy frog. Said blog post goes into a lot more detail about what you can expect, so head there for more.
</p>
<p>
You've not got long to wait for the new expansion pack, as it's currently slated for release on February 12th, just under a couple of weeks away.

            <p>Phasmophobia developer Kinetic Games has shared its 2026 roadmap, complete with hints of four seasonal events, two reworked maps, one completely new location, and a load of "major updates", including the player character overhaul, a Unity 6 update, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> release, and, of course, that highly-anticipated 1.0 release.</p>
<p>And it all starts pretty soon, too. That player character overhaul - which some had hoped would release last year - should be out by March, complete with free cosmetics, new character models, and "fine-tuned animations".</p>

<p>"Brave ghost hunters will need to gear up for a host of new spooks and scares, with the pivotal 1.0 launch set to release across all platforms simultaneously this year," Kinetic teased. "Set to be one of the biggest moments since the game's launch, players can expect lots of surprises, as this will also include what was previously known as Horror 2.0."</p><p>Following on from the reworked farmhouse maps, Willow Street and Tanglewood are the next residential maps to get the decorators in. While Tanglewood's layout will remain "similar" (interestingly, the same is not said of Willow Street, which is my personal favourite), players can expect "a range of new interactions, a few small layout changes, and more."</p>

<p>"For those with a keen eye, there's also a mystery lurking in the shadows of 6 Tanglewood Drive waiting to be uncovered," the team added.</p>
<p>As for the new map? Kinetic is playing its cards very close to its chest on that one, but it did tease that along with the return of the usual seasonal events, a mysterious one-time event is also planned for later this year, too.</p><p>"This year is set to be a big one for Phasmophobia, and we are so excited for our 1.0 launch, which will be one of the biggest moments since we released the game," said Daniel Knight , Kinetic CEO and game director of Phasmophobia.</p>
<p>"We are constantly working on creating a truly immersive experience for ghost hunters, and have been developing the game with this in mind. Previous updates including Chronicle and our upcoming Player Character update have all been steps in fulfilling our vision, and we hope the 1.0 launch will feel as fresh and exciting as when the game first launched back in 2020."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a> developer Kinetic Games reckons 2026 will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/2026-will-be-one-of-the-biggest-years-in-the-history-of-co-op-ghosthunting-game-phasmophobia">"one of the biggest [years] in the game's history" as it moves towards the full release of the game</a>. In an update shared at the beginning of the year, the team says we can expect to see "more immersive animations" added to the early access ghosthunting game, such as physically seeing your character model turn on your EMF Reader, opening and closing doors, and picking up or dropping equipment.</p>

<p>I know, the 'precog' machine in that particular movie wasn't really a 3D printer, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2n7SXUM9m0">Tom's wee red balls</a> seemed to be made of some sort of weird wood rather than filament, but it was the same sort of magic inside my simple mind, and the first time I'd considered a machine that could create a fully 3D object in this way. So the two are forever connected, I'm afraid.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ovhzyi&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Now that I am the owner of a 3D printer, now that we live in the actual future, and not that far off from where Tom Cruise and his wee red balls (and that really angry dude with the blonde hair) exist, I have to say, it feels rather mind-blowing to be able to create so many <em>things</em> so very readily.</p>
<p>I'm excited, is what I'm trying to say, and as a very excited gamer, you can bet your bottom Rupee that the first thing I've done with my precious new printer is dive headlong into a whole new world of knocking out my own accessories and smart little bits and bobs for my beloved Nintendo consoles. Oh yes, my sweet babies, daddy is going to take care of you now, you better believe it.</p>

<p>Sorry. Yes. I've been busy pumping rolls of filament into a big noisy machine that's currently located in my sitting room (*cries in wife*), browsing all of the sites and taking all of the notes on the best unofficial docks, grips, cartridge holders (and lots more) that are currently out there for 3D-printing fiends.</p>
<p>So, without any more nonsense, let's get on with taking a look at some of the best I've found and printed thus far, shall we?</p>
<nav><ul><li><span title="On This Page"></span></li></ul>
</nav>
<h2 id="a-quick-lesson-in-3d-printing-jargon">A quick lesson in 3D printing jargon</h2>
<p>To be as helpful as possible to anyone who might be browsing for something to 3D-print, I'll be dropping the time it takes to print off each of the objects I've made, as well as how much filament I've used to create each one. So, let's talk about a few simple things first.</p>
<p>There are different types of 3D printer out there. You could go with a resin one, which I have heard does <em>slightly</em> better fine details on models, or, like me, roll with a filament machine. This was an easy choice in my case as I have a busy house and some companies, such as Bambu Labs (other brands are available, but it's <a href="https://uk.store.bambulab.com/products/p1s?srsltid=AfmBOor04U7NzjPojHuBAs55yckzd5ur_qvEiSJKtOYVuLfRRA9SpSYS&amp;id=578772891943051270">Bambu Labs' P1S with AMS</a> that I'm using here) have got a sort of Apple design aspect going on that makes it so you can have a printer in your house and it almost looks nice, and without any unreasonably bad mess or fuss. Well, it's a bit noisy sometimes, but not so much that it keeps me awake on a night print.</p>
<figure data-uuid="68c258caaa1d0"><a title="3D Printing Guide" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/68c258caaa1d0/3d-printing-guide.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: PJ O'Reilly / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Filament is bought in rolls of colour ranging from bog-standard to fancy with reflective textures, wood effect, glow in the dark, holographic - basically anything you can think of. There are also different types, grades and levels of filament for different jobs. Oh, and you can change out your printing plate for different textured finishes on your plastic creations, too. So maybe you'll want a brick-grid one for Mario walls, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>For the models below, I'm keeping everything as cheap as possible, using basic PLA filament from a generic brand, but you could also grab PLA+ and onwards and upwards into tough and hard-wearing varieties, or go in other directions for the appropriate material to build, for example, a light and flexible insole for your shoe.</p>
<h2 id="where-to-find-the-designs-to-print">Where to find the designs to print</h2>
<p>All of the designs I've used can be found at <a href="https://makerworld.com/en">Makerworld.com</a>, or you can also grab them off the Bambu Handy app, if you've already got that installed on a device, and I'll drop links to the creations as we go through them as well!</p>

<h2 id="all-the-best-stuff-ive-3d-printed-so-far">All the best stuff I've 3D-printed so far</h2>
<h3 id="mario-warp-pipe-controller-stand-with-storage-for-7-game-carts">Mario Warp Pipe Controller Stand (with storage for 7 game carts)</h3>

<p>This was my first Switch-related print, and it's a belter!</p>
<p>A nice, easy first print to get started, with no complications such as adding supports or any of that nonsense. This controller holder includes the warp pipe itself along with a smart little insert which can manage a grand total of seven of your precious Switch carts.</p>
<p>I had no green filament left when I printed this off, so I've gone with an orange one, but I will be painting it gold very shortly with some acrylic paint! Yessir. SPECIAL PIPE.</p>
<p><strong>Time To Print:</strong> 1 hour 48 minutes<br>
<strong>Filament Cost:</strong> 64g<br>
<strong>Creator/Creation Link:</strong> <a href="https://makerworld.com/en/models/1502329-nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-stand-warp-pipe#profileId-1571705">Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller Stand Warp by @Dave_D_W -</a></p>
<h3 id="nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-2-snap-lock-grip">Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con 2 Snap Lock Grip</h3>

<p>I actually wanted one of these, and so instead of stumping up a wad of cash-cash-money, I've quickly knocked out this very impressive alternative.</p>
<p>There's not much that can go wrong with this sort of design, except perhaps the smaller attachments that keep the Joy-Con in place, but there were zero issues and it's a great fit. In terms of toughness and look/feel, it's also just as good as anything I'd likely find in a store.</p>
<p>To use, you hook on the left and right locking grip, by attaching to the top and bottom of your Joy-Con, then insert the controller into the main body of the grip to push the lock in there permanently. You can now easily click your Joy-Con in and out. Also, it's really light grip, so bonus points for comfort.</p>
<p><strong>Time To Print:</strong> Main Body takes 1.2 hours, whilst the left and right locking grips are 10 minutes each<br>
<strong>Filament Cost:</strong> 25g for the main body, and 10g per grip lock, for a total of 45g<br>
<strong>Creator/Creation Link:</strong> <a href="https://makerworld.com/en/models/1514088-nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-2-snap-lock-grip?from=search#profileId-1586658">Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con Snap Lock Grip By Manabun Lab</a></p>
<h3 id="nintendo-switch-1-andamp-2-game-display-storage-10-slot-version">Nintendo Switch 1 &amp; 2 Game Display Storage - 10 Slot Version</h3>

<p>This very useful display storage is well worth printing out for any serious (and very professional) Switch gamer, such as myself, as not only can it hold lots of lovely game cases and some carts at the front (with gaps so you can see their stickers!), it can also be added to a clever wall-mounted system - for which you print off a few extra parts.</p>
<p>Also, the size can be adjusted from a 4-case holder all the way up to a big 18 model. So there's lots of choice here, and you can add to the storage over time. I've gone with the 10 slot version for this print, and I'll be honest, I should have gone with the 4 because I'm a <em>very</em> futuristic man who is almost 100% digital on the Switch game front these days. Physical media is Dickensian in my eyes. That's right, take your 'cartridges' out of my sight.</p>
<p><strong>Time To Print:</strong> 2hrs 50mins<br>
<strong>Filament Cost:</strong> 92g<br>
<strong>Creator/Creation Link:</strong> <a href="https://makerworld.com/en/models/931008-nintendo-switch-1-2-game-display-storage?from=search#profileId-1077875">Nintendo Switch 1 &amp; 2 Game Display Storage By AkiPrint</a></p>
<h3 id="nintendo-switch-2-zelda-royal-crest-dock-cover">Nintendo Switch 2 Zelda 'Royal Crest' Dock Cover</h3>

<p>Why waste time printing off an entire dock when you can just make a faceplate to hide the unrelenting grim blackness (looks dark grey to me, to be honest) of Nintendo's vanilla offering? This is my biggest print thus far, clocking in at 6.5 hours and costing 204g of tasty filament, but the result, especially if you choose a snazzy filament or paint the result, is well worth it!</p>
<p>There are tons of cool Nintendo-themed plates and docks to choose from out there, and you could go crazy with fancy filaments such as gun metal and realistically shiny gold to really make this Zelda one pop off. Also, the design I've printed off here, which I've linked to below, has a whole bunch of other covers to choose from once you click into its printing screen.</p>
<p>As you can see, I've been a right bore and gone with the classic option, but you can be damn sure I'll be firing up 'Auld Betsy' later to print myself off a Yiga Clan one.</p>
<p><strong>Time To Print:</strong> 6hrs 30mins<br>
<strong>Filament Cost:</strong> 204g<br>

<h3 id="nintendo-switch-1-andamp-2-mini-game-cases">Nintendo Switch 1 &amp; 2 Mini Game Cases</h3>

<p>What's better than having a whole bunch of Switch or Switch 2 game cases on your shelves? I'll tell you what, having a whole bunch of <em>mini</em> Switch or Switch 2 game cases on your shelves. Mate, that's what.</p>
<p>These may, at first glance, seem as though they are meant to be more for fun than anything else. However, they do also provide some much-needed protection. In fact, they are actually a great space-saving idea if you usually cart your cases around when going mobile.</p>
<p>One thing with these: the basic PLA I used seemed a little brittle at first, but the edges do soften up when you bend them, then you're free to add any covers you want to print off and add.</p>
<p>As you can see, I ran out of time on decorating this one, but jump to the link below to see how amazing a printed cover makes them look. Oh, and that all-important click as you snap the cat into place is reassuringly present.</p>
<p><strong>Time To Print:</strong> 19 minutes per case<br>
<strong>Filament Cost:</strong> 8g per case<br>

<h3 id="switchrest-car-headrest-mount-for-switch-2">SwitchRest Car Headrest Mount For Switch 2</h3>

<p>When I'm out and about and being driven around by either my wife or children, I like to recline fully in the back seat and make full use of my time by playing my beloved video games whilst yodelling loudly. No talking when daddy is playing his games and yodelling, please. Not unless you're offering me a snack. Thanks.</p>
<p>So, given my life preferences, it seems obvious that I might want an in-car Switch console holder. Of course I do. And this one is nice and quick and very straightforward to print, too!</p>
<p>There are lots of designs for car holders out there, and some of them get very fancy with retro NES looks and so on. However, the way this one hooks on is, perhaps, one of the better designs. It's very solid and secure as it hooks onto the fully extended kickstand, holding the console firmly in place. Oh, and it just happens to take way less time and materials than most of the rest.</p>
<p>Now I can combat boredom as my wife drives me to the local sweet shop by indulging in a little <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/race_with_ryan_road_trip_deluxe_edition">Race With Ryan</a> in the car. Hey, it feels like I'm really driving!</p>
<p><strong>Time To Print:</strong> 51 minutes<br>

<h3 id="nintendo-switch-multi-game-case-mario-mushroom-edition">Nintendo Switch Multi-Game Case (Mario Mushroom Edition)</h3>

<p>These delightful little containers hold four game carts and are absolutely fantastic quality when you see them finished off. The twisting mechanism on the top here actually surprised me with how robust and smooth it is. These will 100% properly protect and take care of your carts.</p>
<p>What's more, as with anything else you 3D print, you can change the size, so you could have a giant version, a 50% scaled-up version or whatever you fancy. There is also, of course, the opportunity to go wild with colours, matching all in-game types and maybe doing some weird trippy ones while you're at it. Hey, they are mushrooms, amirite? Hello? Mario?</p>
<p><strong>Time To Print:</strong> 3 hours per mushroom<br>
<strong>Filament Cost:</strong> 38g<br>

<h3 id="articulated-ancient-guardian">Articulated Ancient Guardian</h3>

<p>Okay, so I cracked and decided to do some less useful items, one of which is an articulated Guardian that, I'm not gonna lie, I might actually be fully in love with.</p>
<p>Articulated figures such as this, I want to point out, are one of the best things to print for instant fun I've found, as some of them really go to town with giving you loads of posing options.</p>
<p>So whether it's this big guy (which you could scale up to make even larger) or any of the many other characters out there, get stuck into articulated stuff. Put the word 'articulated' into every search. Change your name to Articulated. It's your life!</p>
<p><strong>Time To Print:</strong> 3hrs 20mins<br>
<strong>Filament Cost:</strong> 41g<br>

<h3 id="kirby-mouse-mode-joy-con-2-adapter">Kirby Mouse Mode Joy-Con 2 Adapter</h3>

<p>Oh Kirby, you quietly violent little blob. How I adore your ways. So much so, in fact, that I just had to choose a Kirby design for my first Mouse Mode controller adapter. I mean, just look at him!</p>
<p>I didn't, as it turns out, have any pink filament to go <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds-eshop/3d_classics_kirbys_adventure">classic Kirby</a> colours here, but all that means is I got to experiment with something a little different instead. Remember with this print, if you choose to go with it, that you'll need a total of 6 hours and 20 minutes for both left and right adapters, so you might need to plan a little in advance, and this one uses lots of colours by default</p>
<p>So, if you want the classic Kirby look for a primo finish, make sure to stock up on pink, blue, black, white, and red PLA.</p>
<p><strong>Time To Print:</strong> 3 hours 10 minutes per adapter<br>
<strong>Filament Cost:</strong> 84g per adapter<br>

<h3 id="its-a-mario">It's-A-Mario!</h3>

<p>I couldn't finish up without adding this chap, could I? Oh, and in searching for this model, I discovered you can put pretty much <em>any character you can think of</em> into a search and something will turn up to print off!</p>

            <link>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/runescape-dragonwildss-next-big-update-ups-the-level-cap-to-99-even-though-its-literally-pointless-right-now</link>
            <guid>1421821</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/runescape-dragonwilds">RuneScape: Dragonwilds</a> just held its 2026 summit this week, and with it came a bevy of details about future updates and plans for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> game. Oh what joy for you scaper or runes! The main thing that got a look-in was the game's next big update, Dowdun Reach: Madness of Zamorak, which certainly has an air of someone looking at any section of a given <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> and thinking "yeah, I want a fortress like that."
</p>
<p>
This update comes following some feedback the devs received over a desire to see more locales with interiors and buildings to fight through and explore, hence the castle keepy nature of this update. There's a bunch of big scary knights to fend off, and in March more details will be shared regarding the kind of loot you'll be able to pick up ahead of its release at the end of that month. 
</p>
<p>
What's perhaps a touch funny about this update is that the level cap for all skills will be raised to 99, "even though the skills aren't finished yet." Perhaps an odd choice, but one that's again based on some feedback of folks "wanting to grind out levels and not waste XP." So, if you're someone that likes the grind, technically for now you'll be wasting your time, but any level-locked bits will be automatically available to you as they get added in.
</p>
<p>
After this big update, the next big one is Umbral Sands: Fire of Fuzan, planned for release this summer, which brings you to a deserty area where during the day the sun will be your biggest enemy, requiring you to find shade or build shelter to avoid its rays. There's also a big ole dragon called Fuzan you have to be cautious of, because, well, this game is called Dragonwilds after all.
</p><p>
And lastly, there's Scorned Wilderness: Rage of Kuldra, which is currently planned for launch this autumn. Details are slim on this one, but a <a href="https://dragonwilds.runescape.com/">blog post</a> does have this to say: "What we can tell you is this: Kuldra must die. Face off against the God-Eater and bring down their tyrannical reign as you muster your allies, drive into the wilderness to acquire Rune Armour and delve into the heart of the Anima storm." Why does it always have to be the God-Eater? Can't it be something nicer, less fire-breathy for once?

            <p>
I'm sure there's been many a Dweet and forum post about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/highguard">Highguard</a> is already a dead game or some such silly thing to say about a game that's not even a week old, but it does at least seem like developer Wildlight is paying attention to some of the more constructive bits of criticism about the game. Namely, that many aren't fond of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter's</a> 3v3 Raids simply because it feels like there aren't enough people for such large maps. So in turn, there's already an update adding in an experimental new raid mode.
</p>
<p>
Quite simply, as opposed to 3v3 the headcount is upped to 5v5. "We heard the feedback!" reads a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/4128260/view/538877446766724427">Steam blog post</a>. "For the weekend, we are experimenting with a 5v5 Raid Mode. This is a separate playlist and not meant to replace 3’s. 3v3 Raids are still there for people who enjoy it!" A couple of tweaks have also been made to account for the added numbers, the first being that raids are now 10 lives instead of six, and respawns take a bit longer during raids "to allow generators to be planted/defused."
</p>
<p>
With this update also comes a new base called the Soul Well, a "dark relic from a lost age. The Iron Vigil has now prepared this base construct for use in the field where the dead still speak." You should notice some small improvements here and there, for things like animation performance, projectiles, draw submission times, and "other gameplay systems." On top of all that, you can also turn motion blur on or off now.
</p>
<p>
None of this sounds particularly massive on the offset, but for a game like 5v5 does sound like it should liven things up a bit. We'll just have to wait and see what the results are after this weekend!
