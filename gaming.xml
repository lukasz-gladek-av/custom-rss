			<p><strong>Remedy's Alan Wake 2</strong> had a great reception when it launched in late October 2023. It received excellent review scores (<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-ii-it-truly-was-an-ocean/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including a 9 from Wccftech's Francesco De Meo</a></strong>), many awards (three at TGA 2023: Best Game Direction, Best Narrative, and Best Art Direction), and even became the <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-is-remedys-fastest-selling-title-at-1-3-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>fastest-selling game released by the Finnish studio to date</strong></a>, with <strong>over 1.3 million units</strong> sold as of February 2024. However, sales slowed down quickly afterward. As of late November 2024, Remedy <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-still-hasnt-recouped-all-its-development-and-marketing-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had to admit to its investors</a> that the development and marketing costs hadn't yet been fully recovered. That only changed in February 2025, when the game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-has-sold-2-million-units-remedy-has-a-new-unannounced-project-in-the-works/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finally broke the 2 </a></strong><span><a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-has-sold-2-million-units-remedy-has-a-new-unannounced-project-in-the-works/" target="_blank"><strong>million-unit mark</strong></a>&nbsp;and began</span> generating royalties for the studio.</p>



<p>Obviously, this relative underperformance for a title that most genre fans agree is very well-made was discussed thoroughly by fans and industry professionals alike. Two of the main factors identified were <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2/">th</a><a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e</a><a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2/"> lack of a physical release at launch</a> (which only changed a year later) and, most importantly, the fact that the PC version was and is still only available on the <strong>Epic Games Store</strong> rather than <strong>Valve's Steam</strong>, by far the largest game distribution store on the platform. The permanent exclusivity of Alan Wake 2 didn't sit well with some gamers, who to this day refuse to install the Epic Games Launcher to buy and play the game. </p>



<p>The discussion on the subject was suddenly reignited this week by <strong>Larian's</strong> outspoken <strong>Director of Publishing</strong>, <strong>Michael Douse</strong>. It all started <span>with the comments of&nbsp;<strong>New Blood Interactive CEO Dave Oshry</strong>, who noted on social media that </span><a href="https://wccftech.com/having-your-game-be-free-on-epic-is-great-advertising-for-steam-sales-says-indie-pub-after-blood-west-sales-spiked-while-it-was-free-on-egs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>giving away a game for free on the Epic Games Store also boosted sales of the same game</span> on Steam</a>.</p>



<p>Addressing that claim, Epic Games founder and CEO <strong>Tim Sweeney</strong> <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2013717884711633121" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">responded</a> that 'gamers and developers win by having more options and better deals', adding with a jab to Gabe Newell and his famous acquisition of a massive yacht that <strong>the Epic Games Store is now '55-60%' of Steam's userbase</strong> and that, unlike Valve, the company is reinvesting some of its revenue into the Free Program to the benefit of both developers and users.</p>



<p>That's when Douse <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/2013963017197691329" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">went ahead to say</a> that Remedy '<strong>seemingly went into financial crisis</strong>' because of the game's Epic Games Store exclusivity on PC, losing '<strong>potentially hundreds of millions</strong>' by not launching on Steam.</p>



<p><em>I understand Epic entirely funded Alan Wake 2 but this altruistic pro-developer talk doesn't sit well when Remedy seemingly went into financial crisis because they couldn't tap Steam for AW2 sales suffering potentially hundreds of millions in lost revenue.</em></p>



<p><em>Not that they need the money, but a % take to Epic could've recouped dev costs + more. Competition is good, and important, but it is difficult to buy the message when there are demonstrable cases of games underperforming as a result of the tactic. Ultimately, the viability of the store sits on their ability to convert hundreds of millions of Fortnite players into mid-hardcore premium gamers, and I don't see the Fortnite brand attempting to do that. The Apple &amp; Google stores spent a decade devaluing games &amp; apps to a point where it is largely impossible to sell a premium game there in a way that doesn't massively devalue it on other systems. Giving everyone everything for free might bump numbers but doesn't create a viable storefront from which to sell premium experiences.</em></p>



<p>In a surprising twist, Alan Wake 2 developer Remedy <a href="https://x.com/remedygames/status/2014375181507047630" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actually chose to answer Douse directly</a>, outlining that <strong>there would be no game at all without Epic's help</strong> and stressing that <strong>they received a 'very fair' publishing deal</strong>.</p>



<p><em>Hi. There would be no Alan Wake 2 without Epic Publishing. The publishing deal with Epic was very fair to Remedy. While these complex deals can often take even a year to reach their conclusion, and may not always be fair to the developer, this one was. And it only took months to get done. Epic Games was, and is, an excellent partner to us. Steam or no Steam.</em></p>



<p>To be honest, while Alan Wake 2 would have sold more if it had launched on Steam, it is unlikely that it would have really garnered a large amount of extra sales. The first installment sold a similar amount, after all, and it didn't have that issue. Moreover, it isn't like it's the only Remedy game to suffer this fate. <strong>The studio is known for its portfolio of great games that never quite sold as well as they should have</strong>, with the exception of <strong>Control</strong>, which is, however, in a much more popular genre. If there's anything the studio regrets right now, it is more likely to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-ceo-steps-down-after-9-years-following-fbc-firebreak-disaster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>the disastrous</strong> <strong>FBC: Firebreak</strong></a>.</p>



<p>It was already excellent news for gamers (and for Epic itself) that <strong>a sequel was made at all, which was far from guaranteed</strong>, and even more so that it turned out to be <strong>a fantastic survival horror game</strong>, thus keeping the Remedy Connected Universe going. On that note, a new entry will be released this year: <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/control-resonant-switches-protagonist-brings-the-action-in-open-ended-manhattan-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CONTROL Resonant</a></strong>, a full-fledged action RPG <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/control-2-will-be-made-on-a-smaller-budget-than-alan-wake-2-as-remedy-goes-from-surviving-to-succeeding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made on a lower budget than Alan Wake 2</a></strong>, making it more likely to turn profitable in a short time.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-store-poke-court-nyc-manhattan-robbery-donation-2000662652</link>
            <guid>1414741</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span>Earlier this month, Poké Court, a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>card and collectible shop in the Manhattan Meatpacking District, was holding a community event where fans gathered to decorate top loaders for their cards. The event was a first of its kind for the store, which opened in November. But that’s not why the people there that night will remember it. The event was crashed by </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-shops-robbed-100k-nyc-masked-thieves-anime-backpacks-recently-opened-2000660233"><span>a group of masked robbers who held the store up at gunpoint</span></a><span>, smashed glass cases and shelves,&nbsp; and stole over $100,000 worth of collector’s merchandise. “They just grabbed whatever they could,” said owner Courtney Chin.</span></p> <p><span>Stories like this have unfortunately become </span><a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2026-01-23/pokemon-card-thefts-are-hitting-collectors-across-southern-california"><span>more and more common</span></a><span> as the scalper market has become a quick money-making scheme for people who don’t even care about Pikachu, Charizard, or any of the other monsters in the series. Stores have reported everything from armed robberies and being assaulted with pepper spray to people tunneling into stores like they’re in a heist movie.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>A store in Huntington Beach, California got hit right before the recent Christmas holiday. Thieves reportedly burrowed through some part of the shop’s roof. “It’s hard not to worry with so many other stores being hit,” the owner, Jerry Hernandez, </span><a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2026-01-23/pokemon-card-thefts-are-hitting-collectors-across-southern-california"><span>told the </span><i><span>Los Angeles Times</span></i></a><span>. “I feel like once we got hit and some of the other shops got hit it created a snowball effect.”</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000662648" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000662648"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000662648">© Photo: Kenneth Shepard</figcaption></figure> <p><span>When I went to Poké Court this week, located on cobblestone sidestreet close to the Hudson River, those shelves were mostly still empty, but they did have a bouquet of flowers sitting on them next to some of the Pokémon card top loaders fans had come together to decorate. If I hadn’t already known about the smash and grab, there would have been little to suggest Poké Court had been the target of a terrible crime.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>It was the middle of a cold Manhattan January afternoon, the store still had dozens of customers coming in and out to joyfully buy and open trading card packs at the shop’s bartop. But if you paid attention, there were clues of what had happened. Before I even spoke to anyone in the store, a customer was offering their condolences to the staff, who graciously accepted their kind words. In the corner of the entrance, Chin was putting the store’s new security system through its paces.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2>“A world we must defend”</h2> <p><span>Chin started what would become a brick-and-mortar shop in one of the most expensive real estate markets in the country out of her second bedroom after getting back into </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>collecting in a “really intense way.” She wanted to create something more “specialized” than your average card shop. Trading cards have become such a lucrative hobby and business that most collectible stores diversify their stock, carrying sports cards alongside the </span><i><span>Magic</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Yu-Gi-Oh</span></i><span>, and the </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> packs people love. Poké Court is meant to be a place where </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>fans can reliably show up and know the store is dedicated to the franchise they’re obsessed with, and is staffed by people with extensive experience and knowledge about its long and hype-fueled history.</span></p> <p><span>“These are my friends who also grew up having the same core memories and really loving the franchise and thinking about all the values of Pokémon that we really resonate with,” Chin tells me. “We love the idea of community. We love the idea of trust, and even the theme song’s ‘being the very best,’ right? It tries to bring out the best in people, and it teaches you about resilience and hardship. And I think there are a lot of core lessons that my generation really took to heart.”</span></p>

 <p><span>While many </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>sellers will go to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-tcg-vendor-scalper-reseller-stream-shows-2000630658"><span>larger community events and card shows</span></a><span>, Chin says that having the brick-and-mortar location makes it less feasible to uproot the shop to do temporary events. But that physical presence also helps anchor the business and foster a local community, one that has weathered the changing, difficult storms of </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>collecting’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scalper-reseller-trading-card-van-gogh-pikachu-1850925900"><span>post-Covid, scalper-addled chaos</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“When I first started, I used to price things at MSRP or even below,” Chin says. “I would want to have the best prices so people would always come to my shop and buy from me. Once it became all about money, we would have some individuals— I don’t want to assign a label to them—but they would come and just buy everything and then immediately sell it. There’s nothing wrong with that. It’s a free market. But then they got really creative and they started botting our site. So we would drop something on our site and then we would immediately get flooded with hundreds of orders from the same individuals buying out all of our products. Then we would get an angry response from our actual customers and our regulars and they’re like ‘You didn’t save anything.’”</span></p> <p><span>In response, Poké Court has had to adjust prices, which Chin acknowledges raises the barrier to entry for some people. But the lengths people would go to buy out all of its stock for cheap and then flip it became “unsavory,” even escalating into shouting matches and fights outside the store.</span></p>

 <p><span>“It really shouldn’t be about the money but unfortunately that’s what everyone focuses on because it’s so attention grabbing,” Chin says. “Then people get excited, they’re like, ‘oh, my collection is now worth $1,000 instead of $100. I’ve made so much money.’”</span></p> <div> <p>Welcome to Exp. Share, <em>Kotaku</em> ’s <em>Pokémon</em> column in which we dive deep to explore notable characters, urban legends, communities, and just plain weird quirks from throughout the <em>Pokémon</em> franchise.</p></div> <p><span>Fights are one thing, but threats of gun violence were something else entirely. Chin was in the store’s back room when Poké Court’s top loader event was wrapping up. Around 40 customers and 14 employees were in the store at the time, including folks who just wanted to hang out for the festivities. Chin knew something was wrong the second she&nbsp; heard the sound of glass shattering. Employees and customers rushed to the back of the store for safety as the robbers went to work.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000662647" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000662647"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000662647">© Photo: Kenneth Shepard</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Chin was able to hit the store’s panic button and call the police. Thankfully, no one was hurt, but thousands of dollars worth of vintage and rare merchandise from across the </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> franchise’s 30 years was gone. That’s where most reports about what happened at Poké Court end, but that’s not the whole story.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>“Our courage will pull us through”</h2> <p><span>“I thought that our shop would be deserted and everyone would be scared and employees would resign because they feel like this is an unsafe work environment, but it was almost the opposite,” Chin says. “Everyone really bonded together and wanted to stay here longer. After the robbery, everyone could have gone home, which is the rational thing to do, but everyone, we had 50 people here, and they all wanted to stay. They all stood in line and gave their statements to the police, and they all wanted to be here for each other.”</span></p> <p><span>The local New York Poké Court community showed up for each other, but as word of the shop’s story spread, Chin says the broader Pokémon community has reached out in support as well. Big content creators have shared the store’s </span><a href="https://thepokecourt.com/products/poke-court-community-support?utm_source=ig&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=link_in_bio&amp;fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAc3J0YwZhcHBfaWQMMjU2MjgxMDQwNTU4AAGnU0K6HAZne1CZRccxo-cJqqgib4qA0IczzxBbERK_Ihk0YJf_IDG8l87qarA_aem_wDNuUu1z2EFKMndQncv8NA"><span>community fund</span></a><span> that’s raised thousands of dollars. Even big names in </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-anime-ash-ketchum-pikachu-final-episode-netflix-1850805389"><span>Ash Ketchum</span></a><span> voice actor </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-ash-ketchum-voice-actor-sarah-natochenny-anime-1850234947"><span>Sarah Natochenny</span></a><span> started reaching out </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DThGXC4jJ5P/?hl=en"><span>on social media</span></a><span>. Chin says the store has gotten an influx of job applications, too.</span></p>

 <p><span>“They’re like, ‘I want to work for you’ and I’m like, ‘We just got held up. I can’t believe you would want to spend more time in this spot.’ So I think that it’s very encouraging that people are bouncing back even harder than ever. We’re not going to let a robbery stop us.”</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000662649" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000662649"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000662649">© Photo: Kenneth Shepard</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The support has gone beyond just people donating money. Some have offered musical performances in-store while others bring in food for staff. The immediate pillow of support has been a “big morale booster” for the staff. While the Poké Court has been in headlines over one of the worst things that could have happened to it, Chin wants people to know that the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>community is more than just collectors chasing the most valuable cards.</span></p> <p><span>“One of the most common misconceptions is that the Pokémon community is full of people who only are in it for the money or only care about investing or are scalpers,” she says. “You just hear the worst, right? But for better or for worse, this robbery has shown how people can come together in a really positive and genuinely heartwarming way to support total strangers, to support their local card shop, to support all the people who were absolutely traumatized by this experience. I’ve just been floored and humbled and I’m so thankful that there’s this massive community.”</span></p> <p><span>As the shop’s story has spread on social media, neighboring card shops around the state have also been reaching out about the stolen merchandise, verifying certification numbers in case the robbers try to sell what they took. The entire thing has made Chin feel like the shop has a “network of friends” that expands far beyond New York City.</span></p>

 <p><span>When I left Poké Court this week, it was just as full of </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>fans as it’s ever been, though it now has additional security. There was a version of the store’s future where fans stopped showing up to buy and open packs, scared off by the threat of violence over a hobby that’s supposed to be about bringing people together. Instead, the store is bouncing back, thanks in no small part to a community that was never in it for the money to begin with. They were in it for each other and the friends they’ve met along the way through a shared love of Pokemon.</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-store-poke-court-nyc-manhattan-robbery-donation-2000662652]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[World Of Warcraft’s Transmog Fiasco Ends With Price Cuts But That’s Not The Whole Story]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/world-warcraft-midnight-wow-transmog-changes-update-2000662662</link>
            <guid>1414669</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Days after hiking up the prices to transmogrify your armor in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/world-of-warcraft"><i><span>World of Warcraft</span></i></a><span>, developer Blizzard announced it’s reducing them in half—a decision that came after overwhelming player outrage.</span></p> <p><span>The transmog fiasco started with the launch of the pre-expansion patch for </span><i><span>World of Warcraft: Midnight</span></i><span> on January 20. The patch introduced a plethora of updates to a number of the game’s systems, and the transmog system, which allows players to change the appearance of armor pieces for previously acquired gear without affecting their stats, was one of them. The transmog overhaul ushered in two big problems for the community: the new system is convoluted, and to make matters worse, it’s incredibly expensive. Or used to be, anyway, as Blizzard has already announced it’s dialing the inflation rate back.</span></p> <p><span>“We’re going to lower the cost of outfit creation prices by 50% to bring them more in line with what the prices were prior to the Transmog update,” community manager Linxy </span><a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/free-transmog-change-coming-for-all-characters/2233128/696"><span>wrote on the Blizzard forums</span></a><span> yesterday. “This price reduction is currently under development and should be available within the next day.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The change makes sense, as the new system has characters starting with just two outfit slots for their transmog creations. You can unlock more, of course, but initial prices started at 100 gold and ramped up to almost 800,000 gold to unlock all 20 slots on a given character. So, if you’re somebody who juggles five characters at once and you like to engage with the in-game fashion, having 20 slots for all five of them would cost almost 4 million gold. And this is all without considering the costs of changing the individual pieces in said outfits.</span></p> <p><span>Now, all of these prices are being halved. In addition, Linxy said the team is “going to try” to grant one free transmog to all player-characters soon, before patch 12.0.1. This should “hopefully” happen via a hotfix.</span></p>

 <p><span>The free transmog is also part of the response to community complaints. When Blizzard released the pre-expansion patch, all transmogs that were previously applied to gear were removed. As </span><a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/free-transmog-change-coming-for-all-characters/2233128"><span>explained</span></a><span> by community manager Kaivax on the forums, this was intentional to reflect the transition from a gear-based to a slot-based system. All previously saved loadouts are still present, converted to Custom Sets as part of the new system. The problem, however, is that it costs the normal amount of gold to apply the first transmog to your character, even if you only want to set your appearance back to the way it was before. Kaivax called this “an oversight” on the developers’ part, as players should be able to maintain or reset their existing look without cost.</span></p>

 <p><span>“With the 12.0.1 update before the launch of </span><i><span>Midnight</span></i><span>, all player-characters will be granted one free Transmog,” continues the response. “This will be automatically applied to the next outfit created for each character. We apologize for any inconvenience caused by first-time Transmog costs.”</span></p> <h2><b>Pricing isn’t the only problem with the new transmog system</b></h2> <p><span>While the pricing reduction is a welcoming change, it hardly addresses the only qualm that </span><i><span>World of Warcraft</span></i><span> players have with the new transmog system. The community is also complaining about the convoluted UX, as it used to be simpler in the old system, as well as the multiple added steps the latest changes require.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I think I’ve spent about half of my gametime playing dress up since transmog has been released as a feature,” reads a </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1qj7opk/not_to_be_dramatic_but_im_quitting_over_the_new/"><span>Reddit thread</span></a><span> from a </span><i><span>World of Warcraft </span></i><span>player who says they’re quitting the game. “Now (…) trying to set up anything just fills me with apathy. Why was the icon selection and naming of sets downgraded for the ‘main’ transmog screen? The outdated all-in-one icon selection from classic, without search or prioritizing your outfit’s items is MASSIVELY more annoying than the previous transmog system’s auto-select that just went with the first item’s icon of your outfit. Also, 16 characters limit for outfit names is nonsense.”</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000662666" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000662666"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000662666">©Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>This account is far from the only one voicing such complaints. In the replies to an </span><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/guide/transmogrification/everything-about-transmog-ui-appearances"><span>explainer</span></a><span> by </span><i><span>World of Warcraft</span></i><span> enthusiast site </span><i><span>Wowhead</span></i><span>, people have posted multiple questions about the minutiae of the system. “I just opened up WoW and ALL my warriors look ridiculous,” reads one of the comments. “All the gear I’ve put on them over the years is gone and they look like noobs. I have lost over 2K gold trying to figure out the new transmog bs and when I check them out, they’re still in the wrong stuff. I’ve saved, I’ve bought a slot. I’ve only played WoW since it’s inception so yes, I’m older than most but this is ridiculous and it’s enough to make me want to quit the game.”</span></p> <p><span>Those on roleplaying servers are particularly impacted by these issues, as for many of them, transmogrification is particularly important to defining character identity, as well as adding to the immersion of certain events and actions. Say, for example, that your character is wearing a hood or a helmet, and you want to switch out to a scarf when entering a house. In the old system, you could open your inventory bags and select another transmogged item, switching it on the fly. Now, that individual item transmogging is no longer possible.</span></p>

 <p><span>As </span><a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/transmog-loss-of-an-important-feature-for-roleplayers/2202216"><span>explained by a veteran roleplayer</span></a><span> in the forums, people in these servers are prone to keep flavor items in their possession, such as cloaks to change depending on the weather environment, or a set of white gloves when a character needs to provide medical care for someone.</span></p> <p><span>The use cases are many, but unfortunately, the latest changes to transmogrification have introduced limitations. Instead of selecting an item from your inventory, you would have to pay gold to make a change to your current outfit, only to pay again once you revert it later. Plus, these actions take time, which can interrupt the flow of immersion during active scenes.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I am not a coder, I have no idea how difficult it would be to implement a system where certain items are exempt from the outfit that your character is currently wearing, but I implore you Blizzard, please find a way to allow us to make changes to individual outfit slots on the fly without having to engage with the transmog interface and shell out gold every time,” concludes the post from the roleplayer.</span></p> <p><i><span>World of Warcraft: Midnight</span></i><span> is releasing on March 2. Whether Blizzard decides to roll out more changes based on community feedback remains to be seen.</span></p>

<p>The next Resident Evil remake is coming within the next 18 months. </p>



<p>In a post on social media, NateTheHate reaffirmed that not only is Resident Evil Code: Veronica being remade, but that it’s “deep in development”. He then went on the mention when Capcom is targeting a release.</p>







<p>“Target of release is first half 2027,” <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2014767509803512263" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he said</a>. </p>



<p>This isn’t the first time we’ve heard claims of Code: Veronica being remade. In fact, rumblings about the game have been going on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-and-zero-are-next-two-remakes-insider-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">since at least 2024</a>. Rumors <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-and-zero-remakes-scheduled-for-2027-2028-respectively-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggest that the remake</a> of the 26-year-old game will be announced sometime this year ahead of the aforementioned 2027 launch.</p>







<p>Resident Evil Code: Veronica first launched in February 2000, exclusively for the Sega Dreamcast. After that console went under, the game was re-released as Resident Evil Code: Veronica X for the PlayStation 2 (2001) and Nintendo GameCube (2003). It even came to the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2011. </p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/46-congress-members-express-serious-concerns-over-ea-saudi-arabia-buyout-ftc/</link>
            <guid>1414654</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Last year, <strong>EA</strong> announced that it planned to become a privately owned company, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-confirms-agreement-to-be-acquired-by-pif-silver-lake-and-affinity-partners-for-55-billion/">with the <strong>Saudi Arabia PIF</strong> and <strong>Silver Lake</strong> leading a '<strong>Consortium</strong>' of investors in a massive <strong>$55 billion</strong> buyout</a>. The buyout has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-shareholders-officially-approved-55bn-sale-to-saudi-arabia-pif-silver-lake/">passed the approval of the company's shareholders</a>, with the next and final step being getting the approval of global regulators, including the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC). As that process is ongoing, we don't know yet whether the FTC will choose to fight the acquisition or let it pass, but as many as <strong>46 members of the US Congress</strong> don't want the deal to go through without the FTC "<em>thoroughly</em>" looking it over.</p>



<p><a href="https://laborcaucus.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/laborcaucus.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/letter-to-ftc-on-proposed-acquisition-of-electronic-arts-ea.pdf">In an open letter</a> to the FTC chair, <strong>Andrew Ferguson</strong>, signed by 46 House Democrats led by the Labor Caucus co-chairs, <strong>Steven Horsford</strong>, <strong>Debbie Dingell</strong>, <strong>Mark Pocan</strong>, and <strong>Donald Norcross</strong>, the representatives express their "<em>serious concerns</em>" with the deal, and want it to be "<em>thoroughly reviewed</em>" as it comes under the FTC's purview. </p>



<p>"<em>We are writing to express serious concerns regarding the proposed acquisition of Electronic Arts (EA) by the Public Investment Fund (PIF), the sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia, and private equity firms<br>Silver Lake and Affinity Partners,</em>" the letter begins. "<em>We are committed to preserving fair, competitive labor markets and safeguarding American jobs, and given the impact of this acquisition on workers, labor market concentration, and the long-term competitiveness of the U.S. video game industry, we urge you to thoroughly review this transaction</em>."</p>



<p>The letter goes on to cite the recent instability of the video game industry, which has suffered tens of thousands of job losses in recent years, EA's contributions to those layoffs, and the massive disconnect between EA's executive leadership and its median worker, highlighted by EA's chief executive officer, <strong>Andrew Wilson</strong>, taking home<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-ceo-andrew-wilson-earned-260-times-more-than-the-median-worker-last-year"> <strong>260 times more</strong> compared to the median EA worker.</a></p>



<p>It noted concerns over the fact that the buyout comes with <a href="https://wccftech.com/20-billion-debt-ticking-time-bomb-ea-studios-says-analyst/">EA taking on <strong>$20 billion in debt</strong></a><strong>,</strong> which it says "<em>creates strong incentives for the acquiring firms to pursue further cost-cutting measures, including <strong>layoffs, offshoring, restructuring, or studio closures</strong></em>." The letter also expresses competition-based concerns, saying that the scale of the "<em>cross-ownership</em>" involved, were the deal to go through, "<em>presents risks of self-preferencing and anticompetitive coordination across these sports, sports-related talent, and sports related video game business lines. This could, consequently, restrict worker mobility and reduce bargaining power for employees throughout the industry.</em>"</p>



<p>The last major point the letter makes is one indicating that this merger, should it be approved, could violate some of the FTC's own antitrust laws regarding mergers that harm workers, suppress wages, and enable dominant firms to reduce labor demands. It then closes by saying, </p>



<p>"<em>We respectfully urge the Commission to conduct a thorough investigation into the labor market consequences of this proposed acquisition, including EA’s existing wage-setting power, the likelihood of post-transaction layoffs, the degree of labor-market concentration in relevant geographic and occupational markets, and the role of cross-ownership in shaping labor outcomes. Workers deserve a fair, competitive marketplace where their skills are valued</em>."</p>



<p>These 46 House Democrats are not the first to share these kinds of concerns over the buyout. The $20 billion in debt is <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-55-billion-deal-might-bring-massive-layoffs-ai-pivot-20-billion-debt/">something several other industry figures have already pointed to as a problem</a>, and that's even before getting into the creative concerns, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-claims-it-will-maintain-creative-control-if-55-billion-buyout-goes-through-saudi-arabia-silver-lake/">even as EA claims it will "<em>maintain creative control</em>" after the buyout</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/maxis-promises-the-sims-values-remain-unchanged-amidst-ea-saudi-arabia-buyout/"><strong>The Sims</strong> developer <strong>Maxis</strong> made a similar claim earlier this month,</a> saying its values will remain "<em>unchanged</em>" after the acquisition, a claim that players are struggling to believe. There's already precedent for <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fighting/it-doesnt-really-make-sense-that-soccer-star-ronaldo-is-now-a-fatal-fury-character-but-if-you-follow-the-money-you-can-see-how-it-happened/">the Saudi Arabia PIF allegedly impacting creative decisions in <strong>Fatal Fury</strong></a>, which itself is realistically a small matter in the grand scheme of things, since it can be boiled down to the Saudi Arabia PIF allegedly using its influence to put a sports icon it has financial ties to in this new video game it owns. Not the worst thing in the world.</p>



<p>But if the group were to have used its influence for a small, ultimately trivial matter like that, it's understandable that The Sims players would have concerns that core elements to the long-running life sim, like being able to act out whatever lifestyle you want, including ones that are considered criminal offences in Saudi Arabia, would change.</p>



<p>And while we've not yet seen reports of Maxis employees voicing their concerns, anonymously or not, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioware-devs-reportedly-worried-55-billion-ea-buyout/">employees at EA's <strong>BioWare</strong> have already done so</a>. There's simply no getting around the fact that this deal has a lot of people, inside and outside of EA, seriously concerned.</p>



<p>Of course, these concerns could be all for naught, and the deal could go through, and all of the bad things people fear will happen won't actually happen. We won't know until the deal officially closes, and we won't see that happen until the FTC and other global regulators weigh in on the deal.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo’s Games Are Special Because Its Teams Are Intergenerational]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/podcasts/aftermath-hours-podcast-super-nintendo-keza-macdonald/</link>
            <guid>1414633</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Nobody does it quite like Nintendo. When you’re playing a first-party <em>Mario</em>, <em>Zelda</em>, <em>Metroid</em>, or whatever else, there’s a feeling that other games can’t quite replicate – something akin to magic. But of course, magic isn’t real, and games are productions created by flawed human beings just like anything else. So what makes Nintendo’s so special? Part of it comes down to who’s still around, all these years later. On the latest <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/aftermath-hours/"><u>Aftermath Hours</u></a>, we talk about that.</p><p>This time around, we’re joined by Keza MacDonald – currently of The Guardian and formerly of Kotaku UK way back in the day – to talk about her new book, <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/753986/super-nintendo-by-keza-macdonald/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Super Nintendo: The Game-Changing Company That Unlocked the Power of Play</u></em></a>. We discuss Nintendo’s vast history, dating all the way back to 1889, as well as how its innovative past gave way to the Switch 2 era, perhaps its most iterative yet.&nbsp;</p><p>Keza also tells us all sorts of stories about legendary figures like <em>Mario </em>creator Shigeru Miyamoto, who despite his sunny exterior, is actually a very intense boss. Also, that famous “a delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad” quote? He didn’t say it! Oh, while we’re dispelling misconceptions, Nintendo hasn’t avoided mass layoffs just because its executives are <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/13/nintendo-ceo-once-halved-salary-to-prevent-layoffs-why-thats-uncommon.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>uncommonly forward thinking</u></a>. Thank <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24191650/nintendo-sega-from-software-japan-video-game-layoffs?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Japanese labor law</u></a> for that one. Then we dig into what makes Nintendo Nintendo, including the intergenerational approach it takes to both its characters and its staffing. Finally, we talk about our favorite journalism rabbit holes, of which we have many.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Spotify</u></a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Apple</u></a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that Aftermath can also become an intergenerational enterprise, with sprightly youths reporting to 70-something versions of us decades from now (we'll be a lot crankier, though).</p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Keza:</strong> That intergenerational nature of the market, I think, will safeguard Nintendo for a while, but also they have intergenerational teams. If you are the newest guy making <em>Mario</em>, you are sitting in the same team as Takashi Tezuka who made the first <em>Mario</em>. I think that is the case on every team. It’s always a mix of people who have literally been there for decades – maybe made the first game in that series – [and younger folks]. If you are struggling with a technical problem, you can go ask the guy who made that console. He’s over there. And all the documentation is apparently super tight. They’ve got incredible documentation of their own work.</p><p>I think this intergenerational development process is a key to why their games keep being so good. There’s both the insight and the institutional knowledge; the spirit of the game has remained kind of [the same]. <em>Zelda </em>is a good example. It feels sort of the same. The core of it is the same as it has been for decades. How do they do that? It’s because they keep the same people on it. But then you also have this freshness. You have new people – very talented younger people who are core parts of the teams.&nbsp;</p><p>So yeah, that intergenerational nature of its products and its teams and its audience, I think that’s the thing that really defines Nintendo now – and that will probably define it in the future as well. It’s gonna become like a Disney situation, although hopefully not evil. We will see.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I did forget how long Hidemaro Fujibayashi had been working on this stuff. He directed <em>Oracle of Seasons</em> and <em>Oracle of Ages</em>. That’s crazy.</p><p><strong>Keza: </strong>Yeah, he was the director on those. They poached him from Capcom. And that’s the thing: The “new” director of <em>Zelda </em>has been working on these games for decades himself.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> He’s, like, 53!</p><p><strong>Keza:</strong> Yeah, they’re seen as spring chickens because there’s Eiji Aonuma and Miyamoto, and they’re still there. When you first start to see a Nintendo developer’s name – when you first start to see them cropping up – they have been there for ten years or more by the time that happens. That kind of talent development is pretty solid. They seem to do a good job of bringing people up and not just keeping it with the established generation.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> With that in mind, do you think that tendency of previous generations to stick around well into old age stems from pride in their work and care and craft, or do you think they’re afraid to let go – that they’re afraid to completely take their hand off the wheel because they don’t entirely trust that things will keep working the way that they should if they leave and finally go enjoy retirement?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Keza:</strong> I do think there’s an element of that, probably, for quite a lot of Nintendo’s old guard. I know that Miyamoto took a long time to very slowly withdraw from game development. He’s not involved in games anymore. He does theme parks and movies and stuff. He’s become a student of film scripts because he’s trying to understand how to get the best out of Nintendo’s film partnerships and stuff. But that was a slow, slow, slow process.</p><p>Apart from anything else, can you imagine what would happen to Nintendo’s stock price if Miyamoto retired? So I do wonder the extent to which people are sticking around because they kind of have to for business reasons – especially the old guard. But then they do seem to enjoy their lives. I mean, you see these people on the product cycles; you see them every three or four years. But I’ve never interviewed a Nintendo developer who doesn’t have the light in their eyes.</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/nintendo-direct-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-metroid-prime-4/"><div><p>Nintendo Does What Everybody Else Nintendon’t - Aftermath</p><p>The Switch is bucking industry trends until the not-so-bitter end</p><p><span>Nathan Grayson</span></p></div></a></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>40+ days after it was first revealed as the <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-trailers-recap-highguard-titanfall-apex-2000653088">“last big thing” at The Game Awards in December,</a> <em>Highguard’s</em> social media account finally posted again, breaking a long radio silence and leading to a lot of reactions from gamers online.</p> <p>On January 23, the official <em>Highguard</em> Twitter account announced a “Launch Showcase” live stream happening on the game’s release date of January 26. This is the first time the account has posted anything since <a href="https://x.com/PlayHighguard/status/1999629482123231329">replying to someone’s reaction</a> to the initial reveal trailer back on December 12.</p>

 <p>“Tune in on Monday, January 26, at 10am PT for the <em>Highguard</em> Launch Showcase,” posted the <em>Highguard</em> account. “Here, we’ll share an in-depth look at <em>Highguard</em> direct from the studio, featuring a full gameplay deep dive, year one plans, and much more.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Tune in on Monday, January 26, at 10am PT for the Highguard Launch Showcase⚔️</p> <p>Here, we'll share an in-depth look at Highguard direct from the studio, featuring a full gameplay deep dive, year one plans, and much more.</p> <p>👉<a href="https://t.co/zm4I62mMpI">https://t.co/zm4I62mMpI</a> <a href="https://t.co/VlQ4qbCNA3">pic.twitter.com/VlQ4qbCNA3</a></p> <p>— Highguard | Launching Jan 26 2026 (@PlayHighguard) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayHighguard/status/2014760310046085443?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 23, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <h2>What’s going on with <em>Highguard</em>?</h2> <p>Since its reveal in December, <em>Highguard</em> has had a strange few weeks. Being the big reveal at the end of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-we-saw-at-the-2025-game-awards-2000652719">Game Awards</a>, which reportedly the company didn’t pay for, got it a lot of eyeballs, but also a lot of scrutiny. People tend to expect some big new sequel or long-awaited project to cap off host Geoff Keighley’s annual award and trailer showcase. Instead, Geoff showcased a free-to-play online shooter that, to many online, looked too similar to many other games already out there. That initial trailer didn’t do a great job explaining what it is, and by and large, people weren’t excited.</p>

 <p>Since then, the people behind <em>Highguard</em> have been radio silent, which has led to more discourse around its radio silence and discussion over what little we’ve seen so far. So this new tweet from the main account caught a lot of people’s attention.</p>

 <p>“Bro finally remembered the password,” posted popular <em>Fortnite</em> leaker Shiina.</p> <p>“I logged in specifically just to mute you,” said another user on Twitter.</p> <p>“Oh my word, they are alive,” posted someone else.</p> <p>“Dead game,” tweeted another user, because of course, at least one person had to shout this overused insult.</p>

 <p>To be clear, there are some positive replies, too. People are excited to see what the game actually is, or people are just happy the devs aren’t giving up on it. Regardless of sentiment, <em>Highguard</em> clearly has the attention of a lot of people online, even if some of them are rooting for it to fail while others are just curious as to how this all ends. We won’t have to wait long to see more as <em>Highguard’s</em> big launch day stream kicks off on January 26. Meanwhile, the game launches that day on consoles and PC. I suspect a lot of eyeballs will once again be watching.</p>

<p>Final Fantasy 7 Remake series director has stated that Rebirth’s Switch 2 gameplay experience is “pretty much exactly the same as all the other platforms.”</p>



<p>The Xbox and Switch 2 versions of Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade are already live, and players have already started thinking about the next instalments. Moving on to the next instalment, a reliable insider has reaffirmed that Rebirth should <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-still-coming-to-xbox-in-2026-insider-reaffirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arrive for Xbox in 2026</a>. And now, we have been informed about the game’s performance on the Switch 2. </p>

<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/News/2026/January/FINAL-FANTASY-VII-REMAKE-INTERGRADE-Interview-Naoki-Hamaguchi-Director-3010151.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo</a>, Final Fantasy 7 Remake series director Naoki Hamaguchi spoke about Rebirth’s Switch 2 performance. The director was asked about the next instalments in the FF7 remake series, and Hamaguchi answered, stating that he can’t reveal too much information, but can confirm that Rebirth and the third instalment to the series are indeed in development for the Switch 2. </p>



<p>Development on both titles is progressing for Switch 2 and other platforms. Hamaguchi also stated that it’s his “personal policy” not to make any versions of a game different from one another, or “offer a different gameplay experience just because they’re on different hardware.” He has assured players that the Switch 2 version’s gameplay experience is “pretty much exactly the same as all the other&nbsp;platforms.”</p>

<p>Highguard developers have finally announced a gameplay showcase for the title, which will arrive on launch day. </p>



<p>Since Highguard was announced during the finale slot of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a>, players have been eagerly waiting to learn more about the upcoming free-to-play shooter from the creators of Apex Legends and Titanfall. However, close to the marketing or promotion for the title has been done, apart from the reveal trailer. It seems that we are finally going to get something, but it may be too close to launch. </p>







<h2 id="h-highguard-gameplay-showcase-arrives-on-launch-day">Highguard Gameplay Showcase Arrives on Launch Day</h2>



<p>The official <a href="https://x.com/PlayHighguard/status/2014760310046085443" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter) of Highguard is finally showing signs of life, posting for the first time since December 12, 2025. The new announcement reveals that a Highguard Launch Showcase will be held on January 26, 2026, at 10 AM Pacific Time. The showcase will provide an in-depth look at the game, featuring year-one plans, a gameplay deep dive, and more. Players are speculating that the game could be dropped right after the showcase. </p>

<p>Highguard marketing has been almost non-existent, with developers providing players absolutely no concrete information about their upcoming free-to-play raid shooter. Interestingly, the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-trophy-list-has-revealed-more-details-than-the-devs-have/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trophy list leaked</a> recently, providing players with the most information we have received to date about the upcoming title. The information included details on the game’s mechanics, items, characters, and more. </p>







<p>In other news, a recent claim alleges that Highguard developers Wildlight Entertainment <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-devs-didnt-pay-for-game-awards-spot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">didn’t pay for the spot</a> at The Game Awards finale. Additionally, here’s all you need to know about the upcoming shooter’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-platforms-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">platforms</a>.

Compared to the $79.99 price tag for the physical Switch 2 Edition, this is a great little deal to take advantage of.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Hannah Hoolihan is a freelancer who writes with the guides and commerce teams here at IGN.</em></p></div></section><div><h3 data-cy="title3"><svg data-cy="icon-logo" viewBox="0 0 76 24" title="IGN"><title>IGN Logo</title><path fill="currentColor" stroke="none" d="M5.38 7.65a7.85 7.85 0 0 1 2.26-2.26c.13-1.18.31-2.26.52-3.21a10.605 10.605 0 0 0-6 6c.95-.22 2.03-.39 3.21-.52M16.34 5.36v.02c.9.59 1.67 1.37 2.27 2.27 1.18.13 2.26.31 3.21.52a10.627 10.627 0 0 0-6.02-6.01c.22.95.4 2.02.54 3.2M7.64 18.62c-.9-.59-1.67-1.37-2.27-2.27h-.03c-1.19-.14-2.26-.32-3.19-.54 1.07 2.75 3.26 4.95 6.01 6.02-.22-.95-.39-2.03-.52-3.21M18.64 16.35h-.03c-.59.9-1.37 1.67-2.27 2.27v.03c-.14 1.17-.32 2.25-.54 3.19a10.59 10.59 0 0 0 6.03-6.03c-.94.22-2 .4-3.19.54M10.04 0h3.9c.85 1.85 1.2 4.59 1.3 5.52.04.22.06.43.06.63L12 9.11 8.7 6.15c0-.17.02-.35.05-.55.1-.95.43-3.75 1.29-5.61M8.7 17.83c0 .17.02.35.05.55.1.95.43 3.75 1.29 5.61h3.9c.85-1.84 1.2-4.59 1.3-5.52.04-.22.06-.43.06-.64L12 14.87l-3.3 2.96ZM6.16 8.68c-.17 0-.35.02-.55.05-.95.12-3.75.45-5.61 1.31v3.9c1.84.85 4.59 1.19 5.52 1.3.22.04.43.06.64.06L9.11 12 6.16 8.7ZM24 10.02c-1.86-.86-4.66-1.19-5.61-1.29-.2-.03-.38-.05-.55-.05l-2.96 3.3 2.96 3.3c.2 0 .41-.02.64-.06.93-.11 3.68-.45 5.52-1.3v-3.9Z"></path><path fill="currentColor" stroke="none" d="M42.83 13.9V10h10.45c1.06 0 1.93.86 1.93 1.92v4.63c0 2.38-1.91 4.36-4.33 4.36h-6.69c-4.96 0-8.97-4-8.97-8.94s4.04-8.95 8.98-8.95h10.36v4.11H44.2c-2.67 0-4.86 2.17-4.86 4.84s2.16 4.83 4.86 4.83h6.91v-2.91h-8.27ZM33.86 3h-4.07v16.02c0 1.05.86 1.91 1.91 1.91h2.15V3M74.37 3.01h-2.18v13.81s0 .08-.03.11a.29.29 0 0 1-.24.14c-.09 0-.16-.04-.25-.15L64.83 4.93a4.347 4.347 0 0 0-3.72-2.11h-.07c-2.39 0-4.32 1.93-4.32 4.32v11.88c0 1.05.86 1.91 1.91 1.91h2.17V7.14s.02-.09.04-.13a.29.29 0 0 1 .24-.14c.09 0 .18.03.24.14l6.88 12.07c.76 1.27 2.12 2.05 3.69 2.05h.07c2.39 0 4.32-1.93 4.32-4.32V4.92c0-1.05-.85-1.91-1.91-1.91"></path></svg>Recommends</h3></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition]]></content:encoded>

Lorwyn has been part of Magic’s locations since 2007, and there are some great cards in the set - including some that are already spiking in value.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Most Expensive Cards From Lorwyn Eclipsed</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got the most valuable <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-lorwyn-eclipsed-where-to-buy-2026">Lorwyn Eclipsed</a> cards you can find right now listed below, with the caveat that this is based on pre-launch pricing taken as close to release as we can, courtesy of data from the lovely folks at <a href="https://zdcs.link/aA8Mq0?object_uuid=05b37f9c-0ec2-4cae-8165-6adf0eaf1b1c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TCGplayer</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We'll ensure this list is updated next week as well, so bookmark this page and check back in again soon. For now, let's check out what's hot on release weekend for Magic's latest set, Lorwyn Eclipsed.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">10 -  Glen Elendra Guardian (Showcase) - From $33.55</h3><div id="234631"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234631" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Glen Elendra Guardian (Showcase)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This three-cost Faerie Wizard has some absolutely stunning artwork, and can be cast with Flash. It’s a 3/4 with flying, but arrives with a -1/-1 counter, which can be removed as an activated ability that also counters a noncreature spell.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s a lot to remember, but if you find <a href="https://zdcs.link/zj8wZp?object_uuid=05b37f9c-0ec2-4cae-8165-6adf0eaf1b1c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Glen Elendra Guardian in Showcase art</u></a>, you could earn around $34, or up to $47 in foil.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">9 - Bitterbloom Bearer (Showcase) - From $42</h3></div><div id="234632"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234632" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Bitterbloom Bearer (Showcase)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/9wBZYb?object_uuid=05b37f9c-0ec2-4cae-8165-6adf0eaf1b1c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Bitterbloom Bearer is another Showcase card</u></a>, and it’s sitting at $42 but can reach as high as $85 in foil.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a two-cost Faerie Rogue, again with Flying and Flash, but saps life on your upkeep to create Faerie creature tokens with flying.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">8 - Selfless Safewright (Showcase) - From $45.03</h3></div><div id="234633"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234633" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Selfless Safewright (Showcase) </h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This one is already dropping in price, but the <a href="https://zdcs.link/a56025?object_uuid=05b37f9c-0ec2-4cae-8165-6adf0eaf1b1c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Showcase version of Selfless Safewright</u></a> is now $45.03 in foil.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a 4/2, five-cost Elf Warrior creature with (you guessed it) Flash. It’s also got Convoke, and turns creatures of your chosen type hexproof and indestructible until end of turn.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">7 - Harmonized Crescendo (Showcase) - From $63.62</h3></div><div id="234634"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234634" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Harmonized Crescendo (Showcase)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This six-cost Instant has Convoke, and lets you draw cards based on the number of cards you have in that type. There’s great artwork, too, showing merfolk singing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It looks as though the price will drop, but for now, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QK8bVE?object_uuid=05b37f9c-0ec2-4cae-8165-6adf0eaf1b1c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Showcase version of Harmonized Crescendo</u></a> is north of sixty bucks.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">6 - Moonshadow (Showcase) - From $76.71</h3></div><div id="234635"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234635" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Moonshadow (Showcase)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">With some amazing artwork that extends from beyond the card’s borders, this <a href="https://zdcs.link/zj8wZq?object_uuid=05b37f9c-0ec2-4cae-8165-6adf0eaf1b1c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Showcase treatment for Moonshadow</u></a> is awesome - and could net you upwards of $75.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a one-cost Elemental with 7/7 (yes, you read that right) and Menace, but it enters with six -1/-1 counters. You remove those counters when permanents enter your graveyard.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">5 - Bloom Tender (Showcase) - From $114.62</h3></div><div id="234636"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234636" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Bloom Tender (Showcase)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time of writing, this <a href="https://zdcs.link/QOj18O?object_uuid=05b37f9c-0ec2-4cae-8165-6adf0eaf1b1c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Showcase Bloom Tender</u></a> is being sold for $600, but its current market value is closer to $110 according to TCGPlayer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a 1/1 Elf Druid, but it taps for mana from permanents you control. Could be a good inclusion if you’re upgrading the Dance of the Elements precon.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">4 - Winnowing (Showcase Fracture Foil) - From $228.50</h3></div><div id="234637"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234637" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Winnowing (Showcase Fracture Foil)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QrJOkD?object_uuid=05b37f9c-0ec2-4cae-8165-6adf0eaf1b1c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>This version of Winnowing</u></a> breaks the $200 barrier, with some gorgeous, colorful art and that always impressive Fracture Foil treatment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for what it does, this six-cost Sorcery has Convoke and allows you to essentially boardwipe all but one of your opponents’ creatures.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">3 - Moonshadow (Showcase Fracture Foil) - From $295</h3></div><div id="234638"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234638" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Moonshadow (Showcase Fracture Foil)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Yep, that’s a big jump for this version of Moonshadow, which is functionally the same as any other Moonshadow card in the set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/a07Yjr?object_uuid=05b37f9c-0ec2-4cae-8165-6adf0eaf1b1c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>This Fracture Foil variant</u></a> commands a fee of almost $300 at pre-launch prices.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">2 - Selfless Safewright (Showcase Fracture Foil) - From $452.50</h3></div><div id="234639"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234639" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Selfless Safewright (Showcase Fracture Foil)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">TCGPlayer marks the current market value of <a href="https://zdcs.link/aN37vV?object_uuid=05b37f9c-0ec2-4cae-8165-6adf0eaf1b1c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Selfless Safewright in Showcase Fracture Foil</u></a> at $452.50, but it’s been sold for around $100 less already.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">1 - Bloom Tender (Showcase Fracture Foil) - From $657.08</h3></div><div id="234640"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234640" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Bloom Tender (Showcase Fracture Foil)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aD8ymb?object_uuid=05b37f9c-0ec2-4cae-8165-6adf0eaf1b1c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>This version of Bloom Tender is gorgeous</u></a>, and could net you a sizeable windfall if you open a pack and find it waiting for you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s sitting at around $650 for market value, and the most recent sale is around the same amount. Happy hunting!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on Magic: The Gathering’s latest set, be sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-lorwyn-eclipsed-precon-decks-in-stock-best-price-preview"><u>our guide to the two new Commander precon decks</u></a>: Blight Curse and Dance of the Elements.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy - Lorwyn Eclipsed</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Not only is Lorwyn Eclipsed the first set of a fairly packed year for Magic fans, but it marks big changes to the product lineup as well. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For starters, theme decks are back for Standard play, while a new Draft Night boxed product encourages players to, well, draft cards to build their decks. Then there's our first Commander decks since Edge of Eternities, and both look pretty great. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking to pick up the rarest cards going, then you'll want to invest in the Collector Booster Box, as it has the highest pull rates going. Good luck, and let us know if you manage to score anything good when cracking those new packs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more.
