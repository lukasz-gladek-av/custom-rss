			<p>Amazon is having a busy week for its TV series adaptations of video games. On top of showing off our first look at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-sophie-turner-lara-croft-tomb-raider-tv-show/">Sophie Turner as Lara Croft</a></strong> and confirming the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-fallout-shelter-reality-competition-show-confirmed/">rumoured <strong>Fallout Shelter</strong>-based reality competition show to be real</a>, it also confirmed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-show-amazon-prime-ryan-hurst-kratos-cast/"><strong>Ryan Hurst</strong>, who played Thor in <strong>God of War Ragnarok</strong>, would be playing <strong>Kratos</strong></a> in its upcoming <strong>God of War TV series</strong>. Now, we have our latest cast member for the God of War series, with Warm Bodies star <strong>Teresa Palmer</strong> tapped to play <strong>Sif</strong>.</p>



<p>The news comes from a report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/teresa-palmer-cast-prime-video-god-of-war-1236684477/">Deadline</a>, and arrives just one day after Hurst was named as Kratos for the show. The series is reportedly set to <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-show-begins-filming-march-2026/">start filming sometime in <strong>March 2026</strong></a>, and if that is still the case, then we'll likely start to see more casting announcements as we get closer to the series kicking off production.</p>



<p>What's also interesting to note about this casting announcement is that it gives us more insight into the approach the show is taking with the story. We already knew that this series wouldn't be addressing Kratos' story from the original set of Greek mythology-based games, and that it would be jumping right into the Norse era.</p>



<p>But now that we know the show will include Sif, who players will remember is a Norse goddess in her own right and the wife of <strong>Thor</strong>, we know that the show is pulling from both the 2018 God of War and Ragnarok. Sif doesn't appear in Ragnarok, so now at least know whatever version of Kratos and Atreus' story we get in this show, it'll involve more than just the few Norse gods we meet in the first game.</p>



<p>The series is being led by <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-god-of-war-tv-series-details/"><strong>Ronald D. Moore</strong>,</a> who took over as showrunner after PlayStation Productions scrapped the initial version of the show over creative differences with its previous leads. The first couple of episodes will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-series-two-seasons-shogun-director-to-direct-opening-episodes-amazon/">directed by Shogun director, <strong>Frederick E.O. Toye</strong></a><strong>,</strong> and hopefully, we'll have more official news about the series, and when we'll get our first look of it soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/851165/ces-2026-what-to-expect">As we predicted</a>, the world’s biggest consumer electronics show was a bit of a bust for gamers this year! CES 2026 brought us <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/848331/8bitdo-ultimate-3e-controller-xbox-wireless-tmr-swappable-joysticks">several</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@verge/video/7593953104756821262">neat</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/860346/force-feedback-steering-wheel-in-a-gamepad-feels-surprisingly-great">gamepads</a>, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/853587/lenovo-legion-go-2-steam-os-annoucement-price-release-date">barely</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/860992/onexplayer-ces-2026-liquid-cooled-strix-halo-apex-super-x-handheld-egpu">any</a> handhelds and no new desktop GPUs — not from Nvidia, not from Intel, and not from AMD.</p><p>But if you dig deep, AMD said two things at this year’s show that are worthy of attention. Did you catch that the company’s about to make socketed <em>mobile</em> chips again? Or that its answer to Intel is to lower the price of its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/791460/gpd-win-5-corded-handhelds">monster Strix Halo silicon</a>?</p><p>Publicly, AMD barely acknowledged consumers at the Consumer Electronics Show. “AMD failed us,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsCrKGY9F1o">decried Gamers Nexus</a>, pointing out that the company’s keynote was almost entirely fixated on AI. Outside the keynote, the company’s few consumer-friendly announcements — including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/855188/amd-ryzen-7-9850x3d-processor-boost-clock-announcement">the Ryzen 7 9850X3D</a> for gaming desktops and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/855343/amd-ryzen-ai-400-release-date">Ryzen AI 400</a> for laptops — are all retreads of existing components.</p><p>AMD also didn’t announce a new chip for handheld gaming PCs, no successor to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337300/amd-ryzen-z2-z2-extreme-z2-go">the Z2 and Z2 Extreme it introduced</a> a year ago, even as Intel publicly announced plans for an “entire handheld gaming platform” and Qualcomm teased its own handhelds for a possible March reveal.</p><p>Intel didn’t miss a chance to jab: “They’re selling ancient silicon, while we’re selling up-to-date processors specifically designed for this market,” Intel client product management director Nish Neelalojanan <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3024634/theyre-selling-ancient-silicon-intel-warns-handheld-war-is-coming.html">told <em>PCWorld</em></a>.</p><p>Yet AMD claims those so-called “ancient” processors are more than a match for Intel’s new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/854519/intel-core-ultra-3-panther-lake-18-a-release-date-decoder-ring">Panther Lake silicon</a>. AMD client chip boss Rahul Tikoo <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/amd-is-unphased-by-panther-lakes-big-integrated-gpu-its-not-even-a-fair-fight-to-compare-the-arc-b390-to-strix-halo-amd-exec-claims">told<em> Tom’s Hardware</em> </a>that AMD’s Strix Halo / Ryzen AI Max chip “will kill” Panther Lake. He said, “It’s not even a fair fight at that point, because it’s discrete-level graphics.”</p><p>Tikoo also told <em>Tom’s</em> <em>Hardware</em> that Intel’s gaming-grade Panther Lake chips might be pricier than you expect: “And, oh, by the way, that 12 Xe [Panther Lake]... Wait until you see the price point on that. It’s gonna be, you know. Enough said.”</p><p>Price has been the problem with AMD’s Strix Halo too — every <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/791460/gpd-win-5-corded-handhelds">powerful Ryzen handheld</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/749404/framework-desktop-pc-amd-ryzen-ai-max-385-395-plus-review">mini desktop</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/621947/asus-rog-flow-z13-gaming-tablet-laptop-amd-strix-halo-review">monster tablet</a> we’ve seen has cost around $2,000, even before <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/839353/pc-ram-shortage-pricing-spike-news">the RAM crunch</a>. But that brings me to <strong>the first exciting thing for gamers</strong> AMD quietly revealed at CES: The cost of its powerful Strix Halo systems is almost certainly about to come down.</p><p>AMD introduced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/855463/amd-strix-halo-ai-max-plus-388-392-handheld-gaming">two new cut-down versions of Strix Halo</a> last week with their full-fat graphics intact; Tikoo told us that gaming companies specifically had been asking for parts like the new Ryzen AI Max Plus 388 and 392.</p><p>And when I caught up with AMD’s Jason Banta, who’s in charge of interfacing with those companies, he said AMD genuinely expects the two new chips will lead to lower Strix Halo system prices, below $2,000 even when you factor in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/839506/ram-shortage-price-increases-pc-gaming-smartphones">the runaway price of RAM</a>. (I asked the question several different ways to be sure of his answer.)</p><p>Banta would not tell me if the company has any <em>other </em>plans to defend its tiny handheld empire (the Steam Deck, Xbox Ally, Legion Go, and more all use AMD chips, as do the PlayStation and Xbox) when Intel and Qualcomm come knocking later this year. “We believe imitation is a great form of flattery,” is all he’d really say. “When we’re creating the segment, innovating the segment, we expect others to enter.”</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->9</strong><span><figcaption><em>OneXPlayer brought liquid-cooled Strix Halo handhelds and tablets to CES. This is the “Frost Bay” external cooler.</em></figcaption> <cite>Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge</cite></span></p></section><p>Banta isn’t afraid of Intel and Qualcomm handheld chips taking his customers away. “What they’ve seen is we’ve proven we can execute, and not just execute: When we see a quirk with a game, we follow up, we update, we optimize. […] That has a very big influence on those design decisions for every one of these OEMs,” he said. Banta said AMD’s handheld business is still growing, too, and the company still plans to keep investing.</p><p>Most PC makers don’t seem ready to climb aboard Intel’s handheld bandwagon just yet. If you take a close look at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/857252/intel-handheld-gaming-pc-panther-lake-custom-cpu">Intel’s keynote slide</a>, the only major vendors listed are Acer and MSI, and the only boutique handheld makers are GPD and OneXPlayer, both still <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/860992/onexplayer-ces-2026-liquid-cooled-strix-halo-apex-super-x-handheld-egpu#comments">big on AMD</a>. The rest of Intel’s partners (Compal, Foxconn, Inventec, Pegatron, Quanta, and Wistron) aren’t brands, but rather the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_laptop_brands_and_manufacturers#Original_design_manufacturers_(ODMs)">ODM contract manufacturing companies</a> that’ll be fighting for their business.</p><p>While I was chatting with AMD’s Jason Banta at the show, he brought my attention to one more piece of news that was <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-shows-first-renders-of-ryzen-ai-400-for-am5-socket">easy to miss</a>. <strong>The second potentially exciting thing for gamers</strong> is that AMD is making <em>socketed</em> mobile processors again — Ryzen AI 400 laptop chips that aren’t soldered down, but fit into a socket like a desktop CPU, so you can replace or potentially even upgrade them in the future.</p><p>He said they’ll begin to appear in desktops in the early part of this year, specifically targeting Q2. Banta thinks socketed mobile chips are going to unlock gaming and productivity designs of all shapes and sizes: “That socketed Ryzen AI 400, we’re expecting to see that everywhere from 1-liter designs all the way to 30-liter designs,” he says. (<a href="http://ming/606006/nvidia-rtx-5090-egpu-gaming-handheld-oculink-test-pcie-minisforum-deg1">Mobile processors can be a good match for beefy desktop GPUs</a>, since most games don’t require all that much CPU power at high resolution.)</p><p>These socketed chips aren’t just for gamers, mind; it sounds like they were actually targeted at AI PCs to start. “What we’re seeing is folks that want the flexibility of the socketed design, but they want to try out Copilot Plus, they want to try out some local models that can actually leverage the NPU and run directly on that,” he said.</p><p>When I asked if the socket means we should expect upgradable <em>laptops</em>, Banta gently throws some cold water on that idea. “In general, what we find is people want the thinnest system they can get, even if they’re enthusiast users,” and that both the socket itself and a socketed CPU’s integrated heat spreader add unwanted thickness to a laptop.</p><p>But he seems to think it’ll happen in mini PCs: “What we’re seeing is BGA, LGA, everyone’s experimenting in a lot of different ways within those 1-liter, 2-liter designs, things you can fit on your desk.”</p><p>While I didn’t spot a mini PC with a socketed CPU at the show, I bumped into one with tiny modular desktop graphics cards — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/831106/minisforum-g1-pro-mini-pc-price-release-date">this Steam Machine competitor from Minisforum</a> — and it makes me excited for a possible future where we can upgrade the CPU, too. Why should only larger PCs be fully upgradable? The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/818111/valve-steam-machine-hands-on-preview-specs-announcement">new Steam Machine</a> isn’t, and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/749404/framework-desktop-pc-amd-ryzen-ai-max-385-395-plus-review">Framework Desktop</a> requires you to upgrade a whole mainboard at a time, but it doesn’t have to be that way.</p><p>For that to happen, though, AMD would also have to <em>sell</em> its socketed mobile processors at retail the way it sells its desktop ones, and AMD’s not yet willing to commit to that today.</p><p>“What can I say… we have active partnerships with OEMs on Ryzen AI 400 socketed designs. DIY is not something we’re communicating information about at this time, so more to come later,” Banta said.</p><p>Here’s hoping.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/862861/amd-ces-2026-socketed-laptop-chips-strix-halo-price]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/sgf-2024/2024/06/07/amazon-mmo-new-world-coming-to-consoles-with-major-updates">New World: Aeternum</a> will be taken offline in roughly one year, Amazon Games has announced. The MMO was delisted from stores yesterday, January 15, but existing owners can still play the game until it’s shut down for good.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/the-future-of-new-world-aeternum-what-to-expect">blog post</a> on New World’s official website, the developer explains that New World: Aeternum’s official shutdown date will be January 31, 2027. An FAQ states that although the game has been removed from sale, owners can still install the game from their library. In October, Amazon Games announced the game would stop receiving new content, but it will continue to monitor bugs and performance for the remainder of the game’s lifetime.</p><p>Additionally, players can purchase New World's in-game currency, Marks of Fortune, until July 20. However, purchased currency cannot be refunded. Those who recently bought the game will need to contact customer support for their respective platform's storefronts to seek a potential refund.</p><p>“We want to thank the players for your dedication and passion,” reads the blog post. “We are grateful for the time spent crafting the world of Aeternum with you. Together we built something special. While we are saddened to say goodbye, we’re honored that we were able to share so much with the community.”</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kzKWFP9dPFQ"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kzKWFP9dPFQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>New World: Aeternum originally launched as simply <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2020/07/10/amazons-upcoming-mmorpg-new-world-delayed-to-spring-2021">New World</a> for PC in 2021. The game centers on players inhabiting and surviving on a fantasy island, Aeternum, amid the 17th century during the Age of Exploration. &nbsp;It came to consoles in 2024 with the Aeternum subtitle, along with major updates to the experience. The game was also featured in an episode of Amazon Prime’s <em>Secret Level</em> anthology series.</p><p>This news comes only a few months after Amazon <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/10/28/amazon-lays-off-more-than-14000-including-significant-role-reductions-across-its-gaming">laid off over 14,000 employees</a> across its various divisions, including its gaming division. According to Amazon, the layoffs were made to streamline the company's workflow and management layers to ensure increased investment in its "biggest bets" as part of its push to embrace AI, which it called "the most transformative technology we've seen since the internet" at the time of the layoffs. Today's news about New World: Aeternum's impending closure comes in the same week that BioWare's Anthem was <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/03/anthems-servers-are-shutting-down-in-january-rendering-it-completely-unplayable">shut down for good</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/16/new-world-aeternum-will-be-shut-down-in-january-2027]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pokopia-release-date-switch-2-multiplayer-ditto-2000660646</link>
            <guid>1408624</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It’s the 30th anniversary of </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> this year, and while there are probably big RPG announcements on the way, the first major game we know is coming this year is something a little bit different. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pokopia-animal-crossing-switch-2-nintendo-direct-2000625331"><i><span>Pokémon Pokopia</span></i></a> <span>is an </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-3-0-tips-guide-2000660180"><i><span>Animal Crossing</span></i><span>-style life sim</span></a><span> in which you help rehabilitate a desolate town into a habitat livable for Pokémon. It seems to be </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>’s play at the “cozy” genre, but it may have some dark undertones based on what we’ve seen. Here’s everything we know so far.</span></p> <h2><b>The premise</b></h2> <p><i><span>Pokopia </span></i><span>stars a Ditto who transforms into a human, whose form you will be able to customize. It is heavily implied that this human form is meant to embody Ditto’s trainer, who is missing as of the beginning of the game.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>They meet a graying Tangrowth called Professor Tangrowth, with whom they decide to help rebuild a desecrated town into a livable space, complete with specialized habitats to attract new Pokémon residents. Along the way, Ditto will learn new abilities that will help it cultivate its growing town, using water attacks to water plants and fire ones to cook and burn objects. Ditto can also transform into other Pokémon for traversal’s sake, turning into a Lapras to swim between areas, for instance, or a Dragonite to fly across great distances.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>As you build your plot of land back up, Pokémon will flock to it and soon you’ll have a little community of critters. They’ll come to you with requests for how to make the town better, and that will attract more Pokémon to your space. The more people that show up, the more you’ll need to build homes and other buildings to fill up the town, such as houses, Pokémon Centers, and other utilities.</span></p>

  <h2><b>New Pokémon</b></h2> <p><span>While there haven’t been any new Pokémon species announced for </span><i><span>Pokopia</span></i><span>, a few returning monsters have named variants. Peakychu is a pale-white Pikachu that has an almost ghostly aura about her. Professor Tangrowth has white vines on the top of its head as if it’s an older grass-type Pokémon, and it also wears glasses and a broken Technical Machine on its head to look like a human doctor. Mosslax is a Snorlax that has been asleep for so long it’s been wrapped in vegetation. And lastly, Smearguru is a Smeargle covered in plant splotches. As best as we can tell, these are just named characters and are still considered members of the same existing species. I would be surprised if any of them showed up in the RPGs as usable party members, though.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>Is it post-apocalyptic?&nbsp;</b></h2> <p><span>There’s a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pokopia-post-apocalypse-snorlax-pikachu-fuschia-2000644400"><span>running theory</span></a><span> that </span><i><span>Pokopia </span></i><span>might be set in some kind of dark, post-apocalyptic future version of the Kanto region from </span><i><span>Pokémon Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Blue</span></i><span>. Professor Tangrowth says he hasn’t seen humans in a while, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pokopia-map-kanto-region-post-apocalypse-leak-2000650529"><span>some of the areas</span></a><span> we’ve seen do seem to resemble areas from the original games. Also, each of the “new” Pokémon has some element to them that is giving post-apocalypse. Mosslax has been sleeping so long that nature is reclaiming it, Peakychu is either dead or dying, and Smearguru has seemingly been painting so much that it hasn’t had a proper shower in a while. Will the game actually explore this, or will it just be a haunting truth in the background of an otherwise cozy game? We’re not sure yet.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Multiplayer</b></h2> <p><i><span>Pokopia </span></i><span>will include a cooperative multiplayer mode for up to four players, either by connecting online with multiple game owners, or using GameShare to play with a second player who doesn’t own the game. When using GameShare, the second player can play on the original Switch system, but the game will only be natively playable on Switch 2.</span></p>

 <h2><b>It’s a game-key card</b></h2> <p><span>Unfortunately, </span><i><span>Pokopia</span></i><span>’s physical copies will include </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-pokemon-pokopia-game-key-card-2000642940"><span>a game-key card</span></a><span>, which means the cartridge you put in your system won’t actually contain the game data. Instead, it will just act as a key to tell your Switch 2 to download the game onto your system through the eShop.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>But when is it coming out?</b></h2> <p><i><span>Pokémon Pokopia </span></i><span>is coming to Switch 2 on March 5.</span></p>

The studio has indicated that there are multiple new maps on the horizon, as well as an upcoming content roadmap.</p><p>"There are going to be multiple maps coming this year," said Arc Raiders design lead Virgil Watkins during an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/there-are-going-to-be-multiple-maps-coming-this-year-arc-raiders-dev-teases-2026-roadmap-and-maybe-some-new-maps-even-grander-than-what-weve-got-now/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>.

So you might see some that are smaller, and you might see some that are even grander than what we've got now."</p><p>Watkins didn't share specific details about what will be featured in the new maps, but he added that "the ambition is to try to pair it with some new type of experience, whether that's the map conditions or weather conditions we put in that make the play feel different, enemy types or compositions feeling different, or we're escalating the types of loot available there."</p><p>As for the Arc Raiders content roadmap, Watkins suggested that it will be released "sometime soon." In the meantime, he confirmed that Embark is working on new weapons, objectives, and enemies in addition to the maps.</p><p>Embark has also shared details and stats about its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-players-threw-a-lot-of-snowballs-in-the-cold-snap-event/1100-6537434/" data-ref-id="1100-6537434">recently concluded Cold Snap event in Arc Raiders</a>.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/16/ubisoft-to-update-old-far-cry-games-to-run-at-60fps/</link>
            <guid>1408594</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Ubisoft have revealed, via the unusual method of pictogram, that three old Far Cry games will be getting an update to 60 frames per second. The games are Far Cry 3, Far Cry Blood Dragon, and Far Cry Primal, but there is no date or format information for updates.</p>



<p>Excellent use of a cat purring emoji there, Ubisoft.</p>
<p>Far Cry 5 was updated to run at 60fps <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/03/16/far-cry-5-free-60fps-upgrade-free-weekend/">in 2023</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/far-cry-6/">Far Cry 6</a> launched with a 60fps mode.</p>
<p>In 2023 it was rumoured that Far Cry 7 was to be two games, Project Blackbird which is Far Cry 7, and also Project Maverick, a new stand alone multiplayer game which may be linked to Far Cry 7.</p>

<p>Ubisoft are very fond of massive multiplayer live service games that they can run for many years with content update so it makes sense they would try and make a Far Cry multiplayer title. Sources have also revealed that the game will use the Frostbite engine rather than the aging Dunia engine. Again, this makes sense, one engine for all of Ubisoft’s games means less money spent on maintenance and upkeep.</p>
<p>Far Cry 7 is said to be set in the “Alaskan wilderness” and is an extraction-based shooter” with mechanics such as permadeath, a backpack system, contracts, and more.”</p>
<p>In September 2025 Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot gave a presentation at the New Global Sport Conference and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/far-cry-7-will-focus-more-on-multiplayer-ubisoft-confirms/">said</a> that the goal with Far Cry 7 is to “really to bring the multiplayer aspects” and that it would be “more predominantly pushed so that it can also be played for a long time.”</p>
<p>Far Cry was one of three games <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/27/ubisoft-and-tencent-create-new-subsidiary-just-for-assassins-creed-rainbow-six-far-cry/">folded in to a brand new compan</a>y along with Assassin’s Creed and Rainbow Six. The business unit is the new home for Ubisoft’s teams in Montréal, Quebec, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Barcelona, and Sofia. The new subsidiary will control each game from these series in the back catalogue, as well as any new games that are in development going forward.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/having-your-game-be-free-on-epic-is-great-advertising-for-steam-sales-says-indie-pub-after-blood-west-sales-spiked-while-it-was-free-on-egs/</link>
            <guid>1408591</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>New Blood Interactive </strong>co-founder and chief executive officer <strong>Dave Oshry</strong> has made a name for himself, not just as the head of the indie publisher, but on the <a href="https://x.com/DaveOshry">social media platform X (formerly Twitter)</a>, where he often shares his thoughts and sometimes industry insights. Today, we have the latter, as Oshry revealed the latest example of how much people <strong>hate using the Epic Games Store</strong> and would much rather use <strong>Steam</strong>.</p>



<p>In response to a meme video about how players would rather pay for a game on Steam than grab it for free off the Epic Games Store, Oshry offered a real-life example of the scenario the meme was poking fun at.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1587130/Blood_West/">Blood West</a></strong> is an indie first-person shooter published by New Blood Interactive, and it was also one of the games that was given away <strong>for free on the Epic Games Store</strong> during Epic's annual holiday giveaway period, where it gives away one free game per day leading up to the new year. Blood West <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-free-on-epic-games-store/">was free for December 20, 2025</a>, and by the time the giveaway promotion had ended, it was one of the <strong>20 games</strong> that contributed to <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-free-game-saved-you-over-550/">Epic saving players from spending <strong>$550 </strong>if they wanted to purchase all 20 games at their full, non-sale price</a>.</p>



<p>(Speaking of free games on the Epic Games Store, as a quick aside, <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-two-styx-games-are-free-on-epic-games-store/">you can currently get <strong>Styx: Master of Shadows</strong> and <strong>Styx: Shards of Darkness</strong> for free on the store</a>.)</p>



<p>But that doesn't matter to players, because they're not using the Epic Games Store anyway. They're using Steam, and when given the chance to buy a game on sale on Steam or get it for free on the Epic Games Store, they'd rather buy it on Steam. </p>



<p>"<em>Blood West was free on EGS over the holidays and sold like 200% more on Steam that day</em>," Oshry wrote in response to the meme post. "<em>I used to think EGS was a Marketing Black Hole but turns out having your game be free on Epic is great advertising for Steam sales!</em>"</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Oshry continued to explain that when a game is made free on the Epic Games Store, Epic offers developers a lump-sum royalty payment for the period it's available for free, all of which went directly to Blood West's developer, <strong>Hyperstrange</strong>.</p>



<p>"<em>New Blood doesn't get any royalties from EGS we let Hyperstrange take 100% of that - so they got the $$$ bag for the free giveaway, are putting that money into developing the new DLC and we got more Steam sales too</em>," Oshry said. In response to another user, Oshry revealed he had conducted an interview earlier in the day, where he said, "<em>Epic could give devs 100% of sales and it doesn't mean shit if there's no sales lol. WHAT'S 100% OF $0</em>."</p>



<p>Back in December, while Epic was in the middle of its end-of-year giveaways,<a href="https://wccftech.com/egs-is-a-shop-steam-is-a-home-developer-explains-why-pc-users-attached-valves-platform/"> <strong>The Astronauts</strong> founder <strong>Adrian Chmielarz</strong> put it bluntly, and perhaps best:</a> "<em></em><em>EGS is a shop, and Steam is a community</em>." Oshry's example today is just the latest to make it clear that players are choosing to stick with their communities. </p>

              <p>Since the New Year, discussions about <em>Arc Raiders</em> have shifted from near-unadulterated praise (for everything but its use of AI voices) to growing concerns over the game’s cheating problem. Developer Embark has already started making moves to improve this, first removing access to the console in the PC version, and now issuing some quite surprisingly dramatic bans to those it’s catching stream-sniping.</p> <p>Things started getting heated around January 6 <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-cheaters-ninja-shroud-embark-patch-2000657708">when streamer Shroud expressed his frustration</a> during a live broadcast, uttering “What’s the point of fuckin’ playing?” as he encountered so many issues. He was joined by other big names like Ninja and Nadeshot in making it clear that if something didn’t change soon, the high-profile players were likely to move on to other games.</p>

 <p>At the same time, others were complaining that PC players were able to access the Unreal Engine console within the game and switch off various visual settings such that they could see other players with effectively supernatural vision. By January 13, Embark released a new patch that nerfed a couple of elements that were spoiling PvP, while also preventing key card spoof cheats. This followed a hotfix that removed the console from the PC build, with the explanation that it was never supposed to have been available. And this all followed an announcement on the game’s Discord that <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-devs-say-they-have-big-plans-to-stop-the-current-wave-of-cheaters-2000658425">there were longer-term plans in place</a> for addressing the wider cheating concerns.</p>

 <p>Today, it seems, Embark has begun better wielding the banhammer. According to various posts on Reddit and X, streamers have reported that those players engaging in stream sniping are finally receiving retribution, while others have been posting images of ban messages to social media.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">not even 30 minutes later and theyre banned😭 <a href="https://t.co/QxBqjMaGo5">https://t.co/QxBqjMaGo5</a> <a href="https://t.co/aY2AtwALEC">pic.twitter.com/aY2AtwALEC</a></p> <p>— aimkey (@aimkeyx) <a href="https://twitter.com/aimkeyx/status/2012139292001448355?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 16, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>And these aren’t 24-hour slaps on the wrist, either. One image of a ban posted to X by user @aimkeyx begins, “Permanently suspended,” with accompanying text reading:</p>

 <blockquote><p>“Your account has been permanently suspended for behavior that violates our code of conduct. Due to the severity of your violation, access to your account will not be restored.”</p></blockquote> <p>This is a big step up from the 30-day bans that were being issued previously.</p> <p>The few examples we’ve been able to find so far seem to focus on stream snipers. These are people who either deliberately try their luck to get into the same lobby as a streamer, or use external software to ensure they do should the streamer make the mistake of leaving the UUID for their game session visible at the bottom of the screen. While the former might seem unlikely to work often enough for a person to ensure to match up, you have to factor in that should a streamer have tens of thousands of viewers, there could be a couple of hundred people attempting to cheat this way, making the chances of <em>someone</em> managing it a lot higher. And of course once in the same lobby, they can use the livestream footage to gain an advantage over the streamer. But it does seem to suggest that Embark is taking the issue seriously.</p>

 <p>One streamer who claims to have been caught in the crossfire of all this is Tfue, who found he had a 30-day suspension from <em>Arc Raiders</em> a few days ago. Many suggested it could be because Tfue brought up the console on his stream to show how it could be exploited, although he claims he didn’t actually use it. Others made unsupported accusations about the use of various macros, which Tfue strongly denied. Eventually the Twitch streamer with 11.4 million followers had his account restored, seeming to suggest it was an error.</p>

  <p>Who knows! Tfue’s ban was clearly one of the more regular 30-day sin-binnings, rather than these new permanent exclusions. It’ll be interesting to see if things improve for streamers, and then hopefully for the wider PvP audience for the game.</p> <p>Meanwhile, can I suggest a far better way to play? This is my favorite&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders&nbsp;</em>clip of all time:</p>

BF Studios describes the update, which has a January 20 release date and serves as the first update Battlefield 6 has seen in a month and a half, as “a smaller set of focused improvements aimed at polish and consistency.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, patch 1.1.3.5 delivers a set of improvements, gameplay tweaks, and balance changes fans have anticipated since launch arrived in October. Jet combat will feel quite different going into the extended Season 1, with cannon damage against other flying vehicles significantly reduced, requiring “approximately 40% more hits” to destroy targets. There’s currently no sign of the previously mentioned dedicated air radar, which was promised to arrive after Season 1 in December.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BF Studios has had a jet balance pass in its sights for some time, but the January 20 update for Battlefield 6 is also said to come with what sounds like a pretty wide-ranging update for melee combat. As players have complained of inconsistent knife and sledgehammer attacks, patch 1.1.3.5 aims to improve responsiveness, consistency, and sprint behavior for those who like to get up close and personal. Another set of smaller changes targets the Assault Ladder, which should behave, well, more like a ladder going forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 Season 1 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-update-1110-now-live-on-all-platforms-ahead-of-season-1-and-battle-pass-progression-later-today">launched</a> October 28 and was scheduled to bring its REDSEC offshoot, maps, weapons, modes, and more to the experience through early-to-mid January. As the three-part debut season came to an end, players were left wondering how Season 2 might reinvigorate an experience that was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/losing-steam-3-months-after-launch-its-time-for-a-check-in-with-battlefield-6-and-its-community">steadily falling out of favor with fans</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It wasn’t until January 13, much later than many expected, that BF Studios was finally ready to speak on Season 2, but the news update wasn’t exactly the one many were expecting. Instead of a roadmap, the team announced that Season 2 had been delayed to February 17, with its contents to be detailed at a later date. In its place, Season 1 will roll on, with smaller updates and bonuses to be delivered during the downtime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, Battlefield 6 update 1.1.3.5 will keep the ball rolling, even if it’s just a slight nudge toward the next major content drop. In other news, it was announced this morning that The Division lead Julian Gerighty had <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/a-week-after-saying-the-division-3-was-shaping-up-to-be-a-monster-franchise-boss-julian-gerighty-leaves-ubisoft-for-battlefield-developer-dice">left Ubisoft and to join BF Studios developer DICE</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, you can read the full 1.1.3.5 patch notes below.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Battlefield 6 Season 1 Update 1.1.3.5 Patch Notes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">With Update 1.1.3.5, we’re delivering a smaller set of focused improvements aimed at polish and consistency across Battlefield 6.

<p>Until now, that is. Gulikit made headlines <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/gulikits-elves-2-is-the-first-third-party-pad-with-switch-2-wake-up-support">in 2025</a> by introducing the first third-party controller with wake-up support for Switch 2.

<p>With the TT Pro / TT Max pads, however, Gulikit has created its best controllers yet at $59.99 / £59.99 and $69.99 / $69.99 respectively; two that, in my opinion, just edge out 8BitDo’s Pro 3 as the strongest third-party offering for Switch 2 so far.</p>

<p>One glance at the Pro or Max — I'm covering both here — and you’d be forgiven for thinking, 'But this is just an Xbox controller!' And yes, Gulikit has been leaning heavily on Microsoft’s design for a while now, so the overall shape is much the same. Putting it side-by-side with an official Xbox pad reveals that the Pro/Max is slightly lengthier, but otherwise you’d be hard pressed to find much difference with the form factor.</p>
<p>What <em>is</em> different, however, is the D-pad placement, which has been swapped with the left analogue stick for a more symmetrical design akin to the PlayStation DualSense (and, fortuitously for comparison's sake, the Pro 3). Whether this is a good thing or not really depends on personal preference, but I like it. Having the D-pad up high makes the Pro/Max a wonderful choice for both fighting and retro games, but if you do want to use it for 3D titles with both analogue sticks, this still feels really good.</p>
<p>The D-pad includes two floating designs that you can swap out on the fly. One is more traditional, with a cross on its face, while the other is basically just a concave disc. When I saw the latter in promotional images, I feared the worst, but it’s actually my go-to option. You can still feel the tactile response from the eight directional inputs, and it just feels really nice to waggle about. Overall, the D-pad is responsive and satisfying to use, while lacking the annoying ‘clicking’ sound of the Pro 3.</p>

<p>The analogue sticks feel great, too, and the TMR tech <em>should</em> keep dreaded stick drift at bay for many years to come. Gulikit has also included RGB lighting around both sticks if you’re into that kind of thing, and you can change this via the controller itself to display a basic blue, a rainbow multi-coloured effect, or have it light up depending on the direction you’re moving the sticks. If you don’t want any of this, you can turn it off entirely.</p>
<p>This is also where the Pro and Max differ the most. The latter contains an extra four stick caps of varying heights. In my time testing the controllers, I didn’t really come across any scenarios in which a lengthier stick cap proved necessary, but it’s nice that these are included.</p>
<p>The Max also includes the option to swap between four and eight-directional inputs on the D-pad, while the ‘Auto-Pilot Gaming’ (APG) functionality — which lets you record and play back specific input combos — includes longer time options.</p>
<p>The ABXY buttons all feel exactly as you’d expect, though like the D-pad, these are generally a bit quieter than the Pro 3. If you fancy using the Pro/Max on PC, you can also swap out the buttons for the standard Xbox layout using the included tweezers. Spacing is slightly closer than what you’d see on Nintendo's official Pro Controller and the Pro 3, so everything is easily within reach, while the convex shape of the buttons themselves feels pleasant enough.</p>

<p>Up on top, you’ve got Xbox-inspired triggers, and just like the Pro 3, you can toggle between micro-switch inputs and pressure-sensitive Hall Effect inputs with the relevant switches over on the back. Both options feel great, and I found I’ve been swapping between the two depending on what game I’m playing. So I’d have the full Hall Effect triggers activated for something like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, while the micro-switches feel better on more retro offerings like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_metroid">Super Metroid</a>. To be clear, Mario Kart doesn't make use of analogue triggers; they just feel more natural to me in modern games.</p>
<p>Both pads come with additional paddles that you can add into the four slots on the back. These are nearly identical to what you’d find on the Xbox Elite Controller, and so they’re designed in a way that your two middle fingers rest comfortably on them without accidentally pressing them in.</p>
<p>Again, mapping inputs to these is all done via the controller itself by utilising the settings button in the centre of the device. Gulikit includes a manual for any settings you might want to fiddle around with, and it’s much preferable to loading up an app. If you’re not keen on having the paddles, then the controllers still feel comfortable without them.</p>

<p>In addition to all the bells and whistles you’d expect to find, the Pro and Max have a plethora of additional options. I mentioned a few already, but you’ve also got a range of rumble settings depending on how much feedback you want. I can’t stress enough just how good the rumble really is; it’s just a hair away from being on par with the official Pro Controller 2.</p>
<p>You can also adjust gyro sensitivity, dead zones, and more, and there's a capture button for snapping those sweet Mario Kart World wins. In terms of exclusions, it lacks a headphone jack, NFC amiibo support, and a dedicated chat button. I don’t personally consider any of these essentials, but you may feel different.</p>
<p>Gulikit states wireless latency of 2.62ms with a 730Hz polling rate (the frequency at which data is sent from the controller to the console), while plugging the controllers in reduces this even further to 2.16ms. I've found them to be remarkably responsive in practice.</p>
<p>The retail models also come bundled with Gulikit's own <a href="https://www.gulikit.com/productinfo/1534859.html">Hyperlink 2 Adapter</a>, so if you want to go Bluetooth wireless while eliminating the possibility of interference from elsewhere, that's an option too with a quoted polling rate of 820hz at 2.95ms (and if you <em>really</em> want to, you can use the adapter to link up a PS5 Dualsense to the Switch 2 – wild stuff).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I’ve used the Max specifically almost every day for over a month and only needed to recharge it once. Gulikit claims between 14 - 26 hours between charges depending on settings, and that sounds about right; it easily lasted for longer than 20 hours or so in practice. It’s head and shoulders above most competition, then, and is perhaps second only to Nintendo's Pro Controller.</p>

<p>So overall, the TT Pro and Max are absolute beasts. Not only do they have wake-up support for Switch 2, but they're easily two of the most comfortable controllers I've ever grasped in my grubby mitts. The D-pad placement works nicely for me, but I could certainly understand if you prefer the offset approach. And with the TMR sticks, Hall Effect triggers, RGB lighting, and loads of settings to fiddle around with, Gulikit has provided almost everything you could reasonably want or need from a third-party pad.</p>
<p>Most folks will be quite happy with the Pro model here, with only a minority finding genuine use for the additional stick caps found in the Max. Heck, at $70 though, the Max provides pretty much everything you'd find in Xbox's own Elite Controller at more than half the price. It's insane value for money, and in my opinion, the best third-party controller for Switch 2 so far.</p>
<p>Now, if companies could stop using the word 'Pro' to name their controllers, that'd be <em>great</em>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Digital Foundry Confirms Monster Hunter Wilds PC Performs ‘Thousands’ of DLC Checks That Hurt Performance, But Only in Certain Conditions]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-thousands-dlc-checks-only-certain-conditions/</link>
            <guid>1408549</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-performance-can-reportedly-double-removing-dlc-check/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that one of the reasons <strong>Monster Hunter Wilds PC</strong> players may encounter unexpected frame rate drops is that the game checks for DLC ownership, and <strong>the less DLC you own, the worse the frame rate is going to be.</strong> That can be a problem, especially since there are dozens of cosmetic DLCs. Thankfully, after modder de_Tylmarande found this out, a fix was quickly deployed by Nexus Mods user Vaeux <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/3798?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the so-called '<strong>Less DLC Checks</strong>' mod</a>. The mod requires praydog's <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-rise-modding-tool-reframework-updated-to-work-with-sunbreak-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">REFramework</a></strong>, which improves and fixes various issues in <strong>CAPCOM</strong>'s games built with the <strong>RE Engine</strong>.</p>



<p>Now, Digital Foundry <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/news/2026/01/the-latest-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-perf-drama-explained" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has investigated the issue</a> and discovered that the user's computer is indeed being hammered by <strong>'thousands' of DLC checks</strong>, which are lowering the frame rate. However, <strong>this only happens in a specific scenario</strong>: when your character is in a hub zone and one of the Support Desk felyne characters is nearby. That's because those NPCs handle the DLC menu.</p>



<p>Still, the modder's claim under said conditions is perfectly valid. Using a <strong>Ryzen 5 3600 CPU</strong> test system, the testing performed by Digital Foundry's Richard Leadbetter discovered that the performance boost granted by the Less DLC Checks mod got higher when the graphics settings were lowered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Maxed settings (1440p ultra, RT, DLSS balanced):</strong>&nbsp;11.4% performance improvement</li>



<li><strong>High settings with RT:</strong>&nbsp;20% performance improvement</li>



<li><strong>Lowest settings (DLSS ultra performance, no RT):</strong>&nbsp;25.6% performance improvement</li>
</ul>



<p>The good news is that this issue only really affects the Monster Hunter Wilds PC performance in the aforementioned conditions. That said, CAPCOM should absolutely fix it as soon as possible, and in a way, it's wild that a user discovered it almost a year after the game's original release.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>One of the most important aspects for a 3D platformer to nail is making sure it feels amazing. Running around, jumping, climbing, diving, all of it should be a joy. You should be able to run and jump in a mostly empty room with no textures or music and still have a good time. And </span><i><span>Big Hops</span></i><span>, out now on PS5, PC, and Switch, is a new 3D indie platformer that succeeds perfectly at providing a platformer that’s incredible to play while also offering up plenty of ways to experiment and explore.</span></p> <p><span>In </span><i><span>Big Hops</span></i><span>, you play as the young, precious, and very agile Hop, a talking frog with dreams of leaving his forest to see more of the world. While out with his younger sister on a hike through the woods, which serves as the game’s short and not-annoying tutorial, Hop is summoned by a mysterious voice into a strange dimension. From there, he goes on an epic journey across three different worlds to find the pieces needed to get back home. The eight hours that followed were some of the best 3D platforming I’ve played in a long, long time.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Tongue Tied</b></h2> <p><span>Like most main characters from platforming games, Hop can, well…hop, roll, dive, climb, and eventually swim. But Hop has something special that Mario, Ratchet, and beloved icon Bubsy lack: A handy, dandy, and very long tongue. And it’s Hop’s tongue that elevates </span><i><span>Big Hops </span></i><span>from a great platformer to an all-time classic.</span></p>

 <p><span>With his trusty tongue, Hop can grapple and swing to new locations like Spider-Man. He can also use his tongue to open chests, flip levers, collect items, and even unlock doors via one of the strangest lock-picking mini-games I’ve ever seen. The tongue in </span><i><span>Big Hops</span></i><span> is implemented so well that using it just became second nature to me, as natural as jumping or running in any other game.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>That’s not to say the tongue in</span><i><span> Big Hops </span></i><span>isn’t very cool and awesome, because it is, and the developers designed a lot of clever puzzles and platforming segments that take advantage of it. But it never feels</span> <span>like a silly slapped-on gimmick or a worthless ability that you have to be reminded of via constant screen prompts.</span></p>

 <p><span>And yet, as cool a feature as it is, the devs don’t rely solely on Hop’s tongue to add variety to each of the massive semi-open worlds you explore over the course of </span><i><span>Big Hops’</span></i><span> runtime.</span></p>  <h2><b>Experimenting With Freaky Fruits</b></h2> <p><span>As you meet the locals in these places, which include pirate otters and punk rock bats, you’ll find various fruits that have all sorts of effects. One fruit, for example, when thrown against a wall, generates a rope bridge. Another fruit sets things on fire.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>My favorite special fruit is a green apple that sticks to nearly any surface and can be used to create permanent grapple points. All of these fruits offer a lot of creativity and let me pull off maneuvers that felt like cheating. Wildly,</span><i><span> Big Hops</span></i><span> lets you hold a few of these fruits in your expandable backpack, meaning you can take them to areas where maybe the developer didn’t plan on you having a fire fruit or trampoline fruit. It feels risky as heck to offer the player so much freedom, yet I’m not complaining.</span></p>

 <p><span>Combined, the fruits and tongue let me pull off some wild shit in this colorful 3D platformer. I was able to skip some sections of a level here or avoid a puzzle there using a combination of </span><i><span>Big Hops’</span></i><span> tongue swinging and fruit storing. And it’s this focus on rewarding and encouraging experimentation and exploration that really stood out to me. There were countless times in my journey to get Hop back home when I used my tongue and a fruit to get somewhere that I thought was out of bounds, but hiding up in a corner were a few coins or other small collectibles, a little hat tip from the makers of the game for trying something weird and pulling it off.</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>“Hop does what Mario won’t: Licking everything useful he sees.”</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer</p>                 <p>Luckshot Games</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>Third-person 3D platformer</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Wonderful visuals,  awesome controls, unique tongue features, music</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>Some performance issues, a few glitches</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>Switch, Switch 2, PC, PS5 (Played on PS5 Pro) </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played:</p>                 <p>Completed the main story and some side content in about 8 hours</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release Date</p>                 <p>January 12, 2026</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p><span>Exploring and poking around levels is a joy in </span><i><span>Big Hops,</span></i><span> not only because the devs clearly want you to do that, but because each area and level is gorgeous, featuring cel-shaded-like visuals and crisp colors. On PS5, the game looks stunning and runs at a mostly locked 60FPS that helps the platforming feel snappy, fast, and fluid.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The creepy, purple-tinted Void sections of the game are a standout, featuring stylish environments that twist and fold around in impossible ways. Oh, and the music is wonderful, too, evoking the same vibes as you’d expect from a classic platformer from the PS1 or N64 era.</span></p>

 <h2><b>No Fighting, Just Jumping</b></h2> <p><span>If you’re wondering what combat feels like or what kind of enemies Hop has to deal with, well, there’s none of that in </span><i><span>Big Hops.</span></i><span> Technically, there are a few bugs that will chase Hop (and many more that he can eat for a stamina boost) as well as a handful of fairly easy boss fights. But outside of that, 90 percent of </span><i><span>Big Hops</span></i><span> is combat-free and focused entirely on platforming, exploring, and puzzle-solving.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Don’t expect a relaxing or completely cozy adventure, though, as </span><i><span>Big Hops</span></i><span> has some tense and fast-paced platforming challenges, especially in the second half of the game. You just won’t have to squash 300 random enemies along the way.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Big Hops</span></i><span> is exactly what I want out of a modern 3D platformer. It takes advantage of what modern games can do, with massive levels, detailed graphics, and lots of well-performed voice acting, while also remembering that the main reason people play these kinds of games is to have fun hopping between platforms and obstacles, to feel the satisfaction of getting better with each level and conquering new, trickier jumping challenges.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Big Hops</span></i><span> delivers that experience and more via a visually varied journey that rewards you for poking at the edges of each level while using the game’s brilliant tongue mechanic to find different ways to succeed. Nintendo designers should play </span><i><span>Big Hops</span></i><span> and learn some valuable lessons from this very special game.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>WWE 2K26 is just about two months away, and players will have some new matches to enjoy when they load up the game.</p>



<p>In addition to learning that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-cm-punk-showcase-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CM Punk will be the featured superstar</a> in the game’s Showcase mode, sources have told Insider Gaming what to expect from match types this year.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-are-the-new-wwe-2k26-match-types">What Are The New WWE 2K26 Match Types?</h2>



<p>In total, there are four new match types coming to this year’s game. One of which, Insider Gaming understands, has been in the works for quite some time.</p>



<p>The first new type is the I Quit match. The match hasn’t been seen since WWE 2K14, but is making a return after 13 years (the game launched in October 2013).</p>



<p>Another match returning after 13 years is the Inferno Match. In it, players can win by setting their opponent on fire. As you perform heavier moves, the flames will get larger. The last returning match is the 3 Stages of Hell. A match type that hasn’t been seen since the days of Smackdown vs. Raw, this match has players select three different stipulations for a 2-out-of-3 falls match.</p>







<p>As far as the new match coming, the Dumpster Match is making its debut in the WWE 2K series. While it’s unsure, at this point, exactly how it’ll work, it’s possible that it’ll be akin to the casket match. Exact details on the match are expected to come in the coming weeks.</p>



<p>One last bit regarding a match type that debuted last year, Intergender Matches are returning to the game. It’s also been said that they will even be a part of MyFACTION.</p>



<p>What do you think of the match types coming to WWE 2K26? Leave your thoughts down below, and join the discussion in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a>.</p>

                <p>There are few things more important in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hytale/" data-ref-id="5000-507834">Hytale</a> than the armor your character equips. Armor can save you from dying to a dangerous mob when you're exploring at night or in a dark cave. It also plays a large part in how your character looks, which does play a factor in your experience if you play in third person. While you might have already figured out how to craft the most basic armor in Hytale, there are several more advanced options that offer stronger protection from mobs.</p><p>The guide below shows you all of the current crafting recipes we have for armor in Hytale. As a note, some armor that you see in a Creative-mode world might not be available in Survival yet, similar to our guide on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-hytale-weapons-and-how-to-craft-and-upgrade-them/1100-6537414/" data-ref-id="1100-6537414">all Hytale weapons</a>.</p><h2 id="How_to_craft_armor_in_Hytale">How to craft armor in Hytale</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4636165-3a0ea143fb281f0a8e3f8863d5d19d8d.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4636165" data-ratio="0.53521126760563" data-width="2556" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4636165-3a0ea143fb281f0a8e3f8863d5d19d8d.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4636165"></a><figcaption>A character donning some rare armor in Hytale</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4636165-3a0ea143fb281f0a8e3f8863d5d19d8d.jpg"></figure><p>If you view your character from the inventory screen in Hytale, you'll see that you have four available slots to equip armor. These slots are for your Helm, Gauntlets, Cuirass, and Greaves. For some reason, there is no dedicated boot slot, but maybe that will be added in a future update. You also have a slot for a shield, but that's not necessarily armor, so we won't be covering those crafting recipes.</p><p>Before you rush into trying to craft armor, though, you'll need the right Workbench. All armor can be crafted at an Armorer's Workbench, but some higher-tier armor requires a tier two or tier three Armorer's Workbench. You can find out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-workbench-crafting-recipes-in-hytale/1100-6537409/" data-ref-id="1100-6537409">how build the Armorer's Workbench</a> and upgrade it to higher tiers in our previous guide.</p><h2 id="All_armor_crafting_recipes_in_Hytale">All armor crafting recipes in Hytale</h2><p>You can find every single crafting recipe for all types of armor in Hytale.

Right now, it's essentially the same as the weapons system, as every weapon category has six options, as well. Perhaps future updates will start to include some of the ultra-rare armor and weapons that we can currently see and equip in Creative, but this is what we have available in Survival at the start of early access in Hytale.</p>

            <guid>1408525</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Well, it wouldn't be a new year if there weren't a fresh hell--today, writers at the gaming section of Bustle Digital Group's Inverse said the section has been closed, and layoffs affected Vox-owned The Verge's gaming coverage as well.</p><p>According to a former Inverse writer, the closure affects three writers and the site's gaming editor. That editor, Shannon Liao, confirmed the news on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/shannonliao.bsky.social/post/3mcki3gpiy22o?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">Bluesky</a>, alongside others. (Liao previously worked with Aftermath co-founder Nathan and me at The Washington Post's gaming vertical Launcher, which was shut down in 2023.) The former writer told Aftermath they were told in a Zoom call that the company is "'divesting' from gaming content," language echoed by other laid-off writers on social media today. <strong>(Update, 1/16/26, 1:27pm--</strong>One Inverse worker has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/theloniusly.bsky.social/post/3mckkyivg4c2x?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">said</a> they still have a job at the site, though their role will "be changing significantly."<strong>)</strong></p><p>They say this leaves Inverse with a "skeleton crew Entertainment Team." Bustle bought Inverse in 2019, which <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bustle-digital-group-acquires-inverse-staffers-laid-off-2019-7?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">included layoffs</a>; since then, BDG has seen a rash of layoffs so extensive that opening tabs about them is threatening to crash my browser, including in <a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/the-outline-shut-down-joshua-topolsky-layoffs-bustle-1234570276/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">2020</a>, <a href="https://x.com/thefineprintnyc/status/1571958588326780936?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">2022</a>, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/inverse-lays-off-staff?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">2023</a>, and <a href="https://laid0ff.substack.com/p/negotiating-severance?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">2024</a>, several of which affected Inverse specifically. BDG briefly revived Gawker, sister site of Aftermath's founders' previous home Kotaku, in 2021, and then shuttered it in <a href="https://variety.com/2023/digital/news/gawker-shutting-down-1235509262/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">2023</a>. BDG owner Bryan Goldberg, meanwhile, <a href="https://aftermath.site/ceo-of-media-company-who-owns-napoleons-hat-reviews-napoleon-movie-for-website-he-also-owns/" rel="noreferrer">owns a silly hat</a>.</p><p>"Management had been really telling us the last few months that numbers have been rebounding," the former writer told Aftermath. "But Inverse has always kind of been the black sheep of BDG, because we were so different from all of their other brands. Personally, I've always gotten&nbsp;the sense they just didn't really know what to do with us, despite our numbers justifying our existence."</p><p>In other bad news, Vox-owned The Verge's gaming writer Ash Parrish announced on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/adashtra.bsky.social/post/3mckkus43js22?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">social media</a> that she'd been laid off today. (Parrish previously worked with Aftermath's co-founders at Kotaku.)

<p>Originally founded in 2008 by ex Retro Studios developers Mark Pacini, Todd Keller, and Jack Mathews, Armature has primarily worked on ports, starting with the PS Vita version of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/psvita/metal_gear_solid_hd_collection">Metal Gear Solid HD Collection</a>.</p>
<p>It soon ventured into the world of VR and was acquired by Meta Platforms in 2022, a company that, at the time, were very keen to put all of its efforts into the metaverse. Now that tech bros around the world are obsessed with AI, Mark Zuckerberg has seen fit to steer away from VR.</p>
<p>The result is the closure of three key VR studios: the aforementioned Armature Studio alongside both Twisted Pixel Games and Sanzaru Games. Overall, around 10% of Meta's Reality Labs division has been laid off.</p>
<p>We sincerely hope the folks at every studio affected find their feet in due course. Heck, maybe Retro Studios can snap up Pacini, Keller, and Matthews again..? We'll have to wait and see.</p>

            <guid>1408510</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Kurt Kuhlmann</strong> worked at <strong>Bethesda Game Studios</strong> as a designer for two decades, during which time he was the co-lead designer on <strong><a href="http://wccftech.com/review/skyrim-special-edition-review-when-some-polish-is-not-enough/">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a></strong>, a game that could potentially go down in history as the studio's biggest hit ever. He was also known as the series "<em>loremaster</em>," and though he's no longer with Bethesda, in an interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/bethesdas-former-elder-scrolls-loremaster-on-why-he-left-starfields-communication-breakdowns-and-how-he-wanted-the-elder-scrolls-6-to-be-the-empire-strikes-back/">PC Gamer</a>, Kuhlmann claims he was in line to lead up <strong>The Elder Scrolls VI</strong>, and if he had it his way, we'd be looking at a major <strong>Star Wars</strong>-inspired style of game for the long-awaited entry in the Elder Scrolls series.</p>



<p>Kuhlmann was never officially offered the job of lead designer on The Elder Scrolls VI, but according to him, Bethesda boss <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ai-can-speed-up-game-development-human-intention-is-what-makes-our-stuff-special/">Todd Howard</a></strong> had verbally offered him the role following the completion of Skyrim. In fact, according to Kuhlmann, if not for <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fallout-76-wearisome-wasteland-wandering/">Fallout 76</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/">Starfield</a></strong>, we would've gotten The Elder Scrolls VI a lot sooner.</p>



<p>"<em>Of course, after <strong>Fallout 4</strong> we didn't go to TES6, we made Fallout 76, and then even then we didn't make TES6, we made Starfield," </em>said Kuhlmann<em>, "which became this extremely long project compared to other ones. So from my point of view, I've been waiting like 11 years to be the lead on TES6</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>I was obviously one of the old-timers there and had a lot of experience. <strong>Bruce [Nesmith]</strong> and I had been the co-leads on Skyrim</em>," Kuhlmann continued, "<em>I think most people would call it a successful project, so I thought that it wasn't unreasonable for me to think that I could be a successful lead on TES6. It wasn't just my expectation—I had been told that that was going to happen</em>. <em>And they made the decision, no, you're not going to be the lead.</em>"</p>



<p>Not being given the lead was what stamped home the reality for Kuhlmann that "<em>what I wanted and what he wanted were different at that point</em>," when it finally came to pass that the studio would focus on The Elder Scrolls VI. That, alongside the fact that Bethesda had grown to a point where it functioned in a way that wasn't compatible with how he preferred to operate, contributed to his leaving in 2023.</p>



<p>But if he had been given the lead, and if he had it his way? The story we would've gotten in his version of the game would've been the "<em>Empire Strikes Back</em>" moment for The Elder Scrolls. </p>



<p>"<em>I had in my mind that TES6 was going to be like The Empire Strikes Back</em>," said Kuhlmann. By the end of it, the Thalmor, the elven supremacists who were on the fringes of Skyrim's story, would've seemed to have won, save for the player doing something at the very end of the story to leave a hopeful, cliffhanger ending that would lead into The Elder Scrolls VII. "<em>So you've preserved hope for the future, but overall it looks like the Thalmor are on the march</em>."</p>



<p>Kuhlmann admits that he doesn't believe his idea would've gone far with the rest of the team. Making a game is not like making a movie. After waiting more than a decade for The Elder Scrolls VI, if it ended with evil winning, and a cliffhanger for good potentially succeeding in the next game, which could very well be another decade away, players might not have appreciated it as much as Kuhlmann. "<em>That's not a good way to end a game and say, yeah, we'll see you in 10, 15 years</em>," Kuhlmann said.</p>



<p>Still, it's interesting to hear Kuhlmann's side of the story, and to hear a little more insight into The Elder Scrolls VI, which we've not seen hide nor hair of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-starfield-announced/">since its far-too-early reveal back in <strong>2018</strong></a>. Now that Starfield is out of the way, at least we know the studio is working on it, as Todd Howard and other Bethesda executives <a href="https://wccftech.com/bethesda-speaks-on-the-elder-scrolls-vi-development-can-confirm-its-going/">can say nothing more than "<em>it's going</em>"</a> and that <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-still-a-long-way-off-says-todd-howard/">the game is still "<em>a long way off</em>"</a> when it comes to the game's development progress.</p>



<p>And while Kuhlmann may be right that players wouldn't have loved his Empire Strikes Back, the reality is that no matter what Bethesda does, it won't be able to live up to expectations, as former Bethesda artist <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-do-you-beat-that-why-the-elder-scrolls-vi-is-in-a-no-win-situation/"><strong>Nate Purkeypile</strong> rightly calls the game a "<em>no-win</em>" situation</a>. </p>

              <p><span>The ongoing battle between </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/how-cory-in-the-house-ds-went-from-bad-forgotten-game-1842525482"><i><span>Cory in the House</span></i></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i></a><span> to decide which will ultimately be crowned the top user-rated game on Metacritic rages on, but an unforeseen consequence of the conflict is that secondhand copies of the Nintendo DS Disney game are skyrocketing in price in online marketplaces.</span></p> <p><span>As </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-metacritic-cory-in-the-house-ds-game-2000659380"><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span> first reported on Tuesday</span></a><span>, something strange was brewing over on Reddit: a seemingly organic campaign to get the long-memed 2008 Nintendo DS game </span><i><span>Cory in the House</span></i><span> to the top of Metacritic’s user-rated rankings, unseating 2025’s Game of the Year. </span><span>When I originally reported on the story, </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span>, the current top-ranked user-rated game on the platform, had just dipped from a 9.6 to a 9.5. </span><i><span>Cory in the House </span></i><span>had just risen from 9.3 to 9.4. The meme was about to become a reality.</span></p>

 <p><span>Since then, things have simultaneously changed drastically and also somehow stayed exactly the same. </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span> is still clinging on to a 9.5 rating, but </span><i><span>Cory in the House</span></i><span> is back down to a 9.3. </span><span>The big change is in the number of ratings on Metacritic. I made a note on the 13th that the PS5 version of</span><i><span> Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span> had roughly 23,351 ratings. Now it has 23,654 user ratings. On the other hand, </span><i><span>Cory in the House</span></i><span> had roughly 2,400 ratings on the same date. Now that’s climbed up to whopping </span><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/disney-cory-in-the-house/"><span>4,666 user ratings</span></a><span>. Actually, never mind, I typed that and then immediately refreshed the page. Now it’s up to 4,684.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">As a result of users flooding metacritic &amp; pushing the game to the #2 spot of all time, sealed copies of Cory In The House have skyrocketed by more than 3000% in the past 2 weeks. <a href="https://t.co/nlVkLGWP0V">pic.twitter.com/nlVkLGWP0V</a></p> <p>— Resell News 💸 (@resellnews) <a href="https://twitter.com/resellnews/status/2011945080198930695?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 15, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The point is, the focus is less on review-bombing </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span>, as some had assumed, and more on reverse review-bombing </span><i><span>Cory in the House. </span></i><span>That also probably goes some way toward explaining the recent meme-fueled price increases for physical copies of the Nintendo DS game on eBay. </span><span>The first writer to spot this story seems to have been </span><a href="https://www.cllct.com/sports-collectibles/auctions/cory-in-the-house-meme-makes-video-game-flop-a-collectible-hit"><span><em>Cllct</em>’s Will Stern</span></a><span>.

Since then, </span><em><a href="https://x.com/resellnews/status/2011945080198930695"><span>Resell News</span></a></em><span> noticed that prices had shot up by “more than 3000% in the past 2 weeks,” with some ongoing auctions reaching bids of up to $721.00.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Why The God Of War Casting Has Me Worried]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-casting-kratos-ryan-hurst-amazon-tv-series-2000660584</link>
            <guid>1408495</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Right now, in 2026, we’re living in the boom period that many a gamer has dreamed of for decades: there are plentiful movies and TV shows based on video games being made, and quite a few of them are actually really, really good. It’s to the point now that an outright </span><i><span>Double Dragon</span></i><span>-level stinkbomb<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->looking directly at you, </span><i><span>Borderlands<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment --></span></i><span>feels like an outlier rather than the norm. That’s a good thing overall, but this also means the bar is no longer buried in the floor when it comes to the things that make taking control out of gamers’ hands worthwhile. And now, we’re one step closer to having a </span><i><span>God of War</span></i><span> TV show, with the announcement that Ryan Hurst will be playing the Ghost of Sparta. Granted, many a fan<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->myself included<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->has spent so many years fancasting WWE’s Triple H as Kratos that it’d be a little weird seeing anyone else pick up a Leviathan Axe in live action. But <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-live-action-series-amazon-kratos-ryan-hurst-2000659874">we now know it’ll be Ryan Hurst</a>. </span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>And now I’m a little worried.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span><br> </span></i><i><span>God of War</span></i><span>‘s Kratos has one of the most fascinating and unique character arcs in Western media. </span><span>When this series started in 2005, Kratos was a Spartan soldier with ashen skin, a Scott Ian goatee, and twin blades chained to his arms</span><span> who spent hours upon hours ripping satyrs apart with his bare hands, yelling at the gods, </span><span>blaming them for the death of his family</span><span>, and brooding after threesomes. </span><span>The first game starts and ends with Kratos deciding to plunge to his death from the top of Mt. Olympus because revenge didn’t bring him peace. The only way that first game could be more nu-metal was if Linkin Park played over the end credits, and believe me, I was on </span><a href="http://www.animemusicvideos.org/"><span>AMV.org</span></a><span> enough in the early-to-mid-aughts to know plenty of folks had that exact idea.</span> <span>By the end of Kratos’ third Revenge Tour, his anger had led him to completely decimate the entire Greek pantheon, leaving him immortal and empty.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Unlike most things that angsty from the early aughts, though, Kratos actually managed to grow up, with 2018’s</span><i><span> God of War</span></i><span> evolving the character into </span><span>a thoughtful, pensive father with regrets, who has just barely wrangled his failures as a man into a place where he doesn’t have to lay his multitude of sins onto his son. The Valhalla DLC for </span><span>the 2023 sequel,</span> <i><span>God of War: Ragnarok</span></i><span> could’ve been an empty roguelike mode trying to keep up with the likes of </span><i><span>Hades</span></i><span>, and instead, it’s an act of grace and self-reflection unlike anything in gaming, especially when old man Kratos physically confronts his younger, angrier self, and has to summon the power to forgive him and surpass him.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Those two decades of baggage are a big part of why Amazon’s upcoming </span><i><span>God of War</span></i><span> show has its work cut out for it, but hey, there were plenty of folks who never knew Kratos before 2018, and still loved the last two games. Good writing can paper over any dubious fealty to the games. But unlike, say, </span><i><span>The Last of Us</span></i><span>, this series will lose something introducing Kratos to an audience that has never picked up a controller, unless </span><span>the people in charge craft this version of the </span><span>story very, very carefully. </span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>And that brings me to Ryan Hurst, who has just been cast as Kratos in Amazon’s adaptation.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Let me state upfront that this isn’t really going to be any shade on Ryan Hurst. I’ve liked him in a bunch of things. As someone who stuck with </span><i><span>Sons of Anarchy</span></i><span> way longer than he reasonably should’ve, Hurst’s presence in an episode was always a welcome one, and yeah, I was depressed for days after his character, Opie, got whacked. His performance as Thor in </span><i><span>God of War: Ragnarok</span></i><span> is incredible; having a nigh-invincible god decide to go on an all-timer alcoholic deathmarch is a hell of a take, and Hurst conveying numbness and nihilism in the same scenes as he has to convey unfathomable power and menace is no small feat. He’s a damn fine actor under the right circumstances. </span><span>But that right there is part of the issue. Not that he’s been in this particular universe before, but that this is a circumstance we haven’t seen him in.</span><span> Kratos has particular needs as a character that just….haven’t been there with Hurst.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Normies being introduced to </span><i><span>God of War</span></i><span> through the series will find themselves watching the story of a heartbroken father who has to parent for the first time, going on a journey with his son that brings them closer together, and really, folks who watch a hell of a lot of streaming shows have seen this story told several times over. What’s going to make this show stand out? The Norse angle? </span><i><span>Vikings</span></i><span> is right there. The fantasy elements? It’s going on a streaming platform that already hosts a very expensive </span><i><span>Lord of the Rings</span></i><span> show. The father-son bonding? Probably the easiest layup, and it’s not even going to be the only show based on a video game that builds its foundation on daddy issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Hurst is a good performer, but there’s a different weight to his presence than the one Kratos possesses in the games. Think about that scene in which Kratos ditches Atreus temporarily so he can go back home and get the Blades of Chaos out of storage. The slowness, the fear, but also, the sense that a switch was flipped, that the walking chainsaw Kratos used to be has just been activated. There’s not just surliness and menace there, but a </span><span>certain explosive bloodlust</span><span>, and it’s barely constrained the entire game. </span><span>That’s a different energy than Hurst has ever brought to the table. Kratos has been a monster for a very long time. That guy who used to let innocent soldiers die screaming if it meant getting a hold of a trinket to open a door, or the one willing to sacrifice virgins to spiked pits without ever looking back? </span><i><span>God of War </span></i><span>2018 may reintroduce him as a husband and father in mourning, but as Baldur is quick to remind him later, he’s </span><i><span>still that guy</span></i><span>. Do we see Hurst embodying that volatility in the extreme? Not really.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The other elephant in the room is minor, but it’s got to be addressed: Kratos is a dark olive-skinned Greek, and has traditionally been voiced by black men. That’s always introduced a particularly special texture to Kratos’ entire arc, especially as he’s wrestled more with the man he was and is desperate to move beyond. I’ve known a fair share of black men who recognized the depths there in both T.C. Carson’s and Christopher Judge’s performances, immediately clocking the innumerable black fathers who had to abandon the boys they were so they could be better men. Again, these are things Hurst can likely pull off, but there’s so much less depth to be mined there when our hero is a surly white guy audiences have just met, one who </span><span>never stands out from the people who eventually come to hate and fear the Ghost of Sparta as he rampages through cities</span><span>. When we, presumably, see the glimpses of Kratos’ Spartan past, the ashes of his murdered family grafted onto him as permanent penance, it’s hard not to think it will mean less watching already pale skin go one or two notches down the pantone chart than if we were starting at the other side of the spectrum.</span></p> <p><i><span>God of War</span></i><span> has a shot at being a very good show, especially with </span><i><span>Battlestar Galactica</span></i><span>‘s Ronald Moore at the helm. But it’s a show that’s already putting itself at a disadvantage by incorporating fewer of the more intangible elements this story can carry with it.&nbsp; Ryan Hurst is easy casting. A big surly guy with a beard who can certainly be made to</span><i><span> look</span></i><span> like Kratos. Embodying him, however, demands a hell of a lot more, and I hope they’ve already planned for that.&nbsp;</span></p>
