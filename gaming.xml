One notable feature that isn’t explained at all are the handful of giant vehicles you can briefly take over. It doesn’t take long to figure out that driving into the large question mark opening on their backside is key to controlling them, but none of that matters if you can’t find any to begin with. Read on for a handy breakdown on where to find every transforming vehicle.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196698" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Princess Peach’s Leading Role And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="121" data-playlist="196698,195719,196572" data-current="196698"><div><p>Princess Peach’s Leading Role And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196698/196698_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196698/196698_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196698/196698_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196698/196698_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22254.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h78442"><a id=""></a>Where to find Semi-Trucks</h2><figure id="" data-id="97c1eee0a9821de5386044c59c54364b" data-recommend-id="image://97c1eee0a9821de5386044c59c54364b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Semi-Truck that says Mario Kart on its side drives on a bridge." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Semi-Truck that says Mario Kart on its side drives on a bridge." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="97c1eee0a9821de5386044c59c54364b" data-recommend-id="image://97c1eee0a9821de5386044c59c54364b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Semi-Truck that says Mario Kart on its side drives on a bridge." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The one you’ve likely seen the most is the Semi-Truck. This is the biggest NPC vehicle by far. It stands out with its two containers that display <em>Mario Kart</em> in large red letters. <strong>Semi-Trucks are typically encountered on wide paved roads with multiple lanes.</strong> I’ve often seen them in connecting races with Toad’s Factory as well as the Golden Gate Bridge lookalike that connects Crown City and Faraway Oasis.</p><p>The standard circuit races don’t feature long stretches as much, so you won’t see any of these unless you’re driving between tracks. No need to worry about the sanctity of an old-fashioned race ruined by an obnoxiously fast automobile.</p><p>Another way to drive Semi-Trucks, as well as the other vehicles we’ll be covering, is to take on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-coins-question-marks-outfits-1851784658&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-coins-question-marks-outfits-1851784658">P-Switch Challenges</a></span>.

Pushing the stick up will plunge the nose of the boat into the water, while pushing the stick down will lift the nose up. Alternating between the two can help you soar above big waves.</p><h2 id="h78444"><a id=""></a>Where to find Helicopters</h2><figure id="" data-id="a1167518173ced4b663cd8d749de31f8" data-recommend-id="image://a1167518173ced4b663cd8d749de31f8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="ario drives toward a helicopter with a giant question mark inside." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="ario drives toward a helicopter with a giant question mark inside." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a1167518173ced4b663cd8d749de31f8" data-recommend-id="image://a1167518173ced4b663cd8d749de31f8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="ario drives toward a helicopter with a giant question mark inside." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Special vehicles only get rarer from here. First up is the Helicopter, which is easy to spot in the air thanks to their chunky orange design. Bear in mind that these are separate from the tiny yellow MKTV helicopters that spectate races. <strong>Helicopters fly in a preset loop, so the best way to take one over in Free Roam is to follow it until it lands for a short period.</strong></p><p>Finding them during a race is also a mixed-bag. They’re not located in similar environments the way Semi-Trucks and Speedboats are. I’ve also seen more variance in how they’re presented, such as being an integral part of the race from DK Spaceport to Peace Stadium. Conversely, you can find one hidden behind a building when racing between Mario Bros. Circuit to Toad Factory. </p><p>Controls for the Helicopter also make full use of your Joy-con’s stick, and in proper inverted orientation for flight: Moving it up will make the Helicopter descend, while moving it down makes the Helicopter climb up.</p><h2 id="h78445"><a id=""></a>Where to find UFOs</h2><figure id="" data-id="36302b5efe0b888367611900a7b710ba" data-recommend-id="image://36302b5efe0b888367611900a7b710ba" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Shy Guy drives toward a UFO and a couple of smiling cows." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shy Guy drives toward a UFO and a couple of smiling cows." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="36302b5efe0b888367611900a7b710ba" data-recommend-id="image://36302b5efe0b888367611900a7b710ba" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Shy Guy drives toward a UFO and a couple of smiling cows." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>That brings us to the last and rarest of the bunch–the UFO. I’ve yet to see this one during an actual race, although it does appear randomly in the Free Roam mode. Keep an eye on the sky and you just might see this saucer with colorful lights hovering by. <strong>UFOs typically stay in motion, but following one for long enough will make it come down to the ground and allow you to drive into its tractor beam to take it over.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>You don’t have to rely on luck to find one out in the wild. There is at least one UFO that remains idle in the Free Roam mode and resets after you’ve interacted with it. <strong>This stationary UFO can be found on a cliff overlooking the river between Dry Bones Burnout and Mario Bros. Circuit.</strong> More specifically, it’s on the cliff to the left of the great staircase that leads towards the Dry Bones Burnout area. Follow the mountainside left until you can drive up the slope and see a set of torches and a metal fence. Drive along the path to find the UFO, a couple of cows, and a Nabbit to catch.</p><p>Controls for the UFO are similar to the Helicopter, with the stick controlling both descension and ascension. One standout difference is that pressing the R button will enable the tractor beam. You can use this to pick up everything from other cars, coins, and even enemy NPCs.</p><p>Even if the open world can feel bare at times, <em>Mario Kart World</em> has a lot of fun interactables and secrets to discover. Keep exploring the environment and the tracks themselves! You never know where any large vehicles might be available.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-semi-truck-ufo-helicopter-1851786066]]></content:encoded>

But when I die, if there is a big oasis in the sky waiting for me, I’ll be happy to meet up with old family and friends. And then I’ll ask them where the room is that contains all the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-tony-hawk-games-from-worst-to-best-1844342766&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-tony-hawk-games-from-worst-to-best-1844342766">(good) <em>Tony Hawk</em> games</a></span>. If heaven is truly paradise, a place where I’ll be happy forever, I expect <em>Tony Hawk</em> games. They are some of the best video games ever made, blending snappy controls, fun level design, and awesome music into an incredible skateboarding experience that I’ve always enjoyed since I was a young boy.</p><p>And <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-demo-review-huge-combos-million-points-bam-ps5-1851784238&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-demo-review-huge-combos-million-points-bam-ps5-1851784238"><em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4</em></a></span>, the latest entry in the franchise, continues the franchise’s history of delivering pure, concentrated joy, one kickflip and combo at a time. Sure, some changes might ruffle feathers, and I ran into one too many bugs, but<em> THPS 3+4</em> overcomes its mistakes and has become one of my favorite games of 2025.</p><h2 id="h109362"><a id=""></a><strong>What is <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4?</em></strong></h2><p>If you’ve never played a <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater </em>game before, let me explain how these things work. You have a collection of levels and each has goals, like score a high number of points or collect a certain number of items. You have two minutes to complete these goals, but you can try as many times as you like. Completing enough goals unlocks new levels to skate. Do everything you can, and you unlock more goals that are harder. </p><p>And that’s basically it. It’s a shockingly simple formula, but it works because it adds<em> just enough </em>tension. Each two-minute run is a mad dash to complete a specific goal, reach a certain area, or find that last item you desperately need. Every crash or mistake in a two-minute run in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-bam-margera-how-to-unlock-easy-fast-tip-guide-1851785804&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-bam-margera-how-to-unlock-easy-fast-tip-guide-1851785804"><em>THPS 3+4</em></a></span> feels painful as you lose some time.</p><p>However, the two-minute timer, which was a key part of the first three games, wasn’t a feature in <em>THPS 4.</em> Instead, that game used a semi-open world structure, letting players complete various goals as they saw fit in bigger levels than those in past games. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-remake-remaster-thps4-original-career-mode-ps5-1851779836&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-remake-remaster-thps4-original-career-mode-ps5-1851779836">All of that is gone in the new remake</a></span>. As someone who didn’t play much <em>Pro Skater 4</em>, I don’t mind the remake taking levels from that game and remixing them into the classic two-minute format. But I also get that for some people, this is a huge change that ruins half of <em>THPS 3+4’</em>s package.</p><p><em>THPS 3+4</em> does offer the option to increase the run timer to as high as 60 minutes, which sort of recreates the laidback, open-world vibes of the original<em> THPS 4</em>, though it likely won’t be enough for people who consider the fourth entry in the skateboarding series their favorite.</p><p>It’s not just how you play the levels that has changed in the remake, as the very levels themselves have received big graphical updates, and here, the changes are almost all positive. All of the levels in<em> Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4 </em>are filled with new details, high-res textures, and improved models, making them feel more alive than in the old games. But developer Iron Galaxy (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-the-kotaku-review-1844937925&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-the-kotaku-review-1844937925">who worked on the PC port of <em>THPS 1+2</em></a></span>) was careful to make sure the classic levels still feel great to skate and aren’t too visually busy or messy. You can still clearly see ramps, rails, collectibles, and more. </p><p>This is key in a game where you are often moving very fast in the middle of some huge combo and have to make decisions with little time to think. I never experienced a moment in the remake where I was confused about a piece of the level or what was skateable.</p><h2 id="h109363"><a id=""></a><strong>Something new, please</strong></h2><p>Interestingly, Iron Galaxy has created three new levels in <em>THPS 3+4.</em> One is a large dilapidated waterpark, another a movie studio, and the other places you inside of a pinball machine played by Tony Hawk. </p><p>I was concerned that these levels might not be able to hold their own next to the classic parks. Thankfully, Iron Galaxy nailed it. The waterpark-themed area feels like something original <em>THPS </em>devs Neversoft (a studio killed by Activision) would have created back in the PS2 days. Likewise, the pinball level injects some more absurdity into the collection in a way I really appreciated and which is true to the series. I mean, the first game included an Area 51-like level with a UFO and an alien. Oh, and the pinball level includes a very nice nod to original devs Neversoft. Finally, the movie studio level feels so much like an original park that I forgot to include it in the first draft of this review. </p><p>Speaking of changes, <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4’</em>s soundtrack isn’t just the same songs from the old games. Again, like the changes made to<em> THPS 4</em>’s levels, some fans won’t like that most of the old songs are gone. But they’ve been replaced by a soundtrack filled with bangers, including new songs from artists featured in the original <em>THPS 3</em> and <em>THPS 4. </em>It makes the package feel less like a nostalgic retread and more like a new game. It’s not. It’s still very much a remake, cashing in on nostalgia. But when I was playing one of the new parks, listening to new music, and playing as one of the many new skaters included in the game alongside old <em>THPS</em> vets, I found myself enjoying something I didn’t expect to have in 2025: A new <em>Tony Hawk</em> game. A good one, too. What a wonderful treat buried in this fantastic remake.</p><p>For fans who like to get creative, <em>THPS 3+4 </em>features a very powerful skatepark creator that lets you build basically any kind of level you want. And you can share them across all platforms, too. People are already recreating levels from other <em>Tony Hawk</em> games, and I’ve spotted at least one Mario-inspired track, too. If enough talented creators pick up <em>THPS 3+4</em>, I might have an endless number of new levels to skate, complete with custom goals and collectibles. The remake also supports online play. So you and a few friends can free skate together on a user-created remake of<em> Doom</em>’s E1M1. What a world we live in! There’s also a create-a-skater option, but these can’t be shared online.</p><h2 id="h109364"><a id=""></a><strong>Happiness is a skateboard</strong></h2><p>I’m realizing that I’m nearly done with this review, and I’ve not mentioned yet how skating feels in <em>THPS 3+4</em>. That’s because it’s just so perfect that I don’t have much to add beyond that. It takes what was created for <em>THPS 1+2 </em>and builds on it ever so slightly, but without breaking anything. Skating around a level, even in free skate mode with no goals or timers, is a joyful experience. It just feels so damn good. I always felt in control as I skated, and tricks felt snappy and responsive. Popping a random kickflip on my way to a goal never failed to make me feel a jolt of endorphins firing off in my brain. I have no notes to share about skating in <em>THPS 3+4.</em> It’s very good. It makes me happy. I love it.</p><p>What I don’t love are some of the bugs I encountered while playing <em>THPS 3+4</em>. None of them were game-breaking, but sometimes I’d have my screen go black or the camera get stuck in a weird spot. A quick level reset usually fixed these problems, but some screen tearing on Xbox continued to happen when booting up a level. Performance remained solid, but it was a small annoyance I spotted over and over. Hopefully, a future patch can fix some of these bugs and the tearing issue.</p><p>Even if the issues are never patched,<em> THPS 3+4 </em>is still a fantastic game. If you’ve enjoyed playing <em>Tony Hawk</em> games in the past, then you should check this thing out ASAP. While the changes to <em>THPS 4</em>’s levels might disappoint some, the new music and levels are rad, and the skating feels as perfect as ever. If that gaming room in heaven exists, it better have a copy of <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4.</em></p><p><em> .</em><br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-tony-hawk-pro-skater-review-is-it-good-levels-1851786124]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Whose turn is it?</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> has been one of the breakout hits of 2025. It's also a classically styled turn-based role-playing game, taking cues from many popular series, including Final Fantasy. These two factors have both led to many questions about whether Final Fantasy might return to its own roots, and now the question's been posed to one of Final Fantasy's front-facing leads.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Naoki Yoshida, the director/producer of Final Fantasy 14 and producer of Final Fantasy 16, was asked in an <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2025-07-08/final-fantasy-xvi-producer-on-the-series-future/.226405" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with AnimeNewsNetwork</a> whether mainline Final Fantasy games could go back to being turn-based, in the wake of Clair Obscur's success.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"With this question of turn-based versus action, it tends to isolate the gameplay to just the battle system," said Yoshida. "That doesn't take into account what kind of game the creators want to deliver to players. For example, based on a certain graphical quality we want to present to our players, or the narrative we want to deliver to our players, it relates to how we set up the game's systems around it. This includes the battle system, game design, and gameplay feel. It's not a clear-cut answer, whether it will become all turn-based, or if it's going to become more action-based.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"[I'm] not necessarily going to be on Final Fantasy 17, so we also don't want to obstruct or limit our future director or whomever will be producing the games like 17 or even 18," Yoshida continued. "We don't want to put them on a rail."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The answer, essentially, is still up in the air. Final Fantasy changes with each entry, after all; aside from creating new stories and casts for each mainline numbered entry, each game can range from highly iterative to full-on evolutions or change-ups.

                <p dir="ltr">Aaron Keller hears you all and agrees: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/">Overwatch 2</a> could definitely use more story content right about now, stating that for it to be "firing on all cylinders" it needs to once again make story content a pillar of the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Keller, who serves as Overwatch 2's director, was recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20r5IX0UEnM&amp;ab_channel=Jay3">interviewed by content creator Jay3</a> about many aspects of the live game, including the status of a map editor/creator, a looking-for-group function, and the process of creating just one of the game's many heroes. The latter question eventually led to discussion about the state of narrative content in Overwatch 2 and Keller was refreshingly frank about the matter.</p><p dir="ltr">When probed about a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-boss-says-more-tv-shows-and-movies-are-possible/1100-6530062/">potential TV series</a>, Keller responded by saying that the team "would love to do that" before springboarding off of the question to address narrative-starved fans. Keller continued, saying that the team sees a lot of sentiment online that "Overwatch has dropped the ball when it comes to story and lore."</p><p dir="ltr">Despite the fact that the Overwatch games have always been multiplayer-first, Blizzard has always employed a story team that fleshed out the game's constantly expanding cast. These storytelling efforts encompass many aspects of the game, like sprays, emotes, voice lines, interactions with certain other characters, in-game bios, events, and skins. Outside of the game, it has manifested as comics, novels, and vibrant animated shorts and cinematics, the latter of which Jay3 points out that he misses at one point in the interview.</p><p dir="ltr">Keller seems to as well, claiming, "For me personally, for us to say Overwatch 2 is firing on all cylinders, we need to have some of that come back," all the while expressing that he and the team know that they used to to put out more animated shorts in the past and want to again. Accordingly, he claims that the team had large ambitions of pursuing story content in Overwatch 2, but then, as is often the case in game development, things went sideways. </p><p dir="ltr">Keller admitted, "To speak frankly about it, we did have a big plan to go after story in the game. That was the PvE side of it, with the campaign and everything like that. And it didn't work out." When Overwatch 2 was first announced, a major new feature of the then-upcoming sequel was the implementation of a PvE mode complete with a story that would weave together a cohesive campaign featuring a number of the Overwatch cast.</p><p dir="ltr">However, the heavily anticipated PvE mode was detached from Overwatch 2 prior to its launch in 2023, and was eventually scrapped, which prompted "a kind of reset moment" for the game's team. Aspects of it were later salvaged for later updates, like a content pack of PvE missions that was sold to players post-launch. One of Overwatch 2's newest additions,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/overwatch-2-stadium-heroes-and-abilities-list/2900-6490/"> the Stadium mode</a>, also adapts the canned PvE mode's skill-progression system into a PvP format that has proven to be a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-stadium-mode-is-excellent-but-makes-an-awful-first-impression/1100-6531214/">success</a> with fans of the game.</p><p dir="ltr">But for fans of Overwatch's larger narrative and cast, these additions, as well as constant balance changes and mechanical pivots, have come at the cost of little-to-no in-game story content, let alone cinematics. Keller and the Overwatch team seem to get that though, and want to get back to it, sharing, "It's just there's been a bit of kind of like a step backwards that we had to take in order for us to be able to start moving forward on it again."</p><p dir="ltr">With the game seemingly in a healthier place these days, Keller's comments could be a positive sign that Overwatch's narrative will be a larger part of the game again in the near future.</p>

<p dir="ltr">It will, however, have what DICE is calling Training. Players will be able to choose between two different Training paths for each class. Training levels up over the course of a match by tackling objectives or engaging in teamplay, after which players gain more passive bonuses unique to the class. Upon reaching level-three Training, players can use an unique active class ability.</p><p dir="ltr">One example of a Training ability shared in the blog post is for the Recon class, which at level three will be able to call in a UAV that automatically spots enemies for a duration. Depending on the Training Path players select, their level-0, level-one, and level-two passive Training abilities will be different, though the level-three active ability will be the same, with only one active ability for each class. Triggering a level-three ability resets Training to level two, after which players will be able to start rebuilding charge on their level three ability.</p><p dir="ltr">Once again using the Recon class as an example, selecting the Sniper Training path grants improved spotting capabilities at level zero all the way to making it so enemies hit with sniper headshots becoming unrevivable at Training-level two. Alternatively, choosing the Pathfinder Training tree makes it so players move more quickly while crouched and prone at level zero and makes it so damaging enemies automatically spots them at level two. You can see the full Recon Training perk tree below.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4530374-battlefield6recontrainingtree.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4530374" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1456" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4530374-battlefield6recontrainingtree.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4530374"></a><figcaption>Each class will have two Training paths to choose from, culminating in an active ability.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4530374-battlefield6recontrainingtree.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Training looks to be a major new system in Battlefield 6--one that DICE states is there to incentivize players to efficiently engage in their chosen role and to promote teamplay.

<figure><a title="Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157322/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>I have to admit, I was really nervous about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4</a>. I played the first ‘<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tony_hawks_pro_skater_1_plus_2">1 + 2</a>’ collection back in 2021 and absolutely loved it, but my early teenage years were shaped by the Birdman’s third and fourth console outings. So to say that a lot was riding on Iron Galaxy’s remake would be an understatement, and early concerns regarding THPS4’s shift in structure definitely rattled me.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I can wholeheartedly say that this latest nostalgic revisit to what I would argue was the peak of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-tony-hawk-games-of-all-time">the Tony Hawk’s series</a> is a success – albeit with a few caveats.</p>
<p>So let’s start with the pink elephant in the room. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/tony_hawks_pro_skater_4">Pro Skater 4</a> has been drastically altered to fit more in line with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/tony_hawks_pro_skater_3">Pro Skater 3</a> (and THPS1 + 2, for that matter). So instead of roaming about each level at your own pace and triggering missions by speaking with the local citizens, you’re instead racing against the two-minute clock, with missions completed organically as you make your way around.</p>
<figure><a title="Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157327/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s a bitter pill to swallow for veterans hoping for a more 1:1 remake of the original, but I have to admit that it still works pretty well as is. Yes, the levels in THPS4 are much larger than those that came before, and so tasks like collecting the S-K-A-T-E letters might prove more difficult with the ticking clock. But having the entry align more closely with the third <em>does</em> make for a more cohesive experience; one I’m certain newcomers will appreciate.</p>
<p>Speaking of cohesion, despite development moving from the now-defunct Vicarious Visions to Iron Galaxy, THPS3+4 feels instantly familiar to those who played the original games and the 2021 remake of 1 + 2. It plays exactly how you’d want, with slick, responsive controls, outrageously over-the-top combos, and heaps of potential when it comes to player and board customisation.</p>
<p>You’ve got a really solid selection of skaters to choose from, including Hawk himself, Zion Wright, Chloe Covell, and more. Unlockable characters include Bam Margera and <strong>TMNT</strong>’s Michelangelo, while if you opt for the Digital Deluxe Edition, you can also play as <strong>DOOM</strong> Slayer and the Revenant, with additional bonus music tracks included.</p>

<p>Each skater has various advantages and disadvantages, but by collecting stat points hidden around each level, you can boost everything from speed to lip balance. The good news is that if you switch skaters, you can immediately apply all stat points previously collected, so there’s no need to go through the motions again and again.</p>
<p>As for the levels themselves, they’ve been absolutely wonderfully recreated. Unlike the first two entries, 3 + 4 really leans into the whole <strong>MTV</strong> / <strong>Jackass</strong> influence and includes some truly ridiculous missions that make use of the additional NPC characters located throughout each stage. So, you can ‘Bury the Bully’ in Canada, ‘Stop the Pickpockets’ in Airport, and ‘Photobomb the Tourists’ in Alcatraz. Some missions have been altered somewhat, so don’t expect to see Ollie the Bum hallucinating pink elephants. They’re still around, but the context has been switched up a bit.</p>

<p>In addition to the familiar favourites, Iron Galaxy has also seen fit to create a few new tracks of its own, and I’ll be honest, they’re <em>awesome</em>. Waterpark in particular is a true highlight, with the myriad waterslides and empty pools making for a proper skateboarding playground begging to be combo’d into oblivion. It gives me hope that Activision could soon green-light a brand new Tony Hawk’s game, but I’m not going to hold my breath.</p>
<p>One thing I do want to call out, however, is the music. And to be clear, the soundtrack here is <em>banging</em>; really good stuff. You’ve got Iron Maiden’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qbRHY1l0vc"><strong>2 Minutes to Midnight</strong></a>, Sex Pistols <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ah1JM9mf60"><strong>Holidays in the Sun</strong></a>, Mastodon’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv_QcNplLxM"><strong>Precious Stones</strong></a>, and <em>so</em> much more. The problem, however, is that music is a powerful source of nostalgia, and the majority of the originals’ tunes have been left out, with only six tracks represented from THPS3, and four from THPS4.</p>
<p>I want to reiterate that the soundtrack is really rather good, and ultimately many newcomers will discover some life-long favourites here, just like I did back in the early 2000s. But why couldn’t Iron Galaxy appeal to both crowds? I broke into a massive stupid grin when Bodyjar’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18P614-bnS4"><strong>Not the Same</strong></a> kicked in for the first time, and I just wish that the collection included a few more nostalgic hits.</p>
<p>Moving onto multiplayer, you’ve got a few options to keep you busy once you’re done with the single-player portion. One of the highlights is the new ‘HAWK’ mode, which sees you hide H-A-W-K letters around levels before riding around to locate your opponent’s letters. It’s a cool little mode, and it’s nice to see something that’s not just 'see who can score the most points'.</p>

<p>That said, while multiplayer works well, actually finding a match can take a little while. It’s early days, in one sense, but if the game’s struggling to find matches at launch, then I dread to think what it might be like in a year or two.</p>
<p>In addition to the standard multiplayer, you’ve also got the Create-A-Park mode. Here, you can try out custom parks from a hefty selection, though it’s safe to say that some of the early designs leave a bit to be desired. Heck, I can’t talk, I wouldn’t be able to do much better, but I’m definitely looking forward to seeing a few creations that don’t just rely on silly gimmicks.</p>
<p>The actual creation tool is pretty fun and intuitive, with assets selected with the D-pad and placed on the ground with the analogue sticks. You can rotate pieces, zoom in, pan the camera around – all sorts. It’s a neat little tool if you’ve got a flair for park creation, but ultimately I can’t see myself using it that much.</p>

<p>Finally, looking at how the game runs on Switch 2, I’m mostly very impressed. In handheld mode, there can be a little bit of aliasing, but by and large the game is remarkably on par with the likes of the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, hitting what feels like a solid 60fps with some gorgeous reflection technology on display with puddles.</p>
<p>The lighting looks great in levels like Tokyo and Foundry, and pop-in is thankfully kept at a minimum. Some of the NPC characters can look a little goofy at times, sure, but if anything, this felt like a callback to the original games. That’s my excuse at least – deal with it.</p>
<p>Finally, you can view some of the scenery with the game's photo mode, which works really well and adds in a number of cool little filters and effects for good measure.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 is another welcome return to the franchise's glory days, presenting the third and fourth entries with revamped visuals across the board while retaining the same slick gameplay. Some folks might be unable to get over the structural changes to Pro Skater 4, and I have to admit to being a little disappointed at the lack of classic music tracks, but overall, the positives absolutely outweigh the negatives.</p>
<p>If you're looking to inject a hefty dose of nostalgia into your life, or you simply want to see what the Tony Hawk series was like at its absolute peak, then this should prove a fine addition to your Switch 2 library.</p></section>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/datamine-leak-points-to-ea-hosting-a-battlefield-6-open-beta.1241769/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Spotted by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-spotted-in-new-datamine/">Insider-Gaming</a>, a datamined leak points to EA hosting an open beta for its next entry in the Battlefield series, which we only know as Battlefield 6 for now, since its official title has yet to be revealed. </p>



<p>While datamining Battlefield Labs, the program through which EA is testing new features for the next Battlefield game and consistently playtesting the new entry, the datamining group 1BF Telegram Group found "<em>Battlefield 6 Open Beta</em>" added in the most recent update, though no further details came with the phrase. </p>



<p>It's not the biggest shock that EA would plan an open beta for its next major shooter, since that's the common pattern for how multiplayer-focused games are launched. The beta not only gives the developers a chance to stress-test the servers, it gives players a chance to get a feel for the game ahead of its proper launch. </p>



<p>We've seen a number of leaks for Battlefield 6, including videos of the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-gets-new-alpha-leak-video-of-rush-mode/">Rush Mode</a>, and footage of its <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-campaign-footage-has-leaked-online-from-the-latest-battlefield-labs-update/">campaign</a>, and EA has even <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-showcases-destruction-next-battlefield-game-and-it-looks-like-old-school-destructible-environments-back/">officially shared clips</a> from the Battlefield Labs playtests to show how development is progressing. </p>



<p>A full, proper reveal for the game is all we're missing at this point, which, according to EA, is <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-battlefield-game-will-be-revealed-this-summer-new-battlefield-and-skate-due-to-release-by-april-2026/">due to arrive sometime this summer</a>. It could be that alongside the full reveal, EA will announce the open beta and the dates it'll be live, but for now, we'll have to wait and see. </p>



<p>When the reveal does happen, hopefully, it goes well, as EA reportedly has extremely high expectations for this new shooter. A recent report pointed to <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-targeting-100-million-players/">EA executives setting a target of 100 million players</a>. It also claimed that the budget for this new game has hit an eye-watering $400 million, which at least partly explains why EA executives are hoping the game can reach such high player numbers. </p>

                <p>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 comes loaded with plenty of levels, including every stage from the original versions of both games as well as a few brand-new stages, like Movie Studio and Pinball. However, developer Iron Galaxy actually created several more levels--11, by our count--that you can find via the Create-A-Park mode.</p><p>Select Create-A-Park and you'll see a whole bunch of user-created courses. Thus far, they are ... well, they aren't good, to put it mildly. Most are simply advertising an easy way to earn a few of the game's hardest achievements, and offer little else. However, scroll down and you'll see a "Developer" section, where all the levels were designed by Iron Galaxy itself.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> You Win Some, Lose Some - Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 GameSpot Review</p>

<p>Now, to be clear, these stages lack the complexity--both visual and mechanical--of the "real" stages in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4, but their simplicity and emphasis on performing nearly impossible tricks helps to make them a good contrast after you've had your fill of the others. Iron Galaxy even put in collectables and other goals to make things more interesting, albeit ones that are fairly easy considering the small size of these stages.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4530352-thpsextrastage.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4530352" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4530352-thpsextrastage.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4530352"></a><figcaption>Skateboarding is totally legal in whatever dimension this is.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4530352-thpsextrastage.jpg"></figure><p>However, be careful not to select one stage in particular: Torment Nexus.

            <p>
Ghost Town - the spooky, 80s-set VR puzzle-adventure from the studio behind the acclaimed The Room series - is a genuine treat, and one that's poised to shake off its former Meta Quest exclusivity very soon. Developer Fireproof Games has announced Ghost Town's paranormal delights will be available on PC via Steam VR from next Tuesday, 15th July.
</p>
<p>
Ghost Town whisks players back to the London of 1983, where protagonist Edith Penrose - who runs a paranormal detective agency halfway up a South London council block with her tech savvy flatmate Rina - is attempting to find her missing brother, Adam. The ensuing urban fantasy adventure takes players first to a remote Scottish island and then around various immaculately realised London locales, which I won't spoil here.
</p>
<p>
It's fantastic stuff, full of clever puzzling, satisfyingly tactile environmental interactions (if you love The Room series, you'll feel right at home here), and just a brilliantly cinematic approach to its storytelling as Ghost Town leaps through time and its wonderfully orchestrated set-pieces. There's a bit in a lighthouse that might be one of my favourite gaming moments this year! It helps, too, that its small cast of characters is brought to life by some stellar performances.

<p>
Ghost Town originally launched for Meta Quest (amid plenty of critical acclaim) back in April, with Fireproof promising a PC VR and PSVR 2 release would follow at a later date. There's still no update on that PlayStation VR 2 version, but the studio has now confirmed Ghost Town is coming to Steam VR in just a few days time, on 15th July.
</p>
<p>
It's unclear if Ghost Town's PC release will bring any improvements to take advantage of the potentially beefier hardware at players' disposal, but I've asked Fireproof and will report back if I hear anything. Until then, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2496180/Ghost_Town/">wishlist Ghost Town now</a>, and a demo's available too.

                <p>A long-requested feature is finally sailing to Sea of Thieves, but players will have to shell out some cash to take advantage of it. Custom servers, along with other unannounced "benefits," are included in a subscription service coming to Rare's live-service pirate game in early 2026. Developers from Rare made the announcement during a Community Direct video on Wednesday.</p><p>Sea of Thieves is dependent on emergent encounters with both computer-controlled enemies and real players, both of whom can engage in hostilities with players. With custom servers, players can create their own "private customisable sandbox" with adjustable options for loot and enemy spawns. Private servers can also run "Safer Seas Fleets," allowing players to invite their friends, free of beligerent randos. Rare has not stated how much this subscription model will cost.</p><p>Rare was one of the many studios hit by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/" data-ref-id="2900-6726">massive layoffs at Microsoft</a>, which also resulted in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-a-decade-rares-everwild-canceled-as-part-of-xbox-layoffs-report/1100-6532912/" data-ref-id="1100-6532912">cancellation of the studio's project Everwild</a>. Gregg Mayles, a veteran of the company who served as the creative director for both Sea of Thieves and Everwild, reportedly departed Rare following the latter's cancellation.</p><p>The nearly hour-long Community Direct did not address the layoffs, the fate of Everwild, or Mayles' exit from the company. Instead, the video featured five members of the Sea of Thieves team addressing the health of their online game and detailing additions coming in the next several months.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKQiiI3ElkU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NKQiiI3ElkU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Rare also touched on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sea-of-thieves-season-17-introduces-smugglers-faction-and-new-weapons/1100-6532263/" data-ref-id="1100-6532263">already-announced Season 17</a>, which introduces a new faction called The Smugglers' League and additional loot to the game's sandbox. Seasons overall will have a more monthly structure, introducing new content and events every month rather than throwing everything new at the players upon the season's debut.</p><p>With Season 17 specifically, the first month will properly introduce The Smugglers' League, the second month brings a "heist" live event, and the third month will refresh the map's Skeleton Forts. The developers also briefly teased Season 18, which centers on the perilous Devil's Roar area of the game's world.</p><p>And in a move that might excite devoted players, Rare is lifting the NDA from the game's Insider Programme, which provides preview builds showcasing upcoming updates to Sea of Thieves. The developers describe the move as a "first step" in opening larger conversations with the game's community.</p><p>It's been rough waters for Rare, but the studio appears keen to reassure Sea of Thieves players that the game still has wind in its sails, hopefully for years to come.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/why-disability-journalism-in-games-needs-to-evolve-beyond-marketing.1241730/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It wasn’t all that long ago that accessibility was barely a concern for many video game companies. Some time in the past half decade or so, major publishers realized they could augment their marketing efforts with good old-fashioned back pattery, and now here we are. But there’s more to games than products and features. On the latest Aftermath Hours, we talk about the ways disability journalism surrounding games needs to evolve.&nbsp;</p><p>This time around, we’re joined by award-winning disability reporter <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/supercrip1994.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grant Stoner</a> to discuss Disability Pride Month, as well as his own <a href="https://www.ign.com/person/Hotwheels94" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">growing body of investigative work</a> in the accessibility space. Grant draws a line from the early days of companies largely ignoring accessibility-related concerns to the moment they realized such options could serve as a marketing hook – and then up to the present, which Grant argues would be better served by journalism that goes beyond praising PR-friendly features.&nbsp;</p><p>After that, we move on to the horse girl sensation that’s sweeping the nation: <em>Umamusume</em>. Chris, like the whole internet, is obsessed. He explains why this oddity speaks to him, and then we grapple with how the game’s newfound fandom has <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/racing/horse-girl-gacha-gamers-are-so-obsessed-with-pink-racer-haru-urara-that-the-farm-that-owns-the-real-life-horse-shes-based-on-who-never-won-a-single-race-had-to-respond/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">impacted real horses</a>. Finally, we decide that anyone who pastes into a document (or email or what have you) with formatting is a deviant who deserves to be confined to the deepest reaches of hell.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that Aftermath can buy a horse and then have an <em>Umamusume</em> horse girl named after it.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Grant: </strong>I think a lot of stories about advocates and consultants are usually through a positive lens. They tend to focus more on the work they do to benefit the company. I think the biggest example is <em>The Last Of Us II</em>. When that game came out, they really put their consultants on sort of a press junket where they were shopping them around to different outlets and showing the good work they did and everything.&nbsp;</p><p>We saw that again with <em>Forza Motorsport</em>, with their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7aVUqmQ_Sc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blind driving assists</a>. [Accessibility consultant] Brandon Cole, who sadly is no longer with us, and Phil Spencer and the Turn 10 team went everywhere, to every publication to talk about the work that they did and the work that [Cole] did.&nbsp;</p><p>But we rarely see what those advocates and consultants go through on a daily basis to be able to do their jobs. I think if we could humanize that, it’ll help maybe not developers and publishers, but it’ll help the community better understand what it actually takes to perform these jobs. As for what I want the industry to start doing: shift away from [only covering] studios that develop these games and create these features, because you can read those pieces everywhere. I think we should instead focus more on disabled people in the industry – whether that’s workers, players, or developers – and how they interact in this space.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>Also, a developer is not permanently good. That’s not a condition of the developer; that’s a condition of the people who’ve worked there. [A studio] could just get shitty. It’s a very real and meaningful impact that can happen.</p><p><strong>Grant:</strong> That’s what spawned <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-employees-community-members-allege-ablegamers-founder-fostered-abuse-behind-closed-doors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my AbleGamers piece</a>. The work they did there was good, but then over time it allegedly became a toxic environment that made it so that you couldn’t really highlight the good work anymore without acknowledging the harm that they were doing.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> My guess is that a lot of stories like that go unreported, especially in vulnerable communities. I think you often find a lot of abuse in vulnerable communities. Do you feel, Grant, like disabled communities are uniquely vulnerable to this type of abuse?</p><p><strong>Grant:</strong> The disability community, in my experience, we treat each other like a monolith or a family unit. And when that family unit is disrupted in any way, the disability community often struggles to accept that. Because for years, we’ve been cast aside. We’ve been not given the same space as other people. We’ve always had to fight harder than most to belong, especially in the gaming industry. So whenever stories like this highlight that there are some messed up things going on, oftentimes the community itself struggles to accept it, because we’ve conditioned ourselves to believe that we’re all one big happy family.&nbsp;</p><p>I also tend to blame marketing departments for big companies that make us feel that way. Like Xbox’s tagline “When everybody plays, we all win,” I argue that has done more harm to the greater movement because it makes us act like we’re all friends – which then allows these bad actors to come in and make victims out of the particularly vulnerable. So I think there’s different layers to why disabled people feel the way they do about these stories, but mostly it’s the fact that we struggle to have individualistic agency. We’re mostly led to believe that we’re all one big happy family and that no one would do this to us because we’re all one big happy family.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/plushie-lawsuit-emotional-support-chicken-nuggets-what-do-you-meme"><h3>Plushie Maker Suing Over ‘Emotional Support Chicken Nuggets’</h3></a><p>It’s a pretty standard copyright and trademark infringement case, despite being about stuffed chicken nuggets.</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-disability-pride-last-of-us-forza]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rimworld">RimWorld</a> is boldly going where no acclaimed sci-fi colony sim with a weird cannibalism obsession has gone before: up a bit. RimWorld is leaving the ground behind and heading into space for the first time in its new paid Odyssey expansion, which launches today on PC.
</p>
<p>
Core to Odyssey's heft of new <em>stuff</em> is the ability to built a gravship; essentially a mobile colony players can slowly expand to include the likes of living quarters, labs, workshops, and pretty much anything else they might need. Things start small, though, and initially you'll be using your gravship to explore the planet, landing anywhere you can reach in search of food, fuel, treasure, special weapons, even souvenirs such as exotic birds.
</p>
<p>
And to add some variety to your jaunts, Odyssey introduces new biomes, including the fungal glowforest, gaseous scarlands (home to mechanoids and toxic rain), the bountiful grasslands, the blizzard-ravaged glacier plains, even the molten lava fields - all making use of a new landmarks system said to 'transform' world generation with the likes of cliffs, chasms, fjords, islands, and more. And to spice things up even further, Odyssey introduces 40 new animals to tame, train, trade, or even eat, including sparrows and bluebirds, wolves and scimitar cats, seals and otters, even porcupines and prairie dogs. Oh, and there's fishing now too.

<p>
As you explore, you'll encounter trap-rigged reactors, insect-infested caves, and downed orbital platforms - all potentially home to gravcores you can use to grow your ship and travel further still. And, yes, it'll eventually be possible to leave the planet's atmosphere to start a new chapter in orbit: mining for ore on asteroids, or exploring orbital platforms and hollowed-out satellites (just watch out for scavengers). And tying this together are new multi-part quests players can pick up from ancient maps, passing visitors, and anonymous signals.

"Space is a harsh place," warns developer Ludeon Studios in its Odyssey announcement, "so build your ship to survive. Airtight walls protect your colonists and their pets from the vacuum of space. Heaters keep the interiors warm, while oxygen pumps provide life support. Build airlocks with vac barriers to prevent depressurisation of the ship, and equip spacefaring colonists with vac suits before they exit into the void."
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, there's new gear and weapons - think AI-assisted rifles and sawn-off shotguns - plus new enemies, including hunter drones, wasp drones, ancient sentries, and the cyclops mechanoid. That's all leading up to a new late-game threat in the form of the hateful mechhive. "When you reach the inhuman mind behind this terror, you face a choice," Ludeon teases. "Will you destroy it and shut down every mechanoid for good - or take control of its power?"

Odyssey - RimWorld's fifth expansion since its  release all the way back in 2013 - is available through <a href="https://rimworldgame.com/odyssey/">Ludeon's website</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3022790/RimWorld__Odyssey/">Steam</a> right now, costing £19.99/$24.99 USD. And if you've yet to pick up the base game, it's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/294100/RimWorld/">currently discounted by 20 percent</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been nearly a year and a half since we <a href="https://wccftech.com/judas-is-finally-unveiled-by-bioshock-creator-ken-levine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heard from BioShock creator Ken Levine</a>. As you're probably aware, ever since disbanding Irrational Games, he has founded a smaller studio called Ghost Story Games. For the last eight years or so, they have worked on a game that we now know to be titled <a href="https://wccftech.com/judas-announcement-trailer-bioshock-creator-ken-levine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Judas</a>, a game that is based on <a href="https://wccftech.com/ken-levines-new-game-is-small-scale-open-world-sci-fiai-themed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Levine's concept of 'narrative LEGOs'</a> to be endlessly replayable, at least in theory.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, the BioShock creator <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njzERtlBcB0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was featured in a video interview with Lawrence Sonntag from Nightdive Studios</a>. In the hour-long conversation, Levine promised that Judas would be an old-school single player games and expressed gratitude to parent company Take-Two Interactive that they weren't forced to add any live service elements with additional monetization like microtransactions.</p>



<p><em>I grew up playing single player games, and I grew up before certain types of monetization existed. And again, I'm not here at all to say this is bad or this is good, right? That's not really my thing. I know the kind of games I like to make. Judas is a very old-school game. Like, you buy the game and get the whole thing. There's no live service, because everything that we do is in service of telling the story and transporting the player somewhere. This is no diss on any developers who've done that, because look, games are expensive to make, and we're very fortunate that we work at a company where they believe at least in us enough where they will say okay, you're going to work on this thing for a long time, and it's going to cost a reasonable amount of money, and we're not going to push any of that stuff on you.<br></em></p>



<p><em>But I understand why it happens, right? And I don't blame anybody for trying to make a living, but I like making the games I want to play, and the kind of games I want to play are I just want to have an experience with a game and have that game be just that. All it wants to do is entertain me, right? It's got no other ulterior motives and Judas and our games have not had ulterior motives. And I'm lucky that we've been able to do that. It's a difficult time in the industry, as you know, and not everybody is as lucky as we are that we get to make a game that can really just pursue the player's joy. I think unwisely the industry has decided that you need all these elements, but if you look at the games that have really landed in the past couple of years, they are the games providing this, whether it's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/baldurs-gate-3-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</a>, or <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, or even <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyberpunk 2077</a> or The Witcher III: Wild Hunt. These are really traditional single player games and they don't have that kind of monetization in them, and I think the audience has rewarded those games, especially in the AAA space, because it gets so expensive that people want other methods of monetization. I'm just grateful that we're allowed to not have to do that because that just frees us to purely design the game for the player's experience.</em></p>



<p>Understandably, the Ken Levine creator does not really reveal any significant new details about his next game, Judas, which remains without a release window. That said, for all we know, it could change either at Gamescom or at The Game Awards. Here's hoping anyway, as the actual new BioShock installment <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-bioshock-was-rebooted-again-last-summer-says-leaker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still seems far from launching</a>.</p>

Not the kind that swoop and screech and dive around your car in New Games Journalism articles that lean a bit too obviously on Hunter S. Thompson - bless our hearts, we've all done it - but the kind who labour at the forge and rejoice when their colleagues crumble and may even drive other workers out in order to make themselves feel better.</p>
<p>On the whole, I think I prefer the Fear and Loathing variety. Anyway, here's the trailer for Against the Storm's second DLC expansion, Nightwatchers, which will release on PC via Steam, GOG, Epic Games Store and the Microsoft Store on July 31st.</p><!--more-->

<p>"The Bats despise weakness and tend to thrive where others fail, making them unique but volatile companions on an expedition into the wilderness," says a press release of the new DLC faction. "Their Manorial Court ability is used to expel a member of another species, leveraging this harsh punishment to motivate the rest of the workforce. They also gain resolve when other species leave the settlement." </p>
<p>While the bats may not make for great neighbours, publishers Hooded Horse and developers Eremite Games claim they'll stand you in good stead when exploring the DLC's two new biomes. The Rocky Ravine is a treeless waste where you'll find a lot of metal and stone, plus "merciless merchants who won't think twice about exploiting you for their gain". There's a new Black Market to exploit here, defined by "highly volatile prices and goods availability, all hidden from the watchful eyes of the Scorched Queen."</p>
<p>The second biome is Bamboo Flats, a place of heavy precipitation in at least two senses. "Though the constant rain has left these regions devoid of any fertile soil, the giant Fluffbeak is able to produce copious amounts of fertilizer to enrich the soil and help establish a flourishing settlement, provided it's well taken care of," the developers explain. "Manage its hunger, thirst, and warmth to reap rewards." OK, this sounds like the more interesting part of the DLC, actually: keep Rodan happy so that it'll shit on you regularly enough to hold starvation at bay.</p>
<p>The DLC will also include new orders, world events, rewards, and music. It will accompany the game's 1.8 update, which introduces a new Smouldering City upgrade, a legendary cornerstone and various other bits and pieces, none of them as instantly compelling as the prospect of founding a colony on birdpoop. I wonder if the bats feel happier when they're being crapped on - it seems like the kind of rough living they'd enjoy.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/top-city-builder-against-the-storm-gets-a-grumpy-bat-faction-and-giant-pooping-birds-in-its-next-dlc-this-july]]></content:encoded>

The repair experts—who champion repairability, sustainability, and quality—didn’t mince words about Nintendo’s new and expensive controller. </p><p>For example, it’s “absurdly” difficult to replace the controller’s built-in battery, which will eventually fail—like all batteries—and will need to be replaced. To do so, you have to do all of this: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Remove the top plastic face plate held down by tons of adhesive to reach seven screws. Then remove finicky plastic wedge sections. Then, using more force than expected, yank off the two thumbsticks. Next, remove more screws. Then remove another plastic covering. After that, remove the bumpers. Then take out more screws and disconnect the rumble packs. Finally, remove a few more hidden screws, and now you can remove the internal guts of the controller and reach the battery pack.</p></blockquote><p>Yeah, that’s a lot of work to simply replace a permanently dead battery. And to reassemble the controller, you have to source your own adhesive to reinstall the front plate properly, or it will rattle while gaming. </p><p>And it gets <em>worse</em>. To remove the joysticks completely is a “pain in the ass” and requires more digging into the controller’s guts. And what iFixit found in there is alarming: some very low-profile joysticks that are prone to drifting. What’s more, the sticks appear to be using the same components found in the cheaper Joy Cons. The only good thing iFixit had to say about the controller was how easy it is to replace the headset jack. </p><p>The company suggests gamers <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-best-controllers-wireless-wired-pro-1851784358&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-best-controllers-wireless-wired-pro-1851784358">buy third-party controllers</a></span> that contain easier-to-access batteries and better thumbsticks, like the Elves 2 Pro from Gulikit. “A cash grab riding high on the Nintendo brand” is how iFixit summed up the Pro Controller 2. And yeah, seems like it. While the controller feels great in your hands and has some nifty extra buttons, it seems it’s far from being “Pro” grade hardware. </p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-pro-controller-piss-poor-stick-drift-ifixit-1851786109]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The first <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> had a black-and-white option called Kurosawa Mode. The tribute to the legendary film director was meant to add a vintage aesthetic and heightened gravity to the samurai adventure’s panoramic vistas and cinematic showdowns, to varying levels of success. To be honest, I don’t think it worked that well.

The lo-fi beats mode was arranged by <em>Cowboy Bebop </em>and <em>Samurai Champloo </em>director Shinichirō Watanabe. Based on the brief preview, it sounds not unlike what you might get by streaming a lo-fi beats playlist on the PS5 Spotify app in the background while playing the game. This one just happens to be incorporated directly into it, and with Watanabe’s input, it will hopefully include some unique tracks that complement the open-world exploration and fighting taking place on screen. </p><p>It’s another gimmick, sure, but unlike the Kurosawa mode, it’s not being used as a visual shorthand to impart unearned meanings and depth to the game’s world, characters, and story. Instead, it’s a nod to the way people actually play big open-world games full of backtracking and side content. For every dramatic scene, emotional relationship, or thematically rich detail, there are hours, sometimes dozens, spent doing fun, weird, and extremely repetitive gamer shit. While immersive environments and organic exploration are part of the appeal of the open-world genre, so too is the <em>PowerWash Simulator</em>-like serenity and satisfaction of methodically cleaning up every enemy camp and collectible icon on the map. </p><p>Lots of people already listen to other stuff while doing this busywork. Sometimes it’s turning the game’s soundtrack off and putting on other music. Sometimes it’s catching up on five-hour-long podcasts. Some people even watch other shows and movies entirely during these activities. Sony designed an entire $200 accessory exactly for this purpose called the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/playstation-portal-the-kotaku-review-1851015770&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-portal-the-kotaku-review-1851015770">PlayStation Portal</a></span>. It sold unexpectedly well. The lo-fi beats mode doesn’t just accept this, it embraces it by trying to add<em> Ghost of Yotei</em>’s own bespoke take on the practice. </p><p>This is basically how radio stations function in the <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> series. Zipping around Rockstar’s cities would be completely different without the deep catalog of licensed tunes players can flip through while getting to the next mission marker or dodging the cops. More games deserve them, whether they make fictional sense or not. Who knows if <em>Yotei</em>’s lo-fi beats mode will be as good. Fans are hoping for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wK27xW4OFI&amp;list=RD2wK27xW4OFI&amp;start_radio=1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wK27xW4OFI&amp;list=RD2wK27xW4OFI&amp;start_radio=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">at least one Nujabes track</a></span>, among others. But it’s a worthwhile acknowledgement of the way people actually engage with games.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ghost-yotei-tsushima-2-cowboy-bebop-lofi-1851786114]]></content:encoded>

I watch a lot of music reaction videos, and as such, the algorithm tends to feed me professional musicians reacting to new songs by my favorite bands.

It’s not often I get to put on that old hat for this job, but watching professional musicians react in real time to some of the bonkers compositional choices Fox makes in <em>Deltarune</em>’s soundtrack has been a marriage of two of my passions. The first time I heard “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f1RK1m7qvc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f1RK1m7qvc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Third Sanctuary,”</a></span> one of the incredible tracks from <em>Deltarune</em>’s latest chapters, was when a video of game music cover band <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GzU4BlZcS8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GzU4BlZcS8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lame Genie’s</a></span> drummer, Kyle Sawaia, blind reacting to its odd, shifting time signature, crossed my For You page.</p><p>First off, props to Sawaia for keeping up with those time signature changes on the fly. Second, Fox’s compositions didn’t need to go that hard, and yet he did it anyway. I still don’t really know the context for when this track plays, but it is not only a compositional feat; it also evokes a frantic, emotional battle between two tragically opposing forces. Is that what’s happening when you hear the song in-game? I have no idea, but hearing it out of context only made me want to boot up the game more to find out.</p><p>Lame Genie isn’t the only group of musicians in awe of “The Third Sanctuary” and the rest of <em>Deltarune</em>’s incredible soundtrack. Dozens of reactions from musicians have been sprouting up on TikTok and YouTube.</p><p>I’m the type of person who can listen to a song hundreds (if not thousands) of times on loop without getting tired of it, but eventually you do lose that initial awe you feel when you hear something for the first time. Watching others experience something is about as close as I get to feeling that again, which is why I’ve started watching more reaction videos to music and other media. In cases like <em>Deltarune</em>, musicians reacting to it drew my attention to something I hadn’t really been paying attention to. Most of my exposure to Fox’s music has been through his work on the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1v1sAYXQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1v1sAYXQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Pokémon </em>franchise</a></span>, but it’s nice to be reminded that he’s cooking when he’s working on his own stuff, too.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/deltarune-ost-soundtrack-music-third-sanctuary-reaction-1851786110]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">A better world is possible today.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/overwatch-2"><u>Overwatch 2</u></a> Game Director Aaron Keller has addressed criticisms that Blizzard Entertainment “dropped the ball” when it comes to things like story content, PvE, and animated shorts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The face of Blizzard’s popular hero shooter opened up about the team’s struggles during an interview with content creator<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20r5IX0UEnM" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <u>Jay3</u></a> and Overwatch 2 voice actor Conor McLeod. Although the multiplayer title is largely known for its team-based gameplay, Keller recognizes that some story content will need to "come back" for Overwatch 2 to be "firing on all cylinders."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“One of the things that we hear our players talk about a lot, you see online… it feels like Overwatch has dropped the ball when it comes to story and lore,” Keller said in response to a question from McLeod. “You kinda see that. We used to put a few more of the big animated shorts out than we do nowadays.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/gLo6fdyWhQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/gLo6fdyWhQ</a></p>— Laurence @ Drawing💙 (@volskayadottxt) <a href="https://twitter.com/volskayadottxt/status/1943491882979312119?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 11, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Overwatch animated shorts are a sore spot for fans. Blizzard originally built excitement with a series of high-quality cinematics from 2016 to 2023, with each highlighting abilities for characters like Reinhardt, Hanzo, Genji, Mei, Bastion, and more while also showing how many of its 43 playable characters fit into the larger story. What began as somewhat frequent lore drops eventually started to fizzle out around the release of Overwatch 2 in 2022. It’s been nearly two years since fans received a 3D-animated cinematic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Frustrations with the lack of animated shorts reached a boiling point when Blizzard announced it would be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-pve-hero-mode-canceled-a-difficult-choice"><u>scrapping its PvE Hero ambitions in summer 2023</u></a>. With a long-promised story-driven mode canceled and animated short releases crawling to a halt, Blizzard had to start from scratch. Although it’s been years without a significant update, Keller says the Overwatch 2 team hasn’t completely left story behind.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“To speak frankly about it, we did have a big plan to go after story in the game. That was the PvE side of it with the campaign and everything like that,” he added. “That didn’t work out. So, it was kind of a bit of a reset moment for us when that happened, and we would like to get back to it. I think one of the best parts of Overwatch is the universe and the characters that are there. That’s definitely a goal of ours to get back to it. There’s been a bit of a step backwards that we had to take in order for us to be able to start moving forward on it again.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I think for us to say that Overwatch 2 is firing on all cylinders, we need to have some of that come back.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard announced a gameplay facelift for Overwatch 2 in February of this year. During its breakdown, the studio announced a major new PvP game mode called Stadium as well as the return of free loot box cosmetic rewards, two new Heroes, and a gameplan for the next year of content. Many of these additions, including a fundamental gameplay change called Perks, have launched since, signaling that Blizzard has found its footing as it makes good on significant promises.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of these changes have been accepted with open arms by the Overwatch 2 community, but as new players flock to see why fans are suddenly talking about the 2016 hero shooter again, the desire for story content still echoes across Reddit threads and X/Twitter posts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One idea many fans – including McLeod – would love to see is an Overwatch TV series. Keller says he’s not opposed to the idea, going as far as to say “we’d love to do that.” It’s unclear how, when, or if Keller and the Overwatch 2 team will be able to enter another golden age. One thing is clear: Keller knows Overwatch fans want more story content.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think for us to say that Overwatch 2 is firing on all cylinders, we need to have some of that come back,” Keller said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Overwatch 2 is currently in the midst of Season 17: Powered Up, which features a selection of retro-gaming-inspired skins, Mythic cosmetics for Reaper and D.Va, new Stadium Heroes, and crossover content with G.I. Joe.

                <p>IO has acknowledged the performance issues on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hitman-world-of-assassination/">Hitman: World of Assassination - Signature Edition</a> that have mired its release as a Nintendo Switch 2 launch title.</p><p dir="ltr">As one of a few third-party releases that was supposed to showcase the new console's ability to run graphically intensive current-gen titles, the port has been criticized for its many technical issues. In our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition-disappoints-on-switch-2/1100-6532229/">impressions</a>, we noted that its uncapped frame rate resulted in "uneven" performance that "fluctuates wildly," surprisingly mitigated in handheld mode due to the display supporting built-in Variable Refresh Rate (VRR).</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfKQgglhaBU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FfKQgglhaBU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Speaking in a <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/io-addresses-hitman-switch-2-performance-issues-and-says-fixes-are-on-the-way/" rel="nofollow ">VGC</a> interview, IO's franchise director Jonathan Lacaille has addressed these issues, saying, “The team is working on some of those performance issues right now, and they are addressing it over the summer." A specific date for when exactly these fixes will go live is not yet known.</p><p dir="ltr">Lacaille also took the opportunity to assuage doubts over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/007-first-light/">007 First Light</a>, which is also being developed for Switch 2 alongside the other, more powerful platforms.</p><p dir="ltr">“It’s, of course, good learning for us to bring to First Light as well--so all of this will be learnings we bring to the next title.”</p><p dir="ltr">The Hitman series has previously come to Switch 1 with a cloud version of Hitman 3, as well as a port of older title Hitman: Blood Money, but Lacaille assures that "the Switch 2 is a powerful device--powerful enough for us to bring First Light to it natively.”</p><p>The Switch 2 version of Hitman: World of Assassination isn't the only recent IO release plagued with technical issues. The company also published MindsEye from developer Build A Rocket Boy, and it's one of the worst-reviewed games of the year, with performance issues so bad that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-players-say-theyre-getting-mindseye-refunds/1100-6532383/">PS5 players were getting refunds</a> from the PlayStation Store.</p>
