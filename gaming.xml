            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="98" data-end="647">If you spend a lot of time gaming on a PlayStation 5, now might be one of the best moments all year to give your console a serious storage upgrade. Seagate has quietly rolled out discounts on one of its officially licensed PS5 expansion SSDs ahead of Black Friday, and the savings are pretty substantial. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5846/">Right now, the 2TB Game Drive PS5 NVMe SSD—complete with a built-in heatsink for PlayStation 5 compatibility—is going for 21% off.</a> Instead of its usual $215 price tag, it’s temporarily down to $170, which is a solid $45 cut for a drive that’s tailor-made for Sony’s latest console.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5846/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="98" data-end="647">Triple Your Games Downloaded</h2>
<p data-start="649" data-end="1250">Anyone who owns a launch PS5 is probably familiar this one drawback… the built-in storage fills up fast. Although Sony advertises an 825GB internal drive, a good chunk of that space is reserved for system software, leaving you with about 667GB for your actual games. Considering that many modern titles push well past the 100GB mark, it doesn’t take long before you’re staring at that “storage full” message yet again. Adding a Seagate Game Drive more than triples your usable space, which means far fewer hard choices about which games to delete when something new drops.</p>
<p data-start="1252" data-end="1751">Performance-wise, these SSDs keep up with the specs needed to support use with a PlayStation 5 (it is officially licensed Afterall). With read speeds reaching up to 7,300 MB/s and write speeds reaching up to 6,000 MB/s, they’re more than capable of handling the PS5’s fast load times. Games launch quickly, transitions feel smoother, and you can keep your entire library at your fingertips instead of constantly juggling downloads.</p>


<p data-start="1252" data-end="1751">The custom heatsink is there to help minimize thermal throttling so your PS5 can maintain peak performance over long play sessions. It’s also marked with the official PlayStation logo, though you’ll never see that again after installing.</p>
<p data-start="1753" data-end="2465">Seagate is also sweetening the deal with a little bonus. Every purchase includes a 14-day trial of PlayStation Plus Premium. That gives you access to a huge catalog of games you can immediately start downloading to that new drive. If you want to dive into something big, you can try titles like <em data-start="2048" data-end="2064">Cyberpunk 2077</em> or <em data-start="2068" data-end="2090">Monster Hunter Wilds</em> without spending an extra dime. And if you prefer something a bit more offbeat, consider checking out <em data-start="2193" data-end="2218">Another Crab’s Treasure</em>. It’s a quirky indie take on the souls-like formula, blending colorful, retro-inspired visuals with surprisingly challenging combat. For anyone who hasn’t dipped into <em data-start="2388" data-end="2400">Dark Souls</em>-style games yet, it’s a wonderfully approachable starting point.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-quietly-dumps-ipad-air-on-amazon-only-selling-for-pocket-change-where-early-buyers-wont-look-2000646655</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-quietly-dumps-ipad-air-on-amazon-only-selling-for-pocket-change-where-early-buyers-won%E2%80%99t-look.1362115/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple never does Black Friday sales on its site or in its retail stores, instead quietly passing discounts through Amazon. For example, the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3760/">iPad Air 11-inch with M3 chip, 128GB storage and WiFi connectivity just hit an all-time low of $449 from the usual $599 price tag</a>.</p>
<p>This model fits perfectly between the base iPad and the Pro lineup and<strong> gives you pro-level performance with the M3 chip without paying for the OLED display and extra features</strong> most people never use. You get Apple Intelligence baked in, a gorgeous Liquid Retina screen, and compatibility with the Apple Pencil Pro. This Black Friday deal makes the iPad Air the obvious choice if you need more power than the base iPad offers.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3760/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>M3 Performance Meets Everyday Portability</h2>
<p>The M3 chip provides desktop-class performance, <strong>all in an 11-inch tablet that weighs just over a pound</strong>. It’s the same processor architecture that lies at the heart of MacBook Air laptops for smooth multitasking across demanding apps and graphic-intensive games. You can edit 4K video, work with multiple layers in photo editing apps, and run complex productivity software without slowdowns. The chip also enables Apple Intelligence, which helps you write better, organize information, and get tasks done faster with AI features built directly into the operating system.<strong> All-day battery life</strong> means you can work through meetings, flights, and coffee shop sessions without hunting for an outlet.</p>



<p>This <strong>11-inch Liquid Retina display offers razor-sharp visuals</strong>&nbsp;including P3 wide color gamut and True Tone technology. Colors appear accurate whether you’re editing photos, watching movies, or reviewing design mockups. <strong>Ultralow reflectivity coating</strong> keeps glare down in very bright locations like outdoor patios or offices with big windows. It <strong>refreshes the screen at 60Hz</strong> which is otherwise fast enough for just about everything one would do on an iPad despite lacking the 120Hz ProMotion smoothness of the Pros.</p>
<p>Wi-Fi 6E connects to the latest router technology for faster speeds and better performance in crowded wireless environments. The 6GHz band reduces interference from neighboring networks and translates into more stable connections during video calls and quicker file transfers. The USB-C port takes care of charging, data transfer, and connections to external displays or storage drives.</p>



<p>The 12MP front camera features Center Stage technology and allows the camera to automatically pan and zoom during video calls, keeping you properly centered as you move about. That shines during presentations or family calls when you need to move naturally. The rear 12MP camera takes sharp photos and 4K video, making it surprisingly capable for document scanning and quick content creation.</p>
<p>The iPad Air slots between the $349 base iPad with its older A14 chip and the $999 iPad Pro with its OLED screen and M4 processor. You get the modern M3 chip and Apple Intelligence features the base model lacks but you skip the premium display tech and extra cameras most folks don’t need. At $449, this configuration delivers pro-level performance at a price that makes sense for anyone.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Pushes the TP-Link WiFi Extender to Peanuts as It Dumps Remaining Stock After 10K+ Sold Last Month]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-pushes-the-tp-link-wifi-extender-to-peanuts-as-it-dumps-remaining-stock-after-10k-sold-last-month-2000645602</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-pushes-the-tp-link-wifi-extender-to-peanuts-as-it-dumps-remaining-stock-after-10k-sold-last-month.1362109/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Pictures taking minutes to download? Social media feed doesn’t refresh as much as it should? Struggling to send messages? That’s not just frustrating, but can also affect your productivity when you’re trying to work or study at home. Heck, it even makes relaxing while watching some fun reels hard. If you have been facing all this and more while paying for speedy internet, the issue might not be with your internet service provider, but something at home – the router.</p>
<p>This is especially common in bigger homes, where everyone is trying to enjoy a fast, stable connection (as they should). The solution is simple. A WiFi extender can provide the boost you’re looking for, and these devices aren’t really on the expensive side, either. Most standard options sit around or under $50, but we just found a way to grab one for even less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5845/">Thanks to an early Black Friday sale, the TP-Link AC1200 WiFi extender has dropped by 37%</a>. It normally retails for $30, but after the discount, you can snap it up for just $19. But as you’d expect, the deal is selling out fast, which also shows how common the slow internet issue is. It’s best to grab it as soon as you can, since we don’t expect it to drop any further during the main event. In fact, there’s a good chance the stock will run out by then.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5845/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>No More Dead Zones</h2>
<p>One thing to note before proceeding is that WiFi extenders are made to improve/increase the WiFi coverage around your house, so they won’t have an effect on the internet speed directly. In most cases, getting stronger signals gives you the performance you’re paying for, but if there’s a speed issue on your internet provider’s end, it won’t fix that.</p>
<p>This extender offers coverage up to 1600 sq. ft., which makes it great for apartments, condos, and even homes. There are two adjustable external antennas that offer a reliable connection and fast speeds to up to 32 devices at the same time. You can connect your smartphone, laptop, tablet, computer, gaming consoles, and more, and still enjoy an impressive, strong connection on each.</p>



<p>Dual-band support gets you speeds of up to 300 Mbps on 2.4GHz and 867 Mbps on 5GHz, which means a combined 1.2 Gbps of total bandwidth. That translates into much faster browsing, lag-free streaming, better video calls, and more efficient gaming. Want an even stronger connection on one of your devices? There’s a fast Ethernet port for an improved wireless connection. This comes in handy for when you want to play a game or hop on an important video call and don’t want to leave anything to chance.</p>
<p>Access Point Mode support lets you convert a wired internet line into a WiFi hotspot, while EasyMesh compatibility lets you expand the network by connecting the extender to any EasyMesh-compatible router for a bigger setup.</p>
<p>Setting things up is quite straightforward. TP-Link’s intelligent signal indicator helps you find the ideal place to position your extender for maximum coverage. Once you have installed it into place, head over to the TP-Link Tether app on your phone and follow the on-screen instructions to get started. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes to get everything going, even if it’s your first time doing this!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5845/">It was already quite affordable at $30, but this deal lets you grab it for $19.</a> That’s practically nothing, considering the features and peace of mind it gets you. It’s better to get your orders in quickly, as the price can shoot back up anytime.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/jackery-decided-margins-dont-matter-300w-power-station-now-cheaper-than-fancy-power-banks-2000646676</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Jackery Explorer 300 has become the <strong>best-selling portable power station on Amazon this Black Friday</strong>, and here’s why. This compact unit creates backup power during winter outages, camping trips and emergencies and only <strong>weighs a mere 7.1 pounds</strong>.</p>
<p>And the good news is, Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5851/">just dropped it to an all-time low of $159 from its usual $259 price tag</a>. The 293Wh lithium-ion battery packs enough capacity to charge laptops, phones and small appliances without requiring a noisy gas generator.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5851/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Serious power in a grab-and-go package</h2>
<p>The 293Wh battery capacity gives you real runtime that you can actually plan around. You will have enough to <strong>recharge a smartphone about 24 times</strong>, power a laptop for about 4 to 5 hours, or run a small LED light for days.<strong> Two Pure Sine Wave AC outlets deliver clean 300W power</strong> that’s safe for sensitive electronics like medical devices and modern computers. Pure sine wave output matches the quality of electricity from your wall outlets to prevent the voltage spikes and fluctuations that damage equipment.</p>
<p><strong>Recharging takes just 2 hours to reach 80% capacity</strong> when you plug into a wall outlet and use the 60W PD USB-C port simultaneously. This dual-charging approach gets the battery ready fast when you need to head out quickly. You can also recharge through your car’s 12V outlet during road trips, slowly building capacity while you drive.</p>



<p><strong>Six output ports</strong> support multiple devices simultaneously with no need for adapters or splitters. Two AC outlets power standard household devices such as fans, portable heaters, or small appliances. A <strong>60W PD USB-C port</strong> quickly charges laptops, tablets, and modern smartphones and can double as an input to recharge the power station itself. A Quick Charge 3.0 USB-A port supports rapid charging in compatible phones and accessories. Additionally, <strong>a standard USB-A port</strong> supports older devices, and the DC car port powers 12V equipment such as portable coolers or tire inflators.</p>
<p>At 7.1 pounds, this power station is really portable compared to the much heavier models that require two hands to carry. You can grab it with one hand and move it around your campsite, vehicle, or home during power outages. The compact footprint fits within car trunks, under seats, or within closets without occupying any valuable space.</p>



<p>Winter power outages become less stressful when you have backup power for essential devices. You can keep your phone charged to stay connected, power a small space heater for warmth, or run medical equipment that can’t go offline. Silent operation means you can use it indoors without the noise and exhaust fumes of gas generators. An LCD screen displays remaining battery percentage, input/output wattage, and charging status at a glance, so you always know how much power you have left.</p>
<p>At $159 during Black Friday, this portable power station provides peace of mind and practical backup power for $100 less than usual. You’re getting enough capacity for emergency situations and weekend camping trips in a package that actually stays portable.</p>

Kindle and Libby for reading books, Reader for articles. Spotify for listening to music, Pocket Casts for podcasts. (I <em>hate </em>Spotify as a podcast app.) Workflowy for taking quick notes (it’s a very sparse app, which is perfect on the E Ink screen), MyMind for saving quotes, screenshots, and other snippets of stuff I come across. NYT Games because that’s what I do in bed and this thing mostly lives by my bed. Claude in case I need to look something up — I’ll do anything to avoid lots of typing on the Palma.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shokz-openfit-2-headphones-feels-practically-free-compared-to-past-prices-likely-black-friday-clear-out.1362097/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Over-ear and noise-canceling headphones are not for everyone. Sure, these block all external noise for a more immersive experience, but if you prefer a more minimal design and like to stay aware of your surroundings, in-ear headphones can be a better fit for you. Best of all, now is a great time to treat yourself to a top-rated option without shelling out big bucks.</p>
<p>Black Friday and Cyber Monday are still a week away, but you don’t have to wait till then to start saving. Almost all big retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart are offering plenty of early deals already, and we’re spotting deep discounts on some of the best earbuds out there. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5843/">Amazon, in particular, is being the most generous right now and has dropped the price of Shokz OpenFit 2 to just $125.</a> That’s after a nice 31% discount on the usual price of $180, and the deal applies to the black option. It’s open to both Prime and non-Prime members, but Prime members will enjoy free shipping with their orders, as well.</p>
<p>If you’re planning to grab yourself a pair, it’s best to do it as soon as you can, as early deals tend to disappear fast. We’re not expecting this one to last more than a couple of days.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5843/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Comfortable to Wear, Plus Powerful</h2>
<p>This pair is super lightweight and comfortable to wear. Each earbud weighs just 9.4g, and is designed using Shokz Ultra-Soft Silicon 2.0 for a natural fit. The flexible nickel-titanium ear hooks contour to your ears for a personalized fit, meaning you can wear them for hours without feeling uneasy. The secure fit also makes them great for physical activities like workouts or runs, as you won’t have to constantly worry about them slipping and falling out.</p>
<p>There are multifunction buttons on the earbuds that let you adjust volume, manage music, take calls, and more with a single tap, without reaching out for your phone. As for the performance, you will enjoy detailed, rich sound that’s made possible with the Shokz DualBoost composite drivers and OpenBass 2.0 algorithm. Expect bass to remain clear and deep even when you have pumped the volume all the way up. Songs will come to life, and podcasts will feel more engaging. In fact, calls will get better, too. The four built-in beamforming microphones are paired with smart noise canceling technology and AI algorithms to cut out the background noise as you hop on meetings or catch up with friends; great for when you’re out and about.</p>



<p>Battery life is better than any other option in this range. A full charge gives you 48 whole hours of continuous jamming with the charging case. Without it, you can enjoy 11 hours of battery in total. Running low and don’t have the time to fully juice them up? No worries. A quick 10-minute top-up gets you an additional two hours of listening.</p>
<p>Shokz OpenFit 2 earbuds also offer IP55-rated water resistance, so sweat while working out or light rain on the way back home won’t hurt. Multipoint pairing is supported as well, which means you can connect to up to two devices at the same time, and switch between them within seconds. Those who prefer having a bit more control over their music will appreciate how the Shokz app lets you tailor your listening experience with four preset EQ modes or create your own. You can also customize the physical button’s actions through the app.</p>
<p>A handy carrying case is thrown in for free with your purchase, too! Just place your order before the sale expires or the stock runs out.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/logitech-g305-gaming-mouse-goes-for-pocket-change-amazon-dumps-leftover-stock-for-black-friday-2000646646</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There’s no reason gamers need to spend big bucks on a Logitech MX Master for office productivity when all they want is pure gaming performance. The <strong>G305 Lightspeed mouse</strong> delivers everything competitive players actually need without the ergonomic bells and whistles you’d use for spreadsheets.</p>
<p>Right now <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4265/">it’s hit an all-time low at $27 on Amazon, down from its usual $49 price tag for Black Friday</a>. This wireless gaming mouse packs Logitech’s Hero 12K sensor, Lightspeed wireless technology with 1ms response time and runs for 250 hours on a single AA battery.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4265/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Wireless That Performs Like Wired</h2>
<p>Lightspeed wireless technology eliminates the lag that plagued older wireless mice. The <strong>1ms report rate matches what you’d get from a wired connection</strong> which means your cursor moves exactly when you move the mouse. You won’t notice any delay during flick shots or quick building edits in competitive games. The wireless receiver stores inside the mouse body when you’re traveling, so you won’t lose that tiny USB dongle in your bag.</p>



<p>The <strong>Hero 12K sensor tracks up to 400 IPS</strong> and offers <strong>adjustable sensitivity up to 12,000 DPI</strong>. High IPS ratings come in handy when one is making fast swipes across the mousepad in the heat of an intense firefight. It retains its accuracy even when you’re making those swift moves that would confuse cheaper optical sensors. You’ll be able to dial in your preferred DPI settings and save them to the mouse’s onboard memory.</p>
<p>The <strong>weight of 99 grams keeps the mouse agile</strong> without feeling cheap or flimsy. Lightweight mice reduce fatigue during marathon gaming sessions and allow for easier and quicker adjustments. Pro players who want to shave off even more remove the AA battery cover and install much lighter AAA batteries with foil adapters to do so. The shape works well for different grip styles from palm to claw down to fingertip, though smaller hands might find it more comfortable than larger ones.</p>



<p><strong>Six programmable buttons</strong> are enough to provide options for most games without overcomplicating the design. You can use Logitech’s G Hub software to map things like abilities, building modes, or weapon swaps to the side buttons. Your button configurations are stored in the onboard memory, so you don’t need to install software on every computer you’re using it with.</p>
<p><strong>Battery life extends to 250 hours of continuous use on a single AA battery</strong>. You can game for months before needing to swap batteries, and the mouse warns you when power runs low. Using standard AA batteries means you can grab replacements anywhere instead of hunting for proprietary charging cables. This extended battery life is possible without sacrificing tracking performance thanks to the efficient Hero sensor.</p>
<p>At $27, this mouse delivers professional-level wireless performance for less than half its normal price. You’re getting the same sensor and wireless tech that Logitech puts in its $150 flagship mice.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/forestrike</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mini-review-forestrike-switch-a-roguelite-kung-fu-fighter-that-lets-you-plan-the-perfect-takedown.1362091/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><em>Note. At the time of writing, there has been <a href="https://x.com/ForestrikeGame/status/1991117719924879871">a delay to Forestrike's planned Switch release date</a>. We didn't encounter any performance problems during our time with the game, but if you're looking for it on the eShop, it should be there "in a matter of days." We'll let you know when it does go live, but in the meantime...</em></p>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/forestrike">Forestrike</a> is yet another roguelite to add to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-nintendo-switch-roguelikes-roguelites-and-run-based-games">the Switch pile</a>, albeit one that sets itself apart by focusing on slower, meticulous gameplay. Taking on the role of martial artist Yu, you embark on a deadly quest across multiple regions, taking on a slew of enemies as you go. Rather than attack your foes with reckless abandon, however, you have an ability — ‘Foresight’ — to plan out your strategy with no major consequences.</p>
<p>Essentially, each battle presents you with two options: Foresee and Fight, mapped to ‘L’ and ‘R’ respectively. The former lets you practise the fight as many times as necessary to nail a perfect victory. Once you’ve figured out how to proceed without messing up (and likely dying), you can go ahead and fight for real. It’s an intriguing concept in theory, but it does remove some sense of danger from the experience.</p>
<p>I will say, though, Forestrike is <em>tough</em>. There are typically four or five enemies in any given fight, all possessing different strengths and weaknesses. One might charge at you immediately, while another lobs spears or other objects in your direction. Learning how to turn their attacks against them is often crucial to victory. For example, you can take up a defensive stance and cause one enemy to pass right through you, thus crashing into a hapless fool standing right behind.</p>
<p>Once fights begin, you generally have to string together a bunch of moves in one go if you’re to achieve a perfect victory, while messing up will mean opponents deal immediate damage. Executing the right combination of attacks, dodges, throws, and more results in an elegant dance that’s extremely satisfying to watch. Of course, once you commence the fight for real, you either win and proceed to the next level (while bagging some sweet dosh) or lose and go right back to the start of your run.</p>
<p>As you progress, you’ll gain new, permanent techniques via the different martial masters that accompany you on your journey. The initial master introduces the aforementioned pass-through technique, while the next grants the ability to block through brute force, causing enemies to crash into you and fall to the ground, and so on. Other minor buffs, perks, and techniques are gained in between fights, with the game presenting you three optional cards from which to choose. Very roguelike, then. Naturally, as you gain abilities, you’ll find yourself altering your strategy and gaining confidence. Eventually, you might even be able to complete fights without using Foresight at all.</p>
<p>Overall, however, while Forestrike boasts strong gameplay and a lovely, abstract pixel-art aesthetic, its core hook removes a sense of risk. This is definitely a difficult game at its heart, but the ability to practise your runs with no consequences dulls its edge a bit too much.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/forestrike]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[LEGO Clearly Isn’t Prioritizing Profit as the NASA Apollo Lunar Roving Vehicle Goes Cheaper Than Expected This Black Friday]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-clearly-isnt-prioritizing-profit-as-the-nasa-apollo-lunar-roving-vehicle-goes-cheaper-than-expected-this-black-friday-2000645530</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-clearly-isn%E2%80%99t-prioritizing-profit-as-the-nasa-apollo-lunar-roving-vehicle-goes-cheaper-than-expected-this-black-friday.1362082/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Space (or the universe as a whole) never ceases to amaze me, and I’m sure it’s the same for everyone who likes looking up at the sky and wondering about all that could be out there. Well, a couple of us (humans) have actually been to the moon, and while the rest can’t exactly visit it as of now, there’s definitely a way to celebrate one of our biggest celestial achievements by bringing the iconic rover from the Apollo 17 mission home.</p>
<p>Lego’s Technic NASA Apollo Lunar Roving Vehicle LRV building set lets you build a detailed replica of the rover, plus includes a wealth of accessories to pay the mission a tribute. On a regular day, this set would run you around $220, which isn’t exactly budget-friendly, but that changes today. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5842/">Thanks to an early Black Friday deal, you can grab it for $154, after a whopping 30% off its retail price.</a></p>
<p>The discount is available to all shoppers, whether you’re a Prime member or not. There are no long coupons to worry about, and no complicated procedures to follow. The catch? The deal is selling out fast, which means it’s likely going to wrap up soon. If you’re a space freak, now is the time to build your very own collection of NASA-themed builds. Have an enthusiast in your life who just can’t stop talking about all the cool possibilities out there? Gift it to them for holidays; it’s going to make their entire year!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5842/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Packed With Authentic Details</h2>
<p>At this point, I am convinced there is a Lego set for every cool thing that exists out there; which is a good thing. This set, in particular, isn’t really a small one. You’re getting 1,913 pieces in total, but don’t let that overwhelm you. Building it is going to be fun, and you can even invite friends over to join the project!</p>
<p>The model, once made, measures over 5.5 in. (14 cm) high, 15 in. (38 cm) long, and 10 in. (25 cm) wide, so it’s going to be display-worthy. You will be building the main rover with its seats, steering, suspension, and scientific tools, plus three detailed equipment attachments. There’s a battery pack with heating and cooling elements, a dedicated communications unit, and even tools to collect the samples. You can attach all of these to the rover, or place them nearby; whichever you prefer. Lego even includes a model interpretation of the famous rock sample in the set! The attention to detail is truly impressive, as you’re literally getting everything that played a part in the mission.</p>



<p>It’s quite detailed on its own, but you can also pair it with the Lego Creator 31152 Space Astronaut set to create a bigger, more detailed display to appreciate our heroes. Like most Lego sets, this one comes with a detailed instruction book that takes you through each step one by one. If the book feels hard to follow, you can also install the Lego Builder app. This platform offers 3D instructions where you can zoom in from every angle, track your progress, save sets, and more.</p>
<p>There’s a lot more to like about this set, especially now that you can bring it home without paying the full price. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5842/">The current Black Friday deal drops it to $154, which is quite affordable considering all that you’re getting</a>. It won’t last forever, though, which is why it’s best to act fast to grab it. Once the discount or the stock is gone, it might not even come back for Black Friday or Cyber Monday.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>One More Level, the development studio behind the Ghostrunner games, has released a brand new gameplay trailer for Valor Mortis. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/19/valor-mortis-is-a-first-person-soulslike-from-the-ghostrunner-devs/">Valor Mortis is a first person soulslike</a>, and it was annouced by the development team back in August. The new gameplay trailer, which is approximately a minute long, shows the main character William, a resurrected soldier from Napoleon’s army, using melee weapons, fire, and guns to take on all sorts of horrors.</p>
<p><iframe title="Valor Mortis | Gameplay Trailer - The Crimson Plague" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YjGtfrFmxxM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Valor Mortis will take historical figures from Napoleon’s time and see them twisted into horrors, in a world where plague has consumed Europe but whose powers you can control. As this is a soulslike you will die over and over again in Valor Mortis, but each time you could get stronger by learning new skills and abilities, as well as working out how you need to take advantage of openings to take out the most dangerous of foes. The first playtest for Valor Mortis has concluded and that saw a culmination of 515,000 player deaths and 3 million enemy kills.</p>
<p>Valor Mortis is set to be released in 2026 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon is slashing prices across Sony’s entire gaming lineup this Black Friday, from the PS5 Slim and PS5 Pro consoles to the PS Portal and every controller in between. And the good news is that the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5850/">DualSense <em>Edge</em> just hit an all-time low at $169, down from its usual $199 price tag</a>. This is the <strong>pro-level controller that separates serious players from casual gamers</strong>&nbsp;and it fixes the biggest complaint about the standard DualSense: <strong>limited customization</strong>.</p>
<p>You get mappable back buttons, swappable stick modules and deep control customization that the regular $74 DualSense (now on sale at $54) simply can’t offer.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5850/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>What Makes the Edge Different</h2>
<p>The standard DualSense works just fine for most gamers but the Edge takes things several levels further. You get <strong>two mappable back buttons</strong> that sit right under your middle fingers, ready to handle actions you’d normally stretch your thumbs to reach. These buttons let you jump, crouch, reload or activate abilities without taking your thumbs off the analog sticks. For competitive players, this means never having to break their aim during heated firefights. You can <strong>save multiple control profiles and swap between them</strong> depending on which game you are playing.</p>
<p>When drift inevitably happens, the stick modules pop out and swap in seconds. You don’t have to buy a whole new controller or go through warranty claims, just switch out that single affected module and you’re good to go. Sony <strong>includes different stick cap options</strong> in the box: standard, high dome, and low dome variations that change how the sticks feel under your thumbs. The low dome caps are preferred by many fighting game players for quick, precise inputs while FPS fans like the high dome for finer aim control.</p>



<p>The<strong> trigger customization goes even deeper</strong> than the standard DualSense’s simple trigger effect toggle: You can adjust the travel distance of the triggers along with the dead zones to perfectly suit your playstyle. For racing games, it feels more responsive with shorter trigger pulls, and for shooters, longer pulls seem better, enabling accuracy more.</p>
<p><strong>All the core DualSense features are present in the Edge model</strong>: The haptic feedback still delivers those subtle vibrations that make you feel raindrops or footsteps through the controller. Adaptive triggers dynamically resist your fingers to create tension when drawing a bow or accelerating a vehicle. A built-in speaker and microphone handle quick voice chat without needing a headset. The <strong>controller connects to your PS5 via USB-C or wirelessly</strong>, and the included braided cable charges while you play.</p>
<p>At $169, this controller is a $30 savings off the usual price for a pro-grade set of features. You’re paying nearly twice what the standard DualSense hardware costs, but the customization options and replaceable parts are so much worth the premium. For competitive players, this controller offers precision control and longevity not found in the basic model.</p>

		<p>OMYOG and tinyBuild have announced that the survival FPS filled with dinosaurs, Ferocious, will be launching on December 4th for PC via Steam. Along with the release date for Ferocious, tinyBuild has created a new trailer which shows the Dino Control Device in action. This device allows you to connect with dinosaurs to issue commands, such as attacking enemies or using them as a mount.</p>
<p><iframe title="FEROCIOUS - Release Date Trailer | Dino Control Device????" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0N0h-Lhf1XI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Ferocious, you find yourself washed up on an island that is ruled by dinosaurs, but you soon find you are not the only person there. A group of mercenaries and their mechs are also present and they are not happy with you being on the island, so you have to survive against the dinosaurs that call the island home as well as the mercenary group. Using the dino control device, you can have the dinosaurs attack the mercenaries and destroy their outposts, but not all dinosaurs will be on your side. There are survival and crafting elements in Ferocious too, so you can create items to help with dealing with the threats the island is littered with. The PC specs are as follows:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="6b0e11a69370e"><a title="SNES Classic Mini - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6b0e11a69370e/snes-classic-mini-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Hello folks, and welcome back to another edition of Box Art Brawl!</p>
<p>Last time, we looked at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/inazuma_eleven">Inazuma Eleven</a> for the DS, which resulted in a heated battle in which Europe emerged triumphant against Japan with 71% of the vote. Well done!</p>
<p>This time, to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the SNES, we thought we'd check out the box designs for the SNES Classic Mini, released in September 2017. Continuing the trend set by the NES Classic Mini, this was an adorable homage to the original SNES and came loaded with a bunch of pre-installed games, many of which can be considered all-time greats.</p><div><figure data-videoid="23DYpTkUosk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/23DYpTkUosk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt23DYpTkUosk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/23DYpTkUosk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/23DYpTkUosk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f63eszlipu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Considering the actual design of the console itself differs depending on the region, the box art designs here are wildly different, so it'll be interesting to see how this one pans out.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/snes/related-articles:71679 @ 1763907330 -->
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure data-uuid="99e86f7f1c916"><a title="SNES NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/99e86f7f1c916/snes-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10834-inazuma-eleven">Nintendo</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Okay, so the North American design is pretty busy, right? We've got an image of the console and controllers in the centre, six games listed over on the right (including the newly-released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/star_fox_2">Star Fox 2</a>), and the main logo over on the bottom.</p>
<p>We love the colour scheme here; the blacks and reds work really well, and it gives the box a slightly more 'mature' aesthetic.</p>
<h2>Europe</h2>
<figure data-uuid="4a2b9c4d78491"><a title="SNES EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4a2b9c4d78491/snes-eu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10834-inazuma-eleven">Nintendo</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Europe's approach is similar, but also... not. We've still got the black/red colour scheme, but there are no specific games listed on the front. Instead, we've got a small bit of key art from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_world">Super Mario World</a> in the bottom right. Minimal, but effective.</p>
<p>What on earth is going on with the age ratings, though? Why are they so big?! Ew, no... Not for us.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure data-uuid="54c3c84695362"><a title="SNES JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/54c3c84695362/snes-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Oooooh. Ooooooh. Okay, we're trying not to be biased, but <em>oooooooooh</em>.</p>
<p>This one is really nice. If North America and Europe's designs can be called cluttered, this is the absolute opposite. Instead, we've got a minimal approach that swaps out the black colour scheme for white, while the outlines depicting the console and controllers add a lovely bit of colour.</p>
<hr>

<p><em>Thanks for voting! W</em><em>e'll see you next time for another Box Art Brawl.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-snes-classic-mini-console]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-unveils-steam-frame-steam-machine-steam-controller-launch-early-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement of the new Steam Machine</a> from earlier this month led many to believe that Valve was making a direct play against the console market, trying to capture some of the loyal users who have followed PlayStation and Xbox platforms for generations.</p>



<p>However, there's one key aspect that might very well prevent that from happening: price. At first, speculation was that Valve would have subsidized the hardware, similar to what Sony and Microsoft have been doing with their PlayStation and Xbox consoles. This means accepting a loss on every unit sold, counting on the fact that the real profit comes with selling games and accessories. </p>



<p>Valve could have done the same thing, as they also receive a 30% cut on sales from the Steam store, and they sell accessories and other hardware that will be compatible with the Steam Machine, such as the new Steam Controller and the Steam Frame Virtual Reality headset. However, it doesn't appear that they are planning to move forward with this strategy.</p>



<p><span>We got <span>our first inkling when Valve's Hardware Engineer, Yazan Aldehayyat,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-pricing-will-be-really-competitive-with-building-a-similar-pc/" target="_blank">stated</a>&nbsp;that the product's pricing would be 'really competitive' compared to</span> building a similar PC at home.</span> That sounded like it won't be too far off from just purchasing the regular PC components yourself. Then, Linus Tech Tips <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-price-unlikely-to-hit-the-500-console-mark-but-you-shouldnt-be-surprised/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commented</a> that, after mentioning a potential $500 price point for the Steam Machine in a room with Valve employees, the 'energy wasn't great', suggesting it was unlikely to happen.</p>



<p>Now, though, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvu66Y2VLq8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTuber SkillUp</a> flat-out asked the question, and the answer from Software Engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais was a straight no:</p>



<p><em><strong>[....] But it's not going to be a sort of subsidized device, like, Valve is not going into this thinking we're going to eat a big loss on this so that we can grow market share or category or anything like that, correct?</strong></em></p>



<p><strong><em>Pierre-Loup Griffais:</em></strong> <em>No, it's more in line with what you might expect from the current PC market. Obviously, our goal is for it to be a good deal at that level of performance. And then you have features that are actually really hard to build if you are making your own gaming PC from parts. Things like the small form factor, the noise level that we achieved, or lack thereof, is really impressive and we are excited that people are going to find out how quiet this thing is. But also some integration features like HDMI CEC. The Bluetooth and wireless work that we've done, the four antennas, the very deliberate design so that you can have a great experience with four Bluetooth controllers.   </em></p>



<p>Without subsidization, and with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/samsung-rumored-memory-price-hike-could-be-a-catastrophe-for-pc-gamers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored RAM price hike from Samsung</a>, the Steam Machine might end up costing between $800 and $900. At that price point, it would be honestly a difficult sell to most console users when the PlayStation 5, which launched in 2020 and is priced at $499 (right now, <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-friday-2025-playstation-5-deals-save-on-consoles-bundles-accessories-and-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Digital Edition is actually down to $399 for the duration of the Black Friday sale</a>), is reportedly slightly more powerful.</p>

<p>"We sincerely apologize to everyone waiting"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/guilty_gear_-strive-_nintendo_switch_edition">Guilty Gear -Strive- Nintendo Switch Edition</a> arrived earlier this year in January, but fans on the hybrid platform were left behind when the new DLC and other updates never showed up.</p>
<p>Now, alongside an apology about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/guilty-gear-switch-edition-update-and-dlc-arriving-fall-2025">missing the previous window</a>, Arc System Works has confirmed the Season 4 "DLC characters" and "implementation of ranked matches" will be arriving in the Switch version of the game on <strong>18th December 2025</strong>. As a reminder, these characters include Venom, Unika and Lucy from the anime Cyberpunk: Edgerunners.</p>
<p>Here's part of the translated message about the update and DLC delay on Switch:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We had initially announced that the game would be released in the fall of 2025, but due to additional issues arising during the operational testing process, we have changed the release date. We sincerely apologize to everyone who has been eagerly awaiting the update for any inconvenience caused. The development team is making every effort to ensure a high level of perfection so as not to impair the gaming experience of our users.</p>
<p>We hope you continue to enjoy GUILTY GEAR -STRIVE- Nintendo Switch Edition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In case you need a reminder, the Switch version of Guilty Gear Strive includes 28 playable characters in the base package, including the first three seasons of the title.</p>

<p>Update: It will be available for all platforms</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="2d35179740329"><a title="Resident Evil Requiem" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2d35179740329/resident-evil-requiem.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Update [<time datetime="2025-11-23T09:00:00+00:00" data-format="D jS M Y, g:ia">Sun 23rd Nov 2025, 9am</time>]:</strong> It seems we might have got to the bottom of this mystery. According to multiple online listings, Capcom will offer "Lenticular Editions" of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> for all platforms. So, not just for the Switch 2 but also the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S versions of the game.</p>
<p>Some listings describe this as being a "case sleeve" or "card" (featuring what is basically a changing picture, depending on the angle you view it from). This same type of card has also recently been featured in official Capcom advertising materials for the 'Deluxe Edition' of the game.</p>
<p>Some online listings outside of the US also show the Switch 2 game case with cover art matching its PS5 and Xbox counterparts. So, there you go - it seems there might not be special treatment for the Switch 2 version in this department.</p>

<p>If we hear any updates or developments, we'll let you know.</p><hr><p><strong>Original Story:</strong> When the Switch 2 version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> arrives next February, Nintendo fans can look forward to a few extra goodies, such as a limited edition Pro Controller and eventually a themed amiibo.</p>
<p>As highlighted by many Nintendo enthusiasts online, it seems there could be another surprise. If you haven't already seen the title's cover art for the Switch 2 standard physical release, it's <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/resident-evil-requiem-has-a-different-boxart-on-nintendo-switch-2/">apparently looking a bit "different"</a> from the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S versions.</p>
<p>As you can see below, the cover art on display for the Nintendo release features the game's protagonist, and FBI intelligence analyst, Grace Ashcroft.</p>

<p>As Nintendo Everything highlights, although the standard release may show different cover art here for Switch 2 physical copies, it seems Capcom has shown the same design for the Deluxe Edition of the game.</p>
<figure data-uuid="365ac63fab41d"><a title="Resident Evil Requiem" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/365ac63fab41d/resident-evil-requiem.large.png"></a></figure>
<p>This cover on display here for the Switch 2 standard version has resulted in all sorts of speculation online, so if we find out anything else, we'll let you know. On Switch 2, Resident Evil Requiem is expected to offer the same gameplay experience as other platforms and will also be releasing at the same time on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>It's also been previously confirmed the physical Switch 2 version is a Game-Key Card. Capcom will be offering a special '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/resident-evil-requiem-pre-orders-live-switch-2-pro-controller-and-amiibo-confirmed"><strong>Generation Pack</strong></a>' as well containing the new game, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">Resident Evil: Village</a> (launching for Switch 2 on the same date).</p>

<p>Say goodbye to Godzilla and Hatsune Miku</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_monkey_ball_banana_rumble">Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble</a> was released on the Switch last June, and Sega followed it up with a bunch of DLC updates.</p>
<p>This included Godzilla and Hatsune Miku, who joined the roster on 26th November 2024. Now, a year later, Sega's Japanese <a href="https://x.com/SMB_JP/status/1990978490007761381?s=20">Super Monkey Ball social media account</a> has announced these same licensed characters will be delisted on <strong>26th November 2025</strong> (aka next week).</p>
<p>Here's a rough machine translation about the removal of the cheerful virtual singer and the king of the monsters:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hatsune Miku and Godzilla - playable character available until next week, November 26th (Wednesday) Everyone hurry up"</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no local update about these characters (or other characters) being delisted at the time of writing, but if you were planning on getting any of the DLC for this title, you might want to grab it while it's still available.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time this has happened, with the 2021 Switch title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_monkey_ball_banana_mania">Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania</a> also delisting DLC such as the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/persona_5_royal">Persona 5</a> character Morgana.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been four years since Nintendo brought the first batch of Nintendo 64 games to its Nintendo Switch Online service, now redubbed Nintendo 64 - Nintendo Classics. For someone who started his games media career covering N64 games, this modern take on Nintendo’s legendary Virtual Console era was a very welcome addition. I ended up playing through a few of the games over the months that followed and was surprised how well some of them aged (special shoutout to Rare’s Banjo games)!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not all sunshine, of course. The games aren’t running natively and may not feel as snappy as you remember them. Some early emulation challenges, like Ocarina of Time’s fog rendering, were addressed pretty quickly, even if some others still linger (F-Zero X is still not as we remember it). And while there are many all-time classics to be found in the emulated library, I would’ve honestly expected a bigger lineup by now with a few more first-party hits as well as some third-party gems that have firmly entered the forgotten gems realm. Which means, Nintendo Classics is a convenient and cost-effective solution to relive the N64 age, but not a perfect one. </p><p id="the-analogue-3d"><h2 data-cy="title1" data-toc-title="The Analogue 3D">Analogue 3D: Nintendo 64's Digital Offspring</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Enter the Analogue 3D, a modern – but costly – take on the Nintendo 64 hardware. See <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/analogue3d-review">Seth’s review for more</a>:</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re not familiar with the company, it’s known for making extremely capable high-end solutions to play classic games on modern screens, such as the Analogue Duo (PC Engine/TurboGrafx), the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/02/16/analogue-super-nt-review">Super NT (SNES)</a>, Mega NT ( Genesis/Mega Drive), the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/analogue-pocket-review">Analogue Pocket</a> (all Game Boy systems – with adapters for Game Gear, NGPC, Lynx, and more), and now, the $270 Analogue 3D, capable of bringing both NTSC and PAL games to 4K screens, lag-free, and with additional bells and whistles, like CRT-style display options, overclocking, and VFR. It’s not a replacement for the Switch consoles’ ability to emulate Nintendo 64 on the go, but for purists who have or are willing to build a sizable N64 cartridge collection and want the games to feel and look as good (or better) as they remember, it’s surely the best way to play them on modern screens. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/22/analogue3d-white-1763781056003.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">My Analogue 3D in white (it also comes in black for a more classic look.)</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I preordered one day one, mostly because I anticipated some major N64 games that I still own to never come to the Switch service – though I’ll concede that Nintendo has surprised me before. For starters, I did not have the Japan-only Custom Robo and Custom Robo V2 on my Switch Online bingo card. Perhaps there’s more where that came from? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">People interested in game preservation usually know their way around a classic gaming library and if you’re part of the Analogue 3D club, you likely have some N64 carts at home already. But as someone who reviewed Nintendo 64 games for a living some three decades ago, I humbly present this non-exhaustive list of personal favorites that are worth going back to and AREN’T yet – and in some cases never will be – on Nintendo’s service.   </p><p id="10-n64-must-plays"><h2 data-cy="title1" data-toc-title="10 N64 Must-Plays"><strong>10 Nintendo 64 Must-Plays</strong></h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s kick it off with 10 must-plays, in alphabetical order. I've included IGN's Top 25 N64 games at the bottom of this article -- but these picks and other picks in this column are specifically games you can't get yet play on Nintendo Switch and Switch 2. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Beetle Adventure Racing</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">I wrote a whole column about this one as well, but EA’s Battle Adventure Racing is more than just a – now – obscure entry in the Need for Speed series. It’s a genuinely good racer in which the hunt for its imaginative shortcuts is as entertaining as the actual racing action. Given that the VW Beetle car license comes with strings attached (VW isn’t making Beetles anymore and may not be motivated to rubberstamp an emulated re-release), the Analogue 3D is surely the best way to play it today! </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/22/bar-title-1697833070747-1763780192081.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption"><strong>Beetle Adventure Racing for N64 (1999)</strong></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Read my column, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/raising-the-bar">Raising the BAR</a>, for more on the history of Beetle Adventure Racing -- and its canceled sequel.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Conker’s Bad Fur Day</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Conker’s Bad Fur Day didn’t age as well as Rare’s best platformers, Banjo Kazooie and Banjo-Tooie, partially because of its dated humor and references, but it’s still a great time. I actually played the original saccharine Conker’s game before it was retooled into the M-rated adventure we all know and love today, and historic significance of that “design 180” aside, there still isn’t anything as outrageously funny as the Great Mighty Poo boss battle. Even without the context of Conker’s roots. Perhaps replaying it will finally purge the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2DogLLDV_0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ugas’ chant</a> from my brain, too. Note also that the Conker: Live and Reloaded remake is playable on modern Xbox consoles via backwards compatibility. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Diddy Kong Racing</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s very strange Nintendo added Rare’s much worse Jet Force Gemini to Nintendo Switch Online before adding Diddy Kong Racing, but perhaps the combination of Microsoft-owned game code with Nintendo characters made it a much trickier title to negotiate a re-release contract for. Or maybe it’s still coming. Regardless, Diddy Kong Racing merged the stylings of Mario Kart and Mario 64 into a racing game with multiple vehicle types and an explorable overworld hub – decades before Mario Kart World. The Analogue 3D even smoothes out some of DKR’s framerate issues thanks to its ability to overclock. Given how long it takes Nintendo to make a new Mario Kart, I’m still hoping we’ll eventually get a true remake or a sequel – but lest you want to risk waiting until you approach Cranky Kong’s age you may want to just revisit the original. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Bonus Pick: Goemon's Great Adventure</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Konami’s been issuing classic game collections left and right, which is why we haven’t seen some of its best classics, like the Castlevania GBA games, on Nintendo's service. Goemon games may be more likely additions, since Konami hasn’t revisited them in a long time, but the fact that the only Mystical Ninja game playable on modern hardware today is the obscure arcade original should tell you something. Though they’re not as good as Goemon’s best outings on SNES, Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon is a surprisingly daring Ocarina of Time-style 3D action adventure – and it came out before Nintendo’s mega hit. Plus, with overclocking, it’s actually much more playable than ever. Great Adventure, on the other hand, is a return to the 2D side-scrolling co-op action that may not be as original, but aged much better. Both are still fun to play. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/22/goemon-peer-1763780089988.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption"><strong>Goemon and Ebisumaru. (Credit: Konami JP 2005)</strong></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">See my column, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/life-and-death-of-the-mystical-ninja?_cache=pass">Life and Death of the Mystical Ninja</a> for more.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Ogre Battle 64: Person of Lordly Caliber</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">I wrote an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forgotten-gems-the-legendary-ogre-battle">entire column</a> about this true gem of strategy RPG and its predecessor, but at the risk of repeating myself: Ogre Battle 64 still rocks. Unfortunately, it’s also exceedingly rare and will cost more than a hundred bucks (without box or manual). If you don’t own it yet, always keep a weather eye out for a copy at the next neighborhood garage sale. See: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forgotten-gems-the-legendary-ogre-battle">Forgotten Gems: The Legendary Ogre Battle</a> for more.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Rocket: Robot on Wheels</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ve probably never heard of Rocket, but its developer’s pedigree has improved a thousand fold since its debut back in 1999. I’ve always had a soft sport for developer Sucker Punch’s inaugural game, but those curious what the people behind Ghost of Yotei, Infamous, and Sly Cooper did before they were famous will find a slower-paced, physics-based puzzle platformer featuring a long-forgotten unicycle robot mascot. Given that Sony owns Sucker Punch and publisher Ubisoft likely let the license lapse, here’s probably your one chance to play it again or for the first time. Criminally underplayed when it first came out, Rocket is worth another look.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Space Station Silicon Valley</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m convinced that DMA’s Space Station Silicon Valley will eventually join the Nintendo Classics lineup – after all, both its publisher, Take Two, and the developer – known now as Rockstar – are still alive and well. But until then, this obscure platform puzzle game is best played on original N64 hardware or the Analogue 3D. Silicon Valley has you switch between a variety of robotic animals to solve increasingly complicated puzzles. It’s odd, funny, and endlessly creative. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Star Wars: Rogue Squadron</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Bonus Pick: Star Wars: Battle for Naboo</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s surprising this graphical showcase hasn’t returned to a Nintendo platform given that you can buy the PC port for a few bucks on Steam. Until it does, you could do worse than play the Expansion Pak-enhanced shooter on an Analogue 3D or original hardware today. A technical achievement for its time, Rogue Squadron is still a very playable and fun experience today. I was actually surprised how good it looks compared to pretty much every other N64 game when I plugged it into my Analogue 3D. The Analogue, of course, also supports the high resolution display mode that requires the 4MB Expansion Pak on original hardware. Bonus: try Star Wars: Episode I Battle for Naboo. It may not have the benefit of the more memorable battles from the original trilogy, but it’s a quality shooter in its own right.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Super Smash Bros.</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, I know. It’s insane the original Smash Bros. has not been released on Nintendo 64 Classics. Whatever the reasons, it still feels great and is a wonderful reminder as to how even the biggest hits started small. It’s the weakest game in the series with its limited roster of just 12 characters, but the genius of the series is already on full display here. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">WWF No Mercy</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Bonus Picks: WWF Wrestlemania 2000, WCW/NWO: Revenge, WCW vs. NWO: World Tour</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m not a wrestling guy, but even I could tell that developer Aki’s run of Nintendo 64 wrestlers was something special. WWF No Mercy was always our internal top pick at IGN64 (we played it for many late, late hours), but any of the four Aki-made games are still worth playing. And given the complications with character and league licenses, the chances of them ever coming to Nintendo’s service are very slim.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those 10 picks should be enough to get you started. </p><p id="even-more-n64-picks"><h2 data-cy="title1" data-toc-title="Even More N64 Picks">Even More N64 Picks for Your Analogue 3D</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">And here are a few more games worth checking out, based either on gameplay quality or historical significance, as noted:</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Bakuretsu Muteki Bangai-O</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Inferior to the Dreamcast version, but still a great example of what made Treasure’s games such rare delights, Bangai-O has you steer a tiny flying mech through a maze filled with enemies and relentlessly blast the opposition. Only released in Japan in limited numbers, it’s so ridiculously expensive to buy for N64, it would be really nice to get a digital rerelease.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">BattleTanx and BattleTanx: Global Assault</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo 64 was <strong>the</strong> multiplayer console of the ‘90s – but some of us kept playing four-player split-screen years afterwards, too. Stemming from failed console-maker 3DO, the two BattleTanx games were lesser known, but managed to serve up such addictive tank PVP gameplay, we ended up playing it almost as much as GoldenEye. Sadly, 3DO went under before they managed to pull off a hat trick. Prism Entertainment snapped up the license and maintains the trademarks for BattleTanx, but hasn’t done anything with them. Might as well grab the carts for cheap at a garage sale.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Body Harvest</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Body Harvest is not a great game – and its visuals definitely didn’t age well. But it’s an experiment so ahead of its time, it deserves to be played again. From the makers of Grand Theft Auto comes a fully polygonal alien invasion action adventure that lets you command any vehicle you see. If you’re intrigued, please see my column for more: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/body-harvest-the-game-nintendo-walked-away-from">Body Harvest: The Game Nintendo Walked Away From</a>. Killer soundtrack, too.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/05/13/bodyharvest-toys-1683937341671.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Body Harvest's toy box of commandable vehicles.</figcaption></figure></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Bomberman X4</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo 64 is home to four Bomberman games. Let me break them all down so you know which one's which. The first, Bomberman 64, known as Baku Bomberman in Japan, is notable mostly for bringing Bomberman into polygonal 3D. It’s not as snappy as its 2D predecessors, but it’s still fun to revisit. It was followed by the single-player Bomberman Hero. The lack of multiplayer was confounding and the action is decent enough, but it's at the bottom of the Bomberman list for me. It was followed by Bomberman 64: Second Attack. This underrated sequel to the inaugural 64 outing ffeatures more multiplayer options, including two-player co-op and a four-player splitscreen mode. Not all of them hit, but it’s still a quality game to revisit. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, things get confusing. There’s also: <strong>Bomberman 64</strong>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">No, you’re not seeing double. This Racjin-developed game takes everything back to 2D. Which much better results. Only released in Japan, it’s a shame the real Bomberman 64 from the makers of Snowbo Kids is more obscure than the inferior earlier title. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Castlevania: Legacy Of Darkness</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Konami tried really hard – and struggled – to bring all its classic 2D series into the third dimension. It gave up on Contra 64 outright and canceled the project, while Goemon fared slightly better and saw two N64 releases, covered above. But you have to laud Konami for not giving up. Legacy of Darkness is basically a redo of Castlevania [64]. Its foggy, blurry visuals won’t dazzle you, but it’s a flawed and forgotten gem worth remembering. I still love that oversized “Home Depot Skeleton” battle. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Cruis’n USA and Cruis’n World</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Take a deep breath. I don’t love these games. Actually, I don’t even <strong>like</strong> these games. I had some fun with Cruis’n USA in the arcades, but only when there weren’t better racers around to play – which was rare, because contemporaries like Daytona USA were always near. The N64 version isn’t a great conversion, but I know many older arcade fans are nostalgic for both Cruis’n games, so it feels right to include them with a special callout.. I do appreciate Williams/Midway's early attempts to recreate arcade game on Nintendo 64 -- a key reason why Nintendo of America included them in their much-publicized Dream Team. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Donkey Kong 64</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">While I’m making you angry, I have very mixed feelings about DK 64 as well. The two Banjo games are definitely superior in every way, which is no doubt why both were prioritized for release on Switch. But for all the collection bloat, Donkey Kong 64 still has some memorable moments -- and music -- that make it worth revisiting. Plus, that yellow cartridge looks mighty good in either the white or the black Analogue 3D. Overclocking helps with its erratic framerate, but the drop in quality from Banjo-Kazooie is palpable when you play them back to back. I know, I know, many of you love it. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Doubutsu no Mori (Animal Crossing)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Animal Crossing on GameCube was actually a port of Doubutsu no Mori, a Nintendo 64 “communication game” that predates it by a full year. You’ll have to be able to read Japanese kana to fully enjoy it – but also note that you’ll mostly be playing the same game that later came to GameCube as Animal Crossing and Doubutsu no Mori+. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">San Francisco Rush and Rush 2049</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The original arcade conversion was surprisingly competent, but the Nintendo 64 version of its sequel, Rush 2049, manages the rare feat of being better than the arcade original. The key to its success was the ability to control the vehicles while airborne, which made all the difference for this version’s battle and stunt modes. “Rush… It’s DANGEROUS.”</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Gauntlet Legends</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Atari was intent on reinventing each one of its arcade classics in 3D for the new millennium, and Gauntlet Legends turned out to be one of the few that made it and left an impression. Ironically, its blocky polygonal graphics didn’t age as well as the OG’s top-down sprites, but I remember having a plenty of fun playing four-player in both the arcades and at home on N64. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Hybrid Heaven</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not as good as you remember it to be, but it remains a really unique attempt at marrying Metal Gear-style action with classic roleplaying gameplay. Ultimately, the world you explore is just not interesting enough to keep most player’s attention, but it’s historically interesting as the only sci-fi action RPG from Konami’s Osaka team and because it featured a widescreen mode way back in 1999. Hybrid Heaven supported the physical Expansion Pak for higher resolution output on N64 hardware, which the Analogue 3D supports virtually as well. For all its faults, Hybrid Heaven remains a cool experimental game that unfortunately ended up a mere footnote in Konami console game history.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Mickey’s Speedway USA</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m no fan of Mickey’s Speedway USA – to me, it’s the game where Rare’s considerable design chops fell victim to having to color in the lines of a high-profile license. But it’s unlikely we’ll ever see this Disney take on Mario Kart (with way too wide tracks) re-released, so snap it up if you encounter it in the wild. The marriage of Nintendo, Rare, and Disney seemed like the start of a beautiful friendship and Speedway USA is more of a dead end -- but it's still cool to see Rare try something very "American", even if its NASCAR with mice and dogs didn't quite work out. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Micro Machines 64 Turbo</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s a surprisingly good racing game, on the other hand. Unfairly overlooked, Micro Machines 64 Turbo is a top-down multiplayer racer that offers up super-fun four player action with 32 different vehicle types – cars, tanks, boats, helicopters – across 48 different tracks. It even features an eight-player mode via what it calls “pad share” (yes, it’s as awkward as it sounds, but you have to appreciate the total commitment to create the ultimate party game). </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Mischief Makers</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Mischief Makers bucked the trend of making every game 3D on N64 and it’s still good for some fast and fluid action from storied developer Treasure. It’s not as good as Treasure’s own Gunstar Heroes for Genesis, but hey, not many games let you play as a brawling robot maid. We haven't gotten a new Treasure game since 2014, so even its lesser efforts are worth digging up. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Mission: Impossible</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The movie-licensed Mission: Impossible may not be a great game, but it's worth adding to your physical cart collection as something that will likely never see a re-release on any platform due to licensing issues and the fact that it's a better museum piece than a video game. Mission: Impossible was a hugely ambitious game development project that didn’t quite make it to the desired finish line. It was pared down and became considerably less ambitious to get it out the door, but some of the great ideas are still to be found in what could’ve been a Hitman game before there were Hitman games. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rayman 2: The Great Escape</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Though not as good as the Dreamcast version, Rayman 2: The Great Escape on Nintendo 64 is an excellent platformer that shows the limbless hero could hang with Mario and Banjo (unlike Ubi’s very similar 3D platformer attempt that year, Tonic Trouble). Rayman’s 2D outings have aged better, but The Great Escape is still surprisingly good.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Snowboard Kids 1 and 2</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo 64’s four controller ports and early success with Mario Kart 64 multiplayer inspired some developers to experiment with “Mario Kart, but with…” games. With Snowboard Kids, Osaka-based Racjin found the winning formula. Never as good as Mario Kart – or 1080, for that matter – both Snowbo Kids games do conjure up plenty of happy memories of playing against friends. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">I know there are plenty of N64 fans who would put this in their top 10 based on the strength of its excellent Hoth level. Visually, it was way ahead of its time. But unfortunately, most of the game is marred by sluggish and unbalanced first-person shooter sections and a repetitive, highly compressed mono soundtrack. It’s an interesting failure that has its fans. Worth playing just for the Snowspeeder bits and the fuzzy memories. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Top Gear and Friends</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">I wrote about the original Top Gear on SNES in a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forgotten-gems-top-racer-back-in-top-gear">previous installment of this column</a>, but N64 is a home to a slew of Top Gear titles, all quite different from each other. There’s Top Gear Rally, Top Gear Rally 2, Top Gear Overdrive, and Top Gear Hyperbike. The first one is still arguably the best in the bunch – Boss Game Studios, how you’re missed! Top Gear Rally and the Boss-developed street racing successor World Drive Championship showed what was graphically possible on Nintendo 64, while the Saffire-developed Top Gear Rally 2 added equipment failure to the mix for a more authentic endurance racing experience. Top Gear Overdrive, finally, is an obscure attempt at challenging Beetle Adventure Racing – and it’s quite competent. It’s from Snowblind Studios, the people behind Baldur’s Gate: Dark Alliance. That same team also made Top Gear Hyperbike – a decent racer, but not in the same league as Excitebike 64. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Tetrisphere, The New Tetris, Tetris 64, and Magical Tetris Challenge</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo 64 was home to many quality puzzle games, some of which have already been released on Nintendo Switch. But there’s a quadrilogy of Tetris games that never got there that’s still worth playing. The visually-exciting but also confusing Tetrisphere and the more traditional The New Tetris are mostly notable for their kicking soundtrack (the same composer scored both), while the Japan-only Tetris 64 mixed things up significantly with new block sizes and different modes (and a bio sensor you can clamp to your ear). Capcom’s quality attempt, Magical Tetris Challenge, combines two complicated licenses – Disney and Tetris – and thus will never be seen again outside its limited console run (and the arcade original it’s based on). </p><p id="honorable-mentions"><h2 data-cy="title1" data-toc-title="Honorable Mentions">There's Even More</h2></p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Best of Nintendo 64</h3><p>Here are the N64 games that have left the biggest mark not just on our lives, but on the industry as a whole. You can use this list to track which games you've played, make your personal Nintendo Online wishlist, or re-rank them and make your own Top 25.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">How’s that for a list to keep you busy? No, they're not all great -- but they're all interesting games that are surely worth another look. There’s plenty more, of course, from the oddball liquid puzzler Wetrix, to WipEout 64, platformers Chameleon Twist and Glover, rally racer MRC, and some quality sports games like NFL Blitz, ISS ‘98, and NBA Courtside. Bored with GoldenEye? Eurocom’s The World is Not Enough isn’t bad. Plus, there are the excellent (but widely available) Worms Armageddon, Spider-Man, Vigilante 8, and some fun and goofy ports of StarCraft 64, Command &amp; Conquer, Quake, Quake II, Rainbow Six, and Duke Nukem to keep you busy. And yes, I know about Quest 64 and the Army Men games – more power to you if you enjoy them – but they’re not on my Christmas List.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Do you have any favorite Nintendo 64 games that I didn’t mention?

This <strong>uplighter floor lamp</strong> is a perfect example of what Govee does best, marrying ambient lighting, RGBIC effects and practical task lighting in one sleek device. For Black Friday,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5844/"> it has dropped to a record-low $125 on Amazon, down from $179</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5844/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Tri-Zone Lighting That Transforms Any Room</h2>
<p>This floor lamp is impressive with its tri-zone system: <strong>the upper section projects dynamic ripple effects onto your ceiling, the middle zone delivers colorful RGBIC lighting, and the lower section provides 1000 lumens of focused task lighting</strong>. Control each zone independently or combine them for layered effects. Set up movie nights, work sessions, and parties with their perfect lighting.</p>
<p>The ripple projector creates mesmerizing, water-like patterns that dance across your ceiling and walls. The lamp head rotates 330 degrees, letting you aim the projection exactly where you want it. You<strong> can cover up to 215 square feet</strong> with these dynamic effects, which fills most living rooms and bedrooms easily. Govee includes more than 80 preset scenes in their app, or you can create your own custom patterns.</p>



<p>Circadian rhythm lighting is a feature that actually enhances your daily life once it’s setup: The <strong>lamp adjusts color temperature from 2700K warm tones to 6500K cool white throughout the day</strong>. Cool, energizing light in the morning helps you wake up and stay productive. Warm sunset hues in the evening signal your body to start winding down for sleep. The <strong>auto-run feature handles those transitions automatically</strong> so you don’t have to think about it.</p>
<p>Integration with smart homes works smoothly on all major platforms. The lamp is Matter compatible, meaning it plays nicely with Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, and Google Assistant. With Voice Control, one can change scenes, adjust brightness, or turn the lamp on and off-all without reaching for the phone. The Govee Home app unlocks the full potential with DIY light shows and music-reactive modes.</p>



<p>The build quality is excellent for a lamp in its category: The <strong>solidly built rust-proof aluminum construction</strong> should last for years to come. The transparent black shade accents give it a modern look that suits most décor styles. The motors responsible for the rotating projector head work at under 25 decibels, meaning they are basically silent. This means you won’t have any disturbing mechanical noises when you’re relaxing or working.</p>
<p>Setting everything up with the Govee app takes only a few minutes: Connect to your 2.4GHz WiFi network, and it seems like the lamp is ready for customization. The interface of the app is intuitively simple to navigate, with easy access to scenes, schedules, and manual controls. Firmware updates unlock new features over time, including the combo mode for upper and lower sections.</p>
<p>The Govee uplighter floor lamp is an incredible value at $125 this Black Friday. This is Philips Hue-level smart lighting for a fraction of the price.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-chose-market-share-over-margins-airpods-pro-3-crash-to-record-low-days-after-launch-2000646557</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-chose-market-share-over-margins-airpods-pro-3-crash-to-record-low-days-after-launch.1361968/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple released the AirPods Pro 3 a few weeks ago and they’re already discounted on Amazon. That’s unusual for brand-new Apple products which typically hold their full price for months after launch. Apple isn’t offering any discount on their website or in Apple Stores so Amazon is clearly absorbing the cost to drive Black Friday traffic: You’re saving $30 on earbuds that haven’t even been on shelves for a full month, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/">and at $219 down from $249, this is the lowest price we’ve seen</a> and likely the best deal you’ll find on these new earbuds.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Next-Level Audio</h2>
<p>Active noise cancellation on AirPods Pro 3 <strong>removes up to twice as much unwanted noise as the previous generation</strong>. And airplane engines, office chatter, and city traffic just fade away so you can focus on your music or podcast. The new acoustic architecture delivers transformed bass response with detailed clarity across all frequencies. Vocals sound stunningly vivid, and you can pick out individual instruments in complex recordings.</p>
<p><strong>Spatial audio immerses you in a three-dimensional soundstage</strong> where movies and music feel more real than ever. When you turn your head, the sound shifts around you, placing you in the heart of the action. Of course, this only works with compatible content on Apple Music, Apple TV+, and select other streaming services. It also extends to gaming, providing you with better spatial awareness so you know exactly where sounds are coming from.</p>



<p>These health features are genuinely groundbreaking for a product of this size. Integrated heart rate sensing keeps track of your pulse and calories burned across 50 different workout types. You get access to your Move ring, step count, and the new Workout Buddy feature powered by Apple Intelligence. The hearing health suite includes a home hearing test and a clinical-grade Hearing Aid feature with automatic Conversation Boost.</p>
<p>Live Translation is one of those features that sounds like science fiction until you try it. Firing on all cylinders thanks to Apple Intelligence, the feature translates conversations in real-time directly through your earbuds. You can communicate across language barriers during travel or international business meetings and <strong>the translation is local on your device for privacy and speed</strong>.</p>



<p>Battery life is significantly better compared to previous generations: You get up to <strong>8 hours of listening time with active noise cancellation enabled</strong> or up to 10 hours in Transparency mode using the Hearing Aid feature. The USB-C charging case provides additional charges when you’re on the go. A quick charge gives you hours of listening from just minutes in the case.</p>
<p>The <strong>new ear tips come in five sizes, up from the previous three</strong>, to provide a much more personalized and secure fit. A better seal means improved noise isolation and bass response sans cranking the volume up. The buds stay put during workouts, runs, and active daily use. Apple’s fit test in the Settings app will help you find the perfect size for your ears. Comfort matters when you are wearing earbuds for hours at a time.</p>
<p>At $219, the AirPods Pro 3 offer fantastic value on brand new Apple hardware. Amazon’s taking the hit on margins that Apple won’t match in their own stores. If you want the latest AirPods Pro at a price below retail, this record-low Black Friday deal is the opportunity to grab them.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dyson-shows-no-pride-v11-vacuum-cleaner-now-sells-cheaper-than-mid-range-generic-alternatives-2000646571</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Dyson vacuums are known to be pricey, but they’ve also gained a reputation for being worth the price. One of Dyson’s most recent cordless models, <strong>the V11 Origin</strong>, packs serious suction and smart features into a lightweight design. There’s a reason this has been Dyson’s best-seller since Black Friday started on Thursday: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/">At $399, down from $629, you’re saving $230 on a premium cleaning machine</a> that will revolutionize the way you do housework. And, with this record-low price, Dyson quality is now accessible.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Powerful Suction That Handles Every Surface</h2>
<p>The <strong>185 air watts of suction power places the V11 Origin</strong> among the most powerful cordless vacuums you can buy. This is a full 60% more power than previous Dyson generations, and you instantly tell the difference on carpets. Deep-embedded dirt, pet hair, and fine dust get pulled up from fibers that other vacuums leave behind. The same power works brilliantly on hard floors without scattering debris around.</p>
<p>The Motorbar cleaner head automatically<strong> adjusts to different floor types</strong> as you work your way through your house. Firm nylon bristles dig into carpets, while softer carbon fiber filaments capture fine dust on hard floors. The brilliant part is the de-tangling technology that stops long hair and pet hair from wrapping around the brush bar. You won’t spend time cutting hair out of the roller after every cleaning session.</p>



<p>Three power modes allow you to customize suction for what you’re cleaning. Auto mode intelligently adjusts the power as it senses different floor types and dirt levels. Eco mode makes the most of battery life for lighter cleaning tasks around the home. Boost mode unleashes full suction for stubborn messes and high-traffic areas. The <strong>LCD screen shows your current mode</strong>, remaining runtime down to the second and maintenance alerts.</p>
<p>It reaches up to <strong>60 minutes on a single charge in Eco mode</strong>&nbsp;which is enough to cover most homes. The removable lithium-ion battery charges in an included docking station that mounts on your wall. Having a dedicated home for the vacuum keeps it charged and ready whenever you need it. The accessories store neatly on the dock, too, so everything stays organized. Just grab, clean, and dock back in seconds.</p>



<p>Turn this floor vacuum into a portable cleaning machine <strong>with the handheld conversion</strong>. Pop off the wand and attach the various tools directly to the main unit: The crevice tool reaches into tight spaces, car seats, and between cushions. The mini soft dusting brush handles delicate surfaces and electronics without scratching. The hair screw tool tackles upholstery and stairs where pet hair tends to accumulate.</p>
<p><strong>At just 6.6 pounds</strong>, the V11 Origin feels manageable even during extended cleaning sessions. The weight balance keeps it comfortable to maneuver around furniture and up stairs. You can easily lift it to clean ceiling corners, curtains, and high shelves. The cordless freedom means no more unplugging and re-plugging as you move between rooms.</p>
<p>HEPA filtration captures allergens and microscopic particles that cheaper vacuums blow back into your air. This matters if anyone in your household deals with allergies or asthma. Whole-machine<strong> filtration traps 99.97% of particles as small as 0.3 microns</strong>. You’re improving your indoor air quality while you clean your floors.</p>
<p>The Dyson V11 Origin offers unparalleled value at $399 this Black Friday and this is the best-selling Dyson vacuum for a reason.</p>

              <p>Beats has been owned by Apple since 2014 but the brand has maintained its own identity and signature sound that fans love. The<strong> Beats Pill is one of the most iconic portable speakers</strong> ever made and it continues to deliver impressive audio in a compact package. This Black Friday, it <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5035/">has dropped to a record-low $99 on Amazon, down from $149</a>. If you’ve been eyeing this legendary speaker, now is the time to grab it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5035/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Seriously Loud Sound in a Portable Package</h2>
<p>The <strong>audio quality on the Beats Pill punches far above its weight class</strong>. A custom acoustic architecture produces rich, balanced sound with deep bass that fills a room. You get that signature Beats warmth without any of the muddiness that tends to plague cheaper portable speakers. It gets genuinely very loud while remaining clear, so outdoor gatherings and beach days can sound great.</p>
<p>Where the Beats Pill really impresses is in its battery life: it <strong>gives you as much as 24 hours of playback</strong> from one charge, so weekend trips and all-day events are covered without having to hunt for an outlet. The USB-C charging keeps things simple since you’re probably already carrying that cable for your phone. A quick 10-minute charge gives you enough juice for a couple more hours when you’re running low.</p>



<p><strong>Water resistance adds durability</strong> that makes the Beats Pill ready for real-life adventures. Splashes by the pool, rain at a picnic, or spills at a party won’t damage this speaker. You can take it out to places where you wouldn’t want to take more fragile electronics. The build quality feels solid and premium in your hands without being heavy or awkward to carry. This is gear designed for people who actually use their speakers outside of the living room.</p>
<p><strong>Bluetooth connectivity</strong> works seamlessly with both Apple and Android devices. For the iPhone, one gets extra benefits, such as one tap pairing and Find My integration to locate the speaker in case it goes missing. Android users, on the other hand, get the same excellent sound quality and reliable wireless connection. Pairing only takes seconds, and the connection stays stable even when you move around. You can also connect two Beats Pills together for stereo sound or amplified mode when one speaker isn’t enough.</p>



<p>The compact design makes this speaker truly portable in a way larger Bluetooth speakers just aren’t. It fits in a backpack, beach bag, or even a large jacket pocket without weighing you down. The cylindrical shape looks clean and modern while<strong> providing 360-degree sound dispersion</strong>. The matte black finish resists fingerprints and looks sleek in any setting. You’ll actually want to bring this speaker with you rather than leaving it at home because it’s too bulky.</p>
<p>The Beats Pill, at $99, is a seriously good Black Friday value. At the record-low price, an already great speaker becomes an incredible deal that’s hard to pass up.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Makes a Zero-Profit Play on Fitbit Charge 6, Pocket Change That Buries the Apple Watch]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-makes-a-zero-profit-play-on-fitbit-charge-6-pocket-change-that-buries-the-apple-watch-2000646578</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-makes-a-zero-profit-play-on-fitbit-charge-6-pocket-change-that-buries-the-apple-watch.1361950/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Google bought up Fitbit back in 2021 and the brand has been incrementally improving ever since. The <strong>Charge 6</strong> is Google’s direct challenge to Apple Watch in the fitness tracker space, albeit at a much friendlier price. This tracker packs serious health monitoring features including built-in GPS and Google app integration, into a slim wristband design. For Black Friday,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5847/"> it has dropped to a record-low $99 on Amazon, down from $159</a>. You also get <strong>six months of Fitbit Premium included</strong>, adding even more value to an already great deal.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5847/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Google-Powered Fitness Tracking on Your Wrist</h2>
<p>The Google integration changes how you interact with your fitness tracker throughout the day. On walks and runs, Google Maps gives turn-by-turn directions right from your wrist. With Google Wallet, you’re able to make contactless payments without having to pull out your phone or card. And control from YouTube Music lets you manage your workout playlist sans breaking stride.</p>
<p>That makes heart rate monitoring on the Fitbit Charge 6 a game-changer for indoor workouts, especially with compatible gym equipment. Connect to Bluetooth-enabled treadmills, ellipticals, and stationary bikes that can broadcast your heart rate. Your real-time pulse data appears on the machine’s display to help you stay in your target zone. Previously, this type of gym equipment compatibility had been limited to higher-end fitness watches. You get the premium features without the premium price tag.</p>



<p><strong>Built-in GPS tracks your runs, cycling routes, and hikes</strong> accurately without needing your phone nearby. Afterwards, you can see your pace, distance, and elevation changes in the Fitbit app. The GPS locks in quickly, so you are not standing around waiting before your run.</p>
<p>Health monitoring goes deep on the Charge 6, with continuous heart rate tracking and SpO2 blood oxygen sensing. Sleep tracking analyzes your rest patterns and provides a daily Sleep Score. Stress management tools include guided breathing sessions and an EDA sensor for mindfulness sessions. The tracker monitors your Active Zone Minutes, which count time spent in fat-burning or cardio heart rate zones.</p>



<p>The six-month Fitbit Premium membership that’s included with your purchase will unlock advanced insights and guided programs. With Premium, you get detailed sleep analysis, personalized workout recommendations, and mindfulness content. Video workouts from fitness experts give you fresh routines to try at home or in the gym. Health metrics dashboard shows trends in your data over time. <strong>This membership normally costs $10/month</strong>&nbsp;so you’re getting an additional $60 value included.</p>
<p>Battery life reaches<strong> up to seven days on a single charge</strong>&nbsp;which beats most smartwatches by a wide margin. You can track an entire week of workouts, sleep, and daily activity without touching a charger. When you do need to recharge, it takes about two hours to reach full capacity. The <strong>always-on display option</strong> shows your stats at a glance without tapping or wrist-raising. Less time charging means more time tracking.</p>
<p>The slim band design keeps the Charge 6 comfortable for all-day and all-night wear: <strong>Both small and large bands come in the box</strong>&nbsp;so you’ll find the right fit immediately. Water resistance up to 50 meters means showers, swimming, and sweaty workouts won’t damage the tracker. The<strong> touchscreen is quick to respond</strong> and easy to navigate through menus. You get a premium feel without the bulk of a traditional smartwatch.</p>
<p>At $99, the Fitbit Charge 6 is an absolute steal this Black Friday. This is the best fitness tracker from Google and Fitbit at nearly 40% off retail.</p>

            <p>
Gosh, can you believe it? It's already the 35th anniversary of Ruin! It came out before I was born, but even I'm feeling the passage of time with this one. With such a momentous occasion upon us, a special 35th anniversary edition of the legendary <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> has been released by its developer Official Electric, split across just four floppy disks… except, well, you've definitely already clocked that Ruin isn't quite real. At least not in the way it's been presented.
</p>
<p>
The actual game in question here is Ruin: Chapter 0, an interactive fiction game in the stylings of something you might have seen on the ZX Spectrum, albeit with a lot more flair. And, perhaps, a lot more glitches - <strong>a big flashing imagery warning is needed for this one</strong>. Playable within your browser, it's kind of hard to describe what you do, or even what you're doing, in Ruin. From what I can gather, you are a knight, the hero of rune, tasked by the king to retrieve a sword and defeat evil forever. But no matter what, I just keep getting my ass kicked by this evil, and every time I die it just says "get owned" at me! Rude!
</p>

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IghZpvngG44" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>


<p>
And then the game becomes something else… a sci-fi romper across different planets, one where you run through the woods clicking on apples at just the right time as they approach you, and where you take pitstops to take a smoke break. Those moments where you take the devil sticks out of their luxurious boxes requires you to actually do so, dragging it out, flicking your lighter to set it off, pulling it towards your lips. It is such a strangely involved game in some ways, and hands-off in others.
</p><p>
It flicks between your more typical RPG kind of screen, to a first-person point-and-click adventure game, to, quite honestly, an animated movie of sorts. There is an impenetrable quality to it that makes me want to break it down, to uncover its secrets, to do a deep dive on Wikipedia followed by watching several "Ruin EXPLAINED" videos on YouTube. And yet I won't find those, because Ruin is not the legendary IP celebrating its 35th anniversary it claims to be. But it does a good job of making you believe in it.

              <p>Gamers who also create content, edit videos, or work long hours at their desk need a mouse that handles everything. Your gaming mouse might be great for fragging but it’s probably not ideal for those 10-hour editing sessions or browsing between matches. The <strong>Logitech MX Master 3S</strong> bridges that gap with an 8K DPI sensor, ergonomic design and features that make productivity feel effortless. This Black Friday, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5841/">it has dropped to a record-low $99 on Amazon, down from $119</a>. If you want one mouse that dominates both work and play, this is the one to grab.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5841/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Precision and Comfort Built for Marathon Sessions</h2>
<p>The <strong>8000 DPI sensor</strong> inside the MX Master 3S tracks on virtually any surface, including glass. You can game on your desk, work from a coffee shop table or use it on your couch armrest with no need for a mousepad. Whichever you choose, the tracking remains accurate and responsive. Sensitivity is fully customizable through the <em>Logi Options+</em> software, so you can really dial in just the feel you want.</p>
<p>The ergonomics of this mouse are really impressive for long sessions of gaming and work: The <strong>sculpted shape fits naturally in your hand</strong>&nbsp;and reduces strain through those marathon streams or nights of editing. Your wrist and fingers stay comfortable even after hours of continuous use. The thumb rest provides support that cheaper mice simply don’t offer. If you have ever felt hand fatigue after extended time at the desk, this design makes a noticeable difference.</p>



<p>The <em>Quiet Clicks</em> feature cuts down the noise by 90% compared to the regular mice and becomes a game-changer in streamers’ and content developers’ lives. Your microphone will not catch any kind of annoying click sound while recording or on Discord with your buddies. They are still satisfying and tactile clicks, just without the audible snap.</p>
<p><em>MagSpeed</em> scrolling is one of those features you don’t know you need until you experience it. The scroll wheel moves with electromagnetic precision, allowing you to scroll through long documents or web pages in a single flick. It’s <strong>90% faster and 87% more precise than conventional scroll wheels</strong>. When you need fine control, it shifts automatically to a ratcheted mode that clicks through line by line.</p>



<p>Multi-device connectivity allows you to <strong>connect the MX Master 3S to up to three computers or devices at once</strong>. Switch between your gaming rig, work laptop, and tablet with the press of a button. Flow takes this a step further by allowing you to move your cursor seamlessly across computers and drag files across them. This is incredible if one runs a dual-system setup for streaming and gaming. The <strong>mouse connects via Bluetooth</strong> or the included Logi Bolt USB receiver for a great wireless connection.</p>
<p>And the battery life won’t leave you stranded mid-session: <strong>a full charge lasts up to 70 days of regular use</strong> and a quick one-minute charge gives you three hours of power when you’re in a pinch. The USB-C charging port also means you can use the same cable as your phone or controller.</p>
<p>The Logitech MX Master 3S is an unbelievable deal at $99 this Black Friday, make sure you don’t miss that opportunity.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-not-releasing-in-2026-claim-insiders.1361932/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>After an earlier claim—or belief, depending on how you want to look at it—stating otherwise, some insiders have started to say that Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet is not coming out in 2026. In addition, it won’t be in attendance at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a>.</p>



<p>Last year at The Game Awards, Naughty Dog revealed its next title,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. The sci-fi set space fantasy looked way different than previous studio titles, minus some familiar faces. Hype for the title has been palpable, so when former gaming journalist Colin Moriarty appeared to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-2026-release-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claim the game</a> would release in 2026, many were excited. However, it seems it would be short-lived, as credible insiders have come to debunk the report, including Moriarty himself.</p>







<h2 id="h-no-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-at-the-game-awards-2025-insiders-state">No Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet at The Game Awards 2025, Insiders State</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I sympathize with being misquoted. He was speculating and people on the internet pretended he wasn't. Either way, this caused people to confirm to me it won't be out in 2026 and it won't be at TGAs. </p><p>I'm not interested in keeping score on who said what right on a podcast.</p></div>— Grubb (@JeffGrubb) <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffGrubb/status/1992351916517683631?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 22, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>After Colin Moriarty’s comments went viral, some insiders <strong>quickly hopped onto social media</strong> to <strong>debunk the report of Intergalactic releasing in 2026</strong>. The first to do so was <strong>Jason Schreier</strong>, a notable name in the gaming industry. Commenting on a /GamingLeaksandRumours post, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1p3zwoe/comment/nq8f5f9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he states</a>, “<strong>Can assure you that Intergalactic is not coming out in 2026.</strong>“</p>



<p>Then, video game journalist and insider Jeff Grubb <a href="https://x.com/JeffGrubb/status/1992351916517683631?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted on Twitter</a> that not only would Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet <strong>not come out in 2026</strong>, but <strong>it won’t be at The Game Awards this year</strong>. Following suit, Colin Moriarty <a href="https://x.com/longislandviper/status/1992340284026331442">commented on social media</a> that his words, used in the report, <strong>were taken out of context</strong> and that <strong>it was his opinion</strong>.</p>



<p>Either way, it does look like Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet will be quite a while away. Neil Druckmann himself, who is directing the game, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-will-fans-see-more-of-intergalactic-neil-druckmann-wont-say/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">couldn’t confirm</a> when we’d see the title again. It will be interesting to see when more will come out, though it’ll be exciting to watch gameplay. Naughty Dog’s track record is rather solid, so, whatever year it does launch, it’ll be one to watch out for.</p>







<p>Are you disappointed to hear Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet not coming out in 2026? Still hoping to see it at The Game Awards? When do you think it’ll come out? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>
