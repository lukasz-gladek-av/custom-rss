            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nacon-connect-2025-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nacon has revealed the air date for its latest Nacon Connect presentation, which will feature information on some of the studio's previously-announced games as well as a few surprises.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out Nacon Connect 2025 next week; it's airing on March 6th at 10am Pacific (that's around 1pm Eastern and about 6pm GMT, in case you're wondering). Nacon is remaining cagey about exactly what's going to be announced during the showcase.</p>

<p>Back <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nacon-connect-2023" rel="nofollow">in 2023</a>, Nacon gave us a look at games like&nbsp;<em>RoboCop: Rogue City</em>,&nbsp;<em>Clash: Artifacts of Chaos</em>, and&nbsp;<em>The Lord of the Rings: Gollum&nbsp;</em>(the latter of which was not yet wreathed in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lord-of-rings-gollum-studio-reportedly-abandons-game-development" rel="nofollow">tragedy that would subsume its developer</a> after its release).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/robocop-rogue-city-nacon-connect.jpg?itok=G_ihziSU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/robocop-rogue-city-nacon-connect.jpg?itok=k5X4lYoi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>In 2023, Nacon showed off&nbsp;<em>RoboCop: Rogue City&nbsp;</em>as part of its Nacon Connect presentation.</figcaption></figure><p>The festivities <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/terminator-survivors-and-more-unveiled-at-nacon-connect" rel="nofollow">returned last year</a>, when Nacon revealed survival game&nbsp;<em>Terminator: Survivors</em>&nbsp;during Nacon Connect 2024, as well as showing off the likes of action RPG&nbsp;<em>Dragonkin: The Banished</em>,&nbsp;<em>GreedFall 2: The Dying World</em>, and racer&nbsp;<em>Test Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown</em>.</p>

<p>As for what could be coming in this year's showcase, the studio's upcoming slate still contains all four of the aforementioned games, all of which are yet to receive definitive release dates (although&nbsp;<em>GreedFall 2&nbsp;</em>is admittedly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/greedfall-2-early-access-roadmap" rel="nofollow">out now in Early Access</a>).</p>

<p>In fact,&nbsp;<em>Terminator: Survivors&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/terminator-survivors-early-access-release" rel="nofollow">delayed back in August last year</a>; it was originally slated for a 2024 release, but it was subsequently pushed back to 2025.</p>

<p>If I had to guess, I'd say we'll probably get a release date or a release window for&nbsp;<em>Terminator: Survivors</em>, and I'd be surprised if we didn't hear more about Rogue Factor's&nbsp;<em>Hell Is Us&nbsp;</em>and Midgar Studio's&nbsp;<em>Edge of Memories&nbsp;</em>as well.</p>




<p>Whatever's on the way - and whatever surprises Nacon has planned - will be revealed in full during the Nacon Connect 2025 presentation, which is set to air on March 6th. You'll be able to check it out via Nacon's YouTube channel.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/619605/framework-desktop-preview-hands-on<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Framework’s mission is to “fix consumer electronics, one category at a time” by making them modular, repairable, and upgradable. It’s the only laptop maker to ever <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23125965/framework-laptop-upgrade-intel-12th-gen">truly succeed</a> at that “upgradable” part. But <em>desktop</em> PCs are already modular, so <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/618785/framework-desktop-annoucement-price-release-date">why is Framework making one</a>?</p><p>At first, I thought it saw a unique opportunity to make <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/618785/framework-desktop-annoucement-price-release-date">a cute yet badass tiny gaming PC</a> with AMD’s unusual Strix Halo processor and decided to shoot its shot. As you’ll read below, I’m excited by the result. But I also have another idea I’ll share with you afterward.</p><p>Let’s start with the gadget part: yes, the tiny 4.5-liter gaming desktop that Framework announced yesterday is just as cool in person as it was in Framework’s photos, and yes, it can game.</p><p>At first, I wasn’t sure we’d be able to meaningfully try that last part. Almost all the Framework Desktops at the company’s live event in San Francisco yesterday were either running games that don’t offer a great sense of performance (<em>Counter-Strike</em> and <em>Street Fighter</em>) or were unplugged so we could take photos from every angle. But partway through the event, someone had fired up <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, and I saw my chance.</p><p>The first benchmark was promising but not exactly running smoothly, averaging just under 30fps at 4K with ray tracing, FSR upscaling, and Frame Generation turned on. But when we swapped to a native 1440p at Ultra settings, no ray tracing, and none of AMD’s fancy tricks, I saw <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-cyberpunk-2077-internal-pc-benchmarks-tested-on-ps5-and-xbox-series-consoles">a PS5-beating</a> 73fps average — with lows of 60fps! — from a box that’s actually smaller than a PS5 (or an Xbox Series X) in volume.</p><p>That’s because the Framework Desktop contains a new and rather unusual <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337025/amd-ryzen-ai-max-strix-halo-fire-range-9955hx3d">AMD Ryzen AI Max processor</a> whose integrated Radeon 8060S graphics are as powerful as a discrete mobile graphics chip — namely, the laptop version of the Nvidia RTX 4060 — and can apparently trade blows with the mobile RTX 4070 when it gets enough sustained power like the 120 watts it can tap into here. It also shares a massive amount of unified LPDDR5x memory across the entire system, including graphics — up to 96GB of VRAM for its GPU.</p><p>While <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335012/asus-rog-flow-z13-gaming-tablet-amd-ryzen-max-plus-price-specs">an Asus tablet</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339771/i-lifted-128gb-of-memory-and-the-most-powerful-integrated-graphics-with-one-hand">an HP laptop</a> also contain the same chip, the Strix Halo’s power may be constrained by its cooling and battery, and yet, unconstrained, the chip still doesn’t have enough power to supplant today’s big gaming laptops or desktops. But here, Framework has built an attractive miniature desktop that’s not quite like anything that currently exists.</p><p>It lets you pick your own front I/O ports thanks to the same expansion cards on Framework’s laptops. It has magnetic front and side panels that easily pop into place, then slide down to secure. There’s an optional carry handle that I already love — when you spin each of its halves into place, they act as the thumbscrews to keep your case fully closed, then you screw the two halves of the handle together <em>using the handle itself</em>, and it feels incredibly secure once you’re done. (See my embedded video if that sounds confusing.)</p><p>It also seems easy to personalize this case: there are 21 slots for colored plastic squares on the front panel, you can 3D print your own (I saw some Lego bits attached to 3D-printed studs on one and fake grass attached to another), and it’s incredibly easy to pop the squares out to make room for new ones if you remove the front panel first.</p><p>I’m not yet sold on this computer being easy to upgrade like Framework’s other products, though. Even forgetting the soldered memory, there’s not necessarily enough space in here to maneuver its parts like a larger desktop; I had to reach inside pretty delicately to unplug the ATX motherboard power cable and USB headers. While removing the fan, storage, and Wi-Fi modules is quite easy, I was told I’d have to disassemble the top rails of the case itself to remove the motherboard, which doesn’t have enough room to escape through the large side panel hole.</p><p>But it’s possible some of that will change before its Q3 launch; Framework stopped me before I could fully extract the board or remove the cooler to expose the Strix Halo chip, telling me that what I’d see underneath is not quite final.</p><p>Since yesterday morning’s announcement, I’ve already seen a bunch of reasonable people questioning whether this desktop makes sense — is it truly a modular desktop with no upgradable socketed CPUs, GPUs, or memory? — and noting how unusual it is for Framework to dive into a category it can’t necessarily improve.</p><p>But the more I think about it, the more I wonder if single-board computing might genuinely be a new direction for mini desktops. They’ve largely been at the mercy of the vestigial ATX motherboard spec for a long time, a spec that’s long assumed you’ll plug your memory modules and graphics cards at a 90-degree angle to your motherboard, sticking out perpendicularly, which limits the sizes and shapes of upgradable mini PC designs.</p><p>With Framework’s laptops, the reason they’re so <em>easily</em> upgradable is that Framework builds an entire computer on a swappable board, right down to the USB-C ports, save for the <em>other</em> components you might like to easily upgrade (storage, memory, and Wi-Fi / Bluetooth radios). This is only one component (memory) different from that, and maybe <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/7/24173813/this-is-what-a-desktop-motherboard-with-camm2-memory-modules-looks-like">flat-mount CAMM memory</a> can change that in future designs.</p><p>Maybe Framework can help unlock more new sizes and shapes of mini PCs, especially if others follow its lead, which feels more likely now that it’s iterating on an existing standard desktop motherboard spacing pattern, rather than boards designed to fit specific Framework laptops. Maybe Intel, Nvidia, and Qualcomm might like to get in on single-board mini PCs that’d fit such computers, too.</p><p>Even if not, AMD seems potentially interested in doing more. At CES, I asked AMD chief gaming solutions architect Frank Azor if Strix Halo was a one-off, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/14/17346234/intel-nuc-8-pc-gaming-amd-vega-review">like the unusual Intel chip with AMD graphics that also once powered a tiny gaming PC</a>, or if it’s a new category that’ll stick around. He said he couldn’t announce any new products but noted that it was extremely expensive to build this new “Halo” tier. The hope is that it’ll create a new category by enabling laptops and ultra small form factor PCs to do things they couldn’t do before.</p><p>I also asked Azor if Strix Halo was cost-effective; specifically, if manufacturers can build systems with a single Strix Halo instead of a similarly performing discrete CPU and discrete GPU without paying more. He said yes, they could, and get the benefits of AMD’s fast unified memory as well.</p><p>I will note, though, that Framework did not promise that the Framework Desktop would have future revisions or boards available. And there’s no mention of upgradability on its product page. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/23/24138475/framework-laptop-product-categories-new">While Framework CEO Nirav Patel told me last April</a> that every new product is the “first stake in the ground” for a new category, and that they won’t be one-offs, it’s a bit murkier whether we’ll see future Framework Desktop boards than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619586/framework-laptop-16-update-one-key-but-not-done">whether the Framework Laptop 16 will get future GPU upgrades</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/how-long-is-monster-hunter-wilds<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It is finally time for Monster Hunter Wilds as it makes its way to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. The next entry in the long-running beast-battling action series from Capcom follows in the large footprints of its predecessor Monster Hunter World and its generous Iceborne expansion. But just how long is it? Here we’ll let you know exactly how many hours it took different members of the IGN team to finish the main story, what they prioritised doing with their time, and how much they’ve put into the postgame.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><u><strong>Tom Marks - Executive Reviews Editor, Games</strong></u></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">I took just under <strong>15 hours</strong> to reach the credits in Monster Hunter Wilds’ campaign - and that’s the actual end of the story, unlike the first credit roll in Monster Hunter Rise, which comes at barely the halfway point of the larger plot. That said, finishing the campaign here only marks the end of Low Rank, with High Rank after it offering plenty of side quests and greater challenges to tackle, so you’re far from done at that point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It took me <strong>another 15 hours</strong> to finish nearly all of those quests and get to what should be considered the proper endgame. That meant I had fought all the monsters there are to fight, unlocked all the systems and crafting you are ultimately given access to at launch, and been introduced to the custom Artian weapon system that’s meant to keep you busy from there. Because of Wilds’ streamlined grind, I only needed another five hours to feel like I had reached the peak of the weapons and armor set I wanted, though there is of course plenty more to strive for across other weapon types and the like.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><u><strong>Casey DeFreitas - Deputy Editor, Guides</strong></u></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">I beat the final "story" mission of Monster Hunter Wilds in High Rank at around <strong>40 hours</strong>, about <strong>22 hours after I saw the credits after "low rank."</strong> It's a bit difficult to be 100% accurate though, as I spent quite a bit of time idling in menus for guide purposes. I didn't really engage in any of the more intricate systems of Monster Hunter Wilds during the "Low Rank" portion of the game. I crafted what I could with what I had and carried on, not bothering to repeat hunts. I pretty much did the same for High Rank, but this time I strayed from the Story Missions to tackle new optional monsters and do more hunts with friends, which you kind of need to do anyway to keep unlocking Story Missions. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, I made it to the final mission only specifically going out of my way to upgrade my weapon one time by hunting an extra Ajarakan. Otherwise, I made what I could and beelined it to the end. Not that that's how I wanted to play. If I had time, I probably would have had closer to 60 hours at the finish line, as I would have liked to make a better, more efficient armor and weapon set besides the hodgepodge I had cobbled together.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, I still have some endemic life-catching and fishing to do, and I have six monster-hunting Side Missions left that I unlocked after the second to last Story Mission. I likely have at least one additional optional quest to unlock, too. But I certainly won't stop there. I want to farm a few particular monsters to upgrade a few Talisman, make some different armor, and try my hand with RNG to see what cool Artian weapons I can make! I'm sure I'll spend time just leisurely replaying through the story with friends while learning a new weapon, too, so I have plenty more I'm excited to do in Monster Hunter Wilds. Not to mention event quests starting next week and the title updates with new monsters coming throughout the year.</p><div id="the-10-best-monster-hunter-games" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">The 10 Best Monster Hunter Games</h3><h3>The 10 Best Monster Hunter Games</h3></p></div><h2 data-cy="title2"><u><strong>Simon Cardy - Senior Editorial Producer</strong></u></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It took <strong>just under 16 hours</strong> to finish Monster Hunter Wilds’ main story, a runtime that surprised me, as I made it 25 hours into World’s campaign without seeing the end in sight. Somewhat of a MH novice myself, I was also struck by just how easygoing I was finding a lot of its battles, too. I did faint once or twice when it came to some of Wilds’ showpiece apex predators, but on the whole, I found it a fairly breezy adventure. The streamlining to accommodate relative newcomers like me to the series definitely has an impact on this, with elemental strengths and weaknesses, the requirement to craft and tailor loadouts for specific fights, and any real extensive tracking and hunting, all scaled back. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But, perhaps the biggest impact on the runtime is the consistent story cutscene/monster battles cadence that pretty much continues all the way until the credits. It feels less like a pure Monster Hunter experience at times, and more like Capcom welcoming in one-too-many Western cinematic story-driven development influences into its walls. On the one hand, I appreciated it, as I could swiftly reach the conclusion of its (albeit not entirely original) initial story, but do wonder if it leaves too much of what has made Monster Hunter beloved by fans on the cutting room floor until the post-game hits. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><u><strong>Jada Griffin - Community Lead</strong></u></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It took me about <strong>20 hours</strong> to reach the initial credits for Monster Hunter Wilds and while most of that time was spent tackling all the optional and side quests available to me another smaller chunk was spent just vibing in the world of Wilds. I spent time exploring all the little paths littered around the map, hunting down various endemic life (bugs, birds, etc), customizing my radial menus, shouts and finding the most optimal locations for my pop-up camps (there are some really cool ones hidden in various caves).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That being said, it only took me <strong>15 hours to complete all the High-rank missions</strong> and side quests and see all the monsters held for after the credits. As of now, I've spent nearly 70 hours overall doing other things just for fun in the post-credits like hunting monsters with friends for fun, decoration farming, and doing a bit of some semi-serious hunting for monster crowns which are awarded for finding and successfully hunting the largest and smallest versions of each monster. I’ve had a great time with it so far but I am very much looking forward to when Wilds adds more monsters to its roster in future title updates.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><u><strong>Ronny Barrier - Producer, Guides</strong></u></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">I saw the first credits in Monster Hunter Wilds after about <strong>20 hours</strong>. I mostly mainlined the story, with just a few pit stops to grind out one or two armor sets since they looked cool. I also tried to use a variety of weapons (Switch Axe rocks, by the way), so it took a bit longer than it would have if I just stuck with my faithful sword and shield.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s still plenty more to do, and since <strong>I’m currently sitting at 65 hours</strong>, I wouldn’t consider those credits the real ending, even if that’s a turning point for the story. There’s plenty more to hunt, new monsters to see, and new hats to craft. If anything, the story seems to be a bit of an extended tutorial, which I’m totally okay with. I still get to find and battle more monsters, after all. Except Congalala. Would prefer to never see him again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editorial Producer who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

It's a blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment, but this rooster looks ready to throw down. Good luck trying to kick this feathery fiend.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7r1t_oDC7z8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="985">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7r1t_oDC7z8?start=985" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Chickens have a long history in Fable, as way back in the original game, you could win a special hat in a chicken-kicking competition. In Fable 2, you could earn two chicken-related titles for kicking the birds a respectable distance, and Fable 3 had a chicken-themed suit that you could unlock and even a chance to earn some coin by gambling on chicken races.</p><p>Interestingly, this isn't the first time that the Fable games have toyed with the idea of rebellious poultry, as <a href="https://youtu.be/PgigSpd8N1k" rel="nofollow ">Fable 3 introduced a renegade chicken in its opening cinematic</a>. That chicken would make a bid for freedom, successfully outrunning soldiers for a while, but it met its end when it ran into a castle and a chef took aim at it with a shotgun. There is a theory that it might have survived, as you can spot a black chicken near the castle kitchen when you visit it, so maybe this new nemesis is related to the Fable 3 rebel.</p><p>Originally scheduled to arrive in 2025, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fable-delayed-to-2026/1100-6529698/">Fable has been delayed to 2026</a>. "We previously announced the date for Fable as 2025; we are actually going to give Fable more time and it's going to ship in 2026 now," head of Xbox Games Studios Craig Duncan explained on the official Xbox podcast. "While I know that's not maybe the news people want to hear, what I want to assure people of is that it's definitely worth the wait."</p><p>Fable is set to be released on PC and Xbox Series X|S, but one prominent leaker has suggested <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fable-delay-into-2026-could-allow-it-to-release-on-ps5-at-launch-leaker-suggests/1100-6529719/">that the delay may allow it to arrive on launch day on PS5</a> as well.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/wheel-world-demo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’m a fan of <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/bikes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bike games</a>, especially these days when I'm woefully short on time to ride. I’m not a fan of doing bike maintenance tasks, which is one of the prices you pay for liking to ride bikes. Upcoming game <em>Wheel World</em> not only makes bike tinkering easier, and more fun, than it is in real life, but scratches the riding itch my hectic schedule and a flat tire have kept me from.</p><p><a href="https://annapurnainteractive.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Wheel World</em></a> (nee <a href="https://gamerant.com/ghost-bike-rename-wheel-world-change-why-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Ghost Bike</em></a>)<em> </em>has a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1497460/Wheel_World/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demo</a> out now as part of Steam Next Fest. It’s a brief slice of the game, in which you wake up on a mysterious island and have to help a skull spirit recreate the connection between worlds. You do this by activating shrines charmingly shaped like bike bells, collecting bike parts, and levelling up your character through bike races or taking simple jumps.</p><p>Some of the game’s slangy dialogue is a bit cringe, the way <a href="https://screenrant.com/riders-republic-good-bad-dialog-fun-annoying/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">extreme sports games</a> can sometimes be, but the game itself does away with the flash and tryhard of those games in favor of focusing more on just riding your bike around. The world is stylized and colorful, with wide open roads that let you play with exploration and momentum rather than technical tricks. Your bike makes wonderful mechanical sounds as you roam around, reminding me of the sound design of games like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/711540/Lonely_Mountains_Downhill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Lonely Mountains: Downhill</em></a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/695330/SEASON_A_letter_to_the_future/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Season</em></a>. To activate the first bell shrine, you have to bike up a hill (booo), where you encounter a bike gang blocking the way and have to challenge them to a race. Racing in the demo felt pleasantly simple, with the biggest challenge being drafting--following along in another rider's wake--to earn speed boosts. In real life, the <a href="https://x.com/rcmacleod/status/1664998270320492545" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one bike race</a> I competed in was a terrifying blur of shouting and crashes that encouraged me to stay as far away from other cyclists as possible, so it was fun to experiment with the opposite here.</p><figure><figcaption>Messhof</figcaption></figure><p>Winning races or completing their optional side challenges levels you up in the form of reputation points, and can earn you bike parts, which you can also find scattered around the world. The new wheels, saddles, drivetrains, and frames you find can boost your bike’s speed, handling, and other attributes, and they also change the look of your bike. In the game’s trailer, this can lead to an unholy mashup of a bike, and I think it will be a lot of fun to balance functionality with creating the monster bike of my dreams in the full game.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="WHEEL WORLD | Gameplay Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JmL15GGO1SA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>In real life, I’ve got a flat on my daily bike right now, which I got literally <em>just</em> as I arrived at Nathan’s <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Stream-Big/Nathan-Grayson/9781982156763" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">book</a> launch party a few weekends ago. While bike shops make fixing flats look easy, I am abysmal at this most basic of tasks. (I’m especially bad at it on my bikepacking bike, which has tubeless-ready tires that are impossible to get off.) To encourage myself to do this little chore, I’ve positioned my bike so that it blocks the doorway to my bedroom, thinking it would force me to pull out my levers and pump. Instead, I just think “I really should fix that” and squeeze by every time I need to change my socks or go to bed.</p><p>But playing the <em>Wheel World</em> demo has reminded me of how lovely it is to just bike around, following where roads go and enjoying meandering rather than thinking about speed or challenging terrain. While I wish fixing my flat in real life were as simple as selecting a wheel from <em>Wheel World</em>’s menu, it’s also not nearly as hard as I think if I have a little patience and confidence. By the time you read this, hopefully I’ll be back out on the road (maybe this time with an actual patch kit in my bag), which should tide me over until <em>Wheel World</em> comes out this summer.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/avowed-decision-choices-story-im-so-sorry-everybody"><h3>Every Decision You Make In Avowed Is Terrible</h3></a><p>The road to hell is paved with good intentions</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/warner-bros-discovery-games-wonder-woman-monolith-shut-down"><h3>Fuck WB</h3></a><p>Another all-time great studio sacrificed at the altar of Line Go Up</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>While I probably don’t look like it, I am a massive fan of golf games. Maybe it’s because I’m useless at golf in real life, but I’ve been sinking birdies and the occasional eagle for years – and once upon a time, even a hole in one! 2K and HB Studios returning with another entry in their golf series is a welcome sight to behold, especially as PGA Tour 2K25 is an all-round improvement on the last.</p>
<p><iframe title="Next Round, Best Round I PGA TOUR 2K25 Official Announce Trailer I 2K" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X7TlP1WBr50?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The two year gap that this series maintains has paid off once again. Everything looks better; the character models, the course, even the balls look good! The polish doesn’t end there, however. Gameplay overall feels that little bit smoother and with three different types of swing options, the sky’s the limit.</p>


<p>The swing system once again comes in multiple flavours, with the new EvoSwing providing a very realistic feel to smacking your balls<em> [Phrasing? – Ed]</em>. EvoSwing uses your own rhythm and dexterity to better simulate the feeling of swinging a golf club when using Swing Stick, which is neat. For a more laid back experience, you can opt for the new Perfect Swing difficulty setting, which reduces the material impact of external factors on your swing, allowing newer players to get used to the mechanics of golfing without worrying about all the complex stuff.&nbsp;If all else fails, you can revert back to my favourite, the 3-Click Swing. There’s options for all players, which is great.</p>


<p>I got a tad frustrated with chip shots which often felt a little weird trying to get the ball on the green. I have fond memories of being able to chip the ball and getting it real close to the hole in previous game, but I struggled to get this right in 2K25. I’m not going to blame the game here as this is likely user error on my part, but something definitely feels different with it that I’ve yet to master.</p>
<p>That being said, being able to change your tee position, which doesn’t seem like a big deal, (but was a major annoyance in 2K23), combined with the ability of now being able to choose your hazard drop shot, gives you a level of control you didn’t have before.</p>
<p>The first port of call for almost all players will be MyCareer. One thing I really appreciate is a game that respects my time, and 2K25 absolutely does that, letting you choose how much of each course you want to play. If you only have time for a quick blast, you can play just 6 holes of an 18 hole course and let the sim do the rest. Even the simming can be balanced how you want, with the AI version of your player being as good or as bad as you want them to be.</p>
<p>The goal in MyCareer is, of course, to compete for points in tournaments, trying hard to qualify for the FedExCup. Instead of just dropping you off at each holes, before each event, you can partake in training and minigames as a way to earn stat buffs and get the lay of the land. Earning stat buffs is crucial for later in the game, as that extra few meters on a drive will come in handy when you need to get closer to the hole. It’s easy to dismiss this as simple padding, but there’s a rhyme and reason for it.</p>

<p>MyCareer and the building of MyPlayer feels a bit more of an RPG this time around. You can unlock specific shots in the skill tree, as well as stats buffs for helping with your shots. There are six trees in total, and I went for the Powerhouse character, focusing on smashing the ball as far down the fairway as I could.</p>
<p>In addition to levelling up your player, you can also level up your clubs using tokens to enhance stats in certain areas, before using EvoTools to unlock a higher potential, shaping&nbsp; your equipment to match and enhance your style of play.</p>
<p>There’s also a popularity mechanic which is nothing new, but adds a little flavour to the overall experience. Off the course, you can spend time influencing fans during interviews, with your answers coming across as bold or subdued. It’s like the paragon or renegade sliders from Mass Effect, just without a meaningful effect. Yes, the number on screen was going up over time and I gained more social media followers, but this really didn’t have a massive impact on anything on the course, so I failed to see the benefit of engaging with the system too much. It could have tied in with the sponsorships system, but really the game just boils down to playing good golf to get branding and unlock cosmetics.</p>
<p>The rivals feature still feels a little lacklustre. I got to the end of a tournament and the game told me I’d beaten my rival. I didn’t even know I had one! All I did was score better than him. If they just made a bit more of a fuss about the rivalries and gave some sort of payoff for beating a difficult opponent, I might be more invested. As it stands, this is a bit of a non-feature.</p>

<p>Outside of MyCareer, the online modes from 2K23 have returned. Naturally, I’m a fan of Divot Derby, which is a fast and chaotic mode in which up to 20 players tee off at the same time and race to the hole in a unique golf ‘battle-royale’ style jamboree of madness. In short, it’s a lot of fun. Topgolf is also back again and is an arcade-style game mode in which you’ll take aim at a series of targets and attempt to score as many points as you can. It was introduced last year and was super popular so it naturally deserved a returning spot.</p>
<p>Ranked Tours is a new feature for 2K25 which contains daily and weekly seasonal events and follows the PGA schedule while the real PGA TOUR season is in full swing which is pretty cool.</p>
<p>If you’re feeling creative, you can once again create your own course and share them for the world to see. It’s always good to see everyones creations and attempt to become the master of each hole.</p>

<p>The Clubhouse Pass is back but this time <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/18/2k-reveals-whats-waiting-in-pga-tour-2k25s-clubhouse-pass-seasons/">it doesn’t expire</a>, coming in line with a lot of other recent titles. There’s a free version and a Premium track but thankfully, that and the other microtransactions on offer are mostly cosmetic based. Of course you can spend real world bucks to upgrade your stats immediately, but you can do it almost as fast from simply playing the game, so it’s not too egregious bad. Also, the stats don’t have a patch on simply having skill in this game, when compared to the NBA 2K games where the stat buffs are really felt.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/valves-deckard-vr-headset-rumored-to-launch-in-late-2025-at-1200/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to a new rumor, Valve's Deckard Virtual Reality headset might be launching before the end of the year at a rather steep price. The info comes from Valve-focused insider and content creator Gabe Follower, who <a href="https://x.com/gabefollower/status/1894636466480771136" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a>:</p>
<p><em>Several people have confirmed that Valve is aiming to release new standalone, wireless VR headset (codename Deckard) by the end of 2025. The current price for the full bundle is set to be $1200. Including some "in-house" games (or demos) that are already done. Valve want to give the user the best possible experience without cutting any costs. Even at the current price, it will be sold at a loss. A few months ago, we saw leaked models of controllers (codename Roy) in the SteamVR update. It will be using the same SteamOS from Steam Deck, but adapted for virtual reality. One of the core features is the ability to play flat-screen game that are already playable on Steam Deck, but in VR on a big screen without a PC. The first behind closed doors presentations could start soon.</em></p>
<p>We last reported on the matter in September 2023, when an unannounced Valve-made hardware device was <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-possibly-prepping-for-a-new-vr-device-receives-certification-in-south-korea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">certified</a> in South Korea. Previously, in late 2022, Valve had kind of confirmed they were developing a new Virtual Reality headset via Product Designer Greg Coomer, who said at the time:</p>
<p><em>I can definitely say that we are continuing to develop VR headsets recently. Valve has a lot of expertise in VR devices and has faith in the medium and VR games. We hope to remain open on PC platforms rather than having VR games exclusively on a certain platform. While adhering to this belief, we are continuing development.</em></p>
<p>The Valve Index <a href="https://wccftech.com/full-valve-index-vr-kit-priced-e1079-out-on-june-28th/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched on the VR market in June 2019</a>, priced at $999 (€1079 in Europe). For a while, it was the most advanced VR headset available, and Valve also bundled it with Half-Life: Alyx. The game won several awards for its quality. Even so, sale volumes remained niche.</p>
<p>Shortly after the release of the Index, Valve founder Gabe Newell <a href="https://wccftech.com/gabe-newell-talks-untethered-valve-index-vr-teases-half-life-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talked</a> about an untethered VR headset, admitting that the company was looking into ways to do that. Based on the leaks and rumors, Deckard should definitely deliver on that front with a fully wireless standalone headset. The rumored $1200 pricing is also pretty much the same as the Index when aligned for inflation. It appears that Valve is once again aiming for the smaller high-end segment rather than going for a broader market, as Meta has attempted to do with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/meta-quest-3-unveiled-days-before-the-apple-ar-headset-out-this-fall-for-499/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quest 3</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/meta-quest-3s-unveiled-out-on-october-15-for-299/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quest 3S</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/quantic-dream-unaffected-netease-layoffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Star Wars Eclipse&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Detroit: Become Human&nbsp;</em>developer Quantic Dream has confirmed that it is safe from layoffs and project cancellations put into effect recently across NetEase-funded studios.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/defondaumiere_quantic-dream-jobs-activity-7300062734602100737-dpnq/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on LinkedIn, Quantic Dream CEO&nbsp;Guillaume de Fondaumière says the studio is "unaffected" by the cuts, and that development on Quantic Dream's ongoing projects continues "at full pace", although he doesn't provide updates for specific projects (sorry,&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Eclipse&nbsp;</em>hopefuls).</p>

<p>The CEO says that his studio "remains committed to the strategy outlined by David [Cage] and [de Fondaumière] in 2019", when NetEase <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/quantic-dream-will-now-develop-for-all-platforms-after-netease-buys-minority-stake" rel="nofollow">first acquired a minority stake</a> in the studio. He says that NetEase's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/quantic-dream-acquired-by-netease" rel="nofollow">acquisition</a> of Quantic Dream in 2022 fit with the companies' "shared vision for the future".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/quantic-dream-netease-detroit-become-human.jpg?itok=l0h5DF9A 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/quantic-dream-netease-detroit-become-human.jpg?itok=AUNdZ3fu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Quantic Dream says it's safe from NetEase cuts and layoffs.</figcaption></figure><p>To close his post, de Fondaumière points to&nbsp;<em>Detroit: Become Human</em>, which reached 11 million sales last year, "demonstrating the lasting appeal and quality of [the studio's] titles".</p>

<p>He ends by saying that Quantic Dream's current projects are "progressing as planned" and that the studio is "fully committed to delivering and launching these innovative, high-quality titles in the future".</p>

<p>For context, studios funded by NetEase have been suffering layoffs and project cancellations, as well as outright closures, in recent months. Developers like BioWare vet Mac Walters' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/worlds-untold-netease-pause-shutdown" rel="nofollow">Worlds Untold</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Just Cause&nbsp;</em>creator Christofer Sundberg's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/liquid-swords-layoffs-just-cause-creator" rel="nofollow">Liquid Swords</a>&nbsp;have announced layoffs before even releasing their first games.</p>

<p>It's not just studios yet to release their games or underperforming studios, either. In a shock move, NetEase also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">closed the Seattle studio</a> responsible for developing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-40m" rel="nofollow">global hit</a>&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>, laying off the studio's entire staff contingent in the process.</p>

Some, like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/blood-of-dawnwalker-ex-witcher-devs" rel="nofollow">The Blood of Dawnwalker</a>&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/witcher-3-game-director-starts-rebel-wolves" rel="nofollow">Rebel Wolves</a>, say that they're also safe from NetEase's cuts, although for how long is another matter entirely.</p>

<p>As for what's next for Quantic Dream, the studio is currently working on narrative adventure&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Eclipse</em>, although the game doesn't even have a tentative release window yet. Stay tuned for more.</p>

"There are too many games," is a phrase often heard from people who wish to rustle the jimmies of leftists who contend that overabundance and scarcity are market constructs. It's not something you'll hear from me, but I do think there are quite a lot of <em>one</em> type of game, a game that spawns incessantly within the corrupted magic circle of my inbox, as though I were playing out a scripted last stand against insurmountable odds. That game is the roguelike deckbuilder. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Once upon a time, I thought "roguelike deckbuilder" had a certain robust poetry to it. Now, the syllables strike my ears like the banging of icebergs against a foundering hull. Each new arrival harrows with the thought of a hundred deaths, a hundred unlocks, a hundred fresh descents, all of it spiked with this season's flavour of supporting fiction or subgenre - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phnUHcP6oXk">what's for tea, Mother? Soulslikes on toast?</a></p>
<p>I do still enjoy these games, especially the ones that genuinely have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cobalt-core-review">some kind of imaginative twist</a>, and I mean no offence to their creators, but I've run out of ways to distinguish them using the puny English language. So I'm glad that Rogue Light Deck Builder is here to hold up a mirror to my aggravation.

In Rogue Light Deck Builder, you hammer together a wooden balcony in the flickering glow of a dodgy bulb. A joke like that probably doesn't need a whole game to deliver it, but the Steam demo amused me regardless. Here's how it works: you line up a nail with your floating hand cursor, and smash it in by yanking your mouse around as though trying to free it from the mouth of a resentful dog. The hammer connects with a rubbery animal squeak. It vaguely sounds as though you're crucifying Pikachu. 
</p>
<p>
In a nice send-up of Borderlandsy RPGs with their geysers of damage numerals, words such as "perfect" and "OK" flop out on impact and settle squidgily on the boards like condemned sausages, to be absently brushed around as you thwack in nails. There are also bugs you can splat, and special nails with clover stems that (I think) bestow bonus earnings. Much of the time, of course, you'll clobber your own hand, which deducts an "Ouch" from the invoice emerging from a printing calculator in top left.
</p>
<p>
You are doing all this at the behest of your "husband", a molten <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> cadaver seated behind a marble desk. He has upgrades to sell, including more resilient hands, more accurate hammers, and slightly less dodgy bulbs. Each time you exit the store the deck needs to be built again. Beyond it sways a suffocating horizon of cyanotype foliage. The priciest unlock is a key that costs one million dollars and is labelled "escape".
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3149370/ROGUE_LIGHT_DECK_BUILDER/">Try it for yourself here.</a> The full game is out 17th March. Sorry for moaning about roguelike deckbuilders, developers! It's partly that I seldom have time to dig into each one and work out what sets it apart. When all you have is the hammer of overwhelm, everything starts to look like the nail of diminishing returns.

This time around, instead of running a hospital or building a profitable college, you are tasked with building and maintaining a successful museum. Doing so is tricky, but in a perfectly irresistible way that has sucked hours of my life away in a blink of an eye. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195579" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Narrative Adventure About Doomed Teenage Dinosaurs Feels Too Real" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="178" data-playlist="195579,196411,195891" data-current="195579"><div><p>This Narrative Adventure About Doomed Teenage Dinosaurs Feels Too Real</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21074.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Two Point Museum</em>, like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/two-point-hospital&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/two-point-hospital"><em>Two Point Hospital</em></a></span><em> </em>and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/two-point-campus-hospital-game-pass-review-pc-sim-1849397889&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/two-point-campus-hospital-game-pass-review-pc-sim-1849397889"><em>Two Point Campus</em></a></span>,  shares a lot of its DNA with the old ‘90s PC tycoon games. Stuff like <em>Roller Coaster Tycoon, Theme Hospital, </em>and <em>Zoo Tycoon</em>. These games might contain loads of jokes and wacky, ridiculous situations (for example, in <em>Museum </em>you have to manage ghosts and keep cavemen frozen or they wake up and go wild) but buried beneath all that silliness are real numbers, systems, and things to manage. And <em>Two Point Museum</em> nails this key part of the genre.</p><p>The basic loop of <em>Two Point Museum</em> and its various maps is this: You show up and are put in charge of a failing or unfinished museum. Then you use resources like money to build the place up while you send your staff—who you must hire, manage and take care of—off into various parts of the world to bring back artifacts, fossils, living creatures, historical items, and more nifty stuff that you can put in your museum. </p><p>The idea is to bring in more guests using the lure of more cool shit you’ve gathered from around the world and then build walls and displays that funnel those guests into gift shops where they spend the money you use to keep growing and growing the museum. Repeat until you’ve created the ultimate museum. </p><p> I do wish <em>Two Point Museum</em> aimed its dry, satirical British wit at the practice of stealing artifacts from other cultures and displaying them in places far away from the people who rightfully own said items. That kind of barbed social commentary is something I loved about <em>Two Point Hospital</em>, whose humor was directly aimed at satirizing profit-driven hospitals and did a great job at it. In <em>Two Point Museum</em>, however, nobody jokes about where the stuff you’re displaying actually belongs, and it feels like a missed opportunity. </p><h2 id="h327388"><a id=""></a>Perfectly managing controlled chaos</h2><p>Regardless, pulling off the perfect museum (one that is profitable, pretty, and informative) is much harder than you might think as <em>Two Point Museum</em> loves to throw curveballs at you. </p><p> You might send some staff out on an expedition to collect fossils and one of them gets injured and needs to be healed. And perhaps that injured employee was your one expert on fossils, who you needed to clean and maintain the exhibits. Now all your stuff is getting dusty, attendance is down, and you’re losing money. This kind of thing happens a lot in<em> Two Point Museum. </em></p><p>Thankfully, the menus, UI, and controls in <em>Two Point Museum</em> are wonderfully designed and extremely easy to use. So managing all the tiny disasters, mistakes, and chaos doesn’t feel like tedious work, but is instead a ton of fun. </p><p>It’s very nice to hit two buttons and raise all your staff’s pay (and make them all much happier in the process), especially when you’re trying to avoid having some of them quit on you right as you’re dealing with an increase in mole people drilling into your museum to steal your exhibits. (Luckily my guards with pepper grinders saved the day. Did I mention <em>Two Point Museum </em>is wacky?) </p><figure id="" data-id="3b445d81f252986e83f2fee8dbf783df" data-recommend-id="image://3b445d81f252986e83f2fee8dbf783df" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Two Point Studios / Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3b445d81f252986e83f2fee8dbf783df" data-recommend-id="image://3b445d81f252986e83f2fee8dbf783df" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The great UI and controls also make decorating and tinkering with your different museums a joyous activity. I spent many, many hours in <em>Two Point Museum</em> building elaborate exhibits using decorations, props, and other cosmetic items. I also greatly enjoyed setting up barriers, ropes, and walls to block guests from areas or corral them into certain parts of the museum. It’s not just a power trip, either. It’s very creatively satisfying to build the perfect themed section of your museum.  </p><p>And doing so rewarded me with happier guests who learned more about the items and (importantly) donated more money to the museum as well. </p><h2 id="h327389"><a id=""></a>Too Much <em>Two Point Museum </em></h2><p>My only big complaint against <em>Two Point Museum</em> is that it almost feels too big at times. You don’t just build museums in this game, but also aquariums and ghost hotels, too. (It’s weird.) All of this is fun, and mixing the different types of exhibits together into one cohesive museum is challenging but rewarding.</p><p>However, it’s a lot of stuff to pile onto a full biz sim management game that also features staff upgrades, research rewards, crafting, and exploration. Now you have to deal with living creatures, escaping ghosts, and unlocking new spots on three expedition maps, too. It’s a lot, and while it never ruined my experience it does feel excessive. </p><p>It also made me wonder what a full <em>Two Point </em>game based on aquariums would look like, instead of them basically being crammed into this already great and involved museum-focused sequel. Perhaps later <em>Museum </em>expansions will build out these other parts of the game and make them feel more fleshed out and developed. For now though, <em>Two Point Museum</em> seems like it contains <em>a bit </em>too much, like an extra layer of frosting on an already sweet desert.</p><p>Still, <em>Two Point Museum </em>being a bit overstuffed isn’t a deal breaker at all for me. I highly recommend that folks who loved the past <em>Two Point</em> games or older ‘90s-era tycoon sims check out <em>Two Point Museum </em>when it arrives on PC, Xbox, and PS5 on March 4. </p><p> .</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A colony ship of human survivors has narrowly escaped a devastating intergalactic war—only to crash land on the hostile planet of Mira. Customize your main character—including their features, clothes and hair—and follow the story of these survivors as you fight to carve out a future for humanity on this mysterious, dangerous world.</p><p>Originally released in 2015 as <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em> for the <a title="Platforms > Wii U [1,550 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/wii-u">Wii U</a> system, this updated version of the game includes enhanced visuals and more, such as:</p><ul><li><strong>Exploration</strong> – Mira is a sprawling world with five massive continents, each with its own distinct biomes, weather and diverse array of organisms. You can move seamlessly between these continents, travelling to any location or point of interest you like. Of course, the journey won’t be without its dangers, so prepare accordingly.</li><li><strong>New Los Angeles</strong> – Your new home and one of the last bastions of humanity. New Los Angeles (NLA) is the center of human activity on Mira. In this large city, the survivors of the wrecked USS White Whale live their lives. NLA is divided into districts—including commercial, industrial, BLADE and residential—where you can take in the sights, interact with allies and residents, purchase new weapons and gear, and much more.</li><li><strong>Battle System</strong> – <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</em> features a fast-paced, <a title="Genres > Action [2,520 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>-packed battle system. While in combat, you can freely move around to gain a tactical advantage and employ a variety of customizable special attacks and skills called Arts. These Arts will vary based on the Class of each character. Fight, gain experience and take down enemies of all shapes and sizes—you may even cross paths with some particularly nasty (and enormous!) foes.</li><li><strong>Missions</strong> – Early on, you’ll join the Builders of the Legacy After the Destruction of Earth (BLADE) organization to assist the residents of NLA and Earth’s survivors. Throughout the game, you’ll help with various requests given to you by characters you encounter as well as by BLADE itself. These missions will further the story, strengthen your affinity with your party members, confer various rewards and more.</li><li><strong>Skells</strong> – Skells are powerful armored vehicles developed by humanity that can fly, transform into a vehicle and wield immense strength in battle. Once you prove yourself to the BLADE organization, you’ll unlock the ability to pilot your own Skell. There are multiple Skells that can be obtained, each with different characteristics and customizable to suit your combat style.</li><li><strong>Online Features</strong> – Join a squad of up to 31 other players online* and work together to complete tasks such as collecting a certain number of items or felling specific enemies. Up to four squad members can also team up online and face off against powerful foes. You can even recruit the avatars of other players to your team in the main story.</li><li><strong>Uncover More Story Content</strong> – New <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,082 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>s await on Mira, featuring a new location to explore, new characters to encounter and newly added story content to experience that’s exclusive to <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</em>. The fight isn’t over yet—humanity still needs you!</li></ul><p>Players who purchase the digital version of <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</em> on Nintendo eShop or My Nintendo Store before April 6 will receive an in-game Exploration Support Package containing helpful items to jumpstart your adventure, such as credits, weapons, armor and more. Additionally, players who purchase the physical or digital versions of the game from GameStop will receive a code (available while supplies last) for the pack, redeemable on Nintendo eShop.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

But Fable coming to PS5 in the year after it launched on Xbox/PC is not speculation. Keep in mind that timeline was based on when Fable was slated for 2025 on Xbox/PC. With Fable now delayed to 2026, it stands to reason that it arriving on PS5/Xbox/PC on the same day is within the realm of possibility."</p><p>This would line up with Microsoft's current multiplatform strategy, as the company has announced several PS5 ports for high-profile games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forza-horizon-5-is-the-next-xbox-game-to-speed-onto-playstation-5/1100-6529156/" data-ref-id="1100-6529156">Forza Horizon 5</a> and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. The big difference here is the potential day-and-date release on PS5 alongside the PC and Xbox versions, as Microsoft has so far favored a gap of several months between consoles, so as to give its Xbox hardware a window of exclusivity with new game releases. This rule isn't set in stone, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-release-in-may-with-giant-mech-and-cybernetic-dragon-vehicles/1100-6528975/" data-ref-id="1100-6528975">Doom: The Dark Ages has a multiplatform release date of May 15</a>.</p><p>While Fable won't be out this year, Microsoft still has an impressive lineup of games arriving in 2025. In addition to the aforementioned Doom: The Dark Ages in May, fans can also look forward to South of Midnight and The Outer Worlds 2, and right now, Avowed is also available to play on PC and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p>Like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-155" rel="nofollow">previous</a>&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-152" rel="nofollow">updates</a> before it, the star of the show when it comes to Update 1.56 is the cars, and this time around, you're getting an "elegant convertible", a multi-purpose truck, and an old reliable rally legend.</p>

<p>First up, it's the BMW Z4 3.0i '03, a convertible sports car that debuted back in 2002. You can see the competition version of this model in action at iconic racetracks like the legendary&nbsp;Nürburgring.</p>

<p>Of course, the new update also brings the usual slew of extras with it, including a new Cafe menu, new World Circuits events, and more track compatibility for&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>AI Sophy, so you can test your skills against it.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7</em>, it's...well, it's actually the eighth main installment in the <i>Gran Turismo&nbsp;</i>series thanks to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-sport-delisted" rel="nofollow">now-delisted</a>&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo Sport</em>.</p>

<p>Like its predecessors, the game is a sim-style racer that emphasizes verisimilitude. It offers the chance to drive a ton of real-world cars, including the ones listed above, as well as plenty of others from iconic real-world brands.</p>

            <p>The requirements for your PC to feast on the treefrogs of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater </a>tactical espionage <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> have been revealed. The minimum specs ask for a RTX 2060 Super, same as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-pc-performance-best-settings">The Great Troy Bake Off</a>. While this might sound like Delta is following the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones And The Great Circle</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> in requiring ray tracing, producer Noriaki Okamura <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-is-a-doggedly-faithful-remake-but-new-controls-have-new-consequences">told Eurogamer last year</a> that no ray tracing features are included - so the RTX requirement is likely down to Unreal 5's Lumen lighting tech (although that can <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/lumen-technical-details-in-unreal-engine">include ray tracing techniques</a> anyway.)</p>
<p>You can find the full requirements below and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2417610/METAL_GEAR_SOLID_D_SNAKE_EATER/">on Steam here</a>, in a notably less attractive font than classic Rock Paper Sans.</p>

<p>Did you know that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/two-point-museum">Two Point Museum</a> requires just 8 GB? It's not entirely fair to compare the two, I just wanted to marvel at that install size. As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-pc-requirements-revealed">Eurogamer note</a> that <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-system-requirements-are-here-and-its-yet-another-game-that-requires-an-rtx-graphics-card-and-tonnes-of-free-storage-to-play/">PC Gamer note</a> and RPS is now noting, Delta uses Unreal 5 instead of the studio's previous FOX engine, and Unreal 5's (usually optional) Lumen lighting requires an RTX 2000-series or later card if you want to use its hardware-based ray tracing effects. Eurogamer also note that the PC version includes the Snake vs Monkey minigame with Ape Escape characters, although the ancient Bomberman fan in me is a little jealous that that minigame is exclusive to Xbox.</p>

<p>According to a new leak, Pokemon TCG Pocket will feature a new Ranked Battles mode in March.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Pokemon TCG Pocket’s Ranked Battles mode news comes from popular leaker <a href="https://x.com/eb576dcfe/status/1894572652054155489" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pyoro</a> (via <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1894588040359625000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CentroLeaks</a>). Besides the mode releasing in March 2025, the leaker didn’t provide any more information. However, Pokemon Presents is all set to be hosted tomorrow, February 27, and players might hear more information about the new Ranked Battles mode and details about other Pokemon games then.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If Pokemon TCG Pocket receives a Ranked Battles mode, it will become the third battle game mode, after Versus and Solo. The developers could implement a rank system reminiscent of other online competitive titles with its reward tree. At the same time, the game would need competitive changes which balance gameplay. However, it is all just speculation at this point, and we will have to wait for an official announcement to know for sure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another TCG Pocket leak arrived today through CentroLeaks. This leak shed light on the upcoming booster pack <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-leak-triumphant-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Triumphant Light</a>, featuring an Arceus Ex card. The leaked pack will reportedly be released this week; learn more about it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-set-a2a-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Pokemon TCG Pocket card listings were recently&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-cards-are-being-listed-on-ebay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted on eBay</a>. Also, the game recently gave away&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-is-gifting-players-free-trade-tokens/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free trade tokens</a>&nbsp;after the community’s feedback on the restriction of the feature.

<p>Battlestate Games has adjusted pricing for Escape from Tarkov in LATAM regions to ‘balance things out’. To celebrate the new pricing structure, the team has published a small gift bundle that all users can take advantage of. It includes a full kit – a weapon, plate vest, headset, ammunition, and so on.</p>



<p>The downside is it’s only redeemable in PvP, so PvE players have once again missed out on this limited-time promotion.</p>



<hr>







<p>To get your hands on this latest Tarkov gift bundle, you’ll need to log into your account on <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">escapefromtarkov.com</a> and access your profile. From there, click on ‘Activate Promo Code’ and enter the following:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>TARKOVLATAM</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>This code will unlock the bundle instantly and it’ll be ready to collect when you next log in.</p>



<p>It includes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Mk 16 Assault Rifle</li>



<li>Takedown BP</li>



<li>STRIKE Helmet</li>



<li>Banshee Rig</li>



<li>ComTac IV Headset</li>



<li>3 x GEN M3 Magazines</li>



<li>100 x M856A1</li>



<li>Propital Injector</li>



<li>Condor Glasses</li>



<li>EXPS3 Optic</li>
</ul>



<p>That’s not all, though. Battlestate Games is running a Twitch Drops campaign from February 26 – March 1 for Escape from Tarkov, and from March 1 – March 3 for Tarkov Arena. </p>



<p>On social media, the team wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>LATAM regional pricing for Escape from Tarkov and Tarkov Arena is now in place! Prices for all digital products have been adjusted to match regional rates, enhancing the local accessibility of our games.</p>



<p>To celebrate the LATAM regional pricing, use the promo code in the launcher to receive in-game rewards: TARKOVLATAM.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Battlestate Games continues to evolve Escape from Tarkov, which was first released almost ten years ago (in beta). This year, big things are on the horizon, and the game moves ever closer to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-tarkov-1-0-being-released/">the fabled 1.0 version</a> that’ll be classed as a full graduation.</p>



<p>Are you still playing Tarkov or have you dropped off until <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-escape-from-tarkov-wipe/">the next wipe</a> arrives? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

a-game. Programmers, artists, designers, everyone. I don't know that I have ever worked with a team that cared more about making sure the end product was perfect," she said. "It was a dream come true. Wonder Woman had a dream team and they put their all into it. They made sure it had Wonder Woman and DC lore on every aspect of the game. It was a thrill and honor to work with them."</p><p>Simone said she understands there is a lot of "finger-pointing going on" now around why the game was canceled, but everyone she worked with at Monolith and WB was "enthusiastic and supportive."</p><p>Games, TV shows, movies, and all other types of media projects fall apart regularly, for any number of reasons, and the Wonder Woman game joins them.</p><p>"Sometimes, you give your all and it doesn't work out. But that was an amazing team and I can only hope they continue to make brilliant games. Someone is going to snap them all up and set a new industry standard, I know it," Simone said.</p><p>Monolith's Wonder Woman game was announced in 2021, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wonder-woman-game-has-reportedly-cost-warner-bros-100-million/1100-6529315/" data-ref-id="1100-6529315">more than $100 million was reportedly spent</a> on it prior to its cancellation. In confirming the game's cancellation and the closure of Monolith, management said the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-wonder-woman-game-canceled-multiple-studios-closed-report/1100-6529706/" data-ref-id="1100-6529706">did not align with WB's new strategic pursuits</a>, despite projects in the DC franchise being one of WB's four core pillars going forward for games.</p><p>WB management said it will focus on four major franchises: Harry Potter, Mortal Kombat, DC, and Game of Thrones. As part of this new strategy of focusing on only the biggest franchises, WB is producing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/making-a-hogwarts-legacy-sequel-is-one-of-warner-bros-biggest-priorities/1100-6526285/" data-ref-id="1100-6526285">Hogwarts Legacy sequel</a>, while WB Games Montreal is said to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-batman-and-game-of-thrones-games-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6529314/" data-ref-id="1100-6529314">pitching a new Game of Thrones title</a>. Rocksteady, meanwhile, may be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-batman-and-game-of-thrones-games-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6529314/" data-ref-id="1100-6529314">plotting a new single-player Batman game</a>. As for DC, studio boss James Gunn recently said some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-dc-universe-game-wont-be-revealed-soon-but-some-really-interesting-projects-are-coming/1100-6529678/" data-ref-id="1100-6529678">"really interesting" projects are coming in the gaming space, but not soon.</a> As for the Mortal Kombat series, NetherRealm has not announced any new games, but it's expected the studio will continue the franchise with a new installment at some point.</p><p>In addition to the cancellation of Wonder Woman and closure of Monolith, WB is shuttering MultiVersus studio Player First Games and WB San Diego. MultiVersus is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/multiversus-shuts-down-in-may-but-can-still-be-played-offline-if-you-update-in-time/1100-6529169/" data-ref-id="1100-6529169">shutting down this May. </a></p><p>Warner Bros. Games' longtime boss, David Haddad, announced in January that he's leaving the company but will stay on for the next three months to help oversee the transition to a new leader. No such executive has been named yet for Haddad's replacement.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/quantic-dream-reassures-fans-after-netease-upheaval/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-ceo-reportedly-cutting-funding-for-a-dozen-games-wont-support-marketing-for-nagoshis-and-other-japanese-made-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the decision of NetEase CEO William Ding</a>&nbsp;to pull out of several investments made across North America, Europe, and Japan, Quantic Dream fans were fearful about the studio's prospects. After all, the Paris-based developer was <a href="https://wccftech.com/quantic-dream-has-been-acquired-by-netease-games-for-100-million-euros/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> for €100 million in February 2023. However, CEO and Head of Publishing Guillaume de Fondaumière reassured them with a lengthy post <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7300062734602100737/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared on LinkedIn</a>: the studio is unaffected.</p>
<p><em>We were deeply saddened to learn about the recent layoffs and studio closures affecting some of the NetEase group’s divisions. Our thoughts are with everyone impacted, and we sincerely hope that they quickly find new opportunities.</em></p>
<p><em>David Cage and I would like to express our gratitude to the fans and friends who have reached out to us in recent days regarding QUANTIC DREAM. We want to reassure everyone that our studios in Paris and Montreal remain unaffected. We are continuing to develop our projects at full pace, with several open positions available in both locations (please visit https://lnkd.in/e_AJFbUa for more details).</em></p>
<p><em>Founded 28 years ago, QUANTIC DREAM remains committed to the strategy outlined by David and I in 2019, when NetEase initially acquired a minority stake in our company. Over the past six years, NetEase has been a dedicated partner, providing us with creative freedom and the financial resources necessary for our studio to grow and strive. In 2022, QUANTIC DREAM became a wholly owned subsidiary of NetEase, aligning with our shared vision for the future.</em></p>
<p><em>In 2024, we achieved the highest revenue in our history, driven by the exceptional performance of our back catalogue titles. Notably, Detroit: Become Human reached 11 million units in global sales across PlayStation and PC last year, a remarkable 2 million increase year-on-year, demonstrating the lasting appeal and quality of our titles. The developments of our current projects are progressing as planned, and we are fully committed to delivering and launching these innovative, high-quality titles in the future.</em></p>
<p>De Fondaumière's mention of multiple projects is interesting, as we only publicly know about Star Wars: Eclipse. Originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-eclipse-announced-by-quantic-dream-and-lucasfilm-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at The Game Awards 2021, the game is reportedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-eclipse-2026-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">targeting</a> a 2026 launch, although it could still be delayed further. Last we <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-eclipse-development-is-reportedly-simmering-reveals-quantic-dream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heard</a> from Quantic Dream, the development was 'simmering' in September 2023. We also know that it will retain the studio's classic branching narrative while greatly expanding the gameplay with more action elements than in previous titles made by the developer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathologic-3-quarantine-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Ice-Pick Lodge and publisher HypeTrain Digital have revealed the release date for upcoming not-quite-a-demo&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3: Quarantine</em>, a free-to-play prologue that will introduce the world of the game.</p>

<p>Revealed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathologic-3-quarantine-2025-prelude-demo" rel="nofollow">back in December</a>,&nbsp;<em>Quarantine&nbsp;</em>will be arriving for PC via Steam on March 17th, giving what the two studios call "a chilling glimpse into the dark and immersive world of&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3</em>".</p>

<p><em>Pathologic 3: Quarantine&nbsp;</em>will tell the story of how Daniil Dankovsky, also known as the Bachelor, came to leave his "acclaimed lab" and kick off the events of&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3</em>&nbsp;proper.&nbsp;<em>Quarantine&nbsp;</em>will also introduce the core gameplay mechanics that will make up the basis of&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pathologic-3-quarantine-release-date-bachelor.jpg?itok=rfWmWtlf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pathologic-3-quarantine-release-date-bachelor.jpg?itok=j8ck-Ldn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pathologic 3: Quarantine&nbsp;</em>is officially coming in March.</figcaption></figure><p>As Ice-Pick and HypeTrain tell it,&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3: Quarantine&nbsp;</em>will ask you to "examine patients, uncover strange secrets, and make first steps towards defeating Death". That's a pretty tall order for a prologue demo.</p>

<p>You'll be able to examine and diagnose patients with the mysterious Sand Plague, but you'll also be prying into their personal lives to see what kind of unsavory secrets they're hiding.</p>

<p>As you play, you'll also be building Dankovsky's mental map of the world around him; the two studios say the Bachelor is a "sharp mind in search of the truth", and it's that very truth you'll have to uncover throughout&nbsp;<em>Quarantine</em>.</p>

<p>You can check out the release date reveal trailer for <i>Pathologic 3: Quarantine&nbsp;</i>right here.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3</em>, it's the third game in the&nbsp;<em>Pathologic&nbsp;</em>series, although technically, it's actually sort of the first.</p>

<p>Announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathologic-3-announced-2025" rel="nofollow">in October</a>,&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3&nbsp;</em>is actually an expanded and revised version of the long-awaited&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 2&nbsp;</em>Bachelor Route, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathologic-2-bachelors-scenario-announced" rel="nofollow">intended as an expansion for the second game</a> but which appears to have taken on a life of its own, appropriately enough for&nbsp;<em>Pathologic</em>.</p>

<p>It gets more complicated, though, because&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 2&nbsp;</em>is sort of an expanded and reworked version of the original&nbsp;<em>Pathologic</em>. It's best to think of each game in the series as a reimagining of the first rather than a true sequel.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3&nbsp;</em>is due to arrive on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3199650/Pathologic_3/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> sometime this year. The free&nbsp;<em>Quarantine&nbsp;</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3389330/Pathologic_3_Quarantine/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">demo-slash-prologue</a> will be available on March 17th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/wb-games-has-monoliths-nemesis-system-under-lock-until-2036/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Monolith Studios has shut down, and now fans wonder what will happen to its famed Nemesis System, which is locked under a Warner Bros. Games patent until 2036.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Nemesis System was seemingly set to make its grand return with the now cancelled Wonder Woman game. The game’s cancellation came along with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breaking-warner-bros-games-cancels-wonder-woman-shuts-down-multiple-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shutdown of the following studios</a>: Monolith Studios, Player First Games, and WB San Diego. Due to the sudden closure, the future of the Nemesis System has become uncertain, too, as the studio responsible for creating it no longer exists, and no other game developer will be able to utilise the system as Warner Bros Games holds its patent till 2036.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/wonder-woman-video-game-announced-in-2021-reportedly-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VentureBeat</a> (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/warner-bros-owns-nemesis-system-until-2035-despite-monolith-closure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>), the Nemesis System was patented by Warner Bros. Games in 2021, which barred other game developers from using the system in their games. The patent will remain locked under Warner Bros. Games until 2036 if the company continues paying its associated fees, even after Monolith Studios has been shut down. This means that the Nemesis system may not see the light of day again unless Warner Bros. Games decides to do something about it.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-nemesis-system">What is the Nemesis System?</h2>



<p>For those wondering, Monolith’s Nemesis System debuted with Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and was also used in Shadow of War. The system allows enemy NPC characters, who are usually unforgettable, to have more personality. With the Nemesis system, the player’s actions would be fed into the enemies, and their reaction towards the player character would change according to the decision made in battles, providing a personalised story and fresh encounters to players according to their choices. Thanks to the system, each enemy feels like an evolving rival to the player.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What are your thoughts on the Nemesis System being locked under Warner Bros. Games till 2036?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Guy ‘Dr Disrespect’ Beahm was shamed last year when he admitted to inappropriately messaging a minor on Twitch in 2017. That sequence made up the main reason why he was permanently banned from the platform in 2020. In the wake of the revelation, sponsors, friends, and peers alike all abandoned the controversial creator.</p>



<p>During a recent stream, Dr Disrespect <strong>erupted</strong> against those who have ‘disrespected him’ over the last few months. That long list of people includes NICKMERCS, Dr Lupo, Kai Cenat, and the entire ‘streaming network’ at large.</p>



<p>Despite having built an entire persona based on being disrespectful to others, Beahm is now struggling to contend with being shunned by the industry around him.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-crashing-out">Crashing Out</h2>



<p>In a perfect video posted on social media HUN2R, we see the best showcase possible of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/who-is-dr-disrespect-streamer-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr Disrespect</a>‘s recent mid-stream tirade. It’s a bizarre segment that lasts far too long, with Beahm calling out all his former associates while simultaneously bagging on several outlets, industry personalities, and the wider streaming community.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Dr Disrespect RANTS on stream saying: 

– </span><a href="https://twitter.com/NICKMERCS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@NICKMERCS</a><span> is a phony and a p*ssy 
– </span><a href="https://twitter.com/DrLupo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@DrLupo</a><span> has always copied him and is a rat
– “That’s how you get knocked tf out” 
– “We didn’t admit nothing” 
– </span><a href="https://twitter.com/timthetatman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@timthetatman</a><span> and </span><a href="https://twitter.com/ZLaner" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ZLaner</a><span> are good people, and he would accept their apology privately
-…</span></p></article></div>







<p>He labelled NICKMERCS ‘the biggest p*ssy in the world’, said that Dr Lupo is ‘a big-ass fake’, and suggested that publications are busy d*cksucking Kai Cenat’s content.</p>



<p>Hilariously, the creator said multiple times that he wasn’t going to say anything and wouldn’t address these ‘phony’ people <strong>before </strong>launching into a rant about some of the biggest names in the business.</p>



<p>Dr Disrespect said ‘We didn’t admit nothing’, reverting to the narrative that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-admits-minor-statement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he didn’t cop to messaging a minor</a> on Twitch. </p>



<blockquote>
<p>What the f*ck did we admit? Some jokes and bantering? That’s what we said? Wake up – we didn’t admit nothing!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As the segment unravelled, Dr Disrespect became increasingly flustered, stating that for streamers like TimTheTatman and ZLaner to play games with him again, they’d need to <strong>publicly apologise </strong>for abandoning him in 2024.</p>



<p>It was just a few days ago that Guy Beahm posted on his personal social media profile <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-twitch-plead-reinstated-stream/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">requesting that Twitch unban him</a>, stressing that he never should have been banned in the first place. It’s one hell of a rabbit hole here, folks.</p>



<p>And all this news comes after Dr Disrespect was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-loses-followers-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropped by prolific sponsors</a>, removed from Midnight Society (which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-comments-midnight-society/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently shut down</a>), and signed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-run-rumble-head-of-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a deal with Rumble</a> that he seems to already be neglecting somewhat.</p>



<p>What a wild ride.</p>

            <p>Sonic Rumble, Sega's forthcoming party game for mobile and PC, has been delayed into the spring.</p>
<p>The game is currently available in pre-launch in 44 countries, with a global launch (including UK and US) originally planned for winter.</p>
<p>Now, in a new update from developer Rovio (known for the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/angry-birds">Angry Birds</a> games), the global launch has been pushed back to spring, with its 1.2.0 update.</p>

<p>Sonic Rumble will be a free-to-play battle royale game where 32 players collect rings in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fall-guys">Fall Guys</a>-esque competitive rounds.</p>
<p>Rovio has revealed the 1.2.0 version will also include a ranked competitive mode, a "Crews" feature to allow players to join up together, and the inclusion of character-specific abilities.</p>
<p>Before that, a 1.1.2 update for those in pre-launch will add a Quick Rumble mode for players to enter a single round challenge.</p>

<p>"We would like to extend a huge thank you to our players and Sonic fans for their patience in waiting for the global launch of Sonic Rumble," wrote the developer <a href="https://sonicrumble.sega.com/en/news/000111/">in an update</a>. "The team is committed to delivering a memorable experience for Sonic fans with even more new game mechanics, new features, and more exciting content to look forward to."</p>
<p>Known predominantly for its Angry Birds games, Sonic Rumble will be Rovio's first brand new game since the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-buys-angry-birds-maker-rovio-for-625m">studio was acquired by Sega in 2023</a> for £625m.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-rumble-wont-include-gacha-mechanics-as-sega-says-theyre-shunned-in-west">Sonic Rumble is also notable for its lack of gacha mechanic</a>, due to its lack of popularity in the west.</p>
<p>Said Sonic franchise lead Takashi Iizuka: "In the Japanese and Asian markets, it's common to have to spend tens of thousands of yen [in a game] until you draw a rare character and finally get to move on. But this is not the case in the global market, especially for an action game like Sonic Rumble, where players should be able to enjoy the game on an equal footing. The starting point of this project itself was to make it a mobile game that would sell globally. Therefore, the monetisation model was designed from the beginning based on global standards."</p>
<p>The game will feature a season pass instead.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
