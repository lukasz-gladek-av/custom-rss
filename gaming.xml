            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-update-20-0-0-adds-virtual-game-cards-gameshare-and-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A big new Nintendo Switch update (version 20.0.0) <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22525/~/nintendo-switch-system-update-information#current" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped today</a>, adding several features introduced mostly in preparation for the Nintendo Switch 2 launch. The Virtual Game Cards and GameShare features are easily the most important. Here's what Nintendo had to say about how they work:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Virtual Game Card</strong></em>
<ul>
<li><em>Purchased Nintendo Switch digital software, DLC, and some free software are now virtual game cards and displayed in a list in this menu.</em></li>
<li><em>You can virtually load and eject virtual game cards between up to two Nintendo Switch systems.</em></li>
<li><em>Virtual game cards can be lent to others in the same Nintendo Account family group. For more information, see&nbsp;Virtual Game Card Guide.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em><strong>GameShare</strong></em>
<ul>
<li><em>Compatible software can be shared from a Switch 2 system to other nearby system(s) to play together.</em>
<ul>
<li><em>You can only play together via local wireless, and the Switch 2 system must initiate GameShare.</em></li>
<li><em>This feature cannot be used between two Switch, Switch – OLED Model, and/or Switch Lite systems.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A new User Verification feature has also been added to ensure that access to the Virtual Game Card menu can be restricted via PIN or signing in to your Nintendo Account. Furthermore, with the addition of Online License Settings, users can play downloaded software or DLC they purchased (as long as the system is connected to the Internet) even if they don't have the virtual game card loaded.</p>
<p>Last but certainly not least, the functionality to transfer saves between Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 has been implemented. Users can perform a system transfer using local communication; however, both the local and server-based system transfer services require an Internet connection and a Nintendo Account. Multiple saves can also be selected and transferred at once in the dedicated menu.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><em>For users who will lose access to their Switch before receiving their Switch 2, there is an option to upload system transfer data to a dedicated server, which can then be retrieved on their Switch 2. After you upload your system transfer data to the dedicated server, the Switch system will be initialized to factory settings, so only perform this transfer if you’ll be able to complete the transfer on Switch 2.</em></li>
<li><em>If you want to continue using your Nintendo Switch until you have a Nintendo Switch&nbsp;2, we recommend completing the system transfer using local communication after you have acquired a Nintendo Switch&nbsp;2 system.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is just over a month from its planned June 6 debut in stores. In the meantime, check out our recap article <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know-about-nintendos-new-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, or our hands-on preview <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

            <p>It's been so long since the last <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty">Starcraft</a> that all I can remember is that Zergs build on creep, the Protoss Void Ray is a glorified Xmas bauble, and Jim Curry went to space. I'm pretty sure at least one of those things is from some other <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game universe. Maybe Worms. How long must we wait for a Starcraft 3? A long time yet, but possibly not forever, for Blizzard are apparently handing the rights to the cherished RTS series to Nexon, publisher of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dave-the-diver">Dave the Diver</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-finals">The Finals</a>.</p><!--more-->
<p>As reported by South Korean finance site <a href="https://news.mtn.co.kr/news-detail/2025042808165242317">MTN</a> (via Google translation) and written up by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/strategy/nexon-wins-the-bidding-war-to-make-a-new-starcraft-as-well-as-distribute-a-blizzard-mobile-game-thats-being-called-overwatch-3/">PCGamer</a>, Nexon have been selected as the "preferred" candidate for Starcraft development rights following a bidding war with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/guild-wars">Guild Wars</a> publisher NCSoft, Solo Leveling: Arise creators Netmarble and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG: Battlegrounds</a> outfit Krafton. Nexon are also, it's claimed, in the running to land Korean and Japanese service rights for a new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> mobile game, referred to by some bidders as Overwatch 3, but in actuality a MOBA spin-off.</p>
<p>According to MTN, the bidders have pitched several new Starcraft concepts at Blizzard, ranging from spin-off games to "platforms", though it's not known what Nexon specifically proposed. Apparently, the negotiations have been "complicated" by the fact that while making a new RTS game is the obvious choice and doubtless the best usage of the license, nobody wants to go toe-to-toe with Blizzard's own Starcraft 2, which remains a huge hit in South Korea despite <a href="https://tl.net/forum/starcraft-2/608542-the-death-of-korean-sc2-and-where-we-go-from-here">reports of its "death" as an esport</a>. There's also been talk of a MOBA adaptation, as with Overwatch mobile. Good luck selling that to the Windows 98 diehards.</p>
<p>Why aren't Blizzard themselves making a new Starcraft RTS? Who knows, such a project may exist deep within the company, lost in a trove of Diablo 4 merchandise, but all they're talking about at present <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-ghost-of-starcraft-ghost-endures-as-a-new-shooter-set-in-the-rts-universe-is-in-the-works-at-blizzard">is the latest Quixotic effort to make a Starcraft shooter</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>To celebrate its fourth anniversary, Housemarque has released a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> patch for sci-fi shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/returnal">Returnal</a>.</p>
<p>The patch, out now, promises up to 2.5x the pixels on the more powerful console for a higher resolution experience. Presumably that's aiming for native 4K rather than the upscale solution employed on the base console, though that hasn't been specified.</p>
<p>It's unknown if the patch makes any other tweaks. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-returnals-pc-port-is-good-but-it-could-be-great">PC version of the game</a>, released in 2023, already boosts performance over PS5.</p>

<p>Returnal was released in 2021 and is generally considered one of the best and most unique games on Sony's PS5. The roguelite shooter sees protagonist Selene trapped in an endless cycle on a hostile, alien planet.</p>
<p>A year after its release, in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/returnal-wins-big-at-this-years-bafta-games-awards">won big at the 2022 BAFTA Game Awards</a>, winning the Best Game award and a performance award for Jane Perry.</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>Following Returnal's release, developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-buys-returnal-developer-housemarque">Housemarque was acquired by Sony</a> as part of its PlayStation Studios first-party operation.</p>
<p>At Sony's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/state-of-play-february-2025-everything-announced">PlayStation State of Play in February</a>, the developer revealed its next project: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/returnal-studio-heads-to-a-hostile-shape-shifting-planet-for-newly-unveiled-saros">Saros</a>.</p>
<p>It's once again set on a "hostile, shape-shifting planet" and features British actor Rahul Kohli in the lead role. PS5 Pro enhancements for the new game have been promised, so this update to Returnal bodes well.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/30/report-ea-lays-off-more-than-300-staff-and-cancels-rumoured-titanfall-spin-off/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>EA has reportedly cut more than 300 jobs and cancelled several projects, including a new <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/titanfall">Titanfall</a> game.</p>
<p>First reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-29/electronic-arts-lays-off-hundreds-cancels-titanfall-game">Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier</a>, somewhere between “300 and 400 positions” have been cut by the publisher, including jobs at Apex Legends and Star Wars Jedi studio Respawn Enterainment. It comes a little over a year after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/29/ea-layoffs-hits-5-of-its-employees-mandalorian-fps-cancelled-ridgeline-games-closed/">EA cut 5% of its total workforce in February 2024</a>.</p>


<p>In a statement to Bloomberg and EA spokesperson confirmed that layoffs had been made, “As part of our continued focus on our long-term strategic priorities, we’ve made select changes within our organisation that more effectively aligns teams and allocates resources in service of driving future growth.”</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/Respawn/status/1917267367144423543">Respawn also noted</a> “targeted team adjustments”, admitting that it had “made the decision to step away from two early-stage incubation projects”.</p>
<p>One of those projects, according to Bloomberg, was codenamed R7, an extraction shooter set in the Titanfall universe. While the company has had great success with the other multiplayer FPS phenomenon in battle royale Apex Legends, extraction shooters are a less proven format for massive success, so it’s possible that EA saw the broad reaction toward <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/12/bungie-revealed-marathon-out-this-september/">Bungie’s Marathon extraction shooter</a>, the broader landscape of live service games, and realised that anything with the Titanfall name that wasn’t a full sequel to Titanfall 2 would suffer massive backlash from fans, so decided to can it instead.</p>

<p>This isn’t the first time that a Titanfall game has been cancelled in the last few years, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/02/report-ea-cancels-titanfall-single-player-game-being-built-within-apex-legends/">Titanfall Legends reportedly canned back in 2023</a>.</p>
<p>Our thoughts go out to all those affected by these layoffs, and we hope they find fresh employment and opportunities soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/housemarque-celebrates-4th-returnal-anniversary-with-ps5-pro-patch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Finnish developer Housemarque has <a href="https://x.com/Housemarque/status/1917443799619342788?t=UpfDraahAgVZfbzeHhoBqQ&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">celebrated the 4th anniversary</a> of Returnal with the release of the long-awaited PlayStation 5 Pro patch. The studio didn't go into much detail about the improvements, though they did say the patch offers up to 2.5x higher resolution than the base PlayStation 5 version.</p>
<p>Based on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2021-returnal-absolute-housemarque" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry's analysis of the game on PS5</a>, Returnal originally rendered the game at native 1080p, then used temporal reconstruction up to 1440p, and finally added a checkerboard rendering pass to reach 4K output. So, it sounds like the PS5 Pro version might now output native 4K resolution, although we'll have to wait for a new analysis to get confirmation.</p>
<p>Powered by Unreal Engine 4, Returnal was so successful that it single-handedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/housemarque-returnal-has-officially-joined-playstation-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">convinced Sony to acquire Housemarque</a>. The game earned a 9.3/10 score in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/returnal-in-my-restless-dreams-i-see-that-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a> by Kai Tatsumoto:</p>
<p><em>Save for an ending that crashes nearly as hard as Helios' entry onto Atropos, Returnal checks all of the marks for what a best-in-class roguelike should aim for: a gameplay loop that rewards the player for innovation and mastery, loot that can synergize to create some unstoppable character builds, and most importantly, weapons that simply feel right in the player's hands. Without a doubt, Returnal is one of the finest PlayStation 5 exclusives available in 2021 and those that are eager for the next great challenge can find plenty to look forward to with Selene's first steps onto the alien planet again and again.</em></p>
<p>Despite the game's success, Housemarque is not making a sequel to Returnal. Instead, they are crafting a brand new sci-fi IP <a href="https://wccftech.com/saros-will-be-the-ultimate-evolution-of-housemarques-gameplay-launches-in-2026-on-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">called Saros</a>. The developers claim this will be the 'ultimate evolution' of their trademark action gameplay when it ships next year on PlayStation 5. The game still uses the roguelike framework seen in Returnal, but this time around, Housemarque will let players keep permanent resources and progression, making deaths more bearable.</p>
<p>Last month, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/saros-housemarque-budget-alan-wake-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">admitted</a> they could never have made a game like Saros if they had remained independent. It reportedly has a budget similar to Alan Wake 2's (around €70 million).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/658511/nintendo-switch-20-0-0-update-virtual-game-card-gameshare-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>With just over a month to go before the Nintendo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634603/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-details">Switch 2 release date on June 5t</a>h, Nintendo has released a Switch 1 update that will help prepare things for the new console’s arrival. The <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22525/p/989/c/188#current">V20.0.0 update for the original Switch</a> adds a bunch of new features that go along with the Switch 2, like Home menu buttons for the<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637307/nintendo-switch-virtual-game-card-lending-system"> Virtual Game Card</a> and GameShare features that were announced earlier this month, and a new system transfer feature that can store your data in the cloud until you’re ready to put it on a Switch 2 — just make sure you read the instructions closely before trying it.</p><p>You won’t be able to use the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641334/nintendo">GameShare feature</a> yet, as sharing can only start from a Switch 2 system over local wireless connections — trying to do it between two Switch 1 systems won’t work.</p><p>You can check out the new Virtual Game Cards that collect digital software and DLC for you to “load” and “eject” between two different systems, and lend games to others in your Nintendo Account family group. If you lend a game to someone else, then you can pull it back while they’re online even if they’re currently playing, but if they go offline without returning it or coming back online, you’ll need to wait until the end of the two-week lending period for it to be returned to your library automatically.</p><p>Nintendo’s <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/67891">Virtual Game Card Guide</a> explains all of the ins and outs of the new lending system, like how each Switch can only be connected to one other Switch at a time, how to manage your game cards from the web, and how to hide (or unhide) certain cards.</p><p>To use digital games across more than just two systems or without those restrictions, Nintendo is now relying on the Online License Settings, which are also being added to your Switch 1 in this update. If it’s turned on, it will allow the user to play any of their digitally purchased games and DLC as long as they’re connected to the internet, without relying on virtual game cards.</p><p>But if you’ve already decided to upgrade, then your first stop might be the new option for “System Transfer to Nintendo Switch 2” under the System menu in System Settings. While it can be used for a local system-to-system transfer once your new console arrives, there’s also an option to upload system transfer data to the cloud now, where it will be ready to download to a Switch 2 without requiring access to your old system.</p><p>While that might be good for someone passing their Switch 1 off to someone else, the downside is that it will factory reset your Switch 1, so it’s better to wait if possible, and it will only be stored for a year if not downloaded. Another wrinkle is that it’s possible to set up a Switch 2 cloud transfer, then cancel it and bring your data back to a Switch 1. However, <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68432">as Nintendo’s system transfer FAQ explains</a>, while it doesn’t have to be the same Switch 1 you started with, if it started on a Switch OLED, you will only be able to cancel and reload your data on another Switch OLED.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Strong and selfless, Kaser shies away from the label of a hero, feeling the weight of those who depend on his abilities and leadership. Unyielding in his defiance against oppression, he fights for those who cannot stand up for themselves, fuelled by a steadfast resolve to save his home from the cruel reign of brutal tyrants. Now the fate of his beloved sister hangs in the balance as he seeks to exact a terrible revenge on Aramon and the invading Voidrax.</li><li><strong>Arena</strong> – Once a powerful alien-dragon warrior, Arena exudes a commanding aura of authority that demands respect. It was in witnessing the true depths of human love and kindness that he realized humanity was not the evil species he had always believed it to be. Now haunted by the memories of his past actions in conquering innocent worlds alongside his Voidrax brethren, Arena’s future is clouded and his motivations remain unclear. <a title="Games > Beneath [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/beneath">Beneath</a> his strong and domineering presence lies a wise and compassionate soul, capable of offering help and guidance to those who need it the most, with a dose of dry humour even in the most dangerous situations.</li><li><strong>Louisa</strong> – Kaser’s sweet-natured younger sister always prioritizes the wellbeing of others and is willing to do whatever it takes to protect her friends and family from harm. Growing up in Slum Harbour left an imprint on the teenager and deeply shaped her character, instilling a great deal of loyalty and empathy for its people who have long suffered under the harsh and oppressive rule of the Empire. Despite her overly protective older brother’s concerns, Louisa joined the GLIMMER resistance group, determined to make Slum Harbour a happier and safer place to live. Her genuine compassion, respect and kindness have earned her the heartfelt gratitude of the townsfolk.</li><li><strong>Aramon</strong> – The ruthless commander of the Voidrax has been imprisoned across alternative dimensions for a millennium—but is executing a meticulous escape plan that threatens to unleash catastrophic consequences. Consumed by an insatiable obsession to dominate all of existence, he intends to seize the planet’s Life Nexus—a move that could grant him nearly limitless power. His vengeance against those who imprisoned him will be swift, brutal and merciless, leaving devastation in his wake. Manipulative, narcissistic and arrogant, he holds others in utter contempt, believing that the time for his ultimate rule has finally arrived.</li><li><strong>Victor</strong> – As the noble leader of the Holy Order, bound by a solemn oath to protect the weak and the innocent, Victor embodies the virtues of a true hero. His unwavering loyalty to the Empire and his firm belief in the Emperor’s vision for a brighter, more prosperous future drive him forward.

                <p>Nintendo has rolled out a new system update for the Nintendo Switch. This particular update is a hefty one, introducing the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-virtual-game-cards-will-let-you-share-digital-games/1100-6530424/" data-ref-id="1100-6530424">Virtual Game Cards</a> feature announced during the company's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-march-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6377/" data-ref-id="2900-6377">March 2025 Nintendo Direct</a>, along with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-announces-game-sharing-for-all-switch-consoles/1100-6530545/" data-ref-id="1100-6530545">GameShare</a> support and other compatibility with the upcoming Switch 2 system.</p><p>After installing the update, digital titles and DLC you've purchased will now be converted to Virtual Game Cards. These function similarly to physical game cards. You can load and share your digital games between two Switch systems, making it easier to manage your digital library. You can also loan out digital games temporarily to other users within your family group.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Nintendo Switch - Virtual Game Card Update Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>As mentioned, the new system update also adds support for GameShare. This feature will allow Switch 2 owners to virtually share compatible games with Switch 1 players, similar to the Download Play function the DS offered, giving you the ability to set up or join a multiplayer session even if only one player owns the game.</p><p>Beyond that, the update adds a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-will-let-you-transfer-system-data-from-switch-1/1100-6530566/" data-ref-id="1100-6530566">Switch 2 system transfer function</a> that will allow you to transfer your Switch 1 data over to the new console. Nintendo has also tweaked the colors of the eShop and News icons, as well as added the ability to transfer multiple save data at once. You can read the full patch notes, taken from <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22525/~/nintendo-switch-system-update-information" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo's support website</a>, below.</p><p>This system update arrives a little more than a month ahead of the Switch 2, which is slated to launch around the world on June 5. Preorders for the console opened in the US and Canada on April 24 but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">quickly sold out</a>, although many games and accessories are still in stock.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tempest-rising-review-multiplayer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">There's some rising left to be done in the amount of maps, factions, and modes available.</h2></div><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Note: This review specifically covers the multiplayer mode of Tempest Rising. For thoughts on the story mode, check out the </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tempest-rising-review-single-player-campaign">Tempest Rising single-player campaign review</a><em>.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The problem with Tempest Rising's multiplayer is that while it's perfectly competent at recreating a slice of the old Command &amp; Conquer multiplayer with a pair of new and interesting factions, it's just that: a slice, rather than the whole pie. With only two factions, nine maps, and the most basic of options for customizing its two or four-player matches, just about everything here screams "minimum viable product." Combine that with the fact that Tempest Rising doesn’t aspire to be anything more than a revival of C&amp;C’s gameplay, and there's not a tremendous amount to get excited about. It may well expand over time – such as whenever the Veti faction arrives – but like a vehicle factory that's only half built, it won't be super useful until you're certain you'll have enough harvested Tempest in the bank to complete it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I could try to comment on unit balance, but like with any fresh-out-of-the-gate multiplayer game, anything I say will almost certainly soon be obsolete. My anecdotal experiences with the community's apparent preference for GDF over Dynasty, probably thanks to their self-replenishing drone swarms, is likely to either be nerfed in a patch within a week or proven completely wrong. Soon, I'm sure someone way smarter than I am will figure out a devastating counter that reduces the seemingly unbeatable (and admittedly pretty cool) strategy of loading Skycrane transport helios with drone operating infantry to automatically barrage anything in range to a garbage-tier strategy for fools.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So I'll leave that to the folks who are busily hashing out the best build orders and counter strategies for the unique characteristics of each faction, which are mostly remixes of C&amp;C ideas with a few twists to get a hang of. I’m a big fan of the Dynasty’s Scrap Trucks, which let you quickly unfold a vehicle-repairing turret anywhere on the map and start plopping down structures that you can pre-construct at your con yard. Naturally, there's no end to the opportunities for showing off your micromanagement skills by deftly controlling the transforming Trebuchet tanks, picking targets for your long-range artillery and airborne units to clear the way for flamethrowers and armor, activating special abilities to disable groups of enemies and leaving them vulnerable, laying mines, scouting, calling in support abilities, etc. – all while building and protecting your own resource economy and climbing the tech tree.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Because of Tempest Rising's retro style and adherence to time-tested tech trees I've found it instantly familiar and easy to slip back into old habits; I've been enjoying going back to the classic engineer-rush where I steal the enemy's construction yard out from under their noses while a handful of infantry distracts them from the opposite flank. (That'll only work for a short while after launch, so I'm getting that trollish thrill while I can.) If it worked in C&amp;C, it'll probably work here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a few features that feel like they're built almost exclusively for the hyper-competitive set, such as the Doctrine tech tree that invites you to dump thousands of precious Tempest credits into upgrades that, for the most part, don't get all that good until you're several tiers deep. Boosting my infantry health by 15%, for instance, doesn't seem all that worth it until I have a <em>lot</em> of infantry in play (as opposed to building more infantry). At my skill level – and probably that of most people who aren't hardcore players – the vast majority of my games thus far haven't lasted long enough to build up the kind of excess cash I'd need to invest in that sort of thing, with most of them wrapping up before the 15-minute mark. But I'm sure that plenty of people will find uses for these to get the upper hand with specific builds, so it's good to know there's more depth to be mined if you put in the time to train up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, if you <em>are</em> a competitive player looking for your next RTS fix, know that Tempest Rising doesn't have a ton for you to play with at the moment. For one thing, if you play ranked, there are only 1v1 matches available. Even if there were 2v2 ranked matches (it's actively being worked on, the developers promise), there would only be three maps available that support four players in teams or free-for-all. 1v1 isn't much better in that regard, with just six options. Combine that with there only being two factions until whenever the Veti expansion comes along – which could be a while given the lack of a published timeline – and it feels pretty slim compared to a lot of the games that inspired it.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Dan's Favorite RTS Games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There's nothing wrong with the maps that are here – each is a symmetrical layout with areas of high and low elevation, plenty of bottlenecks and alternate routes, all dotted with capturable neutral structures that can give you a "free" (for the cost of an engineer) foothold to build defenses and forward production off of, as well as a few that generate resources. It's simply that there's nothing unexpected – good or bad – at all, and that gives it a very bog-standard feeling. It’s hard to make the argument that Tempest Rising has gone for quality over quantity when there are no big standouts.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Tempest Rising’s multiplayer mode is a better looking but anemic version of the same exact style of RTS multiplayer we've been playing for 30 years. There's certainly value in that, since Command &amp; Conquer’s fast-paced strategic action still holds up as well as ever, and matches are quick and tense when you’re up against an evenly skilled opponent. It may be a minimum viable product with only two factions and a handful of maps, but it is viable, and it remains a good time to duke it out as GDF and Dynasty with others or bots.</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3><div><h3 data-cy="object-review-title">Tempest Rising Review - Multiplayer</h3><div data-cy="review-content"><p>okay</p><p>Tempest Rising's multiplayer mode replicates the thrills of old-school Command &amp; Conquer-style RTS gameplay, but with just a couple of factions and a handful of maps there's not much meat on its bones.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
A year after laying off five percent of its workforce - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-announces-further-lay-offs-this-time-likely-to-affect-around-670-employees">impacting 670 employees</a> - EA has reportedly cut more than 300 additional jobs, as  part of what it called "select changes" at the company. The move has also seen the publisher cancel a number of in-development projects, said to include a new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> game.
</p>
<p>
EA's latest round of layoffs was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-29/electronic-arts-lays-off-hundreds-cancels-titanfall-game">initially reported by Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, who - citing a source "familiar with the cuts" - claimed "between 300 and 400 positions" had been eliminated. Around 100 of those cuts were said to have been made at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> and Star Wars Jedi studio <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/respawn-entertainment">Respawn Entertainment</a>.
</p>
<p>
An EA spokesperson confirmed layoffs had been made in a statement shared with Bloomberg, writing, "As part of our continued focus on our long-term strategic priorities, we've made select changes within our organisation that more effectively aligns teams and allocates resources in service of driving future growth."
</p>
<p>
A <a href="https://x.com/Respawn/status/1917267367144423543">follow-up statement from Respawn</a> acknowledged it had made some "targeted team adjustments", specifically impacting its Apex Legends and Star Wars Jedi teams. "These decisions aren't easy and we are deeply grateful to every teammate affected," it added. The studio also confirmed it had "made the decision to step away from two early-stage incubation projects".
</p>
<p>
Bloomberg reports one of these projects, codenamed R7, was an extraction shooter set in the Titanfall universe. It seems likely this is the same Titanfall project - lead by Titanfall 1 &amp; 2 director Steve Fukuda - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/titanfall-director-reportedly-making-new-titanfall-game-thats-not-titanfall-3">confirmed to be in early development</a> at the start of 2024. Notably, this is the second Titanfall project cancelled by EA in recent years; an Apex/Titanfall crossover, dubbed Titanfall Legends, was reportedly canned in 2023.
</p>
<p>
"Looking ahead," Respawn's statement continued, "our commitment to player-first experiences remains unchanged... For Apex Legends, that means not just delivering competitive, innovative seasons - but expanding what Apex can be." The studio also highlighted its continuing work on the next Star Wars Jedi game, saying it was "aiming to raise the bar again for storytelling and gameplay."
</p>
<p>
Today's layoffs mean EA has now laid off more than 1800 employees <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-laying-off-6-of-its-workforce-as-part-of-restructuring">since March 2023</a>. Despite that figure, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-top-execs-earned-60m-in-last-fiscal-year-despite-company-layoffs">company's top executives earned $60m in the fiscal year 2024</a>, $25.6m of that going to CEO Andrew Wilson.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/electronic-arts-respawn-titanfall-layoffs-andrew-wilson-pay<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cuts-around-300-roles-including-roughly-100-at-respawn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a very normal day</a>. Nothing is amiss. But just for fun, let’s have a gander at the most recent available information on how much EA execs, like CEO Andrew Wilson, are making.&nbsp;</p><p>Now admittedly, these numbers come from <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000712515/f0be0a59-dd50-4247-b36e-0513336b6c1f.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA’s 2024 proxy statement</a>, the 2025 version of which is just around the corner, so they might be a little out of date. Still, I think they’re useful a) as a point of comparison to workers in less vaunted positions and b) because they’re from a time period during which EA <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/28/ea-layoffs-company-to-cut-5percent-of-workforce-or-about-670-employees.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cut five percent of its global workforce</a> – the sort of ripcord a major video game publisher would obviously <em>never </em>pull again, but to liven up an otherwise dull day, why don’t we consider how such a thing does or does not impact executive compensation.</p><p>During fiscal 2024, Wilson took home over $25.6 million via a mixture of a $1.3 million base salary, $20.4 million in stock awards, $3.44 million from a non-equity incentive plan, and around $500,000 in personal security benefits. In the same proxy statement, EA said that the annual total compensation of its median employee was $148,704. If you crunch the numbers <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-execs-earned-60-million-in-2024-despite-layoffs-and-office-closures" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as Game Developer did</a>, you’ll find that Wilson made 172 times more than the median EA worker.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re wondering how Wilson fared in years where EA didn’t lay off five percent of its workforce, well, those were some real belt-tightening times for the company’s head honcho, who pulled in only $20.6 million in fiscal 2023 and $19.8 million in fiscal 2022, down from $39 million the year prior, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-executives-blocked-from-received-exorbitant-awards-1844694638" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an “exorbitant” level of executive pay</a> that shareholders ultimately <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-ceo-pay-apex-legends-fifa-battlefield-layoffs-compen-1849078379" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">voted to rein in</a>.</p><p>Here’s what other EA executives made during fiscal 2024:</p><figure></figure><p>Now, as a thought experiment, let’s say that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-29/electronic-arts-lays-off-hundreds-cancels-titanfall-game?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0NTk1MzQ2OCwiZXhwIjoxNzQ2NTU4MjY4LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTVkhVQjFUMEcxS1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.Ok9U1G-8KnrQWSRme5JF1VqfCPIxgENs3iq9d32PeRc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">300-400 workers had just gotten laid</a> off as a result of poor sales of games like <em>EA Sports FC 25</em>,<em> </em>as well as longstanding mismanagement of beloved series like <a href="https://aftermath.site/dragon-age-veilguard-mass-effect-5-bioware-layoffs-ea" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dragon Age</em></a> and, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ea-cancels-single-player-titanfall-apex-legends-game-221552559.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">repeatedly</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ea-reportedly-cancels-another-titanfall-game-lays-off-several-hundred-employees-205008255.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Titanfall</em></a>. Wouldn’t you think one or even a few of these people could stand to take a pay cut in order to prevent such an outcome? Wilson alone, as we’ve learned, is equivalent to 172 employees if we’re measuring in pure dollars, and I’m sure he’s got plenty in the bank.</p><p>Fortunately, this is all hypothetical, and there’s no need to feel any wholly justified, blood vessel-bursting rage about any of it.

            <p>
You know, I don't think I'll ever understand why, after finding a huge amount of surprise success, developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/1047-games">1047 Games</a> decided to stop working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splitgate">Splitgate</a> all so that they could make a sequel. Perhaps that's just part of my general confusion towards live service games as a whole, but I do think it's a bit odd all the same. Still, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splitgate-2">Splitgate 2</a> is still on track for a 2025 release it seems, with a date now set for the game's first open beta.
</p>

<p>
As confirmed in a very brief teaser trailer released earlier today, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> will be getting an open beta next month, May 22nd. In terms of content, there will apparently be 25 plus weapons, including the "brand new Borealis, an energy carbine power weapon", 10 plus modes like Takedown, a mode returning from the first game where "teams battle to eliminate all members of the opposing team before they can respawn", and 15 plus maps, including a couple of 24-player Onslaught maps.

<p>
Actually, hang on, scratch that, as both the trailer and a press release notes that there'll be "infinite" maps. The trailer didn't elaborate on that, and the press release said that 1047 "promise to reveal exactly what that means soon." Judging from the trailer itself, and the fact this was a feature in the first game, it'll be a map editor. 
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, that would still mean a finite amount of maps, as just because there would theoretically be a regular supply of them, you could still put an exact number as to how many there are. Perhaps there's some kind of randomly generated map feature instead, I don't know, I realise I'm being very particular about this, I just don't appreciate hyperbole. No details on how to sign-up just yet either, so you'll just have to keep your eyes peeled.
