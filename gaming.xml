            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/siltterhead-is-good-actually<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I deeply regret not playing <em>Slitterhead</em> sooner. I was excited for it before release despite not knowing what it <em>was </em>exactly, and when it came out in November the reviews were divided. This can mean a game is deeply flawed, exceedingly abrasive or both. <em>Slitterhead</em> is both, but more the latter than the former for me. It’s an imperfect game that takes wild swings in gameplay not seen since the PS3 era and one that, like <em>Kunitsu-gami</em>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-feels-like-it-shouldnt-exist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">feels like it should not exist</a>. <em>Slitterhead </em>kinda rules.</p><figure><figcaption>If you've ever wanted to fight a big insect guy specifically in a mahjong parlor, you're in luck. Credit:  Bokeh Game Studio</figcaption></figure><p><em>Slitterhead </em>is the product of Keiichirō Toyama, the creator of <em>Silent Hill</em>, the <em>Siren </em>series and <em>Gravity Rush</em>. That is an incredible pedigree unto itself, and you can see the DNA of those titles in this one (particularly <em>Gravity Rush </em>which I was not anticipating). The game takes place in a fictionalized 90s Hong Kong and more specifically a version of the <a href="https://aftermath.site/kowloon-walled-city-cross-section-illustrated" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kowloon Walled City</a> called “Kowlong.” You take the form of a possessing spirit that comes to be known as Night Owl. You have no corporeal form per se, but instead control the bodies of regular citizens, using each person as a jumping off point and utilizing the power of their blood to form makeshift weapons.</p><figure><figcaption>These bugs are straight up nasty. Credit:  Bokeh Game Studio</figcaption></figure><p>Hong Kong is being overrun by parasitic insect creatures known as slitterheads, which inhabit the bodies of otherwise normal humans and burst out of their skulls to feed on brains. Your goal initially is to hunt them down, although your memory of who you were and the events previous to the game remain foggy. What’s more, the slitterheads’ motivations are unclear. As Night Owl progresses through the game he becomes acquainted with special humans known as “rarities” who resonate particularly strongly with his power. These characters each have their own playstyle and add up to something that resembles your party. They exist as both the source of exposition in the plot well as the primary way you build your skills.</p><figure><figcaption>Pairing play styles with different rarities is most of the strategy in this game. Credit:  Bokeh Game Studio</figcaption></figure><p>Combat in <em>Slitterhead</em> is a process of jumping between civilians and rarities, juggling the unique ability cooldowns of your characters and using the ability to shift rapidly between characters to confound foes. In addition to this, the ability to shift between characters is often used to hunt slitterheads, solve stealth puzzles, and rapidly jump though the dense, vertical terrain of Kowlong. When I said it most closely resembles <em>Gravity Rush</em>, this is the reason.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Kowlong Express: Bringing Forgotten Fragments into Slitterhead" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9RUBI-tKguU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>The documentary Bokeh made about this game.</figcaption></figure></div><p>If that entire explanation was a lot to take in, it’s because <em>Slitterhead</em> is structurally confounding and a difficult game to place, although its similarities to <em>Siren </em>and <em>Gravity Rush </em>are crystal clear if you’ve played them. If I dig deep enough, I can pull up other games it reminds me of, but it has been a very long time since I’ve seen a game that is so thoroughly itself. How would you even begin to describe to a friend how this game works? “Well it’s sorta like <em>Phantom Dust</em> but if it also worked like <em>Messiah </em>or <em>Ghost Trick</em> or the PSP-only <em>Parasite Eve</em> spinoff <em>The Third Birthday, </em>and there’s also some <em>Prototype </em>and <em>Edge of Tomorrow</em> thrown in there.” If you understood at least half of those words, congratulations: you’re statistically 40 years old and have a specific kind of taste.</p><figure><figcaption>Credit: Kino International</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption>I'm fine with a naked reference when it's a tasteful reference.  Credit: Bokeh Game Studio</figcaption></figure><p>On top of all this, the setting of this game is straight up ripped from possibly one of my favorite eras in cinema — early 90s Hong Kong. This is very intentionally a Wong Kar-ai ass video game — in one of the opening cutscenes they literally recreate the iconic motorcycle shot from <em>Fallen Angels</em>. Toyama explicitly pulled from the work of Wong Kar-ai&nbsp; and Fruit Chan work when creating Cowlong. “I felt sad that I couldn’t get to witness that chaotic aspect from the 1990s.” This game is like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durian_Durian" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Durian Durian</em></a> meets <em>Yakuza: Dead Souls</em>. There is a close, lived-in density and lushness to the setting that is just so satisfying to inhabit. On top of this, <em>Silent Hill </em>composer Akira Yamaoka did much of the soundtrack, and it is one of the most varied and interesting works he’s put out in a while. There’s tracks that just sound like menacing burps. One track is just a noise band screaming in Cantonese, it rips.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Master of Labyrinth" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UnN4YhDABEM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>This track is so good man. </figcaption></figure></div><p>Oh, also the entire thing is a time loop story. In addition to having multiple characters you talk to between levels to progress the story, the game takes place in a three-day time loop, a tiny bit like <em>Majora’s Mask</em>. By returning to those previous days you change the fate of characters, recruiting new rarities and opening up new potential timelines. This involves replaying previous levels and using context clues from your rarities to find new paths in previously-explored missions. This quirk is both one of the game’s most interesting conceits and is also tied to its biggest flaw: repetition.</p><figure><figcaption>The key to combat is rapidly jumping between rarities and regular people at a relentless pace. Credit: Bokeh Game Studio</figcaption></figure><p>I love this game, but even I will agree with its harshest critics that it overextends itself. Not only does it repeat levels by design, but the core loops of the game are too similar from level to level. There's just not enough variation for the story it’s trying to tell, and as a result it overstays its welcome, sometimes to a grueling effect. That repetition can be exacerbated if you don’t know what tiny thing in a repeated stage you are looking for. If you don’t enjoy the game’s core combat, that would make playing the game feel like torture, but I love how this game feels on a base level. Cutting off a fleeing slitherhead by jumping into the body of a Chinese grandma like Agent Smith from <em>The Matrix </em>and clubbing it with a blood mace can wear a little thin after a several dozen times, but the actual sensation of doing it is so satisfying. What’s more, slitterheads are all fairly similar in a functional but not stylistic sense, which adds to a degree of monotony.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Pairing play styles with different rarities is most of the strategy in this game. Credit:  Bokeh Game Studio</figcaption></figure><p>And yet, I found the combat in this game so unique and enjoyable that I was fine with that repetition through most of the game. The combos themselves are shockingly simple, but how the game manages moving in space is where the complexity lives. Blood is your main source of power and health in this game, and so fighting becomes a complex dance of managing that resource among all available characters and shifting perspectives to do health management. You mainly restore blood by sucking it up from pools on the ground. There is a parry system that involves using the right thumb stick while blocking to build up “Blood Time,” and while it has a tendency to halt the flow of combat, it makes it possible to dig yourself out of a hole if things are going south for you.</p><p>But what makes the game truly complex is the rarities. The cast of characters in this game are aggressively normal people — a sex worker, an unhoused alcoholic, an Indonesian housekeeper, a sexy doctor who chain-smokes. Each of them comes with a different perspective on the slitterheads, and each has a wildly different kit. Edo the unhoused man plays like a glass cannon monk type. Anita, the sex worker, can summon civilians to the area. The cool doctor has a shotgun made of blood and can turn any character into a living bomb. A max of two rarities can eventually be taken on missions, and one of their abilities can be extended to civilians, so synergizing playstyles between rarities becomes a vital but also personal choice.</p><figure><figcaption>Your interactions with characters are done like this between missions. Credit: Bokeh Game Studio</figcaption></figure><p>If I am being effusive, it is partially because we do not get a lot of games this weird. When people bemoan what old games used to be, they are not actually harkening back to an aesthetic but an ecosystem. The PlayStation has one of the greatest libraries in history because there’s a lot of weird choices on it. There will always be blockbusters and struggling indies, but there used to be much more room made for middle budget games that colored outside the lines a bit. Both <em>Slitterhead </em>and <em>Kunitsu-gami </em>are in that lineage, and they both take clearly limited resources and stretch them as much as humanly possible.</p><figure><figcaption>This street is beautifully rendered, which is good because you see it a lot. Credit:  Bokeh Game Studio</figcaption></figure><p>I am not the first to notice that <em>Slitterhead </em>feels like a PS3 game fell out of a time portal. It has the soul of an untranslated UMD that you had to import for $90 in 2006 cash. It’s the kind of title that Microsoft would commission and send out to die in Japan in an effort to sell an additional 20 Xbox 360s. This is a game designer’s game. <em>Slitterhead</em> is <em>Dead Rising</em> and <em>Godhand </em>and <em>Chaindive </em>and <em>Boktai </em>and <em>Rule of Rose</em> and <em>Bullet Witch </em>and every little freak game that sticks in your craw while so many games with dangerously large budgets pass through you fully undigested. It exists unstuck in time and beyond the binaries of good or bad reviews. It is an ambitious love letter to a Hong Kong of yesteryear that resists categorization and is wholly itself. It is not perfect, nor does it need to be. It deserves to be studied and dissected like a rare beetle because games anywhere close to it are in shockingly short supply these days.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-games-journalism-2024-game-informer-ign"><h3>The Best And Worst Games Journalism Moments Of 2024</h3></a><p>It was the worst of times, it was the less-worst of times</p></div><div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/sandisk-logo-rebrand"><h3>Congratulations To Sandisk On A Rebranding That Rules</h3></a><p>More brands should look like they sell Laserdisc players</p></div></div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The <em>Twilight </em>film series alone grossed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/608468/box-office-revenue-twilight-saga/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/608468/box-office-revenue-twilight-saga/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over $3 billion worldwide</a></span>, and likely produced a generation of adults yearning for Edward Cullen (Robert Pattison) and Bella Swan’s (Kristen Stewart) toxic, undying love. </p><p>There have been countless iterations of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/best-vampire-movies-halloween-interview-dracula-horror-1851676205&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/best-vampire-movies-halloween-interview-dracula-horror-1851676205">vampire</a></span>: monstrous devils who will stop at nothing to feed (<em>Fright Night</em>), tragic antiheroes cursed to watch the years pass by (<em>Byzantium</em>) and everyone they love die over and over again, brooding lovers with skin that sparkles (<em>The Twilight Saga</em>), or hilarious misfits struggling to adapt their night-dwelling ways to the modern world (<em>What We Do in the Shadows</em>).</p><p>Narrowing down the best vampire films isn’t easy, but we’ve put together a wickedly fun list of the 12 best vampire films that shows all the different ways the vampire mythology has been adapted on screen. No matter which version you choose to sink your teeth into, you’ll have a bloody good time.</p></div></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/quentin-tarantino-toy-story-3-4-perfect-wont-watch-1851632823&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/quentin-tarantino-toy-story-3-4-perfect-wont-watch-1851632823">Quentin Tarantino</a></span>’s punchy dialogue and Robert Rodriguez’s chaotic direction were the perfect match to inject fresh blood into the vampire mythos. The filmmakers throw the crime, vampire, and western genres into a blender and watch the bloody remnants splatter on screen, creating an unhinged movie about a pair of bank robbers (George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino) who kidnap a preacher and his family, only to end up in a Mexican topless bar with a horde of rabid vampires. Like most of Tarantino and Rodriguez’s films, it’s filled with carnage and tension you can cut with a knife.</p></div><div><p><em>Byzantium</em> is a different kind of vampire story. Centered on a mother and daughter vampire duo, Eleanor (Saoirse Ronan) and Clara Webb (Gemma Arterton), the Neil Jordan-directed flick is far more pensive, questioning the existential burden of immortality and how you can come of age if you’re stuck at the same age forever. Eleanor wants to step out of her mother’s shadow, feeling remorse for her bloodlust, while Clara uses her power to fight back against the men who oppressed her. This patriarchal struggle offers a fresh spin on the typical vampire figure, and  Jordan’s gloomy, atmospheric direction gives vampirism a moving sadness seldom seen.</p></div><div><p>Ana Lily Amirpour’s <em>A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night</em> is a unique vampire movie because it blends the horror, western, and noir genres while giving the vampire figure a feminist and global twist. It tells the story of an Iranian, skateboarding vampire, played by Sheila Vand, who preys on the men who exploit women. The stark black-and-white cinematography is stunning, giving <em>A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night </em>an eerie and surreal quality. In a world that often tries to hide crimes against women, the sharp, exacting colors reflect the clear-cut nature of the revenge she doles out, leaving no room to question what the men have done or what they deserve.</p></div><div><p>What’s cool about <em>Fright Night</em> is that the main character, teenage Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale), loves horror films and is completely obsessed with vampire mythology, which the movie both lovingly lampoons and infects with genuine frights. Charley is convinced his neighbor is a vampire and recruits an over-the-hill vampire killer to help defeat him. A highlight of the movie is the practical special effects, making the hellish creatures so well-made and finely detailed that they feel real. The movie cleverly interweaves monster movie tropes while riffing on neighborhood surveillance and suburban conformity, balancing just the right amount of camp and chills.</p></div><div><p>What if you had to live with your friends for the rest of your life? Ok, what if you were immortal? This humorous concept is at the heart of Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi’s mockumentary, which follows a group of quirky, centuries-old vampires living together in modern-day New Zealand. We observe the vampire flatmates as they go about their rather mundane lives, despite being undead—arguing about household chores, adjusting to new technology, and finding their next feed. With countless pop culture vampires like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-blade-reboot-delay-production-issues-2025-mcu-1851678580&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-blade-reboot-delay-production-issues-2025-mcu-1851678580"><em>Blade</em></a></span>, <em>Twilight</em>, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/slayer-shock-is-a-stealth-game-for-buffy-fans-1787546879&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/slayer-shock-is-a-stealth-game-for-buffy-fans-1787546879"><em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em></a></span>, this film stands out as a clever and original satire of vampire tropes.</p></div><div><p><em>The Lost Boys</em> seamlessly fits vampires into the sunny, fun-loving seaside town of Santa Carla, California. At night, the town comes alive with the roar of motorcycles and the bright, twinkling lights of carnival rides. Kiefer Sutherland leads a grungy gang of leather-wearing bloodsuckers, while Corey Haim and Corey Feldman deliver playful performances as the geeky, comic book-loving nerds who uncover the truth about the gang. <em>The Lost Boys</em> is a lot of fun, mixing humor and scares, while giving vampires a new, 1980s punk aesthetic that fits their rebellious, enigmatic cool perfectly.</p></div><div><p>Park Chan-wook is often at his best when he tackles more fantastical stories, and <em>Thirst</em> is no exception. His frequent collaborator Song Kang-ho plays a priest who transforms into a vampire after sacrificing himself for a medical experiment to find a cure for a deadly disease. He becomes caught between his moral values and his killer instinct, especially after he falls for an unhappily married woman. The conflict between his saintly and devilish sides is thrilling to watch in scenes with dark comedic twists, erotic encounters, and blood-soaked violence.</p></div><div><p> Universal Studios’ <em>Dracula</em> (1931), directed by Tod Browning, and featuring Bela Lugosi’s portrayal of Count Dracula, is the most well-known version of the blood-sucking legend in popular culture. Bela Lugosi’s Dracula has piercing eyes that can easily frighten his victims, but he’s also got that suave, seductive sophistication that makes him hard to resist. His heavy Hungarian accent and theatricality adds to the supernatural creature’s sense of mystery and debonair charm. The intricate designs of Dracula’s lavish castle, the melodramatic performances, and the gloomy atmosphere also give this version a lot of bite. This version of <em>Dracula </em>perfectly embodies the Gothic grandeur that immediately comes to mind when we think of the famous vampire. <br></p></div><div><p>Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, and a young Kirsten Dunst star as a makeshift vampire family navigating eternal life together, beginning in early 20th century New Orleans. Based on Anne Rice’s novel, <em>Interview with the Vampire</em> has the brooding vampire Louis de Pointe du Lac recount the story of his long, undead life to a biographer. We learn how tortured they were watching life change across centuries while never changing themselves. While <em>Interview with the Vampire</em> tends to drag in some parts and could have made the queer elements more apparent, the flamboyant performances (especially from Tom Cruise as Lestat) and ghoulish violence really suck you into their macabre world.</p></div><div><p><em>Shadow of the Vampire</em> creatively brings together horror and humor by imagining Max Schreck (a delightfully batty Willem Dafoe), who stars as Count Orlok in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nosferatu-robert-eggers-bill-skarsgard-movies-1851721835&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nosferatu-robert-eggers-bill-skarsgard-movies-1851721835"><em>Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror</em></a></span>, as an actual vampire. He insists that he can only be filmed at night, never breaks character, and eagerly drinks blood. The crew can’t tell if he’s deeply immersed in his role, or if there’s some truth to him being the undead. Director F.W. Murnau (played by a wild-eyed John Malkovich) gleefully embraces Schreck’s unsettling commitment to his role—even to the deaths of his colleagues. <em>Shadow of the Vampire</em> makes us question our obsession with creating art that feels real, even at the risk of something truly monstrous.</p></div><div><p>Tomas Alfredson’s<em> Let the Right One In</em> offers a quieter take on vampire lore by telling a simple story about children. Frequently bullied by his peers, a lonely boy Oskar meets an elusive girl named Eli (Lina Leandersson) and learns that she is a vampire. The juxtaposition between childhood innocence and Eli’s thirst for violence is intense and fascinating, revealing itself in very swift and stark ways on screen. The themes of sadness, loneliness, and the struggle to fit in make vampirism feel perfectly suited to this coming-of-age story.</p></div><div><p>While the image of Nosferatu standing wide-eyed in the middle of the hallway with his claws curled has become more of a joke thanks to his appearance on <em>SpongeBob SquarePants</em>, the 1922 silent film is truly frightening. There’s a sense of dread lurking around every corner in the deep shadows. As Count Orlok, Max Schreck’s wide-eyed, unblinking stare, his hunched, gaunt figure, and those long, sharp curved nails create a truly terrifying character design. The fact that this movie is 100 years old, and you can see that in the grainy film stock, only adds to the creepiness, as if we’ve unearthed something from ancient history that should not be seen.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Officially, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-has-already-sold-1-million-copies-with-many-more-playing-on-xbox-game-pass">it’s sold one million copies across PC and Xbox Series X and S</a>, with many more playing on Game Pass. Reports coming out of Ukraine, where developer GSC Game World was originally based before Russia’s full-scale invasion of the country in 2022, indicate Stalker 2 is already profitable. There’s even talk of a Netflix series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what does this success mean for GSC Game World itself and the future of Stalker 2? IGN interviewed GSC CEO Ievgen Grygorovych and creative director Maria Grygorovych at BAFTA in Piccadilly, London following a screening of <a href="https://youtu.be/28CITqxwNz0?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>War Game: The Making of Stalker 2</u></a>, to ask if Stalker 2’s big sales were a game-changer for the developer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Discussing the impact of Stalker 2’s release in English, which is obviously not their first language, Ievgen  and Maria talked about how the studio now faces “a new reality” and with it a bigger audience than it’s ever had to contend with. The first steps as part of this new reality will revolve around working to improve Stalker 2 itself, something GSC has already done with multiple patches, but also to expand its plans for continued support.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/23/20241202-202049-1733223547947-1734961939345.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption"><strong>Ievgen and Maria Grygorovych, far right, discuss the making of Stalker 2 at BAFTA 195 Piccadilly.

And all these years we are slightly updating this plan by just moving the dates forward until we release the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And so six years passed and we still want to do the same games as we planned earlier and nothing changed. The only things that changed is that we didn't think that we would like to invest much more time in live updates of Stalker 2 after game release, that we would want to add much more things in this game in live updates.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What does this mean for Stalker 2 and its players, then? Ievgen confirmed that GSC is now in a position to add ideas it was forced to cut from the game before launch because they weren’t ready, and even add new ideas that have sprung up in the wake of Stalker 2’s release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We didn't expect that we would go back to improving Stalker 2 for a lot,” Ievgen explained. “And now we still have the same plan for 10, 15 years of development of other things we want. But also putting much more in development of Stalker 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Because actually I love the world we built. I still find a lot of things that we can make better and we want to make better. And now we have players for whom we can do that, for whom we have to do that. And for me it's very driving.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/499129/stalker-2-gsc-game-world-profitable-dlc-expansions-multiplayer-netflix" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">same reports coming out of Ukraine</a> suggest Stalker 2 will get at least two expansions and even multiplayer, which may be one of the ideas Ievgen was talking about. The hope, it seems, is that Stalker 2’s success could help put Ukraine on the game development map, as CD Projekt’s The Witcher 2 had done for Poland.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the shorter term, updates to fix issues with Stalker 2 continue, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-patch-11-is-a-big-one-adds-first-iteration-of-a-life-fixes">a much-needed patch that improved the crucial A-Life 2.0 feature</a>.

			<p>The ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator is closing the year in an excellent state, as the emulator is currently capable of at least booting most major PS4 exclusives.</p>
<p>As highlighted by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BRUTALSAMM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BrutalSam</a> in a new video shared on YouTube, the emulator is in an excellent state, as it is capable of running several PlayStation 4 exclusives like Gravity Rush Remastered reasonably well. A few other games, on the other hand, still have performance issues and visual glitches, but the fact that the emulator is even capable of booting them is impressive in itself. The star of the show in the video is Bloodborne, which was clearly one of the main focuses for the developers of the emulator, seeing how well it runs nowadays when it was barely possible to only get in-game a few months back.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Status of PS4 Exclusives on ShadPS4 Emulator | December 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T4_uOv4pdwg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With Bloodborne running so well on the ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator, it was not surprising to see the release of mods that attempt, and mostly succeed, at improving the game's visuals. The most prominent of these mods is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-remaster-new-version/">Remaster project by fromsoftserve</a>, which enhances the game's visuals with new features that wouldn't look amiss in an official remaster, which is still nowhere on the horizon despite the massive demand.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/23/game-of-the-year-2024-best-narrative/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>What makes a good game? <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/22/game-of-the-year-2024-best-gameplay/">Mechanics</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/20/game-of-the-year-2024-best-visual-design/">graphics</a> and compelling characters are all integral, but it’s the narrative that all of these other elements hang upon, like an apple tree bearing fruit. A convincing, emotional and intriguing narrative will keep players coming back, and will make a game live on in their memory long past they’ve forgotten how pretty a mountain was or what buttons to press. 2024 has seen its fair share of engrossing stories, but one title stood head and shoulders above the others.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/07/metaphor-refantazio-review/">Metaphor: Refantazio</a> is built on the legacy of the Persona series, and, if you’re searching for reasons why it’s an incredible piece of storytelling, that tells you everything you need to know. Studio Zero took many of the overarching ideas from the school-based series and transplanted them into a fantasy world that brims with imagination, while staying close enough to our world to ensure that its questions about race, racism, religious fanaticism and democracy hit home every single time.</p>
<p>The grand narrative sees you take the reins following the king’s death, and with his only heir cursed into incapacity, the violent and power-hungry Louis attempts to take control. However, the king foresaw the power vacuum that he’d leave. Instead, he paved the way for a magically-infused election, where the most popular person in the kingdom would become king. You’re thrust into the midst of this, setting out to right wrongs, challenge preconceptions, and build a following, with both the vibrant and personable characters you help on your way, and the populace at large.</p>
<p>Metaphor: Refantazio is constantly surprising, with many moments that will shock and challenge you, all the while pushing you ever forward towards glory and power that you never asked for. To say too much more would ruin some of the game’s best moments, but rest assured, this is by far the most powerful, emotional and exquisitely-crafted story of the year.</p>

<h2>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth – Runner-up</h2>
<p>We all know that feeling where something incredible comes to an end, and you see the next act take to the stage. “Oh god,” you think.”How are they going to follow that?” Cast your mind back a few years and you’ll remember thinking the same after FF7 Remake came to a close.&nbsp;Little did we know that when Rebirth took the stage it would knock our expectations out of the park.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/22/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review/">FF7 Rebirth</a> follows Cloud and friends as they <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0MvE3Q43Gs">escape to the country</a>, desperately seeking to defy the winds of fate and prevent what we all know is coming. There is a lot of ground that we know it has to cover, and a lot of expectations that the devs know they have to meet. The devs, too, must have wondered how they were going to follow that.</p>
<p>If they did, it never shows. We’re been gifted a beautifully paced game, with an expanded (and heavily tweaked) version of the story we all know and love. The narrative additions all add a welcome dimension and depth to the characters we grew up admiring. Though it is effectively a new story, it remains faithful in all the ways that matter.</p>
<p>Cast any fears for Icarus aside: Rebirth is a genuine delight.</p>
<p><em>–&nbsp;Nic B</em></p>
<h2>Threshold – Runner-up</h2>
<p>Some games impress with their epic narratives spanning dozens of hours and a myriad of locations and characters. Others convey their story through casting fantastic voice actors to lend gravitas to emotional and exciting dialogue. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/26/threshold-review/">Threshold</a>, on the other hand, takes us back to basics, taking place as it does in a single small environment and with the minimal amount of characters. What it does offer, however, is a focused and psychologically fascinating narrative that unpacks itself through a series of unanswered questions and mysteries.</p>
<p>You find yourself manning a remote outpost with the responsibility of blowing a whistle to ensure that a huge train runs on time. Where are you? Why are you there? What is the train carrying? Where is it going? All of these questions and more occupy your mind as you carry out the basic duties of your job but things are not as simple as they seem. You have to bite into glass canisters of oxygen to survive as the air is so thin so the longer you go the more bloody the onscreen lips indicator gets. You find mysterious notes from a former worker hidden around the station. And as the game progresses some of the answers to your questions are revealed but in a way that only leads to more questions.</p>
<p>While a relatively short and focused experience, the questions raised and the narrative buildup in Threshold will stay with me for a long time as it’s a game that uses the interactivity of the form to tell a unique story.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov%E2%80%99s-winter-twitch-drops-event-starts-december-30.1068003/</guid>

<p>Battlestate Games has revealed that Escape from Tarkov’s Winter Twitch Drops campaign will start on December 30, all but confirming that the wipe will take place a couple of days before. It’s a tradition at this point – these campaigns always start a day or two after the game has undergone a platform-wide reset known as a ‘wipe’.</p>



<p>This wipe will be accompanied by the 0.16 update, a supersized overhaul that promises to introduce a slew of new weapons, balances, and a rework of Customs, one of the game’s fan-favourite maps.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-with-the-wipe-comes-a-drop">With The Wipe Comes a Drop</h2>



<p>On the Escape from Tarkov website, it was revealed that the Winter Drops campaign will run from December 30 to January 4, and then the Escape from Tarkov Arena drops campaign from January 4 to January 8.</p>



<p>The developer advised streamers <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/event/wintertwitchdropsevent?utm_source=x_post&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=winter_drops_24-25&amp;utm_term=link_1&amp;utm_content=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">to enrol if they want to participate</a> in the campaign, with content creators being assigned time slots based on their availability. It’s easy to envision some of the biggest streamers who’ll get a spot in the Winter Drops campaign – this is the time of the year when they make the most money.</p>



<p>The likes of Landmark, Pestily, WillerZ, Glorious, StankRat, Gingy, and Trey will likely all be doing round-the-clock Tarkov streams in support of the wipe and the Twitch Drops campaign.</p>



<p>It hasn’t been confirmed what rewards viewers will receive, but last year, users had to rack up dozens of watch hours to unlock random gift drops in Escape from Tarkov. Some viewers unlocked thousands of rounds of ammunition, while others got packs of noodles or something to that effect.</p>



<p>Battlestate wrote on social media:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>With the approach of the New Year holidays, one of the most anticipated events of the year for our community is kicking off — the annual Twitch Drops Event. This is a great opportunity to receive in-game gifts and enjoy the festive season.</p>
