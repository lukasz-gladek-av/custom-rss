<p>Bethesda surprised us all today with the announcement that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition</a> was heading to Switch 2 with a bunch of technical upgrades to boot. But with a game we've all seen <em>this many times</em>, would it really look all that different from the re-release we saw on Switch 1 back in 2022?</p>
<p>Well, wonder no longer, because Mr Alex Olney is here to reveal all! In the above video, we've got a side-by-side comparison of how Skyrim matches up on Switch 2 vs Switch 1, showcasing all the gameplay you could wish for.</p>
<p>As you'll see, there's certainly a bump on Switch 2, with the new release boasting "Enhanced resolution, improved load times, and optimised performance", but if you're expecting to see anything other than 'Skyrim, innit', think again.</p>
<p>We'll have our full thoughts on the latest version of Skyrim on Switch 2 soon enough. Until then, you can check out the S2 version either via a free upgrade (if you already own the Anniversary Edition on Switch 1), as a standalone purchase for £52.99, or via the base-game-to-anniversary-edition upgrade for £17.99.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>King of Meat</em> developer Glowmade will layoff “around a dozen people” early next year, according to a new report <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/king-of-meat-glowmade-layoffs/">from <em>Insider Gaming</em></a>. These “voluntary redundancies” come just two months after the multiplayer party game hit Steam and after it reportedly failed to hit an ambitious 100,000 concurrent player target. <em>King of Meat</em> peaked at just 320 people on PC instead.</p> <p>Over the past few days, several Glowmade developers posted to LinkedIn that they’re looking for work. The U.K.-based studio published <em>King of Meat</em> in October, backed by Amazon Game Studio. <em>Insider Gaming</em> reported that discussions around the layoffs began earlier in December, and that leadership previously told staff the studio “had the runway to keep going.”</p>

 <p>Amazon Game Studios announced in 2021 that it was <a href="https://www.amazongamestudios.com/en-us/news/articles/amazon-games-publishing-original-game-from-glowmade">expanding its publishing efforts</a> with Glowmade, which was working on an “exciting new IP.”&nbsp;Glowmade had 25 staffers, according to a news release at the time.</p> <p>The studio’s leadership was reportedly hoping <em>King of Meat</em> would reach “a concurrent player count of at least 100,000,” but instead failed to maintain 1,000 players across platforms. On Steam, <em>King of Meat</em> had a recent 24-hour peak of 23 players; its top concurrent player number there is 320 players, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1926980/charts/#max">according to SteamDB</a>.</p>

 <p>Most people probably only remember it as the game with the flashy trailer at Gamescom 2024 which featured an animated version of Opening Night Live host Geoff Keighley. That memorable moment could have cost <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-2024-trailers-steam-1851629266">close to half a million dollars</a>, but apparently didn’t do much to keep <em>King of Meat</em> bubbling around in the popular consciousness.</p> <p><em>King of Meat</em>‘s October release didn’t go well despite a huge marketing push, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRr0i2akDlk">including a big-budget MrBeast video</a>. The video, which included a whole dang set, more than a dozen content creators, and a $250,000 prize, is essentially a mini-<em>King of Meat</em> esports event. It was published just after <em>King of Meat</em>‘s release date and racked up 6.8 million views.</p> <p><em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to Glowmade and Amazon Game Studios for comment.</p>

                <p>Yearly wraps have become an annual tradition across various platforms, and PlayStation is no exception. The <a href="https://wrapup.playstation.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation Wrap website has gone live</a>, and once again, members of the PlayStation community can explore the total number of hours spent across single-player and multiplayer games. You'll have until January 8 to check out your stats--PlayStation Wrap-Up will continue to update until then--and users can redeem a unique glass-themed avatar once they complete their tour down memory lane.</p><p>This year's PlayStation Wrap-Up also includes a look at the number of games played on PS5 and PS4, a closer look at your gaming style, and even the DualSense controller you used the most. If you've used other PlayStation accessories, such as PlayStation VR2 or the PlayStation Portal handheld, those stats will also be included in your personal wrap-up. Additionally, you can get a brief look at how active you were on PlayStation Plus throughout the year, and Sony is also offering a curated list of recommended games to try out through the subscription service, if you're a member of the Premium or Extra tiers.</p><p>Ghost of Yotei, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, Blue Prince, and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 were considerable timesinks, while other noteworthy releases included games like Ball x Pit, Elden Ring Nightreign, and Battlefield 6 kept players glued to their screens for many hours.</p><p>What will the 2026 edition of PlayStation Wrap-Up look like? While things can still change, some of the big upcoming releases include Resident Evil Requiem, 007: First Light, and Yakuza Kiwami 3. Of course, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-did-rockstar-delay-gta-6/1100-6536423/">if it doesn't suffer another delay</a>, we expect the November 2026 release of Grand Theft Auto 6 to rank high on next year's list of the top five most-played games.</p>

			<p>Imagine a world where music was outlawed, where anyone found making or listening to music is thrown in prison. That is the world of UNBEATABLE where a concert that summoned entities that were given the name The Silence led to a pretty sudden change in the law. Since that day, all musical expression, even singing in the shower or whistling while you work, is banned as it draws The Silence. Yet main character Beat is a musician who finds herself on a mission to fill the world with song once again.</p>
<p><iframe title="UNBEATABLE: FINAL TRAILER " width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vkvi71znX_Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>UNBEATABLE has a great visual style, mixing anime stylised 2D characters in 3D locations. It is a striking visual which makes the characters standout in a pretty detailed world. Locations vary from a large house and its grounds to a few city streets that all have a distinct look, making it easy to get around. The art team have done a stellar job of meshing two distinct styles together that makes it seem natural for these 2D anime characters to be walking around normal looking 3D environments. UNBEATABLE has a colourful world, from characters to locations, and it adds to its distinctive style.</p>


<p>Beat is the main character that you control for much of the game, and she is joined by Quaver, Clef, and Treble on her adventure. Yes, every character is named after musical terminology. Personally, I disliked Beat’s personality, though the performance by the actors for all characters is decently done. UNBEATABLE’s story is one that has highs and lows to it, at some points it seemingly making big jumps accompanied by dialogue that wasn’t always good. I was also surprised at how long could pass between the rhythm battles with a lot of wandering and dialogue taking place between. The story mode lasts around eight hours, but it is not as fast paced as I thought it would be. UNBEATABLE’s story is probably the weakest offering in the whole package.</p>


<p>While the story is weak, the gameplay is where UNBEATABLE steps up. At its core, the game is a rhythm action game where things like combat and hitting balls at a batting cage are done to the beat of UNBEATABLE’s soundtrack. On normal difficulty, the combat scenarios only require a two button input which sounds simple but, as the action ramps up, so does the speed of the incoming prompts and does it test reaction skills. At no point did I find the timings off or unfair, with any failure down to my own misses or incorrect button presses.</p>
<p>What I also liked about the combat is that while you are pressing the buttons the characters are moving around the screen, which plays into which side the prompts are coming in from. In the story mode, outside of a few critical battles, you can lose fights and events will continue.</p>

<p>You can skip the story mode altogether if it is not for you, with UNBEATABLE also featuring an arcade mode. Think of this as a tracklist where you can unlock new songs to tackle with your rhythm matching skills. The combat is the same as in the story, but instead of spending a lot of time walking around between songs you just jump into the action. In arcade mode you can unlock and customise your scorecard with different titles, and challenge yourself to take on the songs at different difficulties.</p>
<p>The soundtrack is a big part of UNBEATABLE, and while there’s a couple of songs that became earworms, with the rest not quite having the hook to be as catchy. Of course, song preferences are personal so others may find more songs they like than I did from the soundtrack.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		UNBEATABLE is a good rhythm action adventure game, with it highlights being its visual style and the arcade mode. The story is fine, but can feel all over the place at times with a script that isn’t the best, but the music through the game is good &nbsp;and there are a couple of standout tracks. It has been a while since a decent rhythm game came out, so it is worth giving UNBEATABLE a shot.	</p></div>

            <guid>1377478</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Netflix's <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-acquire-warner-bros-including-game-studios-82-7-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">agreement with Warner Bros. Discovery</a> to acquire the Streaming &amp; Studios division for $82.7 billion also included the WB Games division, with its studios, assets, and whatnot. However, the biggest VOD streaming media service didn't even mention it in the announcement or in the subsequent investor call.</p>



<p>That was already telling, but yesterday, Netflix executives finally commented on WB Games during the UBS Global Technology Conference. Answering a question, Netflix Co-CEO, President, and Director Gregory K. Peters clarified that the company didn't actually attribute any value to the gaming division during the deal because they're 'relatively minor'. </p>



<p><em>And maybe worth going back again to sort of how we thought about the deal and building our valuation model, while they definitely have been doing some great work in the game space, we actually didn’t attribute any value to that from the get-go because they’re relatively minor compared to the grand scheme of things. Now we are super excited because some of those properties that they’ve built, Hogwarts Legacy is a great example of that, have been done quite well, and we think that we can incorporate that into what we’re offering. They’ve got great studios and great folks working there. So we believe that there’s definitely an opportunity there. But just to be clear, we haven’t built that into our deal model.</em></p>



<p>Now, Peters also said that the addition of WB Games would accelerate the company's existing plans in the gaming space. However, it is clear that Netflix does not really believe WB Games to be a particularly significant asset, despite having recently produced a massive success like Hogwarts Legacy, which sold over 34 million units (as of March 2025) and <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-sold-22-million-units-is-the-best-selling-game-of-2023-says-wb-more-hp-things-on-the-way/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was the best-selling game of 2023</a>, managing to beat even Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and breaking a 14-year streak that either a Call of Duty game or a Rockstar game topped sales charts in the United States.</p>



<p>Granted, WB Games faced some hardships with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-contributed-to-200-million-lower-ebitda-for-wb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">flop of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closure of Monolith Productions</a> (Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor/War), Player First Games (MultiVersus), and San Diego Studio, but there's still a lot of untapped potential there, especially after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/wb-games-has-restructured-into-divisions-focused-franchises-harry-potter-game-of-thrones-mortal-kombat-and-the-dc-universe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">restructuring</a> that refocused the company on its four key IPs: DC, Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, and Mortal Kombat. It would perhaps warrant a little more consideration than what Netflix is giving them.</p>



<p>The Warner Bros. Discovery deal is far from closed, anyway, especially after Paramount Skydance <a href="https://wccftech.com/paramount-bids-108-billion-to-grab-warner-bros-discovery-out-from-netflix-nose/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made its hostile bid of $108.4 billion to get the entire company</a>, not just the Streaming &amp; Studios side. Unlike Netflix, Paramount, through Skydance, already owns several triple-A game development studios, such as Skydance Interactive, which has released several high-profile VR games, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/uncharted-amy-hennig-new-studio-skydance-media/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Skydance New Media</a>, Amy Hennig's studio working on Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra (which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed-once-again-now-arriving-mid-late-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently delayed to the latter half of 2026</a>) and <a href="https://wccftech.com/amy-hennig-will-get-to-make-a-star-wars-game-after-all/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an untitled Star Wars game</a>. Netflix, on the other hand, <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-closes-down-aaa-game-studio-that-was-working-on-a-third-person-arpg-for-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closed down its only triple-A game studio last year</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Netflix Downplays Value of WB Games, Calls Division “Minor” in Deal]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-downplays-value-wb-games/</link>
            <guid>1377472</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>On December 5, it was announced that Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery had come to an agreement to sell the Warner Bros. side of the business to the streaming giant. As part of that deal, it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-set-to-buy-warner-bros-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was confirmed that all</a> of Warner Bros. Games (WB Games) properties and studios would be owned by Netflix. </p>



<p>While Netflix didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment regarding what the future could hold for the gaming division of Warner Bros. On December 8, however, the first gaming-specific comments were made by Netflix Co-CEO Gregory Peters on the company’s pending purchase of WB Games.</p>







<p>Peters <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4851311-netflix-inc-nflx-presents-at-ubs-global-media-and-communications-conference-2025-transcript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said that when the deal</a> was coming together, WB Games wasn’t “built” into the deal model. He says that, despite their being “great studios and great folks working there”, they didn’t “attribute any value” to the games side of the company.</p>



<p><strong>“While they definitely have been doing some great work in the game space, we actually didn’t attribute any value to that from the get-go because they’re relatively minor compared to the grand scheme of things,”</strong> Peters said. </p>



<p><strong>“Now we’re super excited because some of those properties that they’ve built, Hogwarts is a great example of that, have done quite well, and we think that we can incorporate that into what we’re offering. They’ve got great studios and great folks working there. So, we think that there’s definitely an opportunity there. But just to be clear, we haven’t built that into our deal model.”</strong></p>







<p>Should the Netflix deal for Warner Bros. close in 2026, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-studio-affected-by-warner-bros-netflix-merger/">they’ll own studios</a> like Avalanche Software, Rocksteady Games, TT Games, and NetherRealm Studios. That means games like the aforementioned Hogwarts Legacy, Mortal Kombat, the rumored in-development Batman game, and others will be under the Netflix umbrella.</p>



<p>To hear that they didn’t consider gaming when determining the value of the company might not be what fans want to hear. That said, it’s tough to know what the company really feels about the gaming side of things based on those comments alone.</p>



<p>The real showing will come after they official own all of the studios. Of course, that’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/paramount-hostile-bid-for-warner-bros-billions/">if they close the</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/paramount-hostile-bid-for-warner-bros-billions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/paramount-hostile-bid-for-warner-bros-billions/">deal</a>. </p>



<p>What do you think will happen to WB Games if Netflix ends up owning the studios and games? Leave your thoughts down in the comments or in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

                <p>Xbox's Jason Ronald has teased that Microsoft has "a lot of exciting things to share" in 2026 for the Xbox's 25th anniversary.

Ronald didn't confirm anything outright but said fans have a lot to look forward to for the anniversary next year.</p><p>"I can't announce anything today, but 2026 is the 25th anniversary of Xbox.

<p>A shell of an upgrade</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Super Evil Megacorp has today announced that it will be launching an all-new Nintendo Switch 2 Edition for the TMNT roguelike, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-splintered-fate-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate</a>.</p>
<p>The new version launches on <strong>16th December</strong>, either as a standalone purchase or as a paid upgrade pack ($2.49, or your regional equivalent) for those who already own the base game, and it packs in everything you'd expect from a Switch 2 update.</p>
<p>The above trailer promises enhanced visuals and frame rate for smooth 4K 60fps play (resolution dropping to 1080p in handheld), and support for local GameShare and GameChat.</p>
<p>It appears that's <em>all</em> that's included in the Switch 2 upgrade at the time of writing — the trailer mentions both the Metalhead and Casey Jones DLC, though it is unclear whether they are included in the new package. We have reached out to Super Evil Megacorp, and will update this post when we hear back.</p>
<p>The performance boost will be a welcome addition. We had a good time with Splintered Fate when it launched on Switch 1 last year, though we noticed plenty of frame drops and experienced a few hard crashes. The game has seen several updates in the time since then, so perhaps this Switch 2 Edition will be the perfect opportunity to dive back in.</p>

                                                      </p><div>
              
              <p>The news that <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-warner-bros-deal-batman-hbo-max-2000650875">Netflix is trying to buy Warner Bros.</a> didn’t ever look like it would be <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-wb-batman-arkham-hogwarts-legacy-mortal-kombat-2000650918">good for game players</a>, but a recent investor call by the streamer suggests things are a whole lot worse than we previously imagined. Netflix co-CEO Gregory Peters told investors that when it came to Warner’s gaming division, it didn’t even factor it into the $83 billion dollar deal. It was apparently considered to add nothing to the company’s overall value, because “they’re relatively minor compared to the grand scheme of things.”</p> <p>Warner Bros. Games hasn’t exactly shone of late, with <a href="https://kotaku.com/monolith-productions-wonder-woman-multiversus-cancel-wb-1851766400">multiple closures</a> of <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-panther-ea-cliffhanger-monolith-productions-1851782787">extremely talented teams</a>, and the <a href="https://kotaku.com/multiversus-season-5-aquaman-offline-update-refund-1851752453">recent flops of <em>MultiVersus</em></a> and <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-hogwarts-legacy-rocksteady-arkham-1851522893">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a></em>, but it’s still hardly minor. For one, <em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>was the best-selling game of 2023 in the U.S., more popular that <em>Call of Duty</em>, selling 34 million copies in its first year. That’s&nbsp;<em>billions</em> of dollars in revenue.&nbsp;Then you’ve got the <em>Arkham</em> franchise, <em>Mortal Kombat</em>, plus the infinite money machine that is every single&nbsp;<em>Lego</em> game from&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em> to&nbsp;<em>Harry Potter</em> to&nbsp;<em>Batman</em>. Yes, it’s suffered as much as every other arm of the company under David Zaslav, but it’s not something you’d immediately write off as worthless. However, that’s the price Netflix put on Warner Bros. Games when bidding for the whole company.</p>

 <p>“While they definitely have been doing some great work in the game space,” said Gregory Peters on the <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4851311-netflix-inc-nflx-presents-at-ubs-global-media-and-communications-conference-2025-transcript">December 8 call</a> (thanks&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/netflix-didnt-attribute-any-value-to-warner-bros-games-business-in-83bn-mega-deal/"><em>Pocket Gamer</em></a>), “we actually didn’t attribute any value to that from the get-go because they’re relatively minor compared to the grand scheme of things.”</p>

 <h2>Netflix already failed hard with games</h2> <p>It’s important to put this perspective into context. Netflix has spent <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-squid-game-unleashed-app-subscription-team-blue-1851755122"><em>years</em> trying to work out how to make money through video games</a>, and only <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-gaming-hades-monument-vally-golden-idol-braid-1851785038">failed</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-team-blue-bungie-blizzard-sony-closed-1851678075">failed again</a>, stripping back expensive forays into the worlds of PC and console gaming and now sticking exclusively to mobile games with a casual emphasis. That makes sense: Netflix is a TV and movie streaming service, and it was <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-google-stadia-cloud-streaming-xbox-ps5-geforce-1849676394">with hubris that it launched its video gaming ambitions</a> into a market that Google had just so spectacularly crashed out of. Big companies look at the sorts of numbers publishers make from a <em>Call of Duty</em> or&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em> and think, “We’d like some of that please,” and assume it just happens. It doesn’t, millions gets wasted, and people lose jobs.</p>

 <p>It’s in the aftermath of this that Netflix is attempting its purchase of Warner Bros., so on some level you can understand why a company so disillusioned with gaming might be so <i lang="fr">laissez faire</i> with this aspect of the prize. However, it also speaks of some quite spectacular shortsightedness, given the lucrative nature of so many of WBG’s licenses.</p>

 <p>This all suggests bad times are ahead for those surviving developers under Warner’s roof. Peters further comments initially suggest there might be some internal insight, as he says, “Now we’re super excited because some of those properties that they’ve built<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment --><em>Hogwarts</em> is a great example of that<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->have done quite well, and we think that we can incorporate that into what we’re offering.” However, “what we’re offering” is the key phrase, given how clear Netflix has recently made its focus on mobile only. “They’ve got great studios and great folks working there,” adds Peters, “so we think that there’s definitely an opportunity there. But just to be clear, we haven’t built that into our deal model.”</p> <p>It certainly makes sense to see the IPs Netflix is getting in the deal as opportunities when it comes to its casual gaming development. The&nbsp;<em>Lego</em> games are already mobile-friendly and have a broad family audience, while licenses like <em>Harry Potter</em> and <em>Batman</em> can be milked in an endless stream of mediocre cellphone games. But hopes for further entries in Rocksteady’s <em>Arkham</em> franchise seem unlikely to be met, let alone the new owners reviving what Warner Bros. once did best, with game series like <em>Shadow of Mordor</em>, <em>FEAR</em>, and other cruelly abandoned Monolith properties.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Rogue is the next character set to arrive in Marvel Rivals on December 12 with Season 5.5, and the developers have provided the usual glimpse of her vanguard moves in a new trailer. </p>







<p>Anna Marie, or more commonly known as Rogue, is perhaps one of the most beloved members of the X-Men in the Marvel fandom. Partnered with her <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-gambit-voice-actor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beloved Gambit</a>, fans have been wanting to see her inclusion for a long time, and to see her as a vanguard is just the cherry on top. </p>



<h2 id="h-rogue-heading-to-marvel-rivals">Rogue Heading To Marvel Rivals </h2>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Rogue: Tempted to Touch | Character Reveal | Marvel Rivals" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-_CwYQQP21Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>At first glance, Rogue looks poised to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-november-20-update-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shake up the meta</a> in a completely unique way. She’s built primarily as a close-quarters brawler, diving into the thick of the fight and dealing impressive damage up close. But she’s far from limited to melee—she can yank enemies toward her and chip away at anyone caught within her damaging aura.</p>



<p>The real show-stealer, though, is her ability to borrow powers from other heroes. Whoever she drains, she can temporarily wield their abilities as if they were her own. The trailer highlights just how versatile this can be: Psylocke’s invisibility, Thor’s lightning strikes—it all becomes part of Rogue’s toolkit, giving her the potential to dominate the battlefield like no other Vanguard.</p>







<p>Her Ultimate amplifies things even further, letting her batter nearby foes while shielding herself and unleashing heavy, punishing blows. A new Vanguard is always an exciting addition to Marvel Rivals, but Rogue looks ready to steal the spotlight in every sense.</p>



<p>It’s always been the season of Rogue and Gambit, and the notorious couple are finally paired together in-game. What do you think of Rogue’s vanguard abilities in Marvel Rivals?

And perhaps in good time, as well, since today's LEGO Fortnite trailer, above, also shows the arrival of a huge fire-breathing dragon boss.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite clearly has big plans for Ninjago, with a second major game update due in 2026 that is expected to also see the arrival of yet more characters, such as Nya, Master Wu, and Lloyd. Until then, this first drop of Ninjago arrives in-game in just a few days, on December 11.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

(The game is rated 18 for violence and bad language.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, there's a mention here that Black Flag Resynced will include the ability to make in-game purchases. It's still unknown how Resynced will plug into the franchise's existing Animus Hub, which lets you buy optional cosmetic content.

Check out how Skyrim looks on Switch 2 in the video below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition includes the base game and the three official Expansions: Dawnguard; Dragonborn; and Hearthfire. Players on Switch 2 get experience enhanced resolution, improved load times, performance optimisation, Joy-Con 2 mouse support, motion controls, Amiibo support, and more versus the OG Switch version, taking advantage of the more powerful hardware.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s more, this edition offers exclusive Nintendo content from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, including the Master Sword, Hylian Shield, and Champion’s Tunic. You’ll also get hundreds of unique Creations Club items, with quests, weapons, armor, spells, dungeons, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda is selling Skyrim for Switch 2 standalone for $59.99, but there’s a free upgrade for Skyrim Anniversary Edition owners on Switch. Owners of the Skyrim (base edition) on Switch can buy the Anniversary Upgrade for $19.99 to play on Switch and Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Skyrim’s release on Switch 2 is sure to resurface all those jokes about Bethesda milking the life out of the game by releasing it on all the platforms under the sun. Skyrim has been ported and remastered so many times that it’s become one of the internet’s most enduring memes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda is of course busy working on The Elder Scrolls 6, although development chief Todd Howard has indicated it is still some time away. In a recent interview, he teased that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/im-preaching-patience-the-elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-todd-howard-warns-fans-teases-potential-shadowdrop">Bethesda could shadowdrop The Elder Scrolls 6</a>, as it did with this year’s The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered and now Skyrim on Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I like to just announce stuff and release it,” Howard told <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/fallout-4-anniversary-todd-howard-interview" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ</a>. “My perfect version — and I’m not saying this is going to happen — is that it's going to be a while and then, one day, the game will just appear.” The Oblivion Remastered shadowdrop was “a test run,” Howard teased. “It worked out well.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

This new version of the game does come with a few additional bells and whistles not found in the original Switch version, namely Joy-Con 2 mouse-control support.

Those who don't already own any version of Skyrim on Switch can buy it on Switch 2 for $60. Owners of the non-Anniversary Edition of Skyrim on Switch can upgrade to the Anniversary Edition for $20 and then receive the Switch 2 version for free. The Anniversary Edition includes the base game and its three official expansions, as well as access to Creation Club content made by players.</p><p dir="ltr">Skyrim truly is the gift that keeps giving for Bethesda, as it's still one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/" data-ref-id="2900-4814">top 10 best-selling games of all time</a>.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The team at MachineGames has issued a new update for <a href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>.</p>
<p>Along with bug fixes such as sorting incorrect manual entries and the correcting the VO balance on some scenes to make the speech more audible, this update has also added a new outfit for Indy.</p>
<p>This one is the Pankot Palace outfit, so yes, the outfit Indy wore in Temple of Doom when he was served chilled monkey brains. That scene still makes me shiver. The outfit pops Indiana Jones into his round spectacles and bowtie. You can see how it looks in-game via the image further below.</p>
<p>As well as today's new outfit, MachineGames has also promised another new outfit still to come down the line. I wonder which one they will choose?</p>

<li>There's still another new outfit to come in a future update… so stay tuned</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bug fixes and game updates</strong></p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Battlefield 6 Update Adds Winter Offensive Content, Limited-Time Map, Game Modes, and More]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-winter-offensive-update-now-live/</link>
            <guid>1377397</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The final major update for Battlefield 6 - Season 1 has arrived with Winter Offensive, the third update that we knew little <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-hands-on-preview/">about when we first previewed Season 1 back in October</a>. This update adds a new refresh of the Empire State map, turning New York into a frozen, snow-filled battlefield. It adds a new Ice Pick melee weapon, new limited-time game modes, and a whole host of tweaks and changes to the game.</p>



<p>The new limited-time Ice Lock version of the Empire State map is one of the highlights in the Winter Offensive update, as are the new limited-time multiplayer and gauntlet modes that pull players through variations of the Ice Lock Empire State map and introduce a new Freeze mechanic limited to the event.</p>



<p>There's also, of course, a new battle pass for players to work through, which is where you'll be able to unlock the Ice Pick melee weapon introduced with this update.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Regarding changes to the game, update 1.1.3.0 includes improvements to hit registration "<em>across all situations that previously felt unreliable</em>," according to <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-game-update-1-1-3-0">a blog post on the official Battlefield website</a>. There's also enhanced close-range soldier visibility by way of stronger character highlights, refined weapon handling to help players be accurate with their shots more consistently, and improved reliability for some of the most-used gadgets in the game.</p>



<p>EA and Battlefield Studios have also made a point to improve the game's audio across the board, update the layouts for Rush and Breakthrough maps, and strengthen vehicle clarity. </p>



<p>It's a fairly sizable update and a solid way to end off Season 1, since this is the final major piece of what we knew was coming in Season 1. So far, Battlefield 6 has been the shooter-of-the-year in 2025, taking the thunder that would have otherwise been held by Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. We'll see how well EA and Battlefield Studios can carry its momentum into the new year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A PEGI rating has been spotted for something called <em>Assassin's Creed: Black Flag Resynced</em>, which appears to pretty much confirm the long-mooted remake or remaster of the piratical open-world adventure.</p><p>The <a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?q=Assassin%27s+Creed+Black+Flag+Resynced" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">rating</a>, which puts the game at 18 for "violence", "bad language", and "in-game purchases" (because of course; this is Ubisoft we're talking about, after all) was spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/pegi-rates-assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Gematsu</a>, but it's not the first we've heard of a potential <em>Black Flag </em>remake or remaster.</p><p>A couple of weeks ago, Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1p72wmu/assassins_creed_black_flag_remake_resynced_leak/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">thequaliti</a> spotted text pointing to <em>Black Flag Resynced </em>within the localization table of <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>. Essentially, the text is a quick disclaimer discussing "creative liberties" taken with history to create the game, but it's another pretty strong piece of evidence, too.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Assassin's Creed: Black Flag </em>is probably getting a remake soon.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There's precedent for this, too; in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-ceo-confirms-multiple-assassins-creed-remakes-are-on-the-way" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">June last year</a>, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot promised that "some remakes" of titles in the <em>Assassin's Creed </em>series were on the way, and that these projects would "revisit some of the games [Ubisoft has] created in the past and modernize them".</p><p><em>Assassin's Creed: Black Flag </em>seems like a pretty solid candidate to kick off Ubisoft's slate of <em>Assassin's Creed </em>remakes, especially given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/skull-and-bones-review-dead-and-buried-already" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="85cef5b0-2392-4049-9109-bfdd7b8e3e95" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">grim fate</a> of the studio's other foray into nautical adventuring in recent years.</p><p>Still, I'd argue that remaking the original game, or perhaps <em>Assassin's Creed III</em>, would be a better shout. These are games with (in my eyes, at least) very clear flaws, so giving them another try and sanding down some of the more troublesome edges makes a lot of sense to me.</p><p><em>Black Flag</em>, by contrast, is still a very good game by today's standards, and as an avowed RPG-element-<em>Assassin's Creed </em>hater, I'm worried Ubisoft is going to drown the seafaring, swashbuckling classic in gear scores and incremental loot.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Given the increasing buzz around the so-called <em>Assassin's Creed: Black Flag Resynced</em>, it may well be that we can expect an official announcement at The Game Awards, which is set to reward some of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-awards-2025-nominees" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a925a006-6874-4d20-831b-d86ee39af97a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">its nominees</a> with shiny trophies later this week.</p><p>We'll have to wait and see whether that announcement surfaces or not.

But hey, at least we are here together to enjoy another installment of <em>Kotaku’s</em> Morning Checkpoint, a daily round-up of video game news and other stuff you might care about. Today, we have data on how well <em>Elden Ring</em>‘s DLC is selling, a weird <em>Stranger Things</em> crossover, and a report of a new 2K studio with connections to that canceled<em> Perfect Dark</em> game.</p> <h2><strong>Bosses Behind Canned<em> Perfect Dark</em> Reboot Reportedly Creating New 2K Studio</strong></h2> <p>First announced in 2020 and then officially revealed in <a href="https://kotaku.com/perfect-dark-xbox-showcase-gameplay-1851528864">2024 with a snazzy gameplay trailer</a>, Xbox’s <em>Perfect Dark</em> reboot had a lot of buzz around it before <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-reportedly-cancels-that-cool-looking-perfect-dark-1851785531">it was canned by Microsoft in July</a>. The studio behind the game, The Initiative, was also shut down. And now, <a href="https://kotaku.com/perfect-dark-canceled-take-two-embracer-xbox-crystal-dynamics-2000622400">following a reported attempt at Take-Two to save</a> <em>Perfect Dark,</em> the publisher behind <em>GTA</em> and<em> NBA 2K</em> has apparently hired two of the bosses behind the canceled reboot and is funding the creation of a new game studio.</p>

<p>In Cyberpunk TCG, players will be tasked with putting together their ultimate edgerunner team by collecting characters from the franchise and putting them up against their friends. Players will receive “stunning custom artwork” with characters from both the base game, Cyberpunk 2077, and the anime adaptation, Edgerunners. The official announcement on <a href="https://x.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1998407444121243803" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) also arrived with a new trailer, showcasing the type of cards players should expect. </p>
