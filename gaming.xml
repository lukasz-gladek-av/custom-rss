Sometimes to chill out I watch timelapse videos of ocean creatures such as starfish colonising patches of sea floor. Perhaps they're gracefully <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HG17TsgV_qI">devouring a seal's carcass</a>, or moving to escape a lethal <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcUouLOmQuU">descending finger of ice</a>. Look, I'm quite a morbid guy, but 'beauty of nature' and all that.
</p>
<p>
It turns out there's an equivalent in Warhorse's recent RPG-palooza <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>: drop dozens of items in a random town square, and passing NPCs will gradually gather them all up according to preferences dictated by class. Here's a video showing that in action, created by Redditor Mcloganator, with three thousand groschen worth of goods to gather.

Hypnotic, yes? We could do with this kind of thing in Bethesda games. The Reddit video has now been circulated on the Xeetbox, and Warhorse programmer and open world scripter Patrik Papšo has chimed in with some thoughts about the social systems powering such wholesome feats of litter collection.
</p>
<p>
"Haha, that's an NPC behaviour I made!" he <a href="https://x.com/BlueX_ow/status/1890444455028600836">wrote</a>. "They choose what they pick based on the value of the item and their social status. That's why nobles might ignore cheap items, but beggars will pick them up." Under the game's node-based AI system, Papšo <a href="https://x.com/BlueX_ow/status/1890788009802350674">explained</a> in a subsequent tweet, when an NPC sees an object dropped by a player, the system checks its price against the NPC's own "social multiplier", then checks to see if another NPC is already picking it up. 
</p>
<p>
Papšo also has some insights in that tweet thread about roads-not-taken. For example, Warhorse once had a system whereby if you dropped a stolen item, the original owner might spot it and trace the theft back to you. The developers cut this feature, however, because it was too difficult for players discarding dozens of items to make the connection between a particular item and suddenly being accused of a crime. There was also once a bug whereby if an NPC "reserved" an object for collection and the player picked it up first, they might filch it from your inventory instead.
</p>
<p>
The soothing, glacial spectacle of Kuttenberg townsfolk swarming a heap of worn-out gambesons aside, I like all this because I can imagine a game where NPCs actively acquire, exchange or discard objects, and you entertain yourself simply following an object's passage from hand to hand. Imagine somebody nicking your favourite boots early on, and flogging them over the black market. A few dozen hours later, you spy somebody else innocently wearing them while traversing a mountain pass.
</p>
<p>
There's probably a simulation that does this? Right now, I can think only of how dwarves claim items for their own use in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dwarf-fortress">Dwarf Fortress</a>.

<p>FromSoftware’s newest project is an interesting tie-in with Bandai Namco. Let’s find out everything we know about Elden Ring Nightreign, its release date, price tag, and much more.</p>



<p>Elden Ring Nightreign gets more surprising by the second. The Game Awards 2024 took everyone by surprise with the announcement of Nightreign. It was even more shocking to realize it’s a collaboration between FromSoftware and giants Bandai Namco! But we’ve learned from the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/after-technical-problems-more-elden-ring-nightreign-test-sessions-possible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nightreign Network Test</a> the new Souls title is a fascinating battle royale and roguelike hybrid.</p>



<p>It’s not a full-scale release, but it has enough content to keep you busy for a few months. That said, let’s dig through the dirt.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-elden-ring-nightreign-coming-out">When is Elden Ring Nightreign Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We were just passing through, good sir. Credit to FromSoftware</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Elden Ring Nightreign is gearing up for a May 30 release date worldwide.</strong></p>



<p>Early indications suggest Early Access isn’t happening for <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring-nightreign" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>. None of its editions or pre-order incentives include mention of playing Nightreign early. This makes May 30 a global launch for FromSoftware and Bandai Namco’s joint title. </p>



<p>Let the wait for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring Nightreign’s release date</a> commence—Tarnished.</p>



<h2 id="h-elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-platforms">Elden Ring Nightreign Release Date Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>Old-gen users will be pleased to learn Elden Ring Nightreign is debuting on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</strong></p>



<p>2022’s Elden Ring also launched on the mentioned formats. However, it’s three years later, and many developers and publishers now opt to skip the PS4 and Xbox One. It’s not the case here, so if you’ve been able to play Elden Ring before, you’ll be able to endure the nightly grid of Elden Ring Nightreign without a fuss.</p>



<p>Additionally, I<em> </em>would be remiss to mention the Nintendo Switch misses out. It’s not much of a shock, but there’s no mention of Nightreign coming to Nintendo Switch. We’ll keep our Two Fingers crossed for a future port to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-editions-amp-price">Elden Ring Nightreign Release Date Editions &amp; Price</h2>



<p><strong>Elden Ring Nightreign Standard Edition, Deluxe Edition, Seeker’s Edition, and Collector’s Edition are releasing to give fans a tough decision over which one to buy. They clock in at $39.99/£34.99, $54.99/£47.99, $59.99/£49.99, and $199.99/£179.99. </strong></p>



<p>There’s no typo here: <strong>Four editions</strong> are available for Elden Ring Nightreign. Each caters to the level of satisfaction you want from your Nightreign experience.</p>



<p>Check out every edition below and its price for a quick table to consult.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Elden RIng Nightreign Edition</th><th data-align="center">Price</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Standard Edition</td><td data-align="center">$39.99 or £34.99</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Deluxe Edition</td><td data-align="center">$54.99 or £47.99</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"> Seeker’s Edition</td><td data-align="center">$59.99 or £49.99</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Collector’s Edition</td><td data-align="center">$199.99 or £179.99</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<hr>



<p>I’m looking forward to Nightreign as a Souls fan. I’m obviously never getting a Bloodborne remake, so a new Elden Ring spin-off should suffice. Should this be the end of Elden RIng after this, freeing up FromSftware a new title?</p>

Doubly so if the competitor is a blindfolded speedrunner who can't see the chat telling him that his webcam is off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, as spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/super-mario/blindfolded-super-mario-64-speedrunner-gets-near-world-record-pace-doesnt-realize-the-runs-been-invalidated-by-a-broken-webcam-until-its-already-over/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GamesRadar</a>, speedrunner Bubzia was working on beating the world record for a blindfolded 70-star run in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-64">Super Mario 64</a>. It's a record he set himself last June at one hour, 25 minutes, and 11 seconds. He'd spent days — 72, at the time of this incident — trying to topple his own record. And on February 10, while on good pace to break his record, Bubzia's webcam shut off.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Yesterday, it finally happened. My webcam died in the beginning of a 70 Star run, and I did not know until I finished an hour later. Luckily, it was a few seconds behind World Record 😅😅 <a href="https://t.co/7BJzFwYHVH" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/7BJzFwYHVH</a></p>— Bubzia (@Bubzia1) <a href="https://twitter.com/Bubzia1/status/1889231128441106440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 11, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Bubzia had been having some difficulties with his webcam before the run started. "That's a new one, dude," he said in a run prior to the big one, where his webcam turned off about one minute and 34 seconds in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The heartbreaker in question would happen after, at 23 minutes and 59 seconds into a really solid run. You can check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svH7ru0XzWQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube VOD</a> of his run to see the chat, in real-time, react. "This could be the funniest WR," one person in chat said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The facecam is crucial because it's required for the run to be valid. On <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/sm64ce?h=Blindfolded-70-star&amp;x=xd17xo7d-38do6x0l.814d20e1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Speedrun.com rules and regulations</a>, it specifically states: "The player must be visibly devoid of sight during the gameplay, i.e. something must be covering the eyes." Ergo, if you couldn't verify Bubzia had his eyes covered the entire time, the run would not qualify.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Having a back-up of some kind, like a notification, might be a thought. But the second category-specific rule says runners can't have any assistance from other people. This includes hints from a Discord call or text-to-voice chat. After the first webcam failure, Bubzia confirmed he had "everything disabled" to alert him in case of a failure, and had received multiple Discord DMs trying to catch his attention while running.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For some viewers, it might be agonizing to watch someone run a game for over an hour, unaware their attempt has been invalid since the 24-minute mark. Bubzia's chat even leaned into the irony, hoping for the runner to <em>not </em>set a world record, to avoid the heartbreak when the blindfold came off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So in that way, it may have been a relief that Bubzia's time came in a few seconds behind the world record. The pace clock concluded at 1:26:09, almost a full minute behind Bubzia's standing record.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If this would have been world record, I would have cried," Bubzia said, after taking off his blindfold and realizing the facecam had been off. "Dude, I would have quit SM64, man." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can follow more attempts from Bubzia, whose facecam is currently working at the time of this writing, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/Bubzia" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on his Twitch here</a>.

            <p>
Characters from Mortal Kombat will finally be able to square up against Street Fighter legends such as Ryu, Chun-Li and Guile - within <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Epic Games' ever-popular battle royale will be the first video game to officially feature characters from both fighting game franchises, when Mortal Kombat crosses over with Fortnite next season. 
</p>
<p>
The announcement that Mortal Kombat would feature in Fortnite came via artwork teasing the game's next battle pass character line-up - in which ice ninja Sub-Zero will star.

<p>
Street Fighter characters have already been part of Fortnite for several years, of course - with Ryu and Chun-Li added as Shop skins back in February 2021, before their fellow fighters Cammy, Guile, Blanka and Sakura all arrived a short time after.
</p>
<p>
Fortnite even paid tribute to Mortal Kombat during this weekend's eye-catching mini live event, which featured a fight to the death between antihero Daigo and demon boss Hunter X. 
</p>
<p>
The showdown, a culmination of Fortnite Chapter 6's story so far, included a moment where Daigo appeared to have been skewered by Hunter X's sword - though there was no Fatality here. Instead, the masked fighter fought back, ultimately appearing to defeat Hunter X for good after slicing off his arm. You can watch the full event below:

<p>Fortnite being Fortnite, of course, there is no blood - or any realistic-looking violence at all. So, it will be interesting to see the extent to which Mortal Kombat's famously gory antics get translated here.</p>
<p>Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 2 is set to arrive later this week, on 21st February, and feature a criminals theme. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-new-crime-season-will-let-you-play-as-a-giant-pickle">Other new character skins are set to include a giant pickle</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Go in, grab what you need, get out, and try not to die. That’s the ethos behind the extraction shooter genre that has blossomed over the past half decade. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/exoborne">Exoborne</a> takes that and wraps an exo-rig around your squishy fleshy body, giving extended movement for you and your buddies as you try to gather resources and do missions under the threat of an evil megacorp and the potential attentions of other players.</p>

<p>Earth has been completely wrecked by a malevolent company ironically branded as Rebirth. Once seen as a final hope against climate change, the STRATOS towers that they had their workers build only worsened the forces of nature in a coordinated action, leaving even more apocalyptic storms to ravage what’s left of mankind. And what of the remains of civilisation? Just as Rebirth’s lie was uncovered, they hijacked all of the exo-rigs of their workers, turning them on innocent civilians and protestors.</p>


<p>You’re one of those who was able to break free, detaching your suit from the network and joining the resistance movement as the towers start to ominously come back online. Your role is to head out into Colton County, scavenge for valuable resources from Rebirth and the general area, and bring it back to base.</p>
<p>Sharkmob –&nbsp;last seen with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/05/11/bloodhunt-review-ps5-vampire-the-masquerade/">Vampire: The Masquerade –&nbsp;Bloodhunt battle royale</a> –&nbsp;has created a large open world map for their extraction shooter to take place in. It goes beyond roads being littered with abandoned and destroyed vehicles, with bridges having collapsed, the terrain having shifted, and now with major weather events just rolling into the world every ten minutes or so. And when I say major, I’m talking fire tornados, incessant lightning storms that make wearing a lot of metal feel really, really dumb, and more.</p>


<p>As they roll through the world, they’re both a danger and a boon to you. They can transform parts of the map and reveal new points of interest and loot, or more fundamentally, they will often kick up the wind so that you can use just hop up, trigger your paraglide and zoom across the world – it’s great for getting around quickly. Combined with your exo-rig’s grappling hook, this really gives off echoes of mid-2010s Call of Duty and Just Cause here.</p>
<p>Deploying into Coulton County, you pick and choose what gear to take with you. You can have a main gun and sidearm, you need to pack ammo, health kits, a daypack for a larger inventory, and throwables and tactical gear. These are paired with exo-rigs that each have distinct abilities, such as a ground-pounding attack or a force of wind that can knock enemies away.</p>
<p>The first thing to decide is where you actually want to go and what to do&nbsp;–&nbsp;you’ve got 20 minutes before Rebirth can run a trace and reveal your location to other players, and you’re dropping into a dynamic world where teams can join partway through. Opening up the map reveals the scale of this region, but there’s also just a bunch of vague icons and points of interest that don’t really mean that much to me yet – there’s a series of assignments and missions, but early on, they’re things like “extract successfully 2 times”.</p>
<p>This is PvPvE, so heading to map markers will have you running into NPCs to fight, often human, but sometimes Rebirth’s robots and drones. On one occasion, we happened across a downed Rebirth VTOL that had a door to hack open as we fended up a steady stream of bipedal bots, suicide balls and larger minigun bots. We booked it out of there as soon as we’d emptied the cache of its rewards… not least because the VTOL self destructed moments after the doors opened!</p>

<p>It’s tricky to distinguish between the human NPCs and real players, though. Most of our run-ins with other players felt like they were a complete surprise, where the main distinguishing factors were their approach to combat and that they would be downed instead of simply killed off. Of course, if they’re shooting down on an exfiltration point from an overlooking bridge, you can put 2 and 2 together to figure out they’re other players springing a trap.</p>
<p>There’s that rush and relief if you manage to get away as another team tries to take you out, alternating with the annoyance and loss of being wiped out at the last moment. That’s the genre, though, and if you don’t make it out, it’s not just your loot that you’re leaving behind, but all of your gear as well. You’ll then have to buy it all again, or draw from your stash of exo-rigs, guns and other gear.</p>
<p>If you’re on a bad run, that can really sap all of your reserves, and there’s no way to insure your gear against loss. Instead Exoborne has a fallback baseline Exo that can’t be modded, can’t have equipment, but has that core functionality, letting you go scavenging on the entry-level map and tiers without risk.</p>

<p>We’ve only scratched the surface of what Exoborne offers, and from our handful of runs during the latest Exoborne playtest, I think there’s something potentially really appealing to this take on the genre. It’s toeing that line between mil-sims and sci-fi shenanigans, having to lean heavily on the ostentatious weather effects to stand out from that generic military feel, but then that should appeal to a certain cachet of gamers who decry over-the-top cosmetics. Also, the audio-visual feedback as you land shots and crack armour is right up there with the best of them.</p>
<p>Oh, and I’m happy to report that jumping into the rotor of the extraction VTOL will down you immediately.</p>

            <p>Sweden-based developer Liquid Swords has today announced an unspecified number of layoffs.</p>
<p>The NetEase-backed studio was formed in 2020 by Christofer Sundberg, whose name you may recognise from Just Cause's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/avalanche-studios">Avalanche Studios</a>, which he co-founded.</p>
<p>Liquid Swords is yet to launch its first game, and today announced plans to "reduce its workforce as part of an effort to scale back operations and adapt to current business conditions".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.liquidswords.com/news/liquid-swords-announces-proposed-workforce-reduction-amid-business-challenges">message on the company's website</a>, Liquid Swords cited "the present challenges of the video game industry" as a reason for the layoffs. It said this move is "intended to ensure the studio’s long-term sustainability" as it continues to work on its debut game.</p>
<p>"I promised our employees and shareholders success and to build a studio redefining game development with a small, expert-driven team and a sustainable work model. While we achieved much of this, shifting market conditions prevented us from succeeding within our timeframe," Sundberg said in a statement.</p>
<p>"As a result, we must part ways with talented individuals who have been instrumental in our journey. This is incredibly difficult, but we remain committed to our vision and will continue to work on our IP and first game with a dedicated team."</p>
<p>Despite changes within its team, Liquid Swords believes these layoffs "will not prevent" the studio from "realising its original ambition".</p>

<p>Liquid Swords is not the only NetEase-backed studio to have been impacted recently. In November, Mac Walters - the veteran writer and producer who worked on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> for almost two decades - announced a "pause" in operations at his NetEase-backed AAA game studio, Worlds Untold. Its team had been developing a near-future action adventure game set "in a breathtaking world filled with mystery and exploration", backed by investment cash from the Chinese game giant.</p>
<p>Then, last month, Jar of Sparks - the Seattle-based "AAA" studio established by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo-infinite">Halo Infinite</a> head of design Jerry Hook back in 2022 - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-infinite-head-of-designs-netease-studio-halting-work-on-first-game-as-it-searches-for-new-publisher">halted work its currently-unannounced first title as it searched for a new publishing partner</a>, stating it's looking to "find all of our team new homes" as a result.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-infinite-head-of-design-jerry-hook-leading-new-netease-studio-jar-of-sparks">Jar of Sparks was initially unveiled in July 2022</a>, it was described as a first-party developer for Chinese publisher NetEase that would focus on creating the "next generation of narrative-driven action games".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer would like to know if video games journalism is OK. He is concerned that the "whole space is gonna go away or be corrupted by things". He mourns the heyday of magazines, and is bemused by this "SEO" malarkey he keeps hearing about. Much like a Dickensian child holding out a bowl for more gruel, he wants to know if there's still a "path" for "people with a real honest voice".
</p><!--more-->
<p>
All that's from <a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/02/15/xboxera-interviews-phil-spencer/">an interview with XboxEra</a>, in which they whimsically "flip the script" by having Big Spencer ask the interviewer a question. I'm quite glad I am not one of XboxEra's interviewers, because if Phil Spencer had asked me this question I would have exhaled so dramatically I would have jet-propelled myself backwards through the wall and into near-Earth orbit.
</p>
<p>
"People who talk about video games, like the state of the game industry, press and community and all of that, it's just in constant evolution," Spencer began. "You see it, just like the industry itself. But I'm just curious, like from where you sit. Should we, as people who are someone who consumes content - I'm on YouTube, I'm reading stuff. How should we feel about the state of people like yourselves who get to talk about video games? Should we be worried that that whole space is gonna go away or become corrupted by things? Like people with a real honest voice? And just who want to kind of talk constructively about an industry they love? Is there a path for them?" 
</p>
<p>
XboxEra writer Jon Clarke responded by talking about the damaging influence of "rage bait" reporting, which he thinks is the "biggest problem that the industry faces across the board". XboxEra don't go in for any of that nonsense, he added.
</p>
<p>
"Yeah, I love that," quoth Almighty Phil. "No, I love it because it's something that makes me long for magazine subscriptions, where you subscribe to a magazine and that's kind of where you guys are, right? And it's you're paying on a regular basis for the quality of the dialogue.
</p>
<p>
"But otherwise it's just too.... what do they call it? Search engine optimization or something like that?" he impishly continued. "And I have friends in the industry. I obviously do something different, but as somebody who's looking for kind of balanced discussion, not all positive - we should be constructive and talk about things that aren't working for us as players as well. Sorry to make it a heavy question but it is where my head's at."
</p>
<p>
Let's imagine that, having been launched into near-Earth orbit by my own sighs of despair, I now explosively re-enter the room through the opposite wall, stripped naked by atmospheric winds and coated in a thick melange of mosquitoes and condor poo. There is time, as I somersault through the briefing chamber with dictaphone wildly extended, to scream some rapidfire observations of my own. 
</p>
<p>
"PHIL! Phil. I too miss the days when people paid for video games journalism, regularly or irregularly. I too dislike writing headlines such as What Is Doom: The Dark <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> For Fortnite Fans Free Horses Fast. But Phil, this is the equivalent of the high school bully asking us why we are hitting ourselves. Your company makes <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar24/">billions</a> from Search! Those "friends in the industry" you allude to have been trying to steal Google's pie for decades and now, they're devising software that turns searching for websites into a process of auto-regurgitating cliffnotes from those websites and cutting off whatever ad revenue we have!"
</p>
<p>
"Avoiding rage bait?" I would continue on my next orbit through the room, now gripping pieces of satellite fuselage and tarred absolutely purple by air friction. "Your company helped invent the concept of "console wars", Phil! I know you prefer the Kumbaya rising-tide-lifts-all-ships rhetoric these days, but it wasn't that long ago that Xbox execs were getting former PlayStation exclusives <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/classic-e3-moments-xboxs-greatest-triumphs/">tattooed on their arms</a>. Talk constructively about an industry we love? How are we supposed to do that when you keep <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-toss-another-650-jobs-onto-the-layoff-pyre-in-the-name-of-sustainable-future-growth">laying people off</a>?"
</p>
<p>
"Help us bring back the glory days, Phil!" I would shriek, as I disappeared for a third time over the horizon. "Refound Official Xbox Magazine and donate it to the Internet Archive! Go pour glue into Copilot's personality core! Rehire Arkane Austin! Turn Halo Studios into a worker's cooperative! Cede The Coalition to the CBC!" The interview would continue in this staggered fashion until the urgency of my gesticulating finally overpowered Earth's gravity, and I disappeared forever into the last place not corrupted by capitalism.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/why-you-should-play-monster-hunter-world-before-wilds<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">As one of Steam’s most pre-ordered games right now, we know <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is going to be massive. We also know that Wilds will be some people’s first Monster Hunter game. While we’re sure it will have a solid enough tutorial for newcomers, the series is undeniably dense and complex, and so if Wilds is your first go at hunting monsters you may find value in trying one of the previous games first. So before hopping into the vast and dangerous expanse of Monster Hunter Wilds, there’s one game we really recommend you check out: 2018’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-world">Monster Hunter: World</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We don’t recommend Wold because of some big narrative tie-in or cliffhanger ending that will leave you lost and confused when you embark on Wild's central plotline. We suggest it simply because Monster Hunter: World is the game that most closely resembles Wilds’ style and structure. Playing World is a great way to onboard yourself and prepare for the sometimes obtuse systems and gameplay loop the series lives and thrives on.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/11/08/monsterhunterworld-blogroll-1516867463450-1667927878979.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Monster Hunter: World shares much in common with the upcoming Monster Hunter Wilds. | Image credit: Capcom</figcaption></figure></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Why Monster Hunter: World?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve kept up with Capcom’s recent releases, you might already be asking, “Should I not play <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a>, the most recent game in the series, rather than go back to Monster Hunter: World?” It’s a valid question. But while Rise is the most recent Monster Hunter (and a very good game!), it's clear that Monster Hunter Wilds is a direct successor to 2018’s World rather than 2021’s Rise. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rise may have refined the series’ signature gameplay with rideable mounts, the high-flying Wirebug grapple mechanic, and a few other flashy tricks, but they arrived at the expense of some of the larger and more layered seamless zones that World boasted. You see, while Rise is available on every platform these days, it was originally built for the Nintendo Switch, and that console’s more modest specs informed several of the creative decisions. This resulted in an emphasis on speed and smaller scale zones, which expedited the hunt-upgrade-hunt gameplay loop but lost some of the larger scale and fascinating friction of World. It is those elements that Rise dropped that Wilds seems to be trying to recapture and build upon. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>World feels like the blueprint that Wilds’ much larger open areas are drawing from. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter: World features large zones and an emphasis on tracking monsters and other living beings through a detailed ecosystem, and so World feels like the blueprint that Wilds’ much larger open areas are drawing from. This is why we believe World is the perfect game to prepare you for what’s to come. Those more open zones, which act as stages for long, thrilling hunts stretched across wide swathes of varied terrain, is where modern Monster Hunter shines. We expect Wilds to deliver on all that, but why wait when you can get an early, informative taste of it in World?  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite seeming like a direct successor, it’s important to note that Monster Hunter Wilds’ story isn't a continuation of the tale told in World. However, World’s approach to story and campaign structure will set your expectations appropriately for the direction of Wilds’ story. You’ll meet staple organizations like the Hunter’s Guild governing body, as well as your adorable feline sidekicks, the Palicos, all of which will be present in Wilds. However, these elements will be wholly unconnected from previous (and, most likely, future) entries. Think of all this as being like the Final Fantasy series, in which each entry is known to feature your bearded friend Cid, a massive Behemoth, bright yellow Chocobos, and other defining monsters roaming throughout the land, but all the games are distinct and unconnected, which allows every entry to put its own stamp on classic ideas.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Practice, Practice, Practice</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Above and beyond getting a preliminary understanding of the Monster Hunter universe and how the Wilds’ campaign will be structured, the strongest case for playing Monster Hunter: World first lies in the game's challenging combat. Monster Hunter Wilds’ action is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Weapons">built around 14 weapons</a>, each with their own playstyle and strategies. All 14 of them are also present in Monster Hunter: World, which means you can get a headstart on becoming comfortable with the eclectic systems that govern this series’ genuinely one-of-a-kind combat. Diving into World is a great way to familiarize yourself with each weapon’s techniques and decide which one suits your personal tastes and playstyle the best. Whether it's the quick and flashy dual-blades or the hulking greatsword, each weapon in Monster Hunter is distinct and demands focus to master. So consider Monster Hunter: World a training ground where you can learn weapon basics and build up proficiency. By the time you get to Wilds, you’ll be well on your way to becoming a master of your craft. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2017/10/31/monster-hunter-world-pgw-01-26267147179-o-1509411295879.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Learning the intricacies of bows, swords, and switch axes is a big part of Monster Hunter. | Image credit: Capcom</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the Monster Hunter series your weapon is everything. You don't level up and gain skill points through experience or other traditional RPG mechanics. Instead, all of your abilities and stats are delivered through your weapon. Think of your weapon like a character class or job in a more traditional action RPG – each one dictates your role on the battlefield and how you approach each and every hunt. Playing World will teach you how these weapons can be leveled up using parts collected from slain monsters, and how to build toward the higher-level weapons on your weapon tree.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Furthermore, World teaches you early on that you can't just mash your attack button through most situations. The positioning of your character and angle of your attacks are the key to victory, rather than raw damage output. Knowledge of where on a monster’s body your weapon can have the most impact is half the battle. The Longsword is great for slicing off monsters' tails or long appendages, for instance, while the hammer is great for knocking enemies over by bonking them on the head hard enough. Knowing how best to utilize a specific weapon can turn the tide of any battle and set you up for success, so it's certainly worth hopping into Monster Hunter: World and getting familiar with where you can deal devastating damage to your enemies. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Having a solid understanding of the tempo of each hunt will be a huge advantage going into Wilds. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Your weapon is only one piece of World’s equation though. The Slinger is a tool attached to your hunter's left arm that allows you to use special gadgets and ammunition in a fight. Learning when to shoot a Flash Pod to blind an enemy monster or toss out some poison knives for chip damage can make or break a fight. The Slinger returns in Wilds, and knowing how to pepper in shots throughout a fight will take your game to the next level. You'll need to craft Slinger ammo from ingredients gathered from the environment, so having some familiarity with World’s crafting menus and recipes will go a long way when you start using Wilds’ own versions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you've got to grips with World’s weapons and tools you'll begin to peel back the Monster Hunter series’ other recurring layers. Your general gameplay loop begins with following monster tracks, hoping to uncover the whereabouts of the beast in question. Along the way you'll use your pickaxe to mine ore, gather some honey for potion crafting, and grab whatever other materials you find along the way to the monster's location. It all becomes second-nature after a while, and having a solid understanding of the tempo of each hunt will be a huge advantage going into Wilds. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A hunt is not about rushing in, getting a quick kill, and moving on. Each expedition is designed to take some time, especially on the first go around. Learning how to dance with the fire-breathing Anjanath is leagues away from understanding the best equipment to prepare against something like the bomb-dropping Bazelgeuse, but understanding all of the different facets of these creatures builds foundational knowledge. And with Monster Hunter Wilds looking to capture the scope and scale of these adventures in a similar way to how World revels in the spectacle, it means the 2018 entry is the ideal training ground. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Plus, if you need yet another reason to check out Monster Hunter World ahead of Wilds’ release, you can get some free Palico armor if you import save data from World into Wilds, and an additional set of armor if you have data from World’s massive Iceborne expansion. It's a small thing, but dressing up your Palico never gets old. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While you never need to play a prior Monster Hunter game before starting a new one, Capcom’s RPG is a distinctly different animal than any other game out there. While the developer has been working hard to make the learning curve easier with each new game, there are so many unique systems that really the only way to truly prepare for Monster Hunter is by playing Monster Hunter. While there will be many who will find joy jumping right into the new game blind, there's never been a better time to try out Monster Hunter: World and familiarize yourself with the vernacular and community ahead of Wilds’ launch on February 28, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jesse Vitelli is a freelance writer and published author.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/liquid-swords-layoffs-just-cause-creator<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Liquid Swords, the studio founded by&nbsp;<em>Just Cause&nbsp;</em>franchise creator Christofer Sundberg, has announced a round of layoffs, making it the latest NetEase studio to be hit by funding cuts or downsizing efforts.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.liquidswords.com/news/liquid-swords-announces-proposed-workforce-reduction-amid-business-challenges" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on the official Liquid Swords website, the studio says the layoffs are part of "an effort to scale back operations and adapt to current business conditions", which is becoming an increasingly common refrain across the industry.</p>

<p>Liquid Swords goes on to say that the layoffs will go towards ensuring the studio's "long-term sustainability" as it continues to work on its debut title, so it sounds as though that game - whatever it may be - hasn't been canceled, at the very least.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/liquid-swords-layoffs-just-cause-4.jpg?itok=OpWO8Crq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/liquid-swords-layoffs-just-cause-4.jpg?itok=FsS_BBOJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Liquid Swords founder Christofer Sundberg created the&nbsp;<em>Just Cause&nbsp;</em>franchise.</figcaption></figure><p>Sundberg says that his mission with Liquid Swords is to "build a studio redefining game development with a small, expert-driven team and a sustainable business model", and that "shifting market conditions" forced him to "part ways with talented individuals".</p>

<p>Despite this, Sundberg says he and Liquid Swords remain "committed to [their] vision" for the debut game and that work on the project will continue.</p>

<p>The game has yet to be announced, but Liquid Swords says it's "confident that this extremely unfortunate setback will not prevent it from realizing its original ambition" for the title. Here's hoping that we get an announcement for it at some point in the future.</p>

<p>Liquid Swords was originally founded <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/avalanche-studios-founder-announces-new-studio-liquid-swords" rel="nofollow">back in 2020</a>. Helmed by Sundberg, the studio also includes alumni from franchises like&nbsp;<em>Battlefield</em>,&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Payday</em>.</p>

<p>It's not just NetEase studios, either; other smaller indie outfits are closing their doors or cancelling projects too, including the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/casey-hudson-humanoid-origin-closed-down" rel="nofollow">Casey Hudson's Humanoid Origin</a>&nbsp;and Dr. Disrespect's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/midnight-society-shutdown-dr-disrespect" rel="nofollow">former studio Midnight Society</a>, among many others.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-split-fiction-cross-platform-crossplay-status-explained/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Split Fiction encourages co-op, and adding cross-platform play would facilitate this wonderfully. Hazelight Studios has a sterling reputation for letting you play its games with friends, and crossplay would make exploring Split Fiction’s vibrant and volatile world a pal-friendly pleasure.</p>



<p>Gaming’s interconnectivity has changed for the better in the last few years. It’s gotten to the point where more games have crossplay and cross-platform integration than those that don’t. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a>‘s co-op-centric ideology encourages players to join together as the game has to be played with another player.</p>



<p>You can play Split Fiction together on the same console, but let’s see if crossplay is enabled.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-split-fiction-have-crossplay-or-cross-platform">Does Split Fiction Have Crossplay or Cross-Platform?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>I want to ride a dragon. Credit to Hazelight Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Split Fiction includes complete crossplay and cross-platform features—allowing you to enjoy the co-op romp with another player playing on a different format.</strong></p>



<p>In layman’s terms, if you want to play Split Fiction and you have a PS5, but your friend is on Xbox Series X, crossplay allows you to join forces, despite playing on different consoles. The same goes if you’re on PC and your buddy is on PC, and so forth.</p>



<p>The news comes courtesy of <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/ea-originals-discussion-en/announcement--faq-split-fiction%E2%84%A2---launching-march-6-2025---pre-order-now/5037251" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Split Fiction’s official FAQ</a>. Under the “<strong>Will the game be available to play online?</strong>” question, the answer succinctly states “You can play the game online with cross-play enabled.” You don’t need to worry about <em>how </em>you own Split Fiction or owning two copies!</p>



<h2 id="h-does-split-fiction-have-friend-s-pass">Does Split Fiction Have Friend’s Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>Hazelight Studios brings back the Friend’s Pass scheme for Split Fiction, allowing one person to own the game and invite another player to enjoy the title for free.</strong></p>



<p>Friend’s Pass is also available for the developer’s other titles: A Way Out and It Takes Two. Both are acclaimed co-op games, and Friend’s Pass ensures you can play with another player without you both needing a copy of the title.</p>



<p>You’d think this might affect sales, but quite the opposite. A Way Out has reportedly sold over nine million copies and counting.</p>



<div><article><p><span>A Way Out has now sold more than 9 million units! 💥

The development was a wild ride and the game was already a success back when it released. But even then, we never dared to dream of THIS many people playing our game! 😍

With that said, we will continue to look back at… </span></p></article></div>



<p>Whereas It Takes Two went one better in every way. Not only did it scoop multiple Game of the Year awards in 2021, but it’s also sold a staggering 20+ million copies!</p>



<div><article><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ItTakesTwo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#ItTakesTwo</a><span> HAS SOLD OVER 20 MILLION!!!

You’re the best fans in the world, how you have embraced our game is blowing our minds! ❤️

We’re so grateful to every one of the millions upon millions who have enjoyed their time with Cody and May 😍 </span></p></article></div>



<p>Split Fiction looks to be another winner for Hazelight Studios. It has Friend’s Pass—meaning only one of you needs to own it—and looks to recapture the magic of its predecessors.</p>



<hr>



<p>So, Split Fiction has crossplay and cross-platform compatibility and has Friend’s Pass. It’s a win-win all around, and Split Fiction should be in the GOTY conversation come the end of 2025. Or do you disagree? Offer your thoughts if you feel different.</p>

            <p>We're just a day away from the launch of Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage, the new game from the team behind the first two <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> games, following a lengthy development and an unusual delay into 2025.
</p>
<p>Video games often skirt the launch of rivals to avoid launch date clashes on the release calendar, but the situation was more unique for Lost Records' team, in that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/original-life-is-strange-team-delays-new-game-to-avoid-new-lis-launch-date">the clash it wanted to avoid was for the latest entry in the series it initially founded</a>. 
</p>
<p>In this interview (conducted all the way back at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> last year!) I ask Life is Strange and now Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage's creative director Michel Koch about the game's postponement (before its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-nod-delays-second-half-of-lost-records-bloom-rage-for-optimisation-and-refinement">concluding half's further delay</a>), the thinking behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-creators-lost-records-launches-in-two-parts">its split into two episodes</a>, and where the series - if successful - could go next, now Life is Strange is being handled elsewhere.</p>

<p>
<strong>Life is Strange was always a multi-part series, though more recent entries developed after you guys' left the franchise have been standalone - what was the thinking behind splitting Bloom &amp; Rage, and why did you decide on launching in two halves?</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Michel Koch:</strong> I noticed that I'm not invested as much in Netflix shows, I binge them and then forget them very quickly sometimes. And then I was watching some TV shows on Apple TV and HBO, where they are sticking to weekly releases, and I found that I was investing way more. And we were thinking, we made some good episodic games, why not still go for at least a part of that? </p>
<p>It also makes a lot of sense for the story. You know, the game is called Bloom &amp; Rage, so Tape 1 will be Bloom, and Tape 2 will be Rage. The game's past takes place over the summer of 1995, so Tape 1 is July, and Tape 2 is August. And there is an event - there is something that happens at the end of Tape 1 that makes sense to stop the game there and to reflect a bit, to just let the player take their time. To maybe play something else, wait a bit, think about what happened, and then go back to Tape 2, hopefully even more invested in the story, because you have had some time to reflect on what happened, and maybe talked with your friends or to other people online.
</p>
<p>
<strong>So the split was decided later on?</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Koch:</strong> We decided around two years ago, it was not right at the beginning, at conception, but we decided to split it so it makes sense for the story, for editing, pacing.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Another big decision was the delay to 2025, to avoid launching against Life is Strange: Double Exposure. What made your mind up about needing to hold off? Were you sad to see Life is Strange plant its release date flag in the ground first?</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Koch:</strong> There are not many narrative games with like, double A or high-quality. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a> is one, Lost Records is another. We thought, as players, I would love that the games are not coming at exactly the same time, as I want to play both. And for us as developers, it also gives us a bit more breathing room to polish things better.

<p><strong>One of the similarities between Life is Strange and Lost Records seems to be some kind of supernatural element to the game, which we can see in the trailer. There's some purple glowing light in the forest, but we don't yet know what. How far are you going to take the magic, or magic realism?</strong></p><p>
<strong>Koch:</strong> Magical realism is definitely important in our previous games, and is important also again here. As you saw in the trailers, the characters see something in the woods that we are hinting at. But we're still telling a story about a group of friends that is anchored in reality. We want magic to be a catalyst, to be something that makes things have higher stakes, and it will be more and more present as the game advances to the end. But it's more like the magic realism will bring more tension to the group, and to what's happening around some antagonists we cannot talk about yet. If you watch a show like Twin Peaks, this is the kind of magical realism we are going for, rather than full magic. I wouldn't expect some full sci-fi supernatural, high stakes power, or anything that's too major.
</p>
<p>
<strong>So you're not getting into the midichlorians of it all?</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Koch:</strong> [Joking] Maybe we should change that... No, of course not. I think we never did in our previous games either. We are building this universe, so it doesn't mean that we don't know about it, what it is. It's a brand new IP that we are working on, it's the first game in that IP - and that's a good thing, even if it's both frightening and very liberating to be able to do that. But with the team, with the writers, we are also building this game knowing that we can come back to universe. We can come back to some characters, to some plot points, to some other threads within this world, and definitely the magic is part of that, as something we can revisit. So we know what it is about, but we don't want to make it too central to the story itself, because it's really the story of this group of four friends.

</figure>
<p>
<strong>So the plan is that these characters can come back? Or... some of them can?</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Koch:</strong> Yes, though the thing is we are still telling a full story with this game, we really want to make sure that the players have their whole character arc and journey, and that whatever blend of endings they get in the past and in the present is a full tale. But we are definitely starting to know how we could have the characters come back, what other stories we could tell, what side stories we could work around  in this universe. It will also depend on the player reception, of course, and we love that we have the opportunity to also look at which characters players are loving the most. What can come back to and add to the world? 
</p>
<p>
I love the work of Stephen King, and what he does in The Dark Tower, where he does feature characters from some of his other books. And I'm not saying that we are doing that, but it's a major highlight that he did, and it's some of the idea that we could try to be able to build our foundations and make sure that we can.
</p>
<p>
<strong>I look forward to your Stephen King self-insert. Or maybe leave that to David Cage.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Koch:</strong> [laughs] We are still making, again, a game about teenagers, but this time, we are really making a game about the adults remembering when they were teenagers. And we really wanted to push that. A lot of times the adults comment on what you're doing, and it helped us to have that contrast between what the 90s were - the flaws of the time, where something that we said back then, we wouldn't say today - and the adults are able to comment about that. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>As with Life is Strange, I guess it's again about balancing you making a game about teenagers as an adult, and also not feeling like you're talking down to anyone.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Koch:</strong> It is a balance, and it's something we've adjusted a lot. We have this younger designer who joined us who's played the game and provided good feedback. She's said 'oh, this is very Boomer-like, maybe you should remove it'. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>But maybe sometimes you want a bit of Boomer, to show these now-adults are from a different generation. </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Koch:</strong> Yeah, it's cool, it's a challenge but it's really interesting to try to blend both generations in, and make it interesting for both.

<p>Liquid Swords, the video game studio founded by Avalanche Studios founder Christofer Sunberg, has announced its plans to hold layoffs at the company.</p>



<p>The announcement was made via a post on the <a href="https://www.liquidswords.com/news/liquid-swords-announces-proposed-workforce-reduction-amid-business-challenges" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">studio’s website</a>.</p>



<p>According to the announcement, the decision was made after an “evaluation of Liquid Swords’ financial situation and the present challenges of the video game industry.” It was added that the moves are being done to “ensure the studio’s long-term sustainability”.</p>



<h6 id="h-related-exclusive-10-10-games-employees-offered-no-severance-layoffs-happened-while-on-holiday-and-more">RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/1010-games-employees-offered-no-severance-laid-off-while-on-holiday-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EXCLUSIVE: 10:10 Games Employees Offered No Severance, Layoffs Happened While On Holiday, And More</a></h6>



<p>“I promised our employees and shareholders success and to build a studio redefining game development with a small, expert-driven team and a sustainable work model,” Sunberg said. “While we achieved much of this, shifting market conditions prevented us from succeeding within our timeframe. As a result, we must part ways with talented individuals who have been instrumental in our journey. This is incredibly difficult, but we remain committed to our vision and will continue to work on our IP and first game with a dedicated team.”</p>



<p>There was no mention of the number of people being let go nor how many people remain with the company. Insider Gaming has reached out to Liquid Swords for clarification after this round of layoffs.</p>



<p>Sundberg added that the studio “remains focused” on its vision of “simplifying the game development process to create exceptional gaming experiences for players.”</p>



<p>Liquid Swords is currently working on its first game, which is described as “a narrative-driven, open-world, hardboiled AAA revenge story” that is developed in Unreal Engine 5. No other details on the game are known.</p>



<p>In 2025, there have been <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">nearly 1,000 estimated jobs</a> lost due to layoffs a cross 30 companies. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-2m-two-weeks<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warhorse Studios has announced that&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>has hit another huge sales milestone, and the game hasn't even been on general release for two weeks yet.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/WarhorseStudios/status/1891487776421638643" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X earlier today, the studio announced that its realistic medieval RPG has passed the two million sales mark, calling the achievement a "triumph" and thanking players who contributed to the game's sales.</p>

<p>Of course,&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>passing the two million mark probably won't come as a surprise to you if you've been following its progress. After all, the game passed a million sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-1m" rel="nofollow">on its launch day</a>, and parent company Embracer Group announced sales were nearing two million <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-2m-embracer" rel="nofollow">just last week</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-2m-marriage.jpg?itok=sduZLym2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-2m-marriage.jpg?itok=dmp3uDfR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>has passed the two million sales mark.</figcaption></figure><p>As a reminder, the original&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance&nbsp;</em>took <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-sales-six-million" rel="nofollow">six years to pass the six million mark</a>, eventually reaching eight million <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-sales-8m" rel="nofollow">by November last year</a>.</p>

<p>While there is, of course, no guarantee that the sequel will continue the momentum it's currently gathered, there's every chance that&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>will pass the six million point in a fraction of the time it took its predecessor to do so.</p>

<p>It looks like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-rumors-director" rel="nofollow">those wild rumors about the game's content</a>, which director&nbsp;Daniel Vávra shot down prior to&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>'s release, have done absolutely nothing to dull its edge when it comes to popularity.</p>

<p>Lest you worry that the RPG is slowing down now that it's finally out there in the wild, you can think again.&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-roadmap" rel="nofollow">has a roadmap in place</a> for the future, and it promises tons of new stuff for the game. Not only that, but <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-mod-support" rel="nofollow">official mod support via Steamworks</a> is also on the way.</p>




<p>In case you're not up to speed,&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>is a medieval RPG created by Czech studio Warhorse.</p>

<p>Like its predecessor, the game eschews overt fantasy elements in favor of historical accuracy and realism. It takes place in early 15th-century Bohemia and sees protagonist Henry of Skalitz once again navigating a perilous world of political intrigue.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771300/Kingdom_Come_Deliverance_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/9n4w31hsmvvd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. Our Ashley <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-review-deliciously-executed-revenge" rel="nofollow">gave the game a glowing review</a>, praising its huge variety of activities and "outstanding" visual design.</p>

Companion characters who feel the need to comment at the end of every battle, but say nothing of interest or worth, and then say it over and over and <em>over</em> again. Maybe it could not be a thing?</p><p>I <em>love</em>&nbsp;<em>Avowed</em>, I’ve been so fortunate to have had code for a couple of weeks before its release, but no deadline to finish it by—this has allowed me to really sink into it, to explore its sprawling Living Lands at my own pace, never pressured to reach a story beat. I spent the 25 to 30 hours the game is supposed to last reaching just its midpoint, and am still in no hurry. I suppose you could argue that I should be slightly more motivated to speed up given the scale and danger of the Dreamscourge, but I’m not able to live in denial of its spread being entirely beholden to my advancing the plot. The plague can wait, because I just saw what might be a hidden cave entrance and it could end up being a whole other dungeon to explore.</p><p>The catch is, I’ve survived a <em>lot</em> of battles, big and small, primarily skirmishes with Xaurips or spiders who are hanging out in the next valley I’m poking my nose into, defiantly fought entirely with my bow and arrow. And every single time, every single one of them, one of my two companions feels the need to comment on it. But each appears equipped with only two or three different things to say. So dear God, I’ve heard them all so many bloody times.</p><p>“Another glorious battle!” bellows Kai, my constant companion (I can no more leave him in camp than I could when he was in his Garrus incarnation in <em>Mass Effect</em>), following our killing a bunch of halfwits who couldn’t be talked out of trying to kill us. No, Kai, no it wasn’t. It was ignominious at best, and more realistically, fairly grotesque. His cheering in delight after I’ve been forced to slaughter some dumb-dumbs rebels who wouldn’t listen to calm reason makes me think there’s something really very wrong with him.</p><figure id="" data-id="276e820ccd0e9bcf568831e79f0b56c4" data-recommend-id="image://276e820ccd0e9bcf568831e79f0b56c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Some very pretty fireworks during a boos fight." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Some very pretty fireworks during a boos fight." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="276e820ccd0e9bcf568831e79f0b56c4" data-recommend-id="image://276e820ccd0e9bcf568831e79f0b56c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Some very pretty fireworks during a boos fight." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Far worse occurred with another companion after a significant story event that I shall not spoil. Let’s put it this way: everything she’s known and loved has just been destroyed, she’s distraught, and seconds later, on stumbling into a group of sentient toadstools or the like, she’s straight back to happily cheering me on and celebrating wins.</p><p>Or how about one companion discovered later on who, <em>every single time</em> she uses her “dispel” ability, says the same two things. “What, like it’s hard?” and “Child’s play.” Both things. Every time. And neither of them makes <em>any</em> sense in context.</p><figure id="" data-id="531e3d97358421b5f26800921aa10599" data-recommend-id="image://531e3d97358421b5f26800921aa10599" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="My character staring down at the rocky wilderness of the Living Lands." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="My character staring down at the rocky wilderness of the Living Lands." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="531e3d97358421b5f26800921aa10599" data-recommend-id="image://531e3d97358421b5f26800921aa10599" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="My character staring down at the rocky wilderness of the Living Lands." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Avowed</em> deserves so much better than this! The game has fantastic writing throughout, with a really lovely group of chums to chat to, and banter between them all in camp is a real treat to stand still and listen to. So why, for the love of all things <em>why</em>, does each only have three things they say at the end of every fight?!</p><p>Given the verbose nature of Obsidian and BioWare’s RPGs, and how the voice actors must be spending days and days in the recording studio performing their billions of lines, why can’t they each just have a couple of dozen different post-fight lines to drop? It’d add, what, ten minutes to the recording time? And it’s not exactly a Herculean writing task. Watch, I’ll do some now:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>“Phew, glad we were able to put that lot down so quickly.”</li><li>“Hey, I think you clipped my ear with one of your shots that time!”</li><li>“Ha! They really thought they could beat us, didn’t they?”</li><li>“I told my parents it was worth spending so much time practicing with this bow.”</li><li>“Well, if they weren’t all dead, I think they’d have to admit they were impressed.”</li></ul><p>That was a minute’s work, and no, none of them is particularly good, but then nor is any line any companion has ever said in any game in the same circumstances. They’re certainly up there with Marius telling me that he’s pulled his shoulder for the 786th time.</p><p>All of them would be deeply annoying the second time they were spoken, so you write 20, 30 of them per character, and have them tick off so they don’t repeat until they’ve all been said. Done. Problem solved. I fixed a 30-year-old bane of RPGs, and I don’t even know how to use C++.</p><figure id="" data-id="6bce73ba6768622ada8eb2bc7a982d1b" data-recommend-id="image://6bce73ba6768622ada8eb2bc7a982d1b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Giatta saying the unimprovable words, 'You irredeemable fucking swine...'" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Giatta saying the unimprovable words, 'You irredeemable fucking swine...'" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6bce73ba6768622ada8eb2bc7a982d1b" data-recommend-id="image://6bce73ba6768622ada8eb2bc7a982d1b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Giatta saying the unimprovable words, 'You irredeemable fucking swine...'" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s an even easier solution. Hold on tight. Don’t have them say anything at all! Nothing needs to be said! I just killed seven skeletons that were stood by that rock, because I wanted to go past that rock. It wasn’t a battle about which operas will be written, it was just a bit of busywork in a video game. It requires no comment. Silence does perfectly.</p><p>Heck, I’ll compromise! I’m that decent. How about they only say their silly lines after a named boss fight? There are plenty of those in <em>Avowed</em>, and they tend to feel like a more major event, even if they’re just ticking off a bounty. When I’ve won one of those, I feel like I’ve at least achieved something, so sure, let Kai declare it a glorious battle. Give him his moment.</p><p>This is absolutely not an <em>Avowed</em> issue, but an RPG games issue. But that doesn’t let it off the hook. Obsidian, when you make the inevitably (and deeply desired) <em>Avowed 2</em>, please, <em>please</em>, could you be the team to lead the way on changing this? Because the choice is doing this, or I will somehow arrange for your friends and families to respond, “Great work, you really ate some mouthfuls” every single time you have a meal for the rest of your lives.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/counter-strike-2-hits-highest-player-count-since-2023.1111392/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/counter-strike-2-player-count<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Valve's first-person shooter&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>has hit its highest player count since May 2023, and it isn't really clear why that's happened.</p>

<p><em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valve-surprise-releases-counter-strike-2" rel="nofollow">surprise-released in September 2023</a>, essentially serving as both a sequel to&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive&nbsp;</em>and a major update for that game as well. In May that year, when it was still&nbsp;<em>Global Offensive</em>, the game hit its all-time Steam player count high of 1,818,773 (<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/730/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">per SteamDB</a>).</p>

<p>This weekend, again according to SteamDB's numbers (with thanks to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dexerto.com/counter-strike-2/counter-strike-2-hits-massive-new-player-count-record-but-no-one-really-knows-why-3133997/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dexerto</a>),&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>managed to hit a concurrent player count of 1,741,837, representing the game's highest player numbers since the Steam launch of both <i>Global Offensive&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>itself.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/counter-strike-2-concurrent-player-count-shooting.jpg?itok=jLhzaDON 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/counter-strike-2-concurrent-player-count-shooting.jpg?itok=-sLiONym 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Counter-Strike 2</em>'s player numbers have reached a recent high, and it's not clear why.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2</em>'s numbers (which were originally those of&nbsp;<em>Global Offensive</em>, lest we forget) have been trending upwards since 2012, and that the game has routinely been playing host to over a million players per day since 2022.</p>

<p>Still, there weren't any major&nbsp;<em>CS2&nbsp;</em>esports tournaments over the weekend, and as far as I know, no major&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>content creators have done anything particularly noteworthy over the past few days either.</p>

<p>It's entirely possible that&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2</em>'s numbers have simply hit this high as part of the aforementioned general trend upwards for the game, but it's still interesting (and no doubt encouraging for Valve, given <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/counter-strike-2-600m-revenue-report" rel="nofollow">how much the shooter rakes in</a>) to see figures like this for the game.</p>

<p>Will&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>manage to eclipse its all-time player high within the next few weeks? If the player count continues to rise, then it's pretty much an inevitability, which can only mean more skin sales for Valve. Hooray, I guess!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/counter-strike-2-concurrent-player-count-barrels.jpg?itok=6BWGNT17 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/counter-strike-2-concurrent-player-count-barrels.jpg?itok=KKveFkqD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>makes big money for Valve.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're still in the dark about&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, it's a multiplayer first-person shooter that pits teams of terrorists against their counter-terrorist foes.</p>

<p>The game essentially plays the same as its predecessor; it's a reflex-based FPS with a focus on observation, quick thinking, and objective-based gameplay (unless you're playing in deathmatch, in which case it's a chaotic free-for-all).</p>

<p>When it made the switch to&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, Valve's shooter got itself a new Source 2-based coat of paint, as well as new server architecture, updated maps, and more.</p>

<p><em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>is available to play right now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">for free on PC via Steam</a>.</p>

            <p>Among the dorkiest aspects of Bethesda's winningly dorky <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a> is the persuasion wheel minigame - also known as Persuasion Pie, also known as the Wheedlin' Roundabout, also known as the Dartboard of Indoctrination. (Maybe not so much the last two.) This saw you choosing methods of gaining NPC affection from a disc with quadrants labelled "Admire", "Joke", "Coerce" and "Boast", each of which elicits a different response previewed by the NPC's gurnishly changing expression. </p>
<p>You have to choose all four options at least once per round, and the underlying "pie" rotates every time you pick one. The underlying segments are partially filled in to show how much they'll affect the NPC's opinion, for better or worse. The idea, then is to match responses that have a positive effect to the largest chunks of pie, by picking them in the right order. If you think all that sounds incredibly overwrought and laborious, then you are clearly not Don't Nod Montreal's Colin McInerney or one of the other hosts of Wheeljam 2025, a game creation jam dedicated to Bethesda's ole Tart Of Cajolement. Here is a trailer.</p><!--more-->

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LQoGS0q7ls" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>The jam runs from Thursday, March 13th to Thursday, March 20th, the 19th anniversary of Oblivion's 2006 launch. Oblivion aside, it takes inspiration from Bass Reeves Can't Die, a game concepted by Strange Scaffold boss Xalavier Nelson Jr, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/colin.how/post/3lehstucgq225">created by McInerney</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69Ukg2BqIk0">promoted/discussed</a> by Youtuber Julian "Noodle" Morley.</p>
<p>"Feel free to iterate on the original persuasion-puzzle concept or abstract your wheel into something entirely new!" <a href="https://itch.io/jam/wheeljam">explains the jam page on Itch.io</a>. "If your wheel is recognizably derived from the Oblivion wheel in any way shape or form, it is fair game."</p>
<p>Entry is free, and the hosts have considerately put together some Unreal, Godot and Unity Engine templates for people to work from. They're also offering prizes in the shape of 3D-printed Oblivion Persuasion Models. From the Itch page: "They spin! And have magnets! Maybe I'll put your names and the categories on the back of the wheel? I dunno! I didn't think that far ahead!"</p>
<p>There are several prize categories. Under "Hotwheels", we file developers who "spend an exorbitant amount of time juicing your wheel, making custom graphics for it, and making it buttery smooth". Under "Reinvent The Wheel", we find those who "use the wheel in a way that even the most seasoned game designers couldn't possibly fathom". And under "Put The We In Wheel", we find developers who "somehow found a way to have multiple wheels".</p>
<p>I'm quite fond of Oblivion's Brainwashing Pizza. I'd love to see another developer randomly revive it as an in-game item - perhaps Kojima can be pie-suaded to build it into <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>. I also adore gamejams run by sickos who are obsessed with extremely specific features or mechanics from many decades ago. I'll be keeping one eye on this while the other remains peeled for news of Microsoft's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-4-oblivions-rumoured-unreal-engine-remake-has-a-new-take-on-stealth-stamina-and-blocking-say-rumours">long-rumoured Oblivion remake</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
