<p>In my experience, gaming chairs often come and go for one reason or another. Perhaps the lumbar support isn’t right, the seat base isn’t wide enough, or it develops too much wear or an irritating creak after a few weeks of heavy usage. That’s right, I’m a <strong>big </strong>gamer in more ways than one – and that often reflects in the gaming chairs that I opt to use. </p>



<p>I’ve been fortunate enough to review one of the best gaming chairs I’ve ever sat on – the Noblechairs Hero Black Edition. This sumptuous, sturdy seat is one of the finest elements of my setup; a reliable foundation that supports me for several hours a day. </p>



<p>In this Noblechairs Hero Black Edition review, I’m going to break down why it’s just so good.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-s-new-about-the-noblechairs-hero-black-edition">What’s New About The Noblechairs Hero Black Edition?</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Let me open this Noblechairs Hero Black Edition review by stressing that I’ve got my hands on something <strong>really </strong>special – a custom-printed seat. It’s a new service offered by Noblechairs, and it’s phenomenal. I simply posted my images and the team expertly applied them to the back of this wondrous chair. The result is a high-quality, long-lasting, and bright print that stands out nicely against the deep black of the hybrid leather.</p>



<p>That’s where we’ll kick this off – the leather.</p>



<p>The Noblechairs Hero Black Edition uses a unique cover made of vinyl and polyurethane. It’s soft to the touch, doesn’t make you sweat, and you won’t stick to it in even the warmest weather. It feels super durable, and it’s wrapped around a cold foam cushioning that doesn’t relent, even after hours of use. If you pair all that with the velour and memory foam cushions that come in the box, plus the borderline military-grade aluminium and solid steel frame, you’ve got a seat that’s as comfortable as it is dependable – even if you’re looking for the best gaming chair for large people.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="noblechairs EPIC/ICON/HERO Black &amp; Java Edition - The best or nothing" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FP4wsb31-zc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<h2 id="h-full-features-of-the-noblechairs-hero-black-edition">Full Features of the Noblechairs Hero Black Edition</h2>



<p>I cannot praise this chair enough. It’s wide enough to support a larger frame, and the ‘racer’ style back simply opens up to accept you and welcome you to your new home. The soft-topped armrests are 4D, which means you can adjust them to suit your exact needs, and the integrated lumbar support is adjustable to match the curvature of your spine.</p>



<p>It’s heavy and chunky as all hell, but that’s a good thing – it’s indicative of the robustness of this chair. I previously owned a Noblechairs Hero Edition and it lasted me three years before I moved on to something else – and even when I moved on, the chair was in near mint condition, aside from a little wear to the custom design (it was a Fallout-themed chair).</p>



<p>Let me stress again – if you’re looking for a gaming chair for bigger people, you cannot sleep on the Noblechairs Hero Black Edition. It supports a maximum user weight of 330 lbs (150 kg) and everything from the gas lift mechanism to the levers that you use to adjust the chair just feel <strong>so solid</strong> and high quality.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-noblechairs-hero-black-edition-worth-it">Is The Noblechairs Hero Black Edition Worth It?</h2>



<p>It’s time to wrap up this Noblechairs Hero Black Edition review.</p>



<p>Is this gaming chair worth the £399.95 asking price (before shopping costs)?</p>



<p>Absolutely – it’s without a doubt the best gaming chair I’ve ever used. It’s supportive, soft, breathable, and most of all, it’s <strong>comfortable</strong>. It accommodates people of all sizes but is perhaps best suited to those with a larger frame, and the custom printing that Noblechairs offers means it’s one of the best chairs for esports players and teams.</p>



<p>It’s easy to assemble, simple to maintain, and you’re unlikely to need to repair it, even after months of use. It’s noble by name and noble by nature – if you’re in the market for a new chair, consider the <a href="https://www.noblechairs.co.uk/en-gb/hero-series/black-edition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Noblechairs Hero Black Edition</a>.</p>

            <p>Activision has banned over 65,000 players across Call of Duty: Warzone and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3.</p>
<p>The bans rolled out in the last few hours, purging thousands of  "cheating and boosting" players from both Ranked and non-Ranked play alike.</p>

<p>If that sounds like a lot, it's not really, given the size of the Call of Duty playerbase. As one commenter said in <a href="https://x.com/SquishyRSX/status/1819519876614311970">reply</a> to the tweet above, "65k accounts seems so small... I just feel like there's so much more…"</p>
<p>ICYMI, last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-is-heading-to-xbox-game-pass-this-week">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is now available on Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>
<p>Game Pass subscribers will have access to all Modern Warfare 3 modes, meaning its single-player campaign, multiplayer, and open-world Zombies. It's only the second <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a> title to hit Game Pass since Microsoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">$69bn acquisition of the company</a> last year, with Diablo 4 having <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/diablo-4-will-make-a-hellish-addition-to-xbox-game-pass-this-march">launched for the subscription service</a> back in March.

<p>The World Series of Warzone is set to descend upon the realm of Call of Duty once more this year, and it’s looking bigger than ever. This time around, the legendary battle royale-based tournament is headed to Las Vegas, Nevada. It has been a busy few months as teams have fought to qualify for the Global Finals, which is the event taking place in September, but now, each of the 40 teams is locked in and raring to go.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-world-series-of-warzone-schedule-and-format">World Series of Warzone Schedule and Format</h2>



<p>The World Series of Warzone will run from September 14 – 15, making it quite a short tournament compared to other, similar events in the space. It might only be a rapid-fire competition, but it boasts a sizeable prize pool of $1 million. This prize pool is split accordingly:</p>



<ul>
<li>$50,000 – SOLOYOLO Tournament</li>



<li>$950,000 – Trios Tournament</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s quite a confusing format for the World Series of Warzone, though.</p>



<p>Players will compete on the first day of the Global Finals in <strong>six matches</strong>, their placement in which will determine their seeding for the second day (or ‘point advantage’). On day two, the teams will face off in an intense showdown with a ‘match point’ format. That means that once a team reaches 100 points (there are no match limits), they’ll need to win one more match to secure the grand prize.</p>



<p>That means that you could theoretically have ten teams over 100 points and sitting on ‘match point’, but it’s that final win that decides who takes home the trophy.</p>



<p>There’s a $300,000 prize reserved for the number one team.</p>



<h2 id="h-world-series-of-warzone-teams">World Series of Warzone Teams</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>There’s a pretty insane list of competitors making their way into the arena for the World Series of Warzone Global Finals. Here’s the full breakdown of the 40 squads fighting for the top spot:</p>



<ul>
<li>Aydan, DjMas, zSmit</li>



<li>GabeKuun, Flanked, Blazt</li>



<li>Natedogg, Rxul, Destroy</li>

<li>Jukeyz, Lenun, Fifakill</li>



<li>Netodz, XtraJ, Vitaah</li>



<li>xmq, Hassi, Tikqs</li>
</ul>



<p>I warned you – it’s a massive list of Warzone competitors.</p>







<h2 id="h-world-series-of-warzone-predictions">World Series of Warzone Predictions</h2>



<p>Last year’s tournament win went to Biffle, Shifty, and Sage, and this year, everyone is holding out hope that the majority of that squad can pick up the two-time, back-to-back win. This time around, Sage has slipped in with Swagg, and Biffle and Shifty have picked up Soka, a Polynesian player who wound up sitting in second place last time around.</p>



<p>My money is on Team Biffle – this crew breezed through the Warzone category at the Esports World Cup. If the team can win big at the World Series of Warzone, they’ll be catapulted into the history books as some of the biggest earners in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-esports-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty esports</a> history.</p>

<p>New details and images of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 have started to leak online ahead of the mode’s official reveal.</p>



<p>The leaks come courtesy of Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/betterthanalaix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@betterthanalaix</a>, who’s seemingly been able to gain backend access to Black Ops 6 ahead of the multiplayer BETA and final release.</p>



<p>As of the time of writing, the Twitter account has already leaked all of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-mutliplayer-maps-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6’s 20 multiplayer maps</a>, in addition to details on Gunsmith, killstreaks, perks, weapons and more. We’ll have a full compiled list on all of the details later today. </p>



<p>You can see the leaked images/gameplay below:</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>It’s not entirely clear how the user gained access to the game, but judging from the material leaking online, the nature of the screenshots suggests that they were able to access the game via the COD HQ or an old build. At the time of writing, though, this is the only account that has seemingly got access.</p>



<p>The leaks come ahead of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-to-watch-codnext/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CODNext</a>, which is scheduled to take place on August 28th, 2024. CODNext will feature multiplayer reveals ahead of the game’s multiplayer BETA. In addition, it’s also been confirmed that CODNext will feature Call of Duty zombies, but as reported previously by Insider Gaming, Warzone may not be there due to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-verdansk-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk not returning until Spring 2025</a>.</p>



<p>For the first time, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/modern-warfare-3-officially-announced-for-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty Black Ops 6 will be available on day one on Xbox Game Pass</a>, thanks to Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard. </p>

<p>The leaks come courtesy of Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/betterthanalaix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@betterthanalaix</a>, who’s seemingly been able to gain backend access to Black Ops 6 ahead of the multiplayer BETA and final release.</p>

<li>Pillage </li>



<li>Radar </li>



<li>Stealth </li>



<li>Nuketown</li>
</ul>



<p>As those familiar with past Call of Duty titles may recognize, some maps are seemingly from the original Call of Duty: Black Ops title, but most of them seem original. </p>



<p>The Twitter account has also begun to individual upload images of all the Black Ops 6 maps.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Black Ops 6 will launch on the Xbox Series S|X, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation5, and PC on October 25, 2024.</p>

    <p><span>New chapter features Qingyi, Jane, and Seth.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 1.1 update for <em><a title="Games > Zenless Zone Zero [15 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/zenless-zone-zero">Zenless Zone Zero</a></em>, dubbed “Undercover R&amp;B,” will launch on August 14, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [169 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-903363"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>Version 1.1 will feature the new challenges soon to be faced by New Eridu Public Security (N.E.P.S.) and the complex story between Qingyi, Jane, Seth, and the criminal syndicate known as the Mountain Lion Gang. Aside from updates to the story and new characters, Version 1.1 will also introduce the new Hollow Zero gameplay experience “Inferno Reap,” where players can jump into battle with Nineveh directly. Also, the New Eridu Public Security area at Lumina Square will be open to players. Furthermore, with various events such as Camellia Golden Week, abundant rewards are awaiting inquisitive Proxies.</p><p>In Version 1.1, Zhu Yuan, Qingyi, and Seth will utilize their talents to fight a battle of wits and courage with the Mountain Lion Gang. However, these criminals always manage to escape arrest with the help of the enigmatic Jane. By further immersing themselves in the world of Special Episode “Undercover R&amp;B”, Proxies will be able to stroll around New Eridu, complete commissions as Jane, and uncover the intricate past between her and N.E.P.S..</p><p>As Proxies become more familiar with New Eridu Public Security (N.E.P.S.), Qingyi will be ready to join players’ squads. As an S-Rank Electric Stun character who can fit in a variety of different squads, Qingyi is skilled at inflicting Daze quickly to stun enemies. While Qingyi’s attack causes electric damage, she can build up “Flash Connect Voltage,” triggering a powerful attack once it reaches a certain level. Being Zhu Yuan’s trustworthy partner at N.E.P.S., Qingyi can also offer significant support to Zhu Yuan in combat.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_903364"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>Assuming a crucial role in Version 1.1’s storyline, Jane’s relationship with the player will be that of both friend and foe. As an S-Rank Physical Anomaly Agent, Jane can trigger “Passion State” by building up Passion Stream, unleashing rapid, multi-stage, and deadly attacks while quickly inflicting Attribute Anomaly on enemies. However, before she joins the players’ squads, Proxies will face Jane as an enemy in combat due to her status as an important member of the Mountain Lion Gang. You can certainly count on her agile combat skills, but you might not feel the same when you are on the receiving end.</p><p>Beyond two S-Rank characters, the A-Rank Electric Defense character Seth is also ready to join combat. Aside from buffing his teammates with a shield, Seth’s weapon can also transform into a large sword he uses to defeat enemies. In addition, new S-Rank Bangboo “Officer Cui” will be able to assist Proxies in the Hollows.</p><p>In addition to regular updates to Shiyu Defense, <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> is introducing new gameplay “Inferno Reap” to Hollow Zero. After completing the “Withering Garden” stage and related commissions, Proxies can enter a time-limited battle with Nineveh. The challenge can be attempted as many times as possible.

<p>Konami marked the occasion on social media, inviting players yet to meet Anita to "please give it a try".</p>

<p>"I suspect that anyone who can relate to Anita's fictional experiences from a real-life perspective will have one of two polarising responses to Silent Hill: The Short Message: deep outrage, or deep admiration," I wrote in my <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-the-short-message-review">Silent Hill: The Short Message review</a>, giving it three out of five stars.</p>
<p>"No, it may not be the Silent Hill game many of us were expecting; it may not even be the Silent Hill game some people want. But even with that infuriating chase sequence, I'm very glad it exists."</p>

<p>According to Niko Partners, a total of 15 games were approved yesterday (2nd August), including the still-as-yet-unconfirmed Final Fantasy 14 mobile port.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-is-reportedly-coming-to-mobile">The news adds credence to a recent rumour that Final Fantasy developer Square Enix had linked up with Tencent</a> to develop a mobile version of its fan-favourite MMO, Final Fantasy 14.</p> <div>

<p>The approval of Rainbow Six Mobile is interesting, too. Rainbow Six Siege has never been approved by the Chinese authorities, and its ban extended to livestreams as well as sales.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> is reportedly publishing both the Rainbow Six and Final Fantasy 14 games, whilst NetEase secured licenses for Marvel Snap and Marvel Rivals.</p>
<p>Talking of Final Fantasy 14, director and producer Naoki "Yoshi P" Yoshida recently offered his "sincere apologies" for the issues identified in the early access build of its highly-anticipated expansion, Dawntrail.</p>
<p>In a blog post published shortly after the expansion went live for early access players, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-director-apologises-for-issues-identified-in-the-early-access-build-of-dawntrail">Yoshida thanked players for playing and assured them that the team was "investigating" the causes of the most pressing issues</a>, including transition freezes on Xbox, and broken animations across all platforms.</p>
<p>Don't forget that from now until 28th August, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-and-gong-cha-have-come-together-for-a-tasty-new-collaboration">Final Fantasy fans can enjoy three FF14-inspired teas at participating outlets</a> of Gong Cha, as well as earn "special rewards, including the adorable Porxie King mount".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
