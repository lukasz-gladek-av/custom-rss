            <p>A glance at comedy medieval medic sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stretcher-men">Stretcher Men</a> might have you believe it is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op game</a> about co-ordination and teamwork. Not so! It's a singleplayer game in which you control not one but both carriers of a stretcher. You have to ferry a sick man over the hilly countryside, past muddy lake banks and over snowy mountains, all without dropping him on the ground. I can only imagine it controls a bit like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/brothers-a-tale-of-two-sons">Brothers: A Tale Of Two Sons</a>, but with added ragdoll jollity. We'll know next week, when it releases <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2884650/STRETCHER_MEN/">on Steam</a>.

<p>I enjoy the shots of the two peasant lads navigating snow-covered peaks and marching against the light of the full moon. It's like some deleted scene from Lord of the Rings in which Merry and Pippin have to carry a hungover Gimli to the nearest elven refuge for a rest. 

</p><p>"Players control two characters," say developers Chraph, "one at the front and one at the back of the stretcher, and must navigate through various obstacles while maintaining balance. With simple yet deep gameplay, your attention and coordination skills will be put to the test."

</p><p>Does this constitute a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/bennett-foddy">Foddylike</a>? Perhaps. It's got the clumsiness, the basic challenge, the absurdist set-up. There's nothing from the Steam blurb to suggest you'll have to restart from the beginning every time you drop the ill dude. But maybe? We'll know more when it comes out next week on July 28th.

</p><p>Games about clumsiness and co-ordination often appeal to me. I'm looking forward to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baby-steps">Baby Steps</a>, for instance, and this looks like a more bare bones version of that, set in a vague, uncomplicated landscape. I suspect we can file it next to "games that will be played by Twitch streamers for a whole day and then probably forgotten about". But that's okay. Some games are there as snacks to gobble up, get your laughs, and move on. I fully digested the humour of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/chained-together">Chained Together</a> after just <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-tried-to-escape-hell-in-chained-together-and-one-of-us-kept-running-ahead-with-no-warning">an hour of wonderful torture with Nic and Edwin</a>, and I don't regret it.</p>

            <p>
The development team behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> has apologised for elements in the game's marketing campaign so far that have jarred with some Japanese fans - and said the game will "keep evolving" as it heads towards launch in November. 
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft's statement, released via social media today in both English and Japanese, is fairly unspecific about what exactly it is apologising for - other than noting that "some elements in our promotional materials have caused concern within the Japanese community". 
</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-sorry-assassins-creed-shadows-artwork-features-real-life-historical-re-enactment-group-logo">Ubisoft apologised for artwork featured in the game's Collector's Edition</a> that included the logo of a modern day re-enactment group.

<p>
Perhaps surprisingly, the statement goes on to specifically highlight the character of Yasuke, a lightning rod for controversy from some quarters who are unhappy at the portrayal of the historical Black samurai and his inclusion as one of Shadows' two protagonists. 
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-boss-condemns-malicious-developer-abuse-after-assassins-creed-shadows-reveal">Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot spoke out to condemn "malicious and personal online attacks" directed at Assassin's Creed Shadows' development team</a> in the wake of the game's reveal. 
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed boss Marc-Alexis Cot√© has also addressed the matter, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-boss-explains-why-he-ignored-elon-musk-after-backlash-over-african-samurai-yasuke">how he reacted to a tweet from billionaire X and Tesla owner Elon Musk</a> criticising diversity in game design. 
</p>
<p>
"While we strive for authenticity in everything we do, Assassin's Creed games are works of fiction inspired by real historical events and figures," Ubisoft's statement today reads. 
</p>
<p>
"From its inception, the series has taken creative license and incorporated fantasy elements to craft engaging and immersive experiences. The representation of Yasuke in our game is an illustration of this. His unique and mysterious life made him an ideal candidate to tell an Assassin's Creed story with the setting of Feudal Japan as a backdrop. 
</p>
<p>
"While Yasuke is depicted as a samurai in Assassin's Creed Shadows, we acknowledge this is a matter of debate and discussion. We have woven this carefully into our narrative and with our other lead character, the Japanese shinobi Naoe, who is equally important in the game, our dual protagonists provide players with different gameplay styles."

<p>
The statement notes that Ubisoft has collaborated with numerous "external consultants, historians, researches and internal teams at Ubisoft Japan", but says anyone external to the company was "in no way responsible for the decisions that are taken by the creative teams in the interests of gameplay and entertainment". 
</p>
<p>
Criticism therefore should not be directed at "collaborators, both internal and external", the statement requests. 
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft closes by encouraging fans to continue sharing their feedback "respectfully".

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-own-developers-dont-seem-thrilled-at-elon-musks-cybertruck-being-added-to-the-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Reaction to yesterday's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elon-musks-tesla-cybertruck-will-be-available-to-buy-in-fortnite">reveal of the Tesla Cybertruck in Fortnite</a> has been swift from players and Epic Games' own developers alike. 
</p>
<p>
In a rare show of public disapproval, several Epic Games staff have taken to social media to give their personal takes on the addition of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a>'s car to the game. 
</p>
<p>
"Reminder that 1) Voting with your wallet works and sentiment on social media is a tangible factor," Fortnite Festival producer Kyle Wynn <a href="https://x.com/KyleTheWynner/status/1815427055158263840">wrote</a>. "2) Companies are composed of lots of different people with their own unique opinions. 3) That truck looks fucking silly and the CEO of that company is a piece of shit."
</p>
<p>
"Reminder that opinions are mine and mine alone," another Epic Games developer who has since locked their X account wrote. "Destroy on sight [middle finger emoji]."
</p>
<p>
On reddit and X, numerous fans have said they will actively hunt out players using the Cybertruck on sight, and called upon other battle royale players to put aside their usual gameplay and team up against anyone seen driving the vehicle.
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
Fortnite is, at the time of writing, currently in downtime as the game's latest patch is pumped out. But dataminers peering into the update's files have discovered that the Cybertruck appears to be a free reward, given away upon completion of a new questline. 
</p>
<p>
The Cybertruck being made free to acquire would be a curious move from Epic Games, as yesterday's trailer gave no suggestion it would be given away. But in doing so, Epic would sidestep the matter of asking players to pay up for the in-game vehicle, with some portion of the proceeds presumably going to Musk himself. 
</p>
<p>
We'll update again when the Cybertruck's method of acquisition is formally announced.
</p>

			<p>The Witcher 4, also known as the "Polaris" project, will be the first entry in the series to be powered by the Unreal Engine 5. While this was definitely disappointing to learn for a lot of fans due to the known stuttering issues of the engine, the move could lead to some improvements that could benefit all of the games powered by the ending.</p>
<p>According to the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DFClipsChannel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a>, if there is one development team that could solve the stuttering issues plaguing the engine, it is CD Projekt Red. Also, the team is well aware of them, as shown in a photo shared by Alex Battaglia in the video below taken during an Unreal Fest presentation by CD Projekt Red. As such, there's no doubt that the developer will try their best to solve the issues, and whatever they are able to come up with, it's extremely likely it will be integrated into the engine, thus improving every game powered by Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p><iframe title="If The Witcher 4 Is On Unreal Engine 5, Will It Stutter?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cp_pd92iqWE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Very little is currently known about <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-polaris-development-cdpr-acquired/">The Witcher 4 "Polaris"</a>, other than the fact that it is the game in the works at CDPR in the most advanced state of development, and that it will mark the beginning of a new saga. Geralt of Rivia, however, will return to our screens at some point, as a remake of the first entry in the series is also in the works. Little is known about this remake as well, but it has been said that it will do away with parts of the original that are<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-remake-bad-parts/"> outdated and bad.</a></p>

I‚Äôve spent a non-zero amount of time this week compiling a wishlist for potential <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>-likes that also let me keep pets. I wasn‚Äôt sure what I wanted to play, but I knew I was burnt out on both stabbing and shooting, and wanted something light and colourful with a solid loop that I could veg out (pun intended) with at the end of the day. I even went to so far as to create a chap named Karrot King in Stardew before quitting in disgust because I couldn‚Äôt easily access carrot seeds.</p>
<p>I cannot in good conscious claim that I manifested such a videogame - that was the work of Skyreach Studio. However, this is the internet, so I will both take credit for it <em>and</em> offer you an <em>exclusive</em> discount on my course. While I‚Äôm waiting for your membership fee to arrive, I‚Äôll be playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/critter-crops">Critter Crops</a>. It‚Äôs a witchy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games-like-stardew-valley-the-best-farming-games-on-pc">farming</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">sim</a> in which you grow odd pets and cast spells from flesh-bound grimoires. One of the verbs it offers on its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1641120/Critter_Crops/">Steam page</a> is 'noodle'. Apologies to all the other games on my wishlist.</p>

<p>"Sylvie‚Äôs story begins as a newfound witch that has been chased out of her hometown for her abilities. When she arrives on Mutter Island she discovers she is capable of growing magical Critter Crops that will aid her in restoring the island to its former glory," readeth Steam. Might I one day be able to return to the village and bathe my traitorous kin in eldritch flame? No, sorry. Sorry. I‚Äôm trying to escape the cyclical violence that led me to such soothing games in the first place. Maybe just a little immolation? We‚Äôll see. Right now, I‚Äôve got pets to grow.</p>
<p>"Uncover the secrets of the island by growing magical critters in this isometric role-playing/management game! Farm, Noodle, Mine, Gather, and Explore the island in order to level up your abilities and uncover more of the mysteries of Mutter Island." Sounds rad, honestly. There‚Äôs a total of 24 critters to collect, once you‚Äôve discovered each one‚Äôs growing conditions. You‚Äôll level them up, accessing new areas of the island with their abilities.</p>
<p>As well as the usual trailers and screens, there‚Äôs a short clip on the Steam page in which a dev talks through some of Critter Crops' development history. The game started as a college project, which then evolved through inspiration from Skyreach‚Äôs favourite indies. The dev mentions the challenges of working combat into the traditional framework of a 'cosy' game - but ultimately, their goal was "to make the game that (they) wanted to play." As is often the way of such things, the result is a game that <em>I</em> now want to play. Everybody wins - with the notable exception of my former village, who will not even have time to rue the day before I reduce them to ash with an army of anthropomorphic vegetables at my side. Cosy!</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>'s Patch 7 Closed Beta has been delayed until later this week.
</p>
<p>
The patch was due to launch yesterday, but the development team at Larian noticed a last-minute bug causing passive rolls to stop working.
</p>
<p>
"We're trying to figure out how we got here, so while we do that, we'll be pushing the Closed Beta back to later this week," reads a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4366886565633587231">notice on Steam</a>.

<p>

As previously reported, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3s-seventh-patch-amends-split-screen-adds-mod-support-wont-be-final-update">seventh patch will amend split-screen play and add mod support</a>, but won't be the final update from Larian.

</p>
<p>
In the latest notice, Larian stated there are over 1000 fixes and improvements in this patch and reiterated the highlights, which also includes new Evil Ending cinematics, adding Honour Mode mechanics to a Custom Mode playthrough, and "making the way you use soap a bit clearer".
</p>
<p>
Other changes include tweaks to UI, artistic and animation fixes, writing and flow amendments, and improved performance - including areas with large numbers of NPCs like the Lower City.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a>‚Äôs latest patch was due to launch in closed beta yesterday, but Larian have decided to give it a bit more time in the oven due to bugs. Namely, a bug that caused passive rolls - like those that detect traps - to stop working.</p>
<p>Happily, if you hadn‚Äôt already registered to take part in the beta, you now have more time to sign up. Scroll down a bit on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>‚Äôs <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086940/Baldurs_Gate_3/">Steam page</a> and click the ‚ÄòRequest Access‚Äô button.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The other upside is that they‚Äôve have taken the opportunity to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4366886565633587231">post a blog</a> dangling the details of some tantalising changes, much like a delicious bar of soap-on-a-rope. Wait. What. No. Soap is not for eating, say spoilsports Larian. As such, they‚Äôve made some ablutionary items more idiot-proof. ‚ÄúWe noticed some of you hiccoughing bubbles, so the action for washing yourself with soap and sponges is now called 'Use' instead of 'Consume'.‚Äù</p>
<p>All in all, patch 7 boasts "over 1,000 fixes and improvements," with the blog itself detailing just a few select highlights. The big ticket items here are extra evil ending cinematics, split-screen tweaks, and the modding toolkit. Aside from these, here‚Äôs some personal picks. (I say 'picks' - my actual preference would be that Larian call it quits and go have a Milky Way and a nap so I can start a new playthrough.)</p>

<p>Honour Mode systems - the game‚Äôs ultra-tough, single-save beef gauntlet - will now be selectable in a custom game. In terms of specifics, boss hobgobbo Dror Ragzlin will now try and befriend the spider pit‚Äôs inhabitants with a new spell called Arachnid Compulsion, if you happen to knock him in.</p>
<p>For your companions, Karlach "will no longer brush the shaved side of her head," and Astarion might occasionally do something at camp besides reading books. If you‚Äôre too busy being extremely evil to care about friendship, they‚Äôll be more Dark Urge reactivity dialogue and narrator lines. But I already did a Dark Urge playthrough! I moan, before realising that I haven‚Äôt done a Dark Urge that turns good playthrough. <em>Or </em>a Dark Urge that specifically tries to make Minsc‚Äôs life as miserable as possible playthrough. Larian plz.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs also some more help for the final battle. I can understand anyone being a bit bored of the 'alliances you‚Äôve made across your adventure join in for a big dramatic scrap later on' thing, but I‚Äôm not sure anyone has yet come up with a better solution for letting you cash in on your side-excursions in a reactive and satisfying way? I‚Äôm a fan, anyway. Now, the Kuo-Toa fishfolk can get involved (unless they all died in act one), and the Gondians will throw in a hefty Steel Watcher.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs some coming optimisation on the performance front, too. "This will have a more noticeable impact in areas with large numbers of NPCs (like the Lower City) and will reduce peak memory usage when loading levels for the first time," reads the blog. "It will also be noticeable when managing lots of loot (e.g. when transferring everything from a camp chest to a character's inventory)."</p>
<p>Finally, and most bollocks-ly, you‚Äôll no longer be able to cheese the Leap Of Faith trial of Shar by "by just clicking the final platform and letting your character pathfind their way there." Booooo. Boooooo. Boooooooo (boo).</p>
<p>No word on when the patch will be available for everyone, but as mentioned, you can sign up for the beta on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur‚Äôs Gate 3</a>‚Äôs Steam page. I am very serious about Larian chilling out so I can finally play the game again, but it‚Äôs no doubt impressive to see the game still getting such substantial updates, especially as they‚Äôre also working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-have-two-new-games-in-the-works-fueled-by-the-very-same-fire-as-baldurs-gate-3">two more games at the moment</a>.</p>

            <p>
Amid its push toward mobile and free-to-play titles and away from the "volatile" AAA space, Warner Bros. has announced the acquisition of MultiVersus developer Player First Games.
</p>
<p>
MultiVersus - which has had an unusual, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-to-shut-down-until-2024-with-no-refunds-for-paying-players">sometimes</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-relaunch-comes-with-character-restrictions-and-people-arent-happy">controversial</a> development journey since the start of its open beta back in 2022 - is Player First Games' debut title. It finally got its full free-to-play release this May after disappearing for over a year, and while its current player numbers don't appear to be anywhere near those seen during the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-relaunch-comes-with-character-restrictions-and-people-arent-happy">height of its open beta popularity</a>, Warner Bros. is clearly happy enough to acquire the studio behind it.
</p>
<p>
Full details of the purchase haven't been disclosed, but Warner Bros. confirmed (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-games-multiversus-player-first-games-acquisition">via IGN</a>) Player First Games' co-founders Tony Huynh and Chris White will continue to lead the studio.

<p>
"Our team is excited to join the Warner Bros. Games family, and we feel that this will be great for MultiVersus overall," Huynh said in a statement accompanying the announcement. "We are working to make the MultiVersus game experience the best it can be and having our development team integrated with the publisher is optimum for the players."
</p>
<p>
Warner Bros' latest acquisition follows the company's announcement back in March that it would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-focusing-on-mobile-and-free-to-play-instead-of-volatile-aaa-console-games">shifting its focus</a> to mobile, free-to-play, and live-service titles to combat what it called the "volatile" AAA market. That came after February's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-fails-to-meet-warner-bros-expectations">admission</a> the publisher was bracing for a "tough year", after it revealed sales of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League had failed to meet its expectations.
</p>
<p>
Despite Warner Bros' shift in strategy, reports surfaced last week that it had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-studio-netherrealm-hit-by-layoffs">laid off the entire mobile team</a> at Mortal Kombat developer NetherRealm. And while neither the studio or publisher has publicly acknowledged the job cuts, NetherRealm has now confirmed its free-to-play live service mobile game Mortal Kombat: Onslaught will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netherrealm-is-shutting-down-live-service-mobile-game-mortal-kombat-onslaught">shutting down</a>. 
</p>
<p>
News of Warner Bros' Player First Games acquisition came ahead of MultiVersus' second season, which launches today and introduces a ranked mode, plus new fighters Samurai Jack and Beetlejuice. They join a sizeable roster of other playable characters from Warner Bros' library, including Bugs Bunny, Tom and Jerry, Superman, Joker, Gremlins' Gizmo, The Matrix's Agent Smith, Jason Vorhees, and Game of Thrones' Arya Stark.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-star-named-eos-review-quick-charming-puzzle-fun.934275/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/star-named-eos-review-quick-charming-puzzle-fun<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Finding a good, story-based puzzle game is like a reward for those who love the genre. The subtle art of exploring puzzles and learning a story bit by bit can be satisfying, and <em>The Star Named EOS</em> is a good example of what the genre can offer.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The Star Named EOS</em> has a good balance of challenging puzzles and narrative, and the graphics and music support the rest of the game well. While it‚Äôs a solid puzzle game and one that those in the genre will enjoy, it struggles to stand out or above other games as a whole.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Meet Dei, his mom, and puzzle galore</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-star-named-eos-train-stage.jpg?itok=s98NZlos 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-star-named-eos-train-stage.jpg?itok=PSUPxVKC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The train stage was where&nbsp;<em>The Star Named EOS&nbsp;</em>took off.</figcaption></figure><p>The story begins with the player‚Äôs character, Dei, following in his mom‚Äôs footsteps. Every stage starts with a picture that Dei‚Äôs mother took, and his goal is to recreate the picture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Players complete a variety of puzzles as they try to take the perfect picture. All of these are found by exploring the environment of each story chapter. The puzzles strike a good balance of being complex without being frustratingly difficult. While a few puzzles are much more difficult than others, most of them are about the same difficulty level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two puzzles in particular were so frustrating that I was nearly in tears thinking I‚Äôd never solve them. However, after spending some time solving them (and inputting random things), I eventually got to the answers. They didn‚Äôt seem like they were supposed to be as difficult as they were, the hints just didn‚Äôt give quite enough information to make sense.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-star-named-eos-radio-puzzle.jpg?itok=eKb1s8W7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-star-named-eos-radio-puzzle.jpg?itok=hj8zonq4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The morse code radio puzzle was particularly fun.</figcaption></figure><p>Other than those two puzzles, <em>The Star Named EOS</em> flowed well. I didn‚Äôt get too hung up on any particular area, and the progression felt natural and not too difficult. This kept my focus on the story instead of thinking too hard about most of the puzzles.</p>
<p>While exploring, there‚Äôs often dialogue for the things Dei interacts with. For the most part, the dialogue was well-written. However, a few parts of dialogue were reused with items that were the same but in different areas. They weren‚Äôt important items, but it was one of the small things that could have been polished.</p>
<p>Besides the few instances of repeated text, the environments themselves had a quant charm to them. Each area felt thoroughly investigated by the end of a chapter, which was both satisfying and a good use of space.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Art and Sound</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-star-named-eos-night-sky.jpg?itok=OF2yqH2U 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-star-named-eos-night-sky.jpg?itok=Qn7RUlfu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Something was particularly charming about the stars in&nbsp;<em>The Star Named EOS</em>.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>The art style of <em>The Star Named EOS</em> is pretty, and certain areas stand out more than others. Most of these were at the end, making for a pretty climactic end, which went well with the story. The music did the same, not quite standing out but doing a good job of subtly enhancing what was happening at any given moment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The same theme showed up here. <em>The Star Named EOS</em> had good graphics and music, but it was just that: good, not great.</p>
<h2><em>The Star Named EOS </em>| Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, <em>The Star Named EOS</em> doesn‚Äôt do enough to stand out. It‚Äôs not a bad game ‚Äì the story has a meaningful lesson by the end, and the journey to get to it isn‚Äôt bad. It‚Äôs got a charm to it that most <a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/puzzle?page=9223372036854775807">puzzle game</a> enthusiasts will probably enjoy, but that charm won‚Äôt translate well to people who don‚Äôt get the same satisfaction from these types of games.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, it doesn‚Äôt do anything to stand out from other games, even in the genre. It‚Äôs good and worth a play if you‚Äôre looking to cozy up with a puzzle game, but it‚Äôs rather average. That isn‚Äôt a bad thing ‚Äì sometimes a solid puzzle is the best way to relax, and <em>The Star Named EOS</em> is perfect for doing just that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
The Star Named EOS is a quick, charming puzzle game, but it doesn't stand out in the genre. (<a href="https://techraptor.net/review-score-policy">Review Policy</a>)

<p>It has been less than a month since Dr Disrespect vanished from the internet following the surfacing of extremely damaging allegations of sexual messaging with a minor ‚Äì which in part, he admitted to. </p>



<p>Now, MrBeast‚Äôs team has come under fire following the emergence of claims that Ava Kris Tyson, a co-host of the super-sized channel and close personal friend of Jimmy ‚ÄòMrBeast‚Äô Donaldson, formed a relationship with a 13-year-old fan and spent years communicating with them and interacting with suspicious and at times immoral ‚Äòart‚Äô.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-has-kris-tyson-done">What Has Kris Tyson Done?</h2>



<p>In recent days, a series of clips and videos have emerged online alleging that Ava Kris Tyson ‚Äì formerly known as ‚ÄòChris Tyson‚Äô before their gender transition started in 2023 ‚Äì knowingly and nefariously interacted with a young fan over a series of years. Per the reports, the fan won a competition at 13 years old, and Kris Tyson formed a relationship with the minor, going so far as to ‚Äòco-run‚Äô a Discord server with them and stay in touch on social media.</p>



<p>This is where the core of the concerns begin, as evidence has surfaced online showing Tyson sending risque comments to the minor ‚Äì known as ‚ÄòLava‚Äô ‚Äì on social media. There are also some screencaps showing questionable messages on Discord between Tyson and Lava.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs important to stress right off the bat that Lava has come out on social media in defence of Ava Kris Tyson, stressing that no wrongdoing took place aside from ‚Äòedgy jokes‚Äô that bordered on being inappropriate:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>These videos are massive lies and twisting the truth. Ava never did anything wrong and just made a few edgy jokes. I was never exploited or taken advantage of. </p><p>Can you do me a favor and comment on these videos and tell them to stop spreading lies. </p><p>This situation takes away‚Ä¶ <a href="https://t.co/FID7uBlc6h">pic.twitter.com/FID7uBlc6h</a></p></div>‚Äî Lava (@LavaGS) <a href="https://twitter.com/LavaGS/status/1815429514614501500?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 22, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>It‚Äôs easy to write this off as being fake, but MrBeast reportedly <a href="https://x.com/KEEMSTAR/status/1815452450620338565" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">connected KEEMSTAR to Lava</a> after confirming that he is indeed the minor in question ‚Äì but he‚Äôs now 20 years old. After talking at length to Lava, it was determined that he <strong>was not </strong>groomed by Tyson, he <strong>did not </strong>meet Tyson by himself all those years ago, and the furthest it went was with ‚Äò<strong>edgy inappropriate jokes</strong>‚Äò.</p>



<p>That‚Äôs walking the line that‚Äôs very close to what got Dr Disrespect booted out of the gaming community. It was just a few weeks ago that Guy ‚ÄòDr Direspect‚Äô Beahm revealed that he‚Äôd messaged a 17-year-old years ago and that the conversation took inappropriate turns at times. That earned him a ticket out of the industry ‚Äì for now.</p>



<p><strong>It doesn‚Äôt end there with Ava Kris Tyson, though</strong>.</p>



<p>As eagle-eyed hunters dug into the story, darker references were found online. For instance, Ava Kris Tyson has on many occasions interacted with ‚ÄòShadman‚Äô, an artist known for drawing young characters in provocative or downright sexual poses and styles, <a href="https://x.com/realExate/status/1814064935376138552" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">and in one post</a>, it looked as though Tyson was <strong>begging </strong>Shadman to ‚Äòdraw a 10-year-old anime girl‚Äô. </p>



<p>KEEMSTAR was one of the more prolific creators who <a href="https://x.com/KEEMSTAR/status/1815490471273066919" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">backed up the claim</a> that Tyson supported the ‚ÄòCP artist‚Äô. </p>



<p>In one of the <a href="https://x.com/FearedBuck/status/1815439023554355414" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">more recent posts online</a>, Jake Franklin, a former member of MrBeast‚Äôs team, said ‚ÄòJimmy knew.‚Äô This is a direct reference to MrBeast himself, and it‚Äôs a potentially damaging claim that suggests he knew what Tyson was up to ‚Äì but it‚Äôs vague. What did Jimmy know? If he knew about Tyson and Lava but Lava has discredited the claims, what‚Äôs there to know?</p>



<p>Ava Kris Tyson has since made their Twitter profile private and has been removing many of the posts that people have been referring to in videos and screenshots. Fans and critics worldwide are now awaiting the inevitable explanation video or post that‚Äôll surface following this debacle.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Should COD Champs Be a Neutral Event?]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/should-cod-champs-be-a-neutral-event.934263/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cod-champs-neutral-event/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Last weekend, the Call of Duty League Championship took place in Texas, and in an epic fashion, OpTic stormed into the grand final and dominated the New York Subliners to secure the trophy. It was a monumental event that pulled in hundreds of thousands of viewers, but with it being hosted by OpTic Texas, the branding, special events, and crowd weighed heavily in the favour of the Green Wall.</p>



<p>Now, several pro players from the past and present have taken to social media to condemn this, stressing that OpTic Texas had a serious home advantage. Others have stressed that if the team had <strong>lost</strong>, this wouldn‚Äôt be a discussion whatsoever. Ultimately, many are calling for COD Champs to be a neutral event going forward.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-all-comes-out">It All Comes Out</h2>



<p>On social media, users were quick to highlight that when the LA Thieves won COD Champs during the Vanguard season, it was on home turf and the event featured 100 Thieves-themed activations, but nobody has been complaining about <strong>that</strong>. For one thing, OpTic is the team that many fans love to hate, and that‚Äôs seen during every Call of Duty event ‚Äì except the ones that are played at home in Texas.</p>



<p>Most of this discourse was kicked off by ACHES, a former Call of Duty world champion now working on XDefiant ‚Äì but still neck-deep in the world of competitive COD. His opinion that Activision should host a neutral Champs event every year went down fairly well, with some pro players coming out to support him:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">You‚Äôre right and every pro will tell you as well. Tippable fs tho</p>‚Äî Ultra Scrap (@ScrappyNJ) <a href="https://twitter.com/ScrappyNJ/status/1815535506148729090?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 22, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>Of course, he also suggested that OpTic ‚Äòbought the win‚Äô, which didn‚Äôt sit well with fans.</p>



<p>Others pointed out that OpTic fans were nothing short of toxic at the event and effectively went unpunished ‚Äì even those in the VIP areas heavily dominated by OpTic Texas fans. In one post, the Subliners‚Äô Sib mentioned that <a href="https://x.com/SibDMDL/status/1815536756558532885" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">racial slurs were being thrown around</a> and security was doing nothing about it. Of course, that‚Äôs not necessarily a failing of OpTic Texas specifically, but more the venue‚Äôs choice of security contractors.</p>



<p>Even prominent OpTic members agree that COD Champs should be neutral ‚Äì while insisting that the location <strong>didn‚Äôt </strong>‚Äòhelp OpTic win‚Äô Champs:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>if the argument is ‚ÄúThe CDL should make champs neutral to keep a common theme‚Äù‚Ä¶ i agree </p><p>if the argument is ‚Äúthe fact that 24 Champs wasn‚Äôt neutral helped OpTic win‚Äù‚Ä¶ i strongly disagree</p></div>‚Äî OpTic Hitch (@hitchariide) <a href="https://twitter.com/hitchariide/status/1815548860917293271?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 23, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>This feedback will undoubtedly cause something of a shift going into the next season, which will unfold using Black Ops 6 as a competitive platform. Will we be heading to a neutral COD Champs in twelve months?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/warframe-1999-romance-dating-tennocon-soulframe<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Warframe </em>rules. I <a href="https://kotaku.com/oh-no-im-hooked-on-warframe-now-1844458537" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first realized this in 2020</a> while stuck inside, absolutely fiending for something to occupy my time. I proceeded to sink nearly 100 hours into the game, which had by that point already been around for nearly a decade. What I discovered was a co-op shooter MMO so rich with inventively implemented systems that it boggled the mind. Then I fell off playing it. Since then, I‚Äôve repeatedly told myself that I‚Äôll one day return to<em> Warframe</em>‚Äôs beartrap-like embrace. But four years‚Äô worth of additions mean it‚Äôs something of an intimidating proposition, especially when the game keeps adding even more new systems.</p><p>This is, to be clear, not a bad thing unless you are in my specific position. I have always respected <em>Warframe</em>‚Äôs dedication to kitchen-sinking so many different game genres that, if you try to describe it to a regular person, it barely sounds real. That in mind, I responded to this weekend‚Äôs announcement that the game‚Äôs next expansion ‚Äì the amusingly throwback-y <a href="https://www.warframe.com/1999" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Warframe: 1999</em></a> ‚Äì will include a dating system with both a knowing nod and a sigh of exasperation.&nbsp;</p><p>"Unlike other syndicates, when you arrive, we want you to be able to get a little closer with them,‚Äù creative director Rebb Ford said during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi0fgygNwvk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a live demo of the expansion</a> at developer Digital Extremes‚Äô annual TennoCon event. ‚ÄúSo for this syndicate, because we are in 1999 ... we figure you should be able to use instant messengers and build a romance system with any one of them. If you play your cards right, one of those six, including [expansion protagonist] Arthur, could be your New Year's kiss."</p><p>So basically, the expansion is introducing a whole new cast of characters, and you can romance any of them via a fleshed-out dialogue tree and text interface. It‚Äôs more than just a gimmick, a recurring theme with <em>Warframe</em>‚Äôs teetering tower of systems. Here, for the uninitiated, is a non-comprehensive list of the others:</p><ul><li><span>Space ninja combat</span></li><li><span>Cover shooter combat</span></li><li><span>Hoverboarding (with tricks)</span></li><li><span>Fishing</span></li><li><span>Open-world exploration</span></li><li><span>Linear corridor crawling (with <a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Mission" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dozens of variations</a>)</span></li><li><span>Cinematic story quests</span></li><li><span>Character creation (one of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/warframes-big-twist-knocked-my-brain-clean-out-of-my-he-1844882545" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest twists in video games</a>)</span></li><li><span>Moral alignment</span></li><li><span>Faction reputation ranks</span></li><li><span>Mining</span></li><li><span>Clans</span></li><li><span>First-person crime scene investigation</span></li><li><span>Pet capture/raising</span></li><li><span>Weapon upgrading</span></li><li><span>Additional weapon upgrade systems that each <a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Incarnon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">require their own wiki pages</a> to fully explain</span></li><li><span>Flesh mech collection/upgrading</span></li><li><span>Bigger mech collection/upgrading</span></li><li><span>Flesh mech ability mixing/matching (after you feed them to <a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Helminth" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a giant, pustule-spotted mouth</a>)</span></li><li><span>Flesh mech fashion</span></li><li><span>Ship battles</span></li><li><span>Bigger, cooperative ship battles</span></li><li><span>Ship upgrading</span></li><li><span>Adversaries (basically <em>Warframe</em>‚Äôs version of <em>Shadow of Mordor</em>‚Äôs Nemesis system)</span></li><li><span>Hacking</span></li><li><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPTCq3LiZSE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Musicals</a></span></li><li><span>Kahl's Garrison</span></li><li><span>Duviri (a roguelike mode)</span></li><li><span>Pool parties (with floaties)</span></li></ul><p>Now, some of these systems have at various points fallen by the wayside or proven to be less than the sum of their parts due to the inescapable gravitational pull of the game‚Äôs grind-y core, but you can‚Äôt accuse Digital Extremes of resting on its laurels.

            <p>
Developer NetherRealm has pulled the plug on its free-to-play mobile game Mortal Kombat: Onslaught, just days after the studio reportedly laid off its entire mobile team.
</p>
<p>
Mortal Kombat: Onslaught, a character-collecting RPG featuring faces from across the fighting series, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-a-new-mortal-kombat-role-playing-game-coming">announced</a> in October 2022 and arrived <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-onslaughts-free-to-play-rpg-battling-is-officially-available-now">almost exactly one year later</a>. It promised a "mobile-exclusive" story and "massive real-time group battles" for up to ten fighters.
</p>
<p>
Nine months on, however, and Onslaught is officially shutting down. NetherRealm <a href="https://x.com/mkonslaught/status/1814057567422750937">announced the news</a> on Twitter/X, writing, "We are sorry to inform you that Mortal Kombat: Onslaught will close its operations in October. It has been an honour creating this game for our Kommunity, and we appreciate the enthusiasm from our fans."

<p>
Onslaught will be pulled from iOS and Android stores today, 22nd July, but in-app purchases will continue until 23rd August. The game will be playable until 21st October this year.
</p>
<p>
News of Mortal Kombat: Onslaught's impending closure comes after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-studio-netherrealm-hit-by-layoffs">claims from NetherRealm employees</a> last week that the studio's mobile division had been laid off. At the time, it was noted the team was responsible for live service operations on three games - Mortal Kombat Mobile, Injustice 2, and Mortal Kombat: Onslaught - and while NetherRealm is yet to comment on the job cuts, it did <a href="https://x.com/MKMobileGame/status/1814387218443821252">move quickly</a> to assure Mortal Kombat Mobile players the game would "continue operations and have full support."
</p>
<p>
Those layoffs followed parent company Warner Bros. Discovery's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-fails-to-meet-warner-bros-expectations">admission in February</a> it was bracing for a "tough year", after it revealed sales of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League had failed to meet its expectations. The cuts appear to be a part of <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/warner-bros-discovery-lays-off-1000-employees-finance-max-1236074169/">wider job losses at the company</a>, but the decision to lay off NetherRealm's mobile team is perhaps surprising given Warner Bros' announcement in March it would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-focusing-on-mobile-and-free-to-play-instead-of-volatile-aaa-console-games">shifting its focus to mobile, free-to-play, and live-service titles</a> to combat what it called the "volatile" AAA market.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-acquires-multiversus-developer-player-first-games/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Multiversus is the first and <a href="https://multiversus.com/en-gb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only game made</a> by Player First Games studio. Initially announced in 2022 after leaks, it was put into beta from June 2022 to June 2023. As of May 2024, the game is fully released. Considering the number of characters from Warner Bros. IPs in this game, it is no surprise that Warner Bros. has officially acquired Player First Games.</p>
<p>Those curious about what it means for Player First will remain under the guidance of co-founders Tony Huynh and Chris White, who will be the studio head and head of technology. They will now report to Warner Bros. Games San Diego's studio head and VP, Carlos Barbosa, in these new roles.</p>
<p>Fans are concerned about this acquisition and what it means for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/multiversus-stuck-in-a-betaverse/">Multiversus</a>. While it was in a significantly better place during the beta, there could still be hope for the game. However, under WB, it's possible that a multitude of things could happen.</p>
<p>The games industry is an incredibly volatile workplace, with layoffs across game companies. From Riot and EA to even smaller companies like Tango Gameworks being closed down completely, it is difficult to tell whether projects will be viable or whether companies have enough livability in the industry as it currently stands.</p>
<p>"We have worked with Player First Games over several years to create and launch Multiversus, and we are very pleased to welcome this team to Warner Bros. Games. The bright and creative team at Player First Games adds to our extensive development capabilities," says Warner Bros. President David Haddad. Whether this team will be exclusively working on Multiversus or whether they will be invited to work on other projects remains to be seen. However, the statement suggests that there could be other games for Player First Games to work on.</p>
<p>In response to David Haddad's announcement, Huynh also added to the statement, expressing his positive outlook on the company's future and the development of Multiversus. "Our team is excited to join the Warner Bros. Games family, which is great for Multiversus overall. We are working to make Multiversus the best game experience it can be, and having our development team integrated with the publisher is optimum for the players."</p>
<p>We're unsure what updates are planned for Multiversus and whether premium content will be added to the game or a price tag will be introduced for the base game overall now that they are working entirely in collaboration with Warner Bros. Games.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cascadero-board-game-review.934149/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/cascadero-board-game-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Dr. Reiner Knizia might not be a household name, but it‚Äôs one of the most recognizable monikers in board gaming, thanks to his astonishingly prolific career, peppered with highly acclaimed titles like auction classic Ra, heavyweight tile-layer Tigris &amp; Euphrates and other great <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-adults"><u>board games for adults</u></a>. In recent years, the good doctor has slowed the pace of hits a little, but he still pops up with the goods from time to time, such as 2021‚Äôs <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/witchstone-board-game-review"><u>Witchstone</u></a>. Cascadero is his newest fare, and the big question is whether it‚Äôll measure up to those big Knizia titles of yesteryear.</p><h2>What‚Äôs in the Box</h2><div catalogid="c77b0238-0f78-470e-b589-673c2948b522" id="202260"><div id="202260" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Cascadero</h3></p></div><p>Cascadero comes in a worryingly slimline box, but the rich and vibrant cover art by Ian O‚ÄôToole, depicting a medieval messenger on a rearing horse, should allay any concerns about the quality of the contents. And once that lid slides off, any lingering doubts should vanish as the tray is packed with high-quality goodies.</p><p>There‚Äôs a bright fold-out, double-sided board with artwork to match the box cover, and a sheet of plain punch-out hex counters which is used on one of that board‚Äôs sides to play a variant. Some people might find the mix of vibrant player colors and muted background a little garish and others might find it affects readability a little, but these are minor complaints.</p><p>The rest of the components are wooden. Each of four player colors comes with a troop of little figures on horseback, and a bunting of flags to mark scoring achievements on the board. There‚Äôs also a bag of fake wax seals, resplendent in red and gold. Everything is neat, and nicely cut, and while it won‚Äôt win over folk who want legions of super-detailed miniatures on their tables, it‚Äôs great visual design in the European gaming tradition.</p><h2>Rules and How it Plays</h2><p>Like most Knizia titles, Cascadero has a theme that can rapidly be tossed aside to reveal an engaging semi-abstract design beneath. In this instance, you are placing messengers onto a hex grid studded with towns, trying to win the inhabitants over to the glorious reign of El Cascadero, the new ruler. But the townsfolk are suspicious, and will only listen to messengers who travel in groups. In game terms, this means that you get to score if you place a messenger piece next to a town, and it forms a group of at least two pieces of your color.</p><p>But there‚Äôs a catch. You can only score if it‚Äôs not only a group of two, but also if no other members of that group were adjacent to that town before. In other words, if you place one piece next to a town, it does nothing and if you then place a second piece next to the same town, it still does nothing. The initial piece of your group can‚Äôt be adjacent to the town you want to score. </p><p>While there are obvious reasons for this ‚Äì it‚Äôd be impossible to track whether you‚Äôd scored a town before, otherwise ‚Äì it also offers the first deliciously painful edge to dig into your decision-making. That board is pretty cramped. Aside for a few edge hexes, it‚Äôs hard to put a piece down that‚Äôs not immediately adjacent to a town, and that in itself is inefficient as you can‚Äôt then score it, only use it as a launchpad for neighboring towns.</p><p>Why is this important? Because the towns come in different colors, and scoring one will advance your token on the matching scoring track. The number of spaces you climb depends on the situation. One space if it‚Äôs the first piece to make contact with the town, two if there are other messengers already adjacent to the town and three if the town contains a herald, marked on the board by a star icon. Four of the scoring tracks offer the same bonuses, while the fifth, white, has extra goodies to snaffle. The catch is that you need to advance the track that matches your player color to the top space in order to be in with a chance of winning.</p><p>Remember how that board is cramped? Well, now you have additional dilemmas in deciding where to place your one precious piece each turn. Because you get a bonus space on the scoring track if there‚Äôs already a messenger adjacent to the town, pieces you put down that don‚Äôt score yourself aren‚Äôt merely inefficient, they‚Äôre a positive boon to your opponents. Not only that, but all of you will be champing at the bit to claim scarce territory around those herald towns, and those of your own player color, and so it‚Äôs a race to get them, but it‚Äôs also a race where every step gifts your enemies with possible scoring opportunities, while you try and digest this endless stack of problems and your eyes turn to saucers just thinking about it.</p><p>Yet there‚Äôs more. Moving up a scoring track doesn‚Äôt necessarily score you any points. There are other bonuses to net on your climb, from extra turns, to extra spaces on the track, to moving one of your pieces to a new board space. You can also gain seals, which are extremely useful as they allow a single piece to count as two, meaning you can score a town with one placement. But you can only get these if you land exactly on the matching space, not if you skip up by two or three, adding another headache to deal with as you plot your moves. </p><p>You might imagine that the dynamic, interactive nature of play, where you‚Äôre all jostling for position while trying not to let each other score, would make this chiefly a game of tactics rather than a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategy board game</a>. But thanks to those bonuses on the scoring track, that‚Äôs not the case. When you gain extra on-board moves or on-track spaces, if you‚Äôre well set up, it can trigger a cascade of scoring opportunities as one advancement earns a free one, which earns a free move, which earns another free advancement and so on. These chains can be absolutely devastating if you‚Äôve planned and timed it right, letting you bag a majority of those precious seals, or score the big points by closing off an achievement.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>All this goodness, and we haven‚Äôt even mentioned the included variants.</p></div><p>That‚Äôs right: while you can earn points on the tracks, the bigger payouts are available for being the first to reach certain milestones, such as connecting all five colors of town with a single group, or being the first to the top of a given track. There are less high-pressure goals for connecting two matching color towns with a group, which anyone can earn at any time, with a fat ten points extra if you do this with all five colors. But remember: unless you reach the top of your own color scoring track, it doesn‚Äôt matter how many points you have as the victory will go to the high-scoring player who has, making denial of scoring opportunities a valid and punishing end game strategy.</p><p>All this goodness, and we haven‚Äôt even mentioned the included variants. The advanced version allows you to move those important heralds each time they‚Äôre scored, creating an even more pressured race environment as you look to corner those bonuses for yourself. And there‚Äôs the farmer variant, where you flip the board, replacing some cities with a random placement of farmer tiles that earn you similar rewards to the scoring tracks. This results in a much more varied and cerebral experience. The striking thing is that each of the three ways to play is clearly the same game, but each feels like it has its own style and approach, offering three distinct challenges to master.</p><h2>Where to Buy</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/yLEpw?object_uuid=298059a5-4aca-439a-99d5-332c5aed76cd&amp;t=article" target="_blank">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/joEyv?object_uuid=298059a5-4aca-439a-99d5-332c5aed76cd&amp;t=article" target="_blank">Get it at Miniature Market</a></li></ul></div></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jul 22, 2024 8:30 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>Although it‚Äôs quite straightforward to learn, Cascadero peels back new layers of unforeseen depth each time you play it, and that combination is the mark of a truly great game. Like a chameleon, it differs markedly depending on player count and variant, meaning there‚Äôs a whole lot of game to enjoy in this deceptively slimline box. Those who only want to game for thrills and spills need not apply, but for anyone else, this is an easy recommendation. And in a market dominated by high production value games with complex, interlocking rule sets, it‚Äôs great to have an older master designer remind us that in board games less can still be more.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tiny-garden">Tiny Garden</a> is a puzzle game about planting flowers and crops you can then sell to buy seeds for new types of flowers and crops. That would be charming enough on its own, but your agricultural endeavours are set inside a Polly Pocket-style toy, with crops also able to be exchanged for furniture with which to decorate your diorama home. After blowing past its Kickstarter target, there's now a playable demo.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>It's only 20-minutes or so long, more of a "proof-of-concept" than a full demo, say the developers, with many unfinished features. It'll also only be available for the remainder of the Kickstarter pledge drive, which comes to an end on August 2nd.

<p>That said, I've just played it and I had fun. Plopping down plants to modify adjacent tiles, to irrigate soil or grow grass, and thus create platforms for planting new types of seeds, is a satisfying challenge. It reminds me of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concrete-jungle">Concrete Jungle</a>, which used a similar system as the underpinnings of a citybuilder.
</p>
<p>I'm also just in love with the presentation. I did not have Polly Pockets as a kid, or the so-called boy equivalent, Mighty Max, which swapped the makeup cases and domestic scenes for monster heads and creepy dungeons. We ignored such boneheaded gender essentialism with our own son and bought a sackful of old, secondhand Polly Pockets from eBay however, and he adored them. I must have spent dozens of hours hunched over them with him, acting out stories, our imaginations lit up by their intricate construction. 
</p>
<p>Matt beat me to covering Tiny Garden when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tiny-garden-plants-a-charming-cozy-farming-sim-inside-virtual-polly-pocket-toys">it launched on Kickstarter</a> earlier this month, but officially I'm writing about it again now because it's got a playable demo. Unofficially I'm writing about it so that I can say: a Polly Pocket mansion with a secret room behind a bookcase is infinitely cooler than a Mighty Max skull dungeon.</p>

                <p>Epic recently announced an unexpected collaboration with Tesla, the electric car company. Starting Tuesday, July 23, players will be able to drive a Cybertruck in<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/"> Fortnite</a> and<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/rocket-league/"> Rocket League</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The<a href="https://x.com/RocketLeague/status/1815386430710874530" rel="nofollow "> Rocket League</a> and<a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1815386568263110908?t=KLQ6PtB8nv0z2Bm5Oq5yng&amp;s=19" rel="nofollow "> Fortnite X/Twitter accounts</a> posted teasers about what players can expect. The Rocket League collaboration looks to be a standard one for the game, as real-life and fictional cars have been released as premium DLC in the past.</p><p dir="ltr">But as for Fortnite, the collab could be anything, seeing as the most current season is heavily tied to vehicle combat. As of this writing, it's unclear if the Cybertruck will serve as a boss car or if it can be modified with weapons.</p><p dir="ltr">Although these announcements may seem completely random at first, both games had <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1815084377535078540/photo/1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">teased a similar image</a> on its X/Twitter accounts of a tire mark across some white spray paint.</p><p dir="ltr">This isn't the first time Epic has teamed up with a real-world car company. In Fortnite, players can purchase a Ferrari 296; in Rocket League, they can buy Aston Martin Valhalla, BMWs, and much more.</p><p dir="ltr">The Cybertruck's unusual, blocky looks have been compared to those of low-poly video game cars in the past, so its appearance in games seems fitting. The real-life version has been impacted by <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tesla-cybertruck-recall-fourth-time-f3709f24063695bc231763fb07d7d700" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a number of recalls since it launched last year</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">This wasn't the only collaboration Epic has recently announced.
