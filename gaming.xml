            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Video games rule. Sometimes. They </span><i><span>can</span></i><span> be really cool. It can be tough, though. Finding them. The games are good, but the discoverability? Miserable. Storefronts prioritize what’s already selling in a frenzy despite an intimate record of your playing habits. If your tastes generally lie outside of <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-steam-deck-games-ever-megabonk-balatro-vampire-survivors-2000667367">roguelikes or survival games</a>, you’ve noticed you’re not always being served to your palette. That’s why I love Steam Next Fest. A publicity window, sure, but an easy opportunity to dredge the trenches of the video world.</span></p> <p><span>Steam, for all of its resources and data, never seems to match my freak. In my experience, the moment I buy Capcom’s </span><i><span>Pocket Fighter</span></i><span> on sale my discovery queue gets force-fed every </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-review-ps5-open-world-rpg-capcom-1851766113"><i><span>Monster Hunter</span></i></a><span> under the sun. I think of my poor YouTube algorithm, so confused, so eager to please me, that the moment I watch an old Gordon Ramsay clip the whole feed switches to </span><i><span>Kitchen Nightmare</span></i><span> reruns and </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgqudioHmTE"><span>Raj clips</span></a><span>. As if to say, “Now </span><i><span>this</span></i><span> I can work with.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Three times a year, Steam puts on Next Fest. A digital alternative to the E3 trade-shows of old, the event prioritizes demos for up-and-coming works. It’s a great, zero-investment opportunity to not just check out the biggest and most curious hits on the horizon, but to flesh out a sense of what games excite you, specifically. Because gaming doesn’t have common third spaces like rep theatres or record shops, this is as good as it’ll get for most.</span></p> <p><span>Surprisingly, it’s on that note that Steam runs especially flat. The games that make Next Fest’s front page are just as traffic-oriented as what the store calls attention to every other day of the year. If you’re like me, you keep tabs on interesting curators and creators, squirrelling games away into your wishlist. But even if you </span><i><span>are</span></i><span> proactive, Steam doesn’t offer a function to see if anything you’ve earmarked has joined in the festivities (</span><a href="https://steam-wishlist-demos.fly.dev/"><span>you’re welcome, by the way</span></a><span>).</span></p>   <p><span>No one knows you as well as you do. So unfortunately it’s on you to try to shape an environment by following developers, creators, critics, curators and feeds that seem to gel. Like an esoteric game? Check out its </span><a href="https://backloggd.com/"><span>Backlogged page</span></a><span>, peek into its lists to see what company it keeps. Hit the wishlist button on Steam as if that rainy day is going to be a biblical flood. You should probably hit up some </span><a href="http://itch.io/"><span>itch.io</span></a><span> feeds, too, where creators you’ve purchased from eagerly share what they find exciting. And if you aren’t in the habit yet, here’s a little tour through some of what I’ve hit up so far, speaking as </span><a href="http://funland.land/"><span>someone extra invested in the outer orbits</span></a><span> than most.</span></p>

 <p><span>When I first played </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2575900/Corn_Kidz_64/"><i><span>Corn Kidz 64</span></i></a><span>, it dawned on me that not only can indie devs pursue the games they’ve always wanted to make, they can make the exact game they </span><i><span>would</span></i><span> have made if they could have made one back when they were a brooding adolescent mall goth. That thread has beautifully blossomed. There’s a slate of games I’ve mentally categorized as “self-medicating interplay,” games in love with the magic-hat nature of what can be rendered on a computer and intense, uncontrollable energies taking the first multimedia shape they can.</span></p>

 <p><span>One of those is </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4133290/DownSouth/"><i><span>Downsouth</span></i></a><span>, a manic and lurid platformer from Troopsushi about a grinning purple bean descending into an urban underworld, its brisk pace distracted only by the fidelity of detail. Each environment is stuffed with more loaded imagery than a ‘90s MTV bumper. In a similar class is </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2244030/RUBATO/"><i><span>RUBATO</span></i></a><span>, a fun, physics-based, frog-based platformer with visual tonal shifts rapid enough to make you feel like a sleeper cell agent being shown their trigger code.</span></p>   <p><span>Reemerging after some time is </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2007430/Blast_Cats/"><i><span>Blast Cats</span></i></a><span>, an eclectic, explosive 3D platformer reared on all the PlayStation games you saw ads for but never saved up the allowance to play. Another long-awaited bit of goodness is </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4175410/PSI_Demo/"><i><span>PSI</span></i></a><span>, a first-person adventure about cults, plumbing, and frogs. And if you’re snowed in this week, may as well force the chill deeper with </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3635740/Subjectivation/"><span><em>Subjectivation</em></span></a><span>, an off-kilter horror game about a bitter frozen world. </span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Mommy’s Best, who have long made games from a world where the Amiga beat the Super Nintendo, have a demo up for their latest, </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3463500/ChainStaff_Demo/"><i><span>ChainStaff</span></i></a><span>, a pulpy, <em>Metal Hurlant</em>-flavored run-and-gun. Another retro-inspired game that would make more sense in another dimension is </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/952100/Bad_Pixels/"><i><span>Bad Pixels</span></i></a><span>, a 3D western shooter rendered to resemble something you might find on a floppy disc the size of your outstretched hand. And if you miss light rail shooters and adore names that would make an arcade operator scrunch their nose, you owe it to yourself to check out </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4353960/___a_Demo/"><i><span>ᴛᴜᴍᴏʀ ɴᴇᴄʀᴏꜱɪꜱ ꜰᴀᴄᴛᴏʀ:// αᴍᴇɴ</span></i></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>Again, just a vertical slice of what’s out there for those who have hit a wall. Find the routine that works for you, keep tabs and broaden your video game world. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-industry-generational-divide-roblox-nintendo-2000672648"><span>The major industry won’t</span></a><span>. If you do it for anything, do it out of spite.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>WWE 2K26’s new MyFACTION Team Chemistry will be influenced by, and change with, WWE TV feuds, alliances, and faction changes.</p>



<p>Team Chemistry is one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-myfaction-adds-team-chemistry-and-quickswap/" id="178385">new features coming to MyFACTION in WWE 2K26</a>. Team Chemistry scores are influenced by both positive and negative reactions from factions. Scores can also be lowered by specific traits. There are 60 traits across 10 categories, with 30 positive and 30 negative to work with.</p>



<p>While it was presumed that current factions would gel together well in the game, it is now confirmed that as characters change on WWE television, their alliances will change in MYFACTION as well.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-show-never-stops-in-wwe-2k26-myfaction">The Show Never Stops in WWE 2K26 MyFACTION</h2>



<p>In a new interview with Richard Breslin of <a href="https://www.gamingbible.com/news/wwe-2k26-confirms-world-tour-returns-856247-20260220" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GAMINGbible</a>, MyFACTION associate designer Brian Mazique explains how storylines on TV can change MyFACTION. When factions break up on current WWE TV, new cards featuring former stablemates will have bad chemistry with one another.</p>



<p>For example, he mentioned Raquel Rodriguez and Liv Morgan. While the Judgment Day stablemates are friendly right now, Morgan eliminated Rodriguez from the WWE Royal Rumble. Should that rift widen, future cards of Morgan and Rodriguez will have bad chemistry. Furthermore, he notes that players can mix and match to find the right chemistry cards to achieve different actions and traits.</p>



<p>“It’s a bit safe using positive chemistry with legendary factions like DX or the nWo, and things can change with current roster talent. But there will be other ways for players to experiment with cards and find the right chemistry combo for them to achieve different actions and traits, especially when creating unique factions,” said Brian.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Windrose has surpassed a major milestone pertaining to Steam wishlists.</p>



<p>Windrose is an upcoming pirate-themed survival, crafting, open-world PvE game. A demo was released during Steam Next Fest on February 17, where the game reached 22,000 concurrent players. Following that public demo, the game has been wishlisted by over 1 million Steam accounts.</p>



<p>The development team commented on the milestone with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3041230/view/498346952550778886?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a message on Steam.</a></p>



<p>“This past week has been a real whirlwind for our team with all the attention the game has been getting. And as the spotlight grows, so do expectations. We’re working hard every day to live up to them,” they wrote. ” Our biggest goal is to ship a great game and let you be the judge. It may take time, but with your support, this journey becomes a lot easier (and a bit more swashbuckling, too).”</p>



<p>The game was announced back in December during the PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted Showcase. There’s no set release date or price point for the game at this time. It is currently scheduled to release in 2026.</p>

<p>Chris Stockman, the design director of the first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/saints-row/" id="1267">Saints Row</a>, has provided an update that is disheartening for the series’ fans.</p>



<p>The last we heard of Saints Row, Stockman said he had been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/saints-row-1-director-asked-to-create-a-pitch-for-a-prequel/">asked to create a pitch</a> for a prequel to the series. At the time, he said that his dreams were a little closer to coming true. However, in his latest update, he seems to believe that the franchise as a whole is a thing of the past.</p>







<h2>Chris Stockman Feels Embracer Has No Ability to Do Anything with Saints Row</h2>



<p>There hasn’t been a Saints Row game since 2022. Replying to a user on Discord, Stockman said that he believed the franchise was dead. He went on to express his belief that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/embracer/" id="2740">Embracer</a>, the parent company that owns the Saints Row IP, has no ability to do anything with the platform and stated that they ghosted him after he tried his best to offer a pathway forward.</p>



<p>“I think the franchise is dead, unfortunately. I get the sense that Embracer has zero ability to do anything with it. I wish things were different. I tried my best to offer a pathway forward, but they’ve ghosted me,” he said.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Remember when we got excited about the prospect of a Saints Row prequel? Well according to Saints Row 1 Design Director Chris Stockman, Embracer is completely ignoring the idea.

Saints Row is once again dead.</span></p></article></div>







<h2 id="h-stockman-s-take-on-gta-6">Stockman’s Take on GTA 6</h2>



<p>Saints Row was once viewed as an alternative to Grand Theft Auto. GTA 6 is still on the way and is the most anticipated game of its generation. </p>



<p>Chris Stockman has previously stated that he believes the upcoming Grand Theft Auto Title would be deserving of a $100 price point. Read his full comments <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-deserves-100-saints-row-director-insists/" id="152091">here</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> has shuttered another western studio: TiMi Montréal.</p>
<p>TiMi – <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fired-assassins-creed-creative-director-now-at-tencent">which was headed up by former Assassin's Creed creative director Ashraf Ismail</a> after he was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-creative-director-ashraf-ismail-fired-from-ubisoft">let go from Ubisoft</a> amid a flurry of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/three-more-top-ubisoft-executives-resign-as-publisher-renews-commitment-to-fostering-an-environment-its-employees-can-be-proud-of">high-profile departures</a> in 2020 – seemingly closed on Friday, 20th February.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/tencent-timi-montreal-closed">Game File</a> – which says sources had warned that a "shutdown was imminent" – a senior gameplay programmer wrote on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fernandezluzuriaga_today-timi-montreal-is-officially-closing-share-7430638121156784128-RAMk/">LinkedIn</a> that though the team "had been aware this was coming for some time, it doesn't make the reality any easier".</p>
<p>A senior designer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7430638121714659328?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7430638121714659328%2C7430644929057415169%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287430644929057415169%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7430638121714659328%29">added</a>: "This team was exceptional not just in talent, but also in camaraderie. It’s one of those experiences that sticks with you for a very long time, and I feel privileged to have been part of it".</p><p>The five-year-old studio had been committed to creating "AAA open-world multi-platform games" but was chiefly working on titles it had inherited from Jade Studio, TiMi's name before 2020, and mobile spin-offs, including Pokémon Unite and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-mobile">Call of Duty: Mobile</a> (which is different from the mobile Warzone game that's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-will-shut-down">shutting down in April</a>).</p>
<p>According to its <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/timistudiogroup/">LinkedIn</a> profile, TiMi Group in its entirety employs between 5000 and 10,000 people.</p>
<p><em>An earlier version of this story inadverently classed TiMi as a NetEase studio, not Tencent. We've now updated the story - apologies for any confusion.</em></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/game-industry-generational-divide-roblox-nintendo-2000672648</link>
            <guid>1443199</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>30 years ago </span><i><span>Toy Story</span></i><span> chronicled a generational conflict between an old-timey pull-string doll and a fancy new one with buttons. The two toys learned to get along. This week a trailer for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/toy-story-5-trailer-woody-tablet-buzz-jesse-bonnie-cast-2000671373"><i><span>Toy Story 5</span></i><span> arrived</span></a><span> showing both toys enacting a </span><a href="https://dune.fandom.com/wiki/Butlerian_Jihad"><span>Butlerian Jihad</span></a><span> against tablets. While I agree on the potential detriments of excessive screen-time, it is telling how the creators and intended audience of&nbsp;<em>Toy Story&nbsp;</em>films now identify less with the kid playing with toys and more with the adult who just spent all of dinner hearing about “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/13/style/clavicular-looksmaxxing-braden-peters.html">looksmaxxing</a>.”</span></p> <p><span>If you’re a child who wants to watch a movie for children, or an adult who wants to watch a movie for adults, you thankfully have options beyond </span><i><span>Toy Story</span></i><span>. Disrupted as it is, the Hollywood entertainment industry has a built-in ecosystem to provide for demographics across all ages. Gaming still doesn’t.</span></p>

 <p><span>It has been an ominous month for the video gaming industry. AI infrastructure is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ram-shortage-ai-pc-gaming-china-cxmt-2000670712"><span>bodying the consumer technology world</span></a><span>. Another </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-website-down-shutting-down-servers-free-to-play-shooter-steam-playercount-2000669734"><span>multi-million-dollar live-service game</span></a><span> failed to meet its mark while Sony appears to be </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonys-ps5-era-studio-acquisition-spree-has-been-a-disaster-2000671404"><span>rebuilding themselves</span></a><span> entirely in that image. Not only is Microsoft singularly focused on AI integration, but as I wrote this, the heads of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/phil-spencer-goodbye-email-memo-xbox-microsoft-2000672084"><span>Xbox abruptly announced their departure</span></a><span> and replacement with reps from the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xboxs-new-boss-promises-not-to-flood-it-with-soulless-ai-slop-2000672087"><span>AI wing of the company</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>All of these dramatic pivots occur in the shadow of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/why-the-video-game-industry-is-dying-2000671338"><span>inconvenient player trends</span></a><span>. More players are playing fewer games. The games they do play </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/most-playstation-5-owners-have-been-playing-the-same-games-since-2022-2000672009"><span>are years old</span></a><span>. Landing a “forever game” is obviously lucrative to the company behind it, and why Sony is wagering they’ll nail at least one for themselves, but it’s a formula that can only shrink the industry.</span></p>

 <p><span>So why, when the population has never been more immersed in gaming, with even</span> <a href="https://www.theesa.com/annual-esa-study-reveals-video-games-universal-appeal-across-generations/"><span>a third of octogenarians</span></a><span> hitting </span><i><span>Candy Crush</span></i><span>, is success so sluggish? Taste and preferences differ across demographics and geographies. Impassioned fans from European rail-sim lovers to Latin fighting game communities make do even when the larger industry doesn’t provide. Those hungry for more deck builders, 4X games and turn-based RPGs will find something to eat.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>But the biggest gap between cultures is time, not space. There we see devastating stagnation. The youngest players are burning unsupervised hours on </span><i><span>Roblox</span></i><span>. The oldest are in Odinsleep until a single-player blockbuster catches their eye. The middle of the pack, getting the hang of disposable income, are </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/why-the-video-game-industry-is-dying-2000671338"><span>discovering other ways to spend</span></a><span>. The biggest players in the industry are still waiting for this entire bloc to gravitate toward the next </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> or </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto</span></i><span>, but year after year this just looks more like wishful, harmful thinking.</span></p>

 <p><span>Through the ‘90s, the video game industry very intentionally tried to narrow its players down to adolescent males, a controlled demographic that </span><a href="https://aftermath.site/console-wars-nintendo-sega-ad-research/"><span>made marketing much easier</span></a><span>. Movies, music and television did not do this beyond specific programs, because they knew their business relied on having something to sell to everyone. </span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>It’s no coincidence that the video game industry found its biggest successes when the facade slipped. </span><i><span>The Sims</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>,</span><span> and the DVD capabilities of the PlayStation 2 were boomtowns, made up of people who did not previously see themselves as the primary audience for games and gaming hardware. The biggest disruptors of the last decade weren’t fantasy RPGs or open-world shooters but </span><i><span>Minecraft </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Pokémon Go</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Gaming started to broaden its horizons, even if the dude-focused marketing divisions remained entrenched for years. If there is a crash on the horizon, it’s likely Nintendo will be the ones walking away from it the least scathed (</span><i><span>again)</span></i><span>. Games like </span><i><span>Mario</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Zelda</span></i><span> and <em>Mario </em></span><i><span>Kart</span></i><span> truly are widely beloved across generations, demographically pliable. The company has long understood the importance of trying to redefine what the experience of playing a game can be.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“If we continue to coalesce around the four or five genres, then we won’t get the new players because those people have already said we’re not interested in your genres,” former Sony Interactive Entertainment Chairman Shawn Layden </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-ps5-acquisition-preservation-1850951069"><span>said back in 2023</span></a><span>. “Don’t kid yourself that someone who’s said ‘no’ to</span><i><span> Call of Duty</span></i><span> for the last 15 years is going to start suddenly saying ‘yes’ to </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span>.”</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>It is worth mentioning that sales for </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span>, one of gaming’s evergreen cash cows, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-sales-activision-2000652111"><span>slipped last year</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>The current youth, opting for </span><i><span>Roblox</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Five Nights at Freddy’s</span></i><span> lore, are agnostic to the graphics-pushing that once defined industry progress. The people going to concerts, exhausted of being online but still enjoying posting, are compromising with the cruddiest flashcard digicams the 2000s had to offer. The fans who once reliably showed up for every new salvo in the AAA console war are now busy booking colonoscopies.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>As gaming rigs return to the $6,000 range, the island of high-performance players will recede to the peninsula of 30,000 or so people who unironically have “XxX” in their username. The biggest gaming companies are placing unsustainable bets that rely on each one of these kinds of players showing up and subscribing to a singular vision of gaming. These are growing pains maturing at the worst possible time. But it’s the result of intentional decisions, not inevitable fate. </span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>If this industry wants a future for itself, it needs an ecosystem that everyone can participate in for the long haul, from first steps to one foot in the grave. That requires an inclusive approach that is very alien to its foundations. Those players will need a way to discover more than the next live-service game, finding the gaming equivalent to </span><i><span>Sesame Street</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Smiling Friends</span></i><span>,</span><span> and </span><i><span>Saturday Night Live</span></i><span> all on the same idiot box. Edutainment and courtroom dramas alike. The player base is huge. Bigger than ever. Ever growing. They won’t all fit into the next </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span>.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>An apparent accident on the Southeast Asian YouTube page for Bandai Namco has revealed that the forthcoming Dragon Ball Game, codenamed Age 1000, is actually the next Xenoverse game in the Dragon Ball franchise.</p>



<p>The reveal was spotted by several individuals online when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bandai-namco/" id="1300">Bandai Namco</a> Southeast Asia had placed the Age 1000 reveal trailer in a now-deleted playlist titled “DRAGON BALL Xenoverse 3.”</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-dragon-ball-xenoverse-3-has-been-a-long-time-coming">Dragon Ball Xenoverse 3 Has Been A Long Time Coming</h2>



<p>It’s been nearly a full decade since the last game in the franchise was released. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/dragon-ball-xenoverse-2/" id="2178">Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2</a> was released in October 2016. The game has received numerous quality-of-life updates and has proven to be one of the most enduring modern Action RPGs.</p>



<p>The premise of the Dragon Ball Xenoverse titles is for players to create their own character in the universe of Z Fighters and level them up while experiencing brand new stories featuring classic heroes and villains from the Dragon Ball franchise.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-age-1000-fans-dragon-ball-online/" id="171842">When the game was revealed in January</a>, some believed it would be a follow-up to Dragon Ball Online, a 2010 MMORPG that has since been replaced by the Xenoverse line.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-game-features-new-work-from-akira-toriyama">The Game Features New Work From Akira Toriyama</h2>



<p>Despite his unfortunate passing in 2024, this new game will feature work from Akira Toriyama himself. Work began on the Age of 1000 project more than half a decade ago, and as such, Toriyama was able to work on world-building for the new title and brand-new characters.</p>



<p>More information about the game will be revealed during Dragon Ball Games Battle Hour on April 18 and 19. For more Dragon Ball on Insider Gaming, check out the upcoming DLC for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-summer-202-dlc-revealed-with-new-characters/" id="171864">Dragon Ball Sparking Zero.</a></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/slay-the-spire">Slay the Spire</a> 2 will release in early access on 5th March, 2026.</p>
<p>The hugely-anticipated sequel to the brilliant roguelike deck-building game is set to feature "new cards, characters, events, enemies, environments, and more," with developer Mega Crit teasing, "will you attempt the climb alone... or enlist the aid of your fellow adventurers?"</p>
<p>That's right – while, like its predecessor, Slay the Spire 2 is listed as single-player on Steam, it looks like four-player online co-op will also be available from launch day.</p>

<p>According to the new teaser, players can also expect all-new relics, potions, abilities, and alternate acts – more on those below – when the game finally releases for PC via Steam next month. It's currently the sixth most-wishlisted game on Steam, behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a>, Deadlock, Light no Fire, Resident Evil Requiem, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</a>.</p><p>Developer Mega Crit had been aiming for an autumn 2025 release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/slay-the-spire-2-has-been-delayed-but-it-wasnt-silksongs-fault-promise">but pushed it back to an unspecified Thursday in March 2026</a>, insisting at the time that "there's no single dramatic reason [for the delay]. Some personal life stuff hit the team (everyone's okay!), we kept saying 'wouldn't it be cool if...' one too many times, and honestly, the game just needs more polish to meet our standards".</p>
<p>I'm delighted to report that Slay the Spire 2 looks a lot like Slay the Spire 1  – which is a good thing – but upon closer inspection has some notable differences. As we summarised at the time, a lot of effort has gone into improving the visual presentation of the game, including 3D models in 2D environments, and a great deal more content stuffed in.</p>
<p>There are also alternate acts that allow you to choose different "a" and "b" variations of acts when you replay the game to help ease rerun repetition. Each alteration is said to have "radically" different environments, enemies, events, and bosses.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-wildlight-tencent-funding-layoffs-servers-2000669790">Tencent-backed</a> TiMi Montreal is shutting down less than five years after opening and without ever shipping a game. It appears to be the latest casualty of Chinese publishers pulling back on investment in North American studios.</p> <p>As <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/tencent-timi-montreal-closed?utm_campaign=post-expanded-share&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;triedRedirect=true">first reported by <em>Game File</em></a>, news of the closure began to trickle out on LinkedIn late last week. “I am genuinely heartbroken that the public will never get to experience what this team was capable of producing,” one laid-off programmer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fernandezluzuriaga_today-timi-montreal-is-officially-closing-share-7430638121156784128-RAMk/">wrote</a>. “TiMi Montreal was made up of really talented people and working with them was a privilege, the level of skill and dedication on this team was something special.”</p> <p>The studio was founded back in 2021 and was pitched as working on “AAA open world multi-platform games.” It joined TiMi Los Angeles and TiMi Seattle as the third office of TiMi Studio Group in North America. The company behind mobile hits like <em>Honor of Kings</em> and <em>Arena of Valor</em> was trying to branch out into bigger-budget blockbusters.</p>

 <p>A studio in Montreal seemed to outsiders like the perfect way to scoop up talent from open-world adventure factory Ubisoft. That included <em>Assassin’s Creed Valhalla</em> creative director Ashraf Ismail, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/07/28/ashraf-ismail-tencent-ubisoft">who joined TiMi in 2022</a> after being fired from Ubisoft following allegations <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-creative-director-fired-from-ubisoft-f-1844724819">around some of his personal romantic relationships</a>.</p> <p>But TiMi Montreal never announced a game it was making, or disclosed any co-development support it was providing on any recently shipped projects. TiMi’s L.A.-based studio Team Kaiju, which attracted former leads from <em>Halo</em> and<em> Battlefield</em>, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/tencent-closes-shop-on-team-kaiju">ended up shutting down back in 2023</a>. The retreat follows concerns about pricey development costs in the U.S. and competitors like NetEase cutting investment in <a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-casey-hudson-humanoid-origin-scifi-bioware-1851707754">a bunch of recent studio startups</a> over the past couple of years.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> has shuttered another western studio: TiMi Montréal.</p>
<p>TiMi – <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fired-assassins-creed-creative-director-now-at-tencent">which was headed up by former Assassin's Creed creative director Ashraf Ismail</a> after he was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-creative-director-ashraf-ismail-fired-from-ubisoft">let go from Ubisoft</a> amid a flurry of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/three-more-top-ubisoft-executives-resign-as-publisher-renews-commitment-to-fostering-an-environment-its-employees-can-be-proud-of">high-profile departures</a> in 2020 – seemingly closed on Friday, 20th February.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/tencent-timi-montreal-closed">Game File</a> – which says sources had warned that a "shutdown was imminent" – a senior gameplay programmer wrote on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fernandezluzuriaga_today-timi-montreal-is-officially-closing-share-7430638121156784128-RAMk/">LinkedIn</a> that though the team "had been aware this was coming for some time, it doesn't make the reality any easier".</p>
<p>A senior designer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7430638121714659328?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7430638121714659328%2C7430644929057415169%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287430644929057415169%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7430638121714659328%29">added</a>: "This team was exceptional not just in talent, but also in camaraderie. It’s one of those experiences that sticks with you for a very long time, and I feel privileged to have been part of it".</p><p>The five-year-old studio had been committed to creating "AAA open-world multi-platform games" but was chiefly working on titles it had inherited from Jade Studio, TiMi's name before 2020, and mobile spin-offs, including Pokémon Unite and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-mobile">Call of Duty: Mobile</a> (which is different from the mobile Warzone game that's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-will-shut-down">shutting down in April</a>).</p>
<p>According to its <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/timistudiogroup/">LinkedIn</a> profile, TiMi Group in its entirety employs between 5000 and 10,000 people.</p>
<p><em>An earlier version of this story inadverently classed TiMi as a NetEase studio, not Tencent. We've now updated the story - apologies for any confusion.</em></p>

              <p>Every game in <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> series is defined, in part, by its aesthetics, the visual design choices coalescing every element into one cohesive vision. Even during the Hylian hero’s original 8-bit journey, strong art direction transformed simple sprites into sprawling labyrinths, mysterious woods, and terrible foes in the player’s imagination. While the core of <em>Zelda</em>’s story and gameplay has remained (until recently) mostly the same, the series reinvents itself artistically with nearly every entry.</p> <p><em>This article was originally published on June 27, 2023. It’s been republished today following the 40th anniversary of </em>Zelda<em>‘s launch in Japan.</em></p> <p>Looking back on the 40 year history of the franchise, one thing is clear: Link has had a lot of looks.</p>

 <p>Cel-shaded oceans, lonely ranches, and apocalyptic moon landings all paint the diverse canvas that is <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>, but which entries truly <em>look</em> the best? There’s no bad-looking <em>Zelda</em> game—<a href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-the-wand-of-gamelon-the-kotaku-review-1818811388">not from Nintendo, anyway</a>—but today we want to rank the most aesthetically inspired, from least inspired to most. We’ll be considering all the mainline <em>Zelda</em> entries, and please keep in mind that this isn’t a ranking of the best games in the series, but rather the best-looking.</p> <p>Let’s step into the art gallery that is <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> and take a look around.</p>

Pokémon turns 30 on 27th February, and in honour of this momentous anniversary, we've run a series of polls leading up to the big day, asking you to vote for your favourite Pokémon from each generation. The nine winners will then go head-to-head in a final poll at the end of the month.</p>
<p>We've covered a generation a day, with <strong>each poll open for five days</strong>. And now we're at number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine...</p>
<p>Before we get the poll including candidates from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet</a> and their DLC, voting, let's see what Team NL thinks of the monsters from this final (for the moment) generation...</p><div><figure data-videoid="-mwkAYKvypQ" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-mwkAYKvypQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt-mwkAYKvypQ" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-mwkAYKvypQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-mwkAYKvypQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f0a5lkgnvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>So, for the last time before the grand finale. we've got 120 Pokémon listed in National Dex order (use the search bar to quickly find a specific one). And remember, <strong>you can only choose one!</strong></p>

<p><em>Thanks for voting! That's the last of the Gens, but keep an eye out for the final showdown between the nine winners in a week or so's time.</em></p>
<p><em>And if you missed Gens 5, 6, 7, or 8, those polls are still live:<br></em></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-baldurs-gate-3-grok-xai-2000672632</link>
            <guid>1443139</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Elon Musk, currently on track to become the world’s first trillionaire, is apparently obsessed with <a href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-grok-ai-deepfakes-undressed-images-2000658486">teaching Grok about video games</a>. The xAI-powered chatbot was reportedly so bad at answering questions about <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a> last year that Musk actually delayed a major update to its model so the problem could be rectified.</p> <p>That bizarre anecdote comes from a recent <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-xai-leadership-style-big-year-grok-ipo-spacex-2026-2">deep-dive investigation into xAI by <em>Business Insider</em></a>. Musk’s penchant for chaos and micromanagement was apparently so bad that when confronted with Grok’s inability to correctly parse details about Larian Studios’ hit 2023 RPG based on <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, he pulled top engineers off other projects to get the chatbot sorted.</p>

 <p>“In one instance last year, a model release was delayed for several days because Musk was dissatisfied with how the chatbot answered detailed questions about the video game ‘Baldur’s Gate,’ according to people familiar with the matter. High-level engineers were pulled from other projects to improve the responses before launch, they said,” <em>Business Insider</em> writes.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Can I have just one normal week <a href="https://t.co/bip2afWQLe">pic.twitter.com/bip2afWQLe</a></p> <p>— Very AFK (@Cromwelp) <a href="https://twitter.com/Cromwelp/status/2025332627645808932?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 21, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Lest you think this episode was a one-off, Musk was also apparently obsessed with teaching Grok how to play <em>League of Legends</em>. Some former xAI employees reportedly compare how the company is run to a never-ending fire drill. There are multiple “war rooms” running at the Palo Alto headquarters to tackle urgent issues, including getting Grok to Challenger rank in Riot Games’ popular MOBA.</p>

 <p>“At the end of 2025, at least five war rooms were running simultaneously, according to three people,” writes <em>Business Insider</em>. “One, they said, was dedicated to teaching Grok how to play one of Musk’s favorite video games, ‘League of Legends.'”</p>

 <p>That definitely sounds like the unparalleled, no-drugs grindset of someone worth a trillion dollars. It’s worth noting that all of this was happening the year following Musk exposing himself as <a href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-poe2-diablo-4-paid-boosting-fake-controversy-1851743670">a massive cheater</a> in games like<em> Diablo 4</em> and <em>Path of Exile 2</em>. <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>‘s own publishing head was busy calling out Musk’s promises of AI-generated video games <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-larian-studios-elon-musk-ai-xai-douse-2000632638">for missing the point</a>.</p>
