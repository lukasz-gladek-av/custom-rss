			<p>Marvel Rivals' next update, Season 4.5, launches next week on October 10, 2025, adding Daredevil to the roster as a new duelist. Beyond a new character, next week's update will add the beginnings of a highly requested feature: cross-platform progression support. The catch, unfortunately, is that it'll only be live for players invited to try it out, while everyone else will have to wait for cross-progression support to be available to all players with Season 5's launch.</p>



<p>As is routine with every major Marvel Rivals season update, developer NetEase has debuted two new videos. The first is a gameplay trailer showing off Daredevil gameplay and each of his skill and abilities in action. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>The second is a Dev Vision video featuring the game's creative director, Guangguang, going over the key changes in the coming season, including being able to customize the background of your home screen, and how cross-platform progression will work once it's live for all users.</p>



<p>You'll be able to access a main character across PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms, though your statistics and rankings will be separate for each platform. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Guangguang also teased that a new mode is going to be added to the game, with details set to premiere on October 17, and that the team is preparing a Halloween event with new cosmetics for various characters on the Marvel Rivals roster.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals' fourth season has seen some major changes, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-ps4-release-date-season-4/">the addition of a PlayStation 4 version of the game</a> and the introduction of cross-platform progression. However, a bigger, and likely more controversial change is still to come, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/loot-boxes-might-be-coming-to-marvel-rivals/">rumours still loom that loot boxes will be added to the game</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new beginner-friendly role-playing game has gone live on Kickstarter. David Marron's first major campaign on the platform is <em>Wizard Community College</em>, an RPG that revolves around learning magic at a magic school. The twist is that magic can easily get out of control if you're not careful.</p>



<p>According to the campaign page, <em>Wizard Community College</em> is a role-playing card game designed for 3-8 players. Each game is meant to last about twenty minutes. As the name implies, the players are newly inducted student wizards, solving problems with spells that go horribly wrong. The promo material is light-hearted and comedic, invoking works like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/strixhaven-curriculum-of-chaos-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Strixhaven</em></a>&nbsp;and the TV show,&nbsp;<em>Community</em>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizard-community-college-game-pieces.jpg?itok=0fsvoz-e 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizard-community-college-game-pieces.jpg?itok=mfX_qnqO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The game is promoted as a great gateway to role-playing games. The rules can easily be taught in about two minutes. The game is GM-less, allowing all players to contribute to the fiction. Lastly, it is designed to contain the best elements of a one-shot adventure. If you have been looking for a way to bring players into the hobby that isn't <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> or Monster of the Week, this may be the answer.</p>

<p>Setting up a game of <em>Wizard Community College</em> is simple. The scene is established by drawing an Event Card. This will give players objectives to complete. From there, players take turns in clockwise order, casting spells to solve the problem. Those spells are represented by spell cards.</p>

<p>Whenever a spell is cast, a disk is drawn at random from a bag. The symbol of the disk determines how the spell acts up. The color determines which player gets to explain how the spell messes up. The next player then reacts to the complication. This repeats until the main objectives are completed.</p>

<p>There is only pledge tier <em>Wizard Community College</em>: a physical copy of the game at an MSRP of $20 not including shipping. No add-ons or stretch goals are planned. This was an intentional choice by Marron to keep the project affordable and straightforward. A copy of the game contains the following:</p>

<ul><li>45 Spell Cards</li>
	<li>27 Magic Item Cards</li>
	<li>36 Major Event Cards</li>
	<li>18 Minor Event Cards</li>
	<li>8 Double-Sided Character Cards</li>
	<li>9 Player Aid Cards</li>
	<li>32 Colored Wooden Disks</li>
	<li>1 Drawstring Bag</li>
</ul><p>At the time of writing, Wizard Community College has raised&nbsp;<span><span>$3,380, which is just shy of its funding goal of $4,000. The campaign ends on October 31.</span></span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-steam-demo-pc-console-2025-coolest-looking-game-2000630663</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/one-of-2025%E2%80%99s-coolest-looking-games-now-has-a-demo.1314070/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-preview-beat-em-up-tribute-games-1851784757"><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em></a> may not have a release date yet, but it does have a demo. The coolest-looking Marvel game in years, and a game many of us at <em>Kotaku</em> are excited to play later this year, now has a small demo up on Steam letting you play the superhero brawler alone or with a few pals.</p> <p>On October 1, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4013980/MARVEL_Cosmic_Invasion_Demo/">Tribute Games and publisher Dotemu announced and released a free, playable demo</a> for the upcoming <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em>. The demo contains two full levels with boss fights, supports both local and online co-op, and features nine playable characters: Rocket Raccoon, Nova, Phyla-Vell, She-Hulk, Venom, Spider-Man, Wolverine, Storm, and Captain America. Here’s a new trailer for the demo:</p>

  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-brawler-dotemu-tmnt-co-op-switch-1851772740">Announced earlier this year</a> during a Nintendo Direct,&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/games/marvel-cosmic-invasion"><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em></a> is a side-scrolling 2D retro-inspired beat ’em up being developed by the same studio behind the extremely tubular and awesome <em>TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge</em>, which was also a 2D co-op brawler.&nbsp;<em>Cosmic Invasion,</em> like Tribute’s past games, is a snappy and action-packed retro throwback. I played the new demo on Steam for a few minutes and immediately had a blast smashing baddies as She-Hulk and Spider-Man. <a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-hands-on-preview-mvc-impressions-2000614681">Swapping between the two, which is this game’s big gimmick</a>, was great as it let me switch between Spider-Man’s fast and agile action during some segments and She-Hulk’s heavy hits during fights with tougher foes. I did encounter some performance dips, which wasn’t ideal, but hopefully those issues get ironed out when the game launches…eventually.</p>

 <p>While there are nine characters in the demo, that’s not the game’s full line-up. <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em> is set to include a large roster of 15 characters. <a href="https://kotaku.com/two-new-heroes-marvel-cosmic-invasion-full-roster-black-panther-ghost-rider-2000626521">We know 12 of the 15 characters</a> that will be playable at launch. Three more have yet to be revealed.</p>

 <p>Now the bad news for console players: The new <em>Cosmic Invasion</em> demo isn’t available on Xbox, PlayStation, or Switch. This has understandably disappointed many players online, with some jumping into the comments of the trailer above to share their frustration.</p> <p>Regardless, we shouldn’t have to wait long, as <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em> is set to arrive in 2025. Exactly when hasn’t been announced yet, but there’s not much time left in the year so if it’s not getting delayed, the game is likely weeks away from launching on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch 2, Switch, and PC.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-tcg-vendor-scalper-reseller-stream-shows-2000630658</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-sweet-side-of-pok%C3%A9mon-card-collecting-that-scalpers-can%E2%80%99t-steal.1314067/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Although I’ve sought out a handful of cards featuring my favorite monsters and characters, I generally only pay casual attention to the </span><i><span>Pokémon Trading Card Game</span></i><span>.&nbsp; I grew up with a giant cardboard box of old cards under my bed, but as an adult, I can’t imagine putting in half the time or money I did into it as a kid. It just seems like it would be too much hassle, and that’s not to mention everything that happens around the game. When I do hear stories about the TCG, they’re usually </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scalper-reseller-trading-card-van-gogh-pikachu-1850925900"><span>stories of controversy</span></a><span>. Images of people nearly destroying the Van Gogh Museum in order to get exclusive cards and merchandise to sell online, as well as grown-ass men fighting and camping out for cards outside of GameStops, are seared into my brain. This toxic, predatory side of </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>collecting </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-plush-scalper-reseller-world-championships-2000618087"><span>has pushed a lot of people out of the space</span></a><span>, as memories of excitement at finding your favorite card have been replaced by stories of scams and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/card-shop-pokemon-robbed-100k-hammer-rare-cards-thief-1851786241"><span>robberies</span></a><span>. That was how it was for me until fairly recently, when I saw a video from </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>vendor @beard_dad_cardz having an extremely sweet interaction with a girl named Sophia at a card show.</span></p>   <p><span>As a fan of his streams, Sophia is excited to be at beard_dad_cardz’s booth, and his viewers are so excited about her excitement that they donate so she can get a card she likes. She says she’s a fan of Umbreon and Espeon, and after she finds a card of the dark-type Eeveelution she likes, beard_dad_cardz gives it to her for free. The moment went viral on multiple social media apps and has accumulated over 17.8 million views on TikTok alone.</span></p>

 <p><span>A lot of </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>card vendors have taken up content creation as an extension of their business, and that means several of them livestream from card shows and capture moments like this regularly. You wouldn’t know it from the news, but there’s a lot of kindness, charity, and community in </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>cards that often gets drowned out by the worst bad actors. And as the stigma around the space has grown, creators and vendors like Chris Daywalt, the owner of HLD Cards and Collectibles, are trying to combat these notions by putting these moments of kindness on the internet, where people can see them.</span></p>

 <p><span>“The rise of videos where you’re seeing people scalping Costco for cards or doing things like that, that’s going to happen any time you really shine a spotlight on something, especially something as big as </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>,” Daywalt told </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>. “When people start hearing money around it, those people are going to come out of the woodwork. They did the same thing to sneakers and to Supreme clothes, video cards, and PSIs, anything else that they feel like they can make a quick dollar on, but I think what makes </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>different is the 30 years of community that’s been built around it.”</span></p>

    <p><span>Daywalt started HLD as a way to connect with his son Henry, whom the shop and channel are named after. Henry returned from a summer camp trip with his first set of </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>cards, which led to the father and son bonding over their collections. Daywalt says this ignited a passion in his son to start collecting and gave them a common interest, as Daywalt has been a lifelong TCG player, and grew up playing and trading with others.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I always used to say ‘I play </span><i><span>Magic</span></i><span> for the gathering,’ and so I really knew the community part of it before I knew the reselling part of it,” Daywalt said.</span></p> <p><span>What started as an opportunity for Daywalt to pass on his values around taking care of something and finding community quickly became a family business after his brother started making content out of their card show appearances, and his wife started handling other aspects of the business. Daywalt says he’s comfortable sharing this with his son because in his experience, the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>community sticks to the messages of kindness the franchise touts. There are still some bad actors that try to take advantage of others, though, which is why Daywalt </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@hldcardsandcollectibles/video/7545145575449152799?lang=en"><span>doesn’t do “trade-ups,</span></a><span>” or card exchanges in which the card the event attendee receives is of greater value than the one they part with, with adults, but will do them with kids.</span></p>

   <p><span>Promoting those good moments is why a lot of vendors are branching out into content creation. Sure, it’s another extension of the business and also works as viral marketing, but the narrative of bad actors dominating the space has become so prevalent that long-time fans feel protective of </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>and the space they’ve cultivated, and want to push back. Aaron Lee, one of the co-founders of Duckbird, grew up watching the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>anime and has memories of waiting for new episodes to premiere on WBTV back in the day. As such, he’s been in the space long enough to have encountered people engaged in shady practices at card shows time and time again. However, he says a lot of these are less common at in-person events than one might think, and he especially experiences them less in his small North Carolina town.</span></p>

 <p><span>“You’ll see people who you can tell are, like, obviously there to make a quick buck,” Lee told </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>. “There will be even kids and adults who are obviously there trying to make money essentially; taking advantage of vendors and whatnot, and have their kids try to do a trade-up challenge to get them a better card. That’s a big one that I’ve seen a lot, and that has come from a lot of influencers or YouTube content creators being able to do that. But if it’s, you know, someone who knows what they’re doing and[is] just trying to take advantage of people, that’s something that’s not so fun.”</span></p>   <p><span>For Lee and his partner, “Duck,” trying to make people feel welcome at card shows is important. Lee says that the pair tries to give free stuff to kids who show up, especially if they seem to be in the early days of their own collection journey.</span></p> <p><span>“We kind of do like a rock-paper-scissors game, but we use Poké Balls with different types [of Pokémon], and we give them free packs if they win,” Lee says. “Even if they lose, we still give them free packs. We’ll do coin flips with kids for free, and then even if they lose, we’ll keep flipping until they win. So it’s stuff like that to just make sure that anybody who we feel like is new to the hobby or is genuinely passionate about collecting is able to have a positive experience when they go to a show or if they stop by our stream. Anything to just let them know,&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>‘Hey, there are still people out there who really enjoy the space and just want to grow the community in the right direction.’”</span></p> <div> <p>Welcome to Exp. Share, <em>Kotaku</em> ’s <em>Pokémon</em> column in which we dive deep to explore notable characters, urban legends, communities, and just plain weird quirks from throughout the <em>Pokémon</em> franchise.</p></div> <p><span>Stories of vendors going out of their way to help kids get cards they’re looking for are pretty common at these events. Which is why, despite all the talk of big money in </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>these days, a lot of the biggest transactions are completely free.</span></p> <p><span>“I had people who were trying to find a card for a kid who’s looking for, like, a specific Pikachu card,” Lee said. “They’ll tell their buddies and their buddies will tell their buddies, and then the whole show will be searching for a card and bringing it to the kid. Half the time, they give it to the kid for free. It really just depends on where you are and who you talk with, but I would say like 80 to 90 percent of vendors that you see in real life are kind. They go out of their way to help the kid out or help somebody out when they’re looking for something specific. I see a lot of kindness with vendors when, sometimes, you might be trying to trade a card in that might not necessarily move as well. A lot of times, vendors will match the card 100 percent and just give the kid what they want, just to help the kid out. That’s where it starts, when you’re a kid and you don’t really wanna look at this in a monetary way. You just want to collect cards. You can really tell if a kid is just trying to collect cards, you know, versus trying to make some money. And that’s what I like to see.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Even with all these positive stories, piercing through all the constant reports of crimes and the viral moments showing scalpers acting a fool at major events can feel impossible. When I asked Daywalt what advice he’d give to someone trying to enter the space, he said the average collector and vendor is not going to be making thousands of dollars off these cards, and if you go into the hobby expecting that, you’re likely going to be disappointed.</span></p> <p><span>“If it’s about the money, go trade stocks or work in finance,” Daywalt says. “What I always say to people is that the reason I don’t necessarily worry if the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>market crashes tomorrow is because I’ll look at it as an opportunity to go get all the cards I wanted. They have a value to me outside of what a TCG player says the market value is. Don’t put that pressure on something, you know, buy it because you like it and it’s something that brings you joy intrinsically, not extrinsically, because it could make you some money.”</span></p>   <p><span>Lee echoed the sentiment and said that some of the best cards are ones you won’t find selling for three or more figures, and if you aren’t interested in the art or community, there are easier ways to make money.</span></p>

 <p><span>“We get tons of people coming up asking for particular Pokémon because they want to collect all of that Pokémon,” Lee says. “Then if it’s a less popular Pokémon like Dunsparce, then, you know, the cards aren’t gonna be as expensive, and it makes for a really fun time.”</span></p> <p><span>Daywalt says that even after the time he’s put into buying, selling, and collecting, HLD isn’t paying his family’s bills, and that every dollar they make at these shows is going back into the business. While he admits he does get invested in predicting the market, he encourages people who are hoping to find the golden ticket in a Target booster pack to interrogate whether they’re in it for the right reasons.</span></p> <p><span>“There’s a lot of knowledge and a lot of really sharp people that are already in the space, and you’re not going to catch up to them tomorrow,” Daywalt says. “I don’t care how many YouTube videos you watch or how many articles you read about it. If you want to get into this space, do it because it brings you joy. Do what you like, and make the money a secondary part of it if it’s important to you.”</span></p>   <p><span>After talking to vendors and seeing these kinds of wholesome interactions online, I still don’t know that </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>card collecting is for me. I have a collection of <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-raichu-evolution-x-y-paid-dlc-2000625371">Raichu</a> and Professor Turo cards on my shelf, and I think that’s probably enough. But after seeing the uptick in </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>card scams and content mills over the past few years, it was disheartening for a while to know a series that had brought me so much joy had become a symbol of predatory greed. At the very least, it’s comforting to know that some people are keeping the childlike wonder alive, and that they’re posting reminders of it online.</span></p>

                <p>KPop Demon Hunters, which quickly became one of Netflix's most popular things <em>ever</em> when it was released on the streaming service earlier this year, is coming to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> on October 2, but this collaboration is way more than just new skins for the item shop. HUNTR/X is taking over Battle Royale, Blitz, and Creative, essentially getting the first week of Fortnitemares to themselves before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-fortnitemares-2025-everything-to-know/1100-6535025/" data-ref-id="1100-6535025">the Halloween party begins in earnest a little later</a>. Take a look at what's in store in the teaser below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ipctlvNePk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5ipctlvNePk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In all, Fortnite x KPop Demon Hunters is adding quite a pile of stuff around the Fortnite ecosystem. There are at least three new weapons and items to Battle Royale and Blitz, with Rumi's sword, Mira's Spicy Ramyeon, and a new version of the teleporting void mask. There's Demon Rush, the new KPop Demon Hunters-themed re-do of the limited-time Horde Rush mode, which Epic brings back each October. There are KPop Demon Hunter items and NPCs that can be used for modes designed using Unreal Engine for Fortnite (UEFN), as we've seen previously with Squid Game and The Walking Dead.</p><p>And, yes, there will be skins in the item shop for each member of HUNTR/X. There's been no word about any jam tracks, however.</p><p>October is a busy month for Fortnite. In addition to the Fortnitemares event that is expected to significantly shake up the loot pool in Battle Royale next week, October 2 marks the start of Fortnite OG Season 6, and October 9 marks the beginning of Fortnite Festival Season 11. The new music pass is expected to be full of Fortnite-original stuff instead licensed music and skins like usual--but the KPop Demon Hunters takeover has fans wondering if HUNTR/X might actually be the new season headliners. But there have been no leaks thus far about the upcoming Festival season, so that's pure speculation at this point.</p><p>KPop Demon Hunters is just one of a pretty massive pile of new Fortnite collaborations we're expecting this month.

<figure data-uuid="010e79099c209"><a title="Silksong Funny" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/010e79099c209/silksong-funny.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's very easy not to see the funny side of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. Don't worry, I've been there. Something about bashing your head against a boss for the 20th time takes away the giggles a little bit, and that's okay. But you have to hear me out here: I haven't laughed this much at a game in a very long time.</p>
<p>It tickles a very <strong>Looney Tunes</strong>-esque niche that I didn't realise I still found so funny. There's none of the surrealism of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/thank_goodness_youre_here">Thank Goodness You're Here</a> or the quips of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/portal_companion_collection">Portal</a>, but if you're the kind of person who likes watching Wile E. Coyote finally catch Roadrunner only to immediately land a heavy anvil to the noggin, then Silksong has more than enough opportunities to laugh away the pain.</p><div><figure data-videoid="8PPa7JzGiQE" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed61a957kryvxi&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>835k</span></a></p>

<p>I first noticed this at the end of my battle with The Last Judge — the final boss of Act 1. I know that I'm not alone when I say that this battle was a <em>pain in the butt</em>. I threw countless, and I mean <em>countless</em>, attempts at this bell chucker (<em>steady</em>), and just when I thought I had wrapped it up at last, it landed one final twisted joke: a massive explosion.</p>
<figure data-uuid="9742e7970a2ea"><a title="Silksong Funny" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9742e7970a2ea/silksong-funny.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'd defeated my much-battled foe and was in the process of performing my victory dance around the sofa when I spotted the smoke spilling from its mace. I dived back to my controller and hit dash just in time to see the whole thing go up in flames, instantly hitting me for three points of health and leaving my already dishevelled Hornet with just one Mask left.</p>
<p>If I had been caught in the epicentre of the blaze and died in the process, it's unlikely that I would have found it as funny, but after hours of trying to beat this thing, the way that it so very nearly got the last laugh was enough to tickle me pink.</p>
<p>It's that last-minute bait and switch that Silksong does so well. It butters you up to the point of <em>thinking</em> you've beaten its toughest challenge, only to then drop a metaphorical Acme Anvil on Hornet's head. If you don't laugh, you'll cry.</p>
<p>And I started to see it everywhere. I'd be patting myself on the back after clearing a particularly perilous bit of platforming along Sinner's Road, only for the floor to crumble away and chuck me into a pit of spikes below. Hunter's March is home to the nasty bench of doom. And what's the High Halls' gauntlet challenge if not a Pharloom rendition of the broadcaster brawl from <strong>Anchorman</strong>?</p>

<p>But like the very best comedies, there are layers to Silksong's laughs. Take the NPCs, for example. When was the last time that you laughed this much at a little guy? They might have a particularly comical look like Garmond's sublime 'stache <em>[Zan-zi-baaaar! - Ed.]</em> , a voice that gets funnier the more you hear it (you know we're talking about you, Caretaker), or just a generally giggle-worthy vibe like... well, all of Trobbio. The more I played, the more I chuckled whenever I ran into a new or familiar face.</p>
<p>There's a sprinkling of slapstick, too. The bug-obsessed Nuu is funny enough on looks alone — Sly Snootles fans, rise up — but let's not pretend that watching Hornet deny their kissy advances with a swift slap to the face <em>didn't</em> make you snort.</p>
<p>Perhaps that's what it all comes down to: Hornet is the ultimate straight man. The weirdness of Pharloom gets dialled up to eleven because we experience it all through the never-wavering emotionlessness of Hornet's mask. I laugh at all of the above examples because I can feel Hornet pulling a <strong>The Office</strong>-style look-to-camera whenever something unexpected happens. You just know that this fearless warrior hates how goofy she looks floating in the Drifter's Cloak or being relegated to riding with the mutts in the back of the Flea Caravan.</p>
<p>I've only seen the one ending of Silksong so far, but I fully intend to go back to it one day and wrap up Act 3. I hear the finale is tough, like <em>really</em> tough, but as long as my beloved little weird guys continue to crop up all over the place, I know I'll have a laugh seeing it through.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Right, there's just a constant wall of bad news at the moment, so how about something a bit nicer. Earlier this year, Summerfall Studios announced that the Kickstarter for their demonic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> deckbuilder <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/malys">Malys</a> didn't work out, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-kickstarter-for-dragon-age-writer-david-gaiders-demonic-deckbuilder-malys-didnt-work-so-here-it-is-in-early-access-instead">so they'd be releasing it in early access instead</a>. Much like Kickstarters themselves, early access releases are risky business too, but it appears that at the very least it's worked well enough to grant the game a 1.0 release.
</p>
<p>
Summerfall shared word of this very fact yesterday, revealing a release date of October 23rd in the US and Europe, or October 24th in Oceania. "There are a million more things we’d put into Malys if we had the time and runway, but we’re so proud of where we’ve been able to get the game to, and how fun it is to play," Summerfall explained in a <a href="https://www.summerfallstudios.com/malys-developer-updates/devlog-6-v1-is-coming">devlog</a>. They also shared that you can expect them to be quiet in the lead-up to launch as they deal with last minute bits of feedback, as well as getting as much actual video game into the video games as possible (plus a bit of polish and "pizazz").
</p>
<p>
In terms of what to expect from 1.0, don't go too attached to your current save file, as it'll be completely reset when the update drops. With the full release, there will be a completely playable story, three regions to get through, a big music update, and the cherry on the icing, a final boss fight. Plus, there are double the "amount of random encounters, or the numerous new cards, curios, demons, consequences and rewards."
</p>
<p>
For those that haven't been ensnared by Malys' dark and mysterious ways, it's one of those roguelike deckbuilders, one where you are a former priest turned demon-hunter who is going around a ruined city performing exorcisms. Summerfall Studios, quite notably, was also co-founded by original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a> writer David Gaider, so there's certainly some veteran skill attached to the project.
</p>
<p>
You may also want to pick up Malys now if you're at all interested, as the price will be going up slightly on launch - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3449690/Malys/">it's available on Steam now</a>.

                <p dir="ltr">Amazon's Luna cloud gaming service, now in its third year, has been a constant part of their Prime lineup, allowing Prime members to stream games at no extra cost right from their PCs or TV sets. Today, the company has <a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/news/articles/new-amazon-luna" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced its plans</a> to overhaul the Luna experience, with new social features and a slew of new games coming to the service later this year.</p><p dir="ltr">The main new offering of the Luna redesign is called GameNight, which will offer a collection of multiplayer-focused games that players control with their cell phones. The collection will include adaptations of classic board games like Taboo and Clue, established party games like Exploding Kittens, and new titles like Courtroom Chaos: Starring Snoop Dogg, where players must try to convince Judge Snoop Dogg to rule in their favor by spinning stories and placing the blame on other players.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajawdjs6KKA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ajawdjs6KKA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The selection of games available to stream on Luna will also increase with the overhaul, with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, and Dave the Diver among those announced. Luna Premium members will gain access to even more games, including Lego DC Super-Villains, Team Sonic Racing, Batman: Arkham Knight, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">Amazon Luna fully launched in March 2022, following a "soft launch" trial period that began in October 2020. Subscribers can access Luna on tablets, smartphones, PC, and smart TVs, and they can use any Bluetooth-enabled controller to play streamed games. A Luna controller specifically made for the service was released by Amazon just before the October 2020 soft launch.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/world-of-warcraft-midnight-deep-dive-%E2%80%93-housing-early-access-starts-on-december-2.1313992/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Blizzard invited various content creators and press members, Wccftech included, to get a brief taste of the World of Warcraft: Midnight Alpha before it goes live tomorrow. In this short period of time, we were able to capture some footage of Silvermoon City and the new Housing feature, arguably two of the standout features of the upcoming expansion.</p>



<p>We also watched the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmG98apVwKw&amp;pp=ygURd29ybGQgb2Ygd2FyY3JhZnQ%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deep Dive presentation</a> in advance. This 30-minute video reveals many new details about World of Warcraft: Midnight; here's a summary of what the developers explained about the second chapter in the Worldsoul Saga.</p>



<p>The arrival of the Voidstorm—a swirling vortex of shadow—heralds the return of Xal’atath, the big bad enemy introduced in The War Within, now wielding the Dark Heart. Her goal is simple and rather scary: to devour the heavens and extinguish all light in the universe. The expansion centers on a desperate defense of the Sunwell, led by Lady Liadrin and Lor’themar Theron (and, of course, the players), as the forces of Light and Void clash in a battle that is more reckoning than war.</p>



<p>The Blood Elf capital of Silvermoon City has been reimagined as a shared hub for Horde and Alliance. It's also, at last, a city fully renewed by the Sunwell's light. Landmarks that Horde players have are familiar with now shine renewed, but there are also brand new areas like the Sanctum of Light and Garden of Remembrance, which offer fresh lore and exploration. The shared space includes trainers, vendors, and more. <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-qa-housing-long-term/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As we were told in our Gamescom 2025 interview</a>, a third of Silvermoon City remains exclusive to the Horde, and Alliance players must remember not to get too close or they may be attacked.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="World of Warcraft: Midnight Alpha - New Silvermoon City Tour" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lrmzYU1rbYg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Because of the Sunwell's healing outburst, the Eversong Woods, once scarred by the Scourge campaign led by Arthas Menethil on his way to become the Lich King, are now teeming with life. Eversong Woods has also been merged with the Ghostlands into a seamless, expanded zone connected to the Eastern Kingdoms. The healing energy might have revitalized the land, but it also inadvertently caused a mysterious and dangerous overgrowth known as lightbloom, which, if left unchecked, could cover the whole zone in a jungle-like environment. Quests include solving noble feuds, investigating suspicious apothecaries, and unraveling a murder mystery with Magister Umbric.</p>



<p>After they're done with this first region, players will be able to progress in World of Warcraft: Midnight in any order of their choosing. There are three main options: Zul’Aman, Harandar, or a continent-spanning storytelling experience with Arator, son of Turalyon and Alleria Windrunner. Once those main stories are completed, the paths converge as heroes make their way into the Voidstorm itself to face Xal’atath’s fiercest allies.</p>



<p>The fallen Amani empire seeks redemption in Zul’Aman (once a 10-man PvE raid). Players join Zul’jarra, granddaughter of Zul’jin, to reclaim sacred temples and fight deranged Void cultists. This region features fog-shrouded ruins, stormy wilds, and sky-scraping peaks. Helping the Trolls means they will, in return, aid the Sunwell's defense.<br>Harandar, a primordial jungle deep within Azeroth, is where the roots of the World Tree converge. This region is home to the Haranir, already seen in the previous expansion. They are a reclusive race now forced to join the surface war against Xal’atath. Harandar features fungal towers, moss bridges, and the Cradle—a sacred site once ruled by a nascent goddess, now vanished. The Haranir are also the next playable allied race; their racial abilities include the ability to fast-travel via the World Tree roots. Haranir characters can be Warriors, Hunters, Rogues, Priests, Shamans, Mages, Warlocks, Monks, and Druids (with unique forms reflecting their jungle origins).</p>



<p>As for Arator’s journey, it follows the son of High Exarch Turalyon and Void Elf Ranger Alleria Windrunner on a continent-spanning quest to search for sacred relics and strengthen the Light. Featured encounters include defending Light's Hope Chapel, cleansing Scarlet Monastery, and ultimately confronting his legacy with the Sons of Lothar at Blackrock Mountain, all of which are iconic places vanilla World of Warcraft players will recognize.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Finally, there is the Voidstorm, a chaotic, gravity-defying zone filled with ancient Void creatures called Domanaar. Here, three huge Nexus Points fuel Xal’atath's power. Players must uncover the storm's secrets alongside the Void Elves and other champions from Azeroth.</p>



<p>When it comes to launch content, World of Warcraft: Midnight offers over ten Delves, including Parhelion Plaza (located in the Isle of Quel'Danas), Collegiate Calamity, and Shadowguard Point, and one seasonal Nemesis Delve. Each Delve has its own unique mechanics, like commanding Light artillery or navigating pocket dimensions. The War Within's Brann Bronzebeard will take a break this time so that players will be joined by a new Delve companion: Valeera Sanguinar. Like Brann, her abilities differ depending on her player-selected role of tank, DPS, or healer. When set to DPS, her Killing Spree skill damages multiple enemies at once as Valeera phases in and out of the shadows. As a healer, her Vampiric Reaping extracts the enemies' life force in the form of orbs that the players can collect to get healed. As a tank, she has an ability called 'Your First Mistake' that taunts and deals damage over time to ensure an enemy is focused on her rather than the players.</p>

<p>The expansion also includes eight new group dungeons, such as Windrunner Spire, Magister’s Terrace, Murder Row, The Den of Nalorakk, Maisara Caverns, Blinding Vale, Voidscar Arena, and Nexus-Point Xenas. Windrunner Spire, located on the Western shore of Eversoong Woods, explores the haunted legacy of the Windrunner family. Players will have to help Lirath, the only brother to the more famous Winderunner sisters; he's a spirit who just wants his home to be free of the many restless spirits that now call it home. </p>



<p>World of Warcraft: Midnight's endgame includes three raids at launch: Voidspire, the heart of Xal’atath's power, guarded by six fearsome bosses; the Dreamrift, where players will hunt an undreamt god that never should have been, and the March on Quel’danas, where players will face Belo’ren, a Void-corrupted phoenix, in this two-boss raid. </p>



<p>The expansion also adds the Prey System, an opt-in bounty hunting system led by Astalor Bloodsworn in Silvermoon City's Murder Row. Players will hunt targets like Magister Sunbreaker, High Vindicator Vureem, and Executor Kaenius, picking between three difficulty tiers: Normal, Hard, Nightmare. Higher difficulties incorporate torments to add personal afflictions like time-limited kills or lethal spirits.</p>



<p>One of the brand new things revealed today is the Arcantina, a cozy, cross-faction tavern serving as a quest hub and social space. It offers respite from the war against the Void and even access to new adventures. Blizzard said familiar characters would show up, giving quests that will send players worldwide to search for relics from the long-forgotten past.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The long-awaited Housing system will allow players full customization with interiors and exteriors. Architectural styles available at launch include Orc, Human, Blood Elf, and Night Elf. An Advanced editing mode allows rotation, scaling, and floating of décor, and many housing items can be dyed to achieve the desired look. More Housing rewards are tied to many facets of core gameplay, including achievements (even from past content exploits), crafting, vendors, and events. What's particularly interesting is that players can choose to either join a public Neighborhood or a private Neighborhood. The latter are also further split into Guild Neighborhoods, which scale to fit the Guild roster, and Charter Neighboorhods, which cap at 50 homes. The developers have even prepared Neighborhood-wide monthly Endeavors that can unlock themed decorations and community rewards. Early access to the Housing system will start on December 2 for those users who pre-ordered the expansion.</p>



<p>Demon Hunters will be able to select a new spec, Devourer, a Void-powered mid-range DPS with a summonable Void Scythe. Their abilities include Voidblade, Hungering Slash, Void Ray, and Collapsing Star. Metamorphosis and Reap mechanics allow for high burst damage. In addition, Void Elves can now be Demon Hunters, too.</p>



<p>World of Warcraft: Midnight will also update the MMORPG with several quality of life, Player versus Player and user interface enhancements, such as: </p>



<ul>
<li>Transmog overhauled with slot-based looks and auto outfit swapping.</li>



<li>Apex Talents: powerful multi-point capstones in the talent trees.</li>



<li>PvP additions: Slayer’s Rise (an instanced epic battleground inspired by others like Alterac Valley and Isle of Conquest) and an open world PVP area) and Training Grounds (formerly known as the brawl “Comp Stomp,” now a permanent fixture to PVP battlegrounds with Silvershard Mines and Battle for Gilneas available).</li>



<li>New player experience enhancements: fast-track to Dragonflight and lorewalking.</li>



<li>Combat assistant, cooldown manager, profession streamlining, and more.</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>



<p>Finally, Blizzard revealed that a physical Collector's Edition of World of Warcraft: Midnight can now be pre-ordered <a href="https://fave.co/43136dl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the official website</a>. It features an art book, a collectible pin, a replica of the Dark Heart, and the Epic edition of the game and all its digital bonuses.</p>



<p>Renowned leaker billbil-kun <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-to-launch-february-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed yesterday</a> that the expansion will go live on February 26, 2026, although Blizzard did not comment on the leak and remains on a generic 2026 release window.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The spooky season is here and it’s packed with a terrifying number of new game releases. October is always a busy month but this year, it feels even more overwhelming than usual. <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>, the latest prestige open-world blockbuster from Sony, kicks things off this week while the team behind <em>Shovel Knight</em> wraps up the month with <em>Mina the Hollower</em>, their teeny, tiny, cozy homage to <em>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</em>, debuting on Halloween. Trick or treat? Why not both!</p> <p>In between, we’re getting the return of franchises with a lot to prove in <em>Battlefield 6</em>, <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>, and <em>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</em>, as well as other big sequels in&nbsp;<em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> and <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>. And don’t lose track of some of the top-wishlisted games on Steam coming in October, including <em>Little Nightmares 3</em> and <em>Arc Raiders</em>. It’s felt like there are too many games for a while now. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-09-26/the-video-game-industry-has-a-problem-there-are-too-many-games">That’s a problem for the video game industry,</a> but it offers a bounty of riches (and choice paralysis) for players this month.</p>

The service, which gives people access to a large library of games for a monthly fee, has long been considered one of the best deals in gaming, especially for people who don’t want to buy dozens of games a year. You could theoretically just subscribe to Game Pass and have something new to play every month as games rotate in and out of its catalog. Well, today Microsoft announced it would be raising the price for the Ultimate tier from $20 to $30 a month.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Along with the hefty price increase, the Ultimate tier is getting a lot of new games and perks, including the Ubisoft+ catalog and a </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>crew membership that gives you battle pass access and in-game currency every month. The other tiers are also going up in price, and will now include cloud gaming access and an expanded library. The PC Game Pass package, however, is going up from $12 to $16.50 with no new perks.

            <p>We knew it was coming, but now Epic Games has confirmed that KPop Demon Hunters is coming to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> on 2nd October - that's tomorrow. The KPop trio from the film will all appear, as will the demons. Sadly there's no mention of the demonic boy band, Saja Boys.</p>
<p>Fortnite's Horde Rush mode returns as Demon Rush, this time with you, Rumi and co fighting off waves of faceless demons. You'll be able to load up on KPop Demon Hunters perks between each survival phase. This mode will run from 2nd October to 1st November.</p>
<p>In the store you'll be able to buy Rumi, Mira and Zoey outfits and accessories. Emotes will also hit the Fortnite Shop and a bundle will be available containing multiple items. Inside Battle Royale and Blitz you'll be able to complete quests to earn special items, such as Rumi’s Sword and Mira’s X-tra Spicy Ramyeon.</p>
<p>For players who like to create content for Fortnite, a whole load of assets are being added inspired by the Netflix film.</p>
<p>You can see the KPop Demon Hunters Fortnite crossover in the trailer below:</p>

            <p>The early access release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/moonlighter">Moonlighter</a> 2: The Endless Vault has been delayed by a month due to the amount of games being released in October.</p>
<p>Developer Digital Sun and publisher 11 Bit Studios had originally planned to release its RPG shop-sim adventure sequel on 23rd October, but now it'll be out on 19th November.</p>
<p>October has "filled up with so many other great releases that we feel it has become too crowded for us" they wrote in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2350790/view/525355229451912554?l=english">statement shared on Steam</a>. "And as every wise shopkeeper knows, even the most precious gem can be overlooked in an overstuffed showcase."</p>

<p>In the meantime, closed playtests will run soon on Steam and the Microsoft Store, with details expected soon.</p>
<p>October's release schedule is certainly looking stacked. The 23rd, specifically, sees the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/plants-vs-zombies">Plants vs. Zombies</a>: Replanted, Once Upon a Katamari and Double Dragon Revive.</p>
<p>However, there are other big games due out the rest of the month, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ghost of Yotei - 2nd October</li>
<li>Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 - 2nd October</li>
<li>Digimon Story: Time Stranger - 3rd October</li>
<li>Battlefield 6 - 10th October</li>
<li>Little Nightmares 3 - 10th October</li>
<li>Pokemon Legends: Z-A - 16th October</li>
<li>Jurassic World Evolution 3 - 21st October</li>
<li>Ninja Gaiden 4 - 21st October</li>
<li>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 - 21st October</li>
<li>The Outer Worlds 2 - 29th October</li>
<li>Arc Raiders - 30th October</li>
<li>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake - 30th October</li>
</ul>
<p>Still, even with the move, Moonlighter 2 will now compete with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a> 7 on 14th November.</p>
<p>While it's certainly a wise move to not have quite so much competition on release, it's near impossible to find a quiet release date to stand out with so many games released these days.</p>
<p>Plenty of games <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksongs-release-date-causes-delays-for-more-games-than-you-might-think">shifted release date in the wake of Hollow Knight: Silksong's surprise launch</a>, but has this set a worrying precedent?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a>'s surprise release in particular was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silksongs-surprise-release-was-a-little-callous-says-hell-is-us-creative-director">described as "a little callous" by Hell is Us creative director</a> Jonathan Jacques-Belletête, believing it impacted sales of the sci-fi adventure.</p>
<p>The early access release for Moonlighter 2 was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/moonlighter-2-plops-players-back-into-the-shoes-of-adventurous-shopkeeper-will-with-early-access-release-date">announced back in August</a>. The game is a follow-up to 2018's Moonlighter, and sees a shift from top-down to 3D worlds.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>developer Funcom has announced that it will lay off a number of employees, despite the fact that the survival MMO has been the studio's most successful launch to date.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dune-awakening-developer-funcom-announces-redundancies" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, the Oslo-based developer will let an undisclosed number of staff members go in order to "restructure [its] teams and focus [its] resources from across projects and studios".</p>

<p>Funcom says this is needed because of the move to shift&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>"from development to long-term live operation", which, to me, sounds rather like NetEase's shutting down of its Seattle studio after&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' release, although whether a proportionate number of employees will be affected is unclear.</p>

<p>To me, announcing how successful your latest game has been and then immediately revealing that you're laying off a tranche of employees comes across as rather unforgivably gauche, but perhaps I just don't have a corporation's perspective on things.</p>

<p>Of course, Funcom is right to say&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>has been a big success. The game, which launched on PC back in June, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-sales-1m-infographic" rel="nofollow">managed to hit a million sales</a> within just two weeks of its launch. It's also due to land on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S at some point next year.</p>

<p>Still, Funcom is far from the only studio to lay off employees following a purple patch. Microsoft laid off thousands of employees earlier this year, many of them within the gaming sector, but Xbox's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-revenue-up-microsoft-2025" rel="nofollow">revenue actually increased</a> last fiscal year.</p>




<p>It's becoming a very common refrain, but it seems that making and releasing a successful game is no longer enough to guarantee the retention of your job in the gaming industry. Stay tuned to find out which successful studio inevitably becomes the next one to lay off employees regardless.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/they-finally-did-it-fallout-76-is-pretty-good-now-1845315294"><em>Fallout 76</em></a> is going to Ohio, and waiting for players in the new region is none other than the Ghoul from the popular <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-tv-show-amazon-prime-audience-ratings-1851445138"><em>Fallout</em> TV show on Amazon</a>. This new expansion, which the devs claim is the biggest map expansion they’ve done yet, is out later this year and also adds bounty hunting, new characters, fresh mutated creatures to kill, and more.</p> <p>On October 1, <a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7uCbEFtoNrbecM1hMWtY3u/fallout-76-burning-springs-first-look">Bethesda announced <em>Fallout 76′</em>s next big update,</a> Burning Springs. This new update is set to arrive in early December for all platforms and adds a brand new region to the game’s map. The region is named Burning Springs, hence the name of the update. This area is set in Ohio, a location that we’ve not seen much of in past <em>Fallout</em> media, giving the devs a bit of a blank slate to do whatever they want.&nbsp; And according to the people making it, Burning Springs is directly inspired by <em>Fallout 3 </em>and <em>Fallout: New Vegas.</em></p>

 <p>Here’s a big update video from Bethesda going into more detail about the new region, what players can expect to find there, and more:</p>   <p>“The new region is terrifyingly beautiful and will feel very familiar to fans, drawing its main influences from&nbsp;<em>Fallout 3 </em>and&nbsp;<em>New Vegas</em>,” <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fallout/fallout-76s-burning-springs-draws-its-main-influences-from-fallout-3-and-fallout-new-vegas-as-players-venture-to-a-whole-new-state-ohio/">creative director Jon Rush told <em>PC Gamer</em></a>. “We wanted it to remind folks of what they came to know and love in <em>Fallout 3 </em>and <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em>. And so when we set out to make this new region, the three pillars that we gave to the team were, ‘It’s got to have desert, death claws and Raiders,’ and to me, that captures the tone, the essence, and the danger of those games.”</p>

 <p>While it’s neat that the new area is inspired by past <em>Fallout</em> games, the big news with Burning Springs is that it will directly connect to <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-show-amazon-review-1851400505">Amazon’s live-action <em>Fallout</em> TV show</a>. As mentioned, the Ghoul from the show will be an NPC that people can talk to in <em>Fallout 76′</em>s new region. Located in Highway Town, he will hand out various repeatable bounties to players and is even voiced by Walton Goggins himself. Another example of the show and game syncing up: The free update is launching at around the <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-trailer-teaser-deathclaw-new-vegas-gamescom-2000618496">same time season two of the show is set to premiere on Amazon Prime Video</a>. And that’s not an accident.</p>

 <figure><figcaption>© Bethesda</figcaption></figure> <p>“Burning Springs is in total tonal tandem with <em>Fallout</em> season two, “Rush told <em>PC Gamer</em>. “It is poised to be our biggest update ever, and will coincide with the timing of the premiere of the Amazon <em>Fallout</em> series season two that’s coming this December.”</p>

 <p>The new location in <em>Fallout 76</em> will be added to the Western edge of the current map in a similar way to how the last world expansion, <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/fallout-76-skyline-valley">Skyline Valley</a>, was added in 2024 to the bottom of the map. To access this new area, players will travel across the Point Pleasant Bridge, leaving Appalachia and entering Ohio.</p> <p>Console players will have to wait until December to make that journey to Ohio to meet the Ghoul. But PC players willing to check out the update before launch will be able to start visiting the new region as early as tomorrow, October 2, via <em>Fallout 76</em>‘s testing server. Bethesda also says full patch notes for the big update will arrive at that time, too.</p>
