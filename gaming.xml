            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon is shaking things up this Labor Day weekend, going after all the big names – and Bose is no exception. If you’ve been thinking about upgrading your audio setup, now’s a great moment to jump in: The Bose TV Speaker, which <strong>works as both a soundbar for your TV and a simple living room speaker</strong><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3727/">, is down to just $163 on Amazon (41% off)</a>. Considering that it normally retails for $279, that is a huge discount.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3727/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Our Favorite Speaker</h2>
<p>The speaker is designed to<strong> improve the audio from your TV without the bulk of standard soundbars</strong>. It’s simple to hook up with HDMI-ARC, so installation is fast and hassle-free. The HDMI-ARC (Audio Return Channel) permits the soundbar to both transmit and receive audio via the same cable as video, less cord clutter and neater installation. <strong>And it has Bluetooth</strong>, so listening to music or podcasts from your phone or tablet is ridiculously easy and wireless.</p>
<p>Another of the first things you’ll notice about this soundbar is just how evenly balanced and clean-sounding its sound is. Bose engineered it to maximize conversation clarity which is a big plus if you catch yourself from time to time having trouble hearing every word or being drowned out by other sounds when you watch TV. The speaker’s voice-centric design is made to prioritize voices without comprising the depth of your go-to TV movies or shows.</p>
<p>The speaker uses proprietary drivers and proprietary digital signal processing to deliver clear sound that fills the room beyond your TV’s built-in speakers. Bass is unexpectedly strong for something this compact, providing kick to action flicks and music rhythms without distortion, making it a more immersive experience. You feel the actual sense you’re bringing your entertainment to the next level without complicated setups or humongous speakers.</p>



<p>Compact and slim, the Bose speaker just sits on a shelf or TV stand without wasting space or being in the way of your room’s decor. Its black veneer adds a touch of modern sophistication. It can also sit flat on your TV or be mounted on the wall using the included mounting bracket with some adjustability to fit your living room.</p>
<p>The <strong>attached remote control</strong> is another thoughtful touch: It allows you to easily control your sound level, bass, and whatnot, without having to search through a bunch of devices just to get your sound in balance.</p>
<p><span>This is a great opportunity to treat your home audio to an affordable boost this Labor Day weekend.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Borderlands 4 Post-Launch Roadmap Reveals The Return Of Something Fans Loved From Borderlands 2]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pearls-roadmap-takedown-dlc-free-update-2000621708</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4-post-launch-roadmap-reveals-the-return-of-something-fans-loved-from-borderlands-2.1284876/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Just a couple weeks before launch, <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-price-tag-70-drama-pitchford-80-real-fan-1851784583"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> has announced its post-launch roadmap for free updates and paid DLC throughout the next six months and it’s a lot. But one of the smaller details fans were surprised to see is the return of Pearlescent weapons and shields from <em>Borderlands 2</em>.</p> <p>The <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/post-launch-roadmap/?linkId=856235028">rundown of <em>Borderlands 4</em>‘s end-game</a> arrived alongside a developer panel at PAX West walking fans through how the XP-based loot grind will work this time around. The game’s first paid bounty pack arrives in the fall with new missions, a new boss fight, and a slew of Legendary gear and fresh cosmetics. There will also be Vault Cards that let players grind to unlock extra rewards, including gear that can keep being re-rolled until players find the version that fits their build.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000621710" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000621710"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000621710">Gearbox Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p>But the big update is <em>Borderlands 4</em>‘s first paid Story Pack coming in early 2026. It’ll feature a new Vault Hunter, a mini-story campaign, new area to explore, and another trove of collectibles. It’s a cosmic-horror-themed expansion based around Mad Ellie, a Pandoran mechanic who happens to be Moxxi’s daughter. Some other past characters will be returning as well, with a second Story Pack following later in the year.</p>

 <h2><em>Borderlands 2</em>‘s Pearlescent drops are back</h2> <p>There are plenty of free updates sprinkled in between each DLC, but the biggest will arrive alongside Bounty Pack 2 in early 2026. It adds the Pearlescent rarity to the game, something fans have been begging to be brought back from<em> Borderlands 2</em> after it was dropped for <em>Borderlands 3</em>.</p> <p>These drops are essentially like ultra-rare drops with unique gimmicks. When they arrived in <em>Borderlands 2</em> they didn’t make or break builds. There were more like Shinies from <em>Pokémon</em> than <em>Diablo’</em>s Uniques, sought after as prizes rather than the deadliest tools in the game. <em>Borderlands 4</em> might change that this time around, however. “Pearlescent gear drops will be incredibly difficult to find, but their power level will match their coveted rarity,” writes Gearbox.</p>

 <h2>Where are <em>Borderlands 3</em>‘s Takedowns?</h2> <p>A returning feature the studio hasn’t mentioned yet are Takedowns. <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-3s-next-big-expansion-will-be-a-western-1843586642">These free updates for <em>Borderlands 3</em></a> were raid-boss-adjacent endgame modes that were designed to push squads of players to the breaking point with their difficulty. Gearbox hasn’t mentioned them by name yet, thought it has mentioned Invincible Bosses coming in a future free update for <em>Borderlands 4</em>.</p> <p>“Think of them as bosses on steroids: new unique mechanics, massive health pools (not literally invincible, but close to it), extremely lethal attack damage, and other new modifiers that can make quick work of any unprepared Vault Hunters,” the new announcement reads. The first of these will drop before the end of 2025. Weekly big encore boss fights, wildcard missions, and Maurice’s Black Market Machine are all coming after launch as well.</p> <p>If <em>Borderlands 4</em>‘s base campaign can deliver a better story than <em>Borderlands 3</em> and make good on the <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-split-screen-coop-switch-2-amon-skill-tree-2000618064">promised variety, variability, and build-crafting depth</a> of the new Vault Hunters, the post-launch roadmap definitely looks like it will be showering players with all of the content they’ll want in the endgame. Those are two big ifs. But with <em>Destiny 2</em> currently spiraling and <em>Diablo 4</em> still awaiting its next big expansion, I’m as primed for some fresh, smooth-brained loot chasing as I’ll ever be.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Escape from Tarkov Steam Release Teased by Battlestate Games]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-steam-release-teased-battlestate/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov-steam-release-teased-by-battlestate-games.1284873/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlestate Games, the developer behind the legendary extraction shooter, Escape from Tarkov, has teased the game being released on Steam at some point. The thinly-veiled nod came from Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games, as well as the official BSG social channels earlier today.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov: Arena came to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-arena-epic-games-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the Epic Games Store</a> earlier this year, but Escape from Tarkov has never been accessible anywhere other than directly from Battlestate Games and through a proprietary launcher.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-tarkov-coming-to-steam-soon">Is Tarkov Coming to Steam Soon?</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, Nikita Buyanov, arguably the face of Escape from Tarkov, posted a cryptic GIF of a man jetting ‘steam’ from an iron. This was followed up by the Battlestate Games team publishing a simple post featuring a single emoji – <strong>a steam cloud</strong>.</p>











<p>One social user noted that the above GIF appears in the top five listed when you search for ‘Steam’.</p>



<p>It’s entirely open to interpretation and conjecture, but it’s almost certainly not anything other than a Steam release. In November, Escape from Tarkov <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-tarkov-1-0-being-released/">will graduate to a 1.0 state</a> after being in a beta state since 2017. It’s the ultimate step for Escape from Tarkov, and it’s one that Battlestate Games has spent a decade preparing for.</p>



<p>It makes complete sense for Escape from Tarkov to diversify its reach and deploy on other launchers and storefronts moving forward, especially as it’s finally being released as a ‘full game’.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that this is completely unconfirmed at present, and I’ve reached out to Battlestate Games to try and get a little clarification on what the posts might mean. Stay tuned!</p>



<p>Would you like to see Escape from Tarkov on Steam? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>Just months after revealing there'd be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-promises-no-more-updates-until-haunted-chocolatier-releases">no more Stardew Valley updates until Haunted Chocolatier released</a>, creator Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone has confirmed that another update is coming to the fan-favourite farming sim.</p>
<p>Addressing fans at the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-symphony-of-seasons-concert-tour-announced-coming-to-the-uk-in-2026">Stardew Valley Symphony of Seasons concert</a> in Seattle, Barone himself took to the stage and revealed a "secret" to the excited attendees.</p>

<p>As posted to TikTok by <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jillbobagginz/video/7544281610573630734">jillbobagginz</a> (thanks, <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/news/stardew-valley-creator-confirms-another-update-is-coming-symphony-of-seasons-concert/">FRVR</a>), Barone said: "After that [last 1.6] update, I was thinking, 'I don't know if I’m going to make another update'. But I wanted to share something with you tonight, it's kind of a secret… there's going to be another update."</p><p>We don't know any details yet, of course, let alone timescales, but it's great news to Stardew fans nonetheless, given Barone revealed in April that Stardew "pulls [him] away from devoting all [his] time to Haunted Chocolatier," the follow-up game he's also currently working on. Quite how this new update will impact the development of Haunted Chocolatier – if at all – remains to be seen, though.</p>
<p>Pixelated farming sim Stardew Valley first debuted almost a decade ago, and has since gone from strength to strength. Last year, Barone released Stardew Valley's bumper 1.6 update, which essentially boosted the game to an almost 2.0 status, introducing a vast number of features to the base game such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valleys-16-update-is-finally-here-with-some-impressively-lengthy-patch-notes">new NPC dialogues, home renovations, and turtle pets</a>.</p>
<p>As of December last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-continues-its-wholesome-farming-dominance-with-latest-sales-milestone">Stardew Valley had sold in excess of 41m copies across platforms</a>. Of those 41m, over half are on PC, with 26m copies sold. Meanwhile, the Nintendo Switch accounts for 7.9m Stardew Valley sales and though there's been a handful of crossovers with other games during that time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/creator-of-stardew-valley-doesnt-charge-for-collabs-with-other-games-does-it-to-please-players">Barone recently revealed he's never made any money directly from in-game collaborations</a>.</p>

              <p><em>Mortal Kombat 2</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/mortal-kombat-2-karl-urban-johnny-cage-first-trailer-1851786495">was set to hit theaters</a> on October 24, just a week before Halloween. It seemed like good timing for a hyper-violent video game classic about warriors fighting horrors from other dimensions. Apparently Warner Bros. disagreed. The studio has now delayed the sequel by nearly seven months because it thinks the corny fist-fest can make more money in the spring.</p> <p>That’s according <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/08/mortal-kombat-ii-opening-date-1236501771/">to <em>Deadline</em></a>, which reported the news late on Friday before the Labor Day holiday weekend. It claims “research screenings have been strong” and that Warner Bros. didn’t want to bury its latest video game adaptation in a “crowded late October frame” between<em> Springsteen Deliver Me From Nowhere</em> and <em>Regretting You</em>.</p> <p>So instead, <em>Mortal Kombat 2</em> will now come out on May 15, 2026.<em> Avengers: Doomsday</em> was originally set to open that month but was pushed back to December of next year. The only real competition will be <i>The Mandalorian and Grogu</i>, which arrives at the end of next May. So even if <em>Mortal Kombat 2</em> ends up having a surprisingly long tail, it’ll probably get kicked out of most theaters by<em> Star Wars</em>.</p> <p>The sequel brings in<em> The Boys</em>‘ Karl Urban as the shade-wearing, split-kicking Johnny Cage and its July trailer looked decent. If it has the budget to double-down on some of the big spectacle fight sequences the 2021 reboot was missing, it could be fun, though I still think its cheesy gore-fest sensibility was a great fit for Halloween. I don’t usually like slasher movies but I’ll make an exception if Scorpion’s the one doing the impaling.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Gameplay footage of Battlefield 6’s Operation Firestorm map has leaked online from the game’s recent playtests.</p>



<p>Battlefield began its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-labs-testing-is-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Labs playtests again this week</a>, following its hugely successful <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-record-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 Beta</a>. As expected, the leaks are coming thick and fast. The most recent leak is of Operation Firestorm, a map that was first featured in Battlefield 3.</p>



<p>You can watch some of the gameplay footage below:</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Operation Firestorm is currently the only named remade map to be featured in Battlefield 6, but other maps, including the highly popular Operation Metro, are most certainly going to make a return during the game’s life cycle.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-sign-up-for-battlefield-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RELATED – How To Sign Up For Battlefield Labs and Test Battlefield 6<br></a></strong><br>Operation Firestorm was first featured for Battlefield 6 during the game’s reveal trailer, which showcased what the map was popular for – aerial combat.</p>



<p>Other leaks from the Battlefield Labs playtests are also coming in thick and fast, including the addition of the server browser in Battlefield Portal. As of the time of writing, the developers have only committed to bringing the server browser to Portal and will leave standard multiplayer for standard matchmaking. </p>



<p>Developers behind Battlefield 6 – DICE, Motive, Criterion, and Ripple Effect have said that Battlefield 6 was the most successful Battlefield Beta to date. The stats include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Total Matches Played: 420,127,450</li>



<li>Hours of Gameplay: 92,351,578</li>



<li>Enemies Killed: 4,928,771,770</li>



<li>Friendlies Revived: 30,936,675</li>



<li>Final Destruction Receipt: $196,760,386,367</li>
</ul>



<p>Are you looking forward to playing on Operation Firestorm in Battlefield 6? The game releases on October 10, 2025, on the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC.</p>

And after years of fermenting hype, the most wishlisted game on Steam now has to deliver something bigger than the all-consuming cultural distortion field surrounding it. No small task. I’ve now played 15 minutes of the final demo and I still could not tell you which way it’s going to go. That’s because everything that can make a Metroidvania Soulslike like <em>Silksong</em> truly pop is precisely what Team Cherry is keeping most under wraps.</p> <p>I played the Gamescom 2025 build of <em>Silksong</em> on the Xbox Ally PC gaming handheld during a PAX West-adjacent event at Microsoft and it felt like eating a Dunkin Donuts Munchkin: easy, sweet, and over way too soon. That’s by design. Team Cherry <a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-interview-delay-hollow-knight-team-cherry-2000619168">said in a recent interview</a> that the game took seven years to make because of all of the new areas, characters, and secrets it wanted to pack into the <em>Hollow Knight</em> sequel. And it also clearly didn’t want to ruin any of those things by actually talking about them before the game’s September 4 release date on PC and console, or by showing them off ahead of time in the demo.</p> <p>The only portion of<em> Silksong</em> that anyone has played so far takes place near the beginning of the game. Hornet, the new protagonist, awakes in an underground glen full of bright moss and easy enemies. A short platforming section introduces players to the familiar <em>Bloodborne</em>-inspired combat (you need to deal damage to get health back) and the game’s exploration which has you exhausting dead-ends until you find the path forward. It wraps with a simple mini-boss fight that’s intent on scaring any newcomers away.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000621699" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000621699"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000621699">Team Cherry</figcaption></figure> <p>The second section takes you to smoldering caverns with more deadly enemies to navigate. Ensembles of flying, fire-ball-spitting wizards and knights with big shields make you work to survive and gesture toward the ambient, elevated threat level that fills each path you choose to go down with just the right amount of tension.</p> <p>This is all classic <em>Hollow Knight</em> so far. The only thing that really sets<em> Silksong</em> apart in the demo is Hornet. The character’s a bit faster, has a down diagonal attack to speed up aerial recoveries, and can heal more quickly but only after more energy is gathered from dealing damage. It’s a different, more aggressive flow than the original game’s, and could take on an even more distinct identity once players start unlocking their full arsenals.</p>

 <h2>Will <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> really cost $20?</h2> <p>All of which is to say that while there were certainly no red flags in my brief hands-on time with <em>Silksong</em>, it’s impossible to know from the 15-minute demo whether <em>Silksong</em> can deliver on what fans have been hoping for over the last eight years. It’s slick and prettier than the original, but what will ultimately matter is the cleverness of its secrets, exploration, and later-game boss fights. One other bit of potential good news ahead of the game’s launch next week is that it might not be very expensive either.</p> <p><em>Hollow Knight</em> launched for just $15 back in 2017. You can currently buy it on PC for just half that price leading up to the sequel’s release (act now and you&nbsp;<em>might</em> be able to beat it in time). <a href="https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/nintendo-switch/products/hollow-knight-silksong---nintendo-switch/432032.html">A leak yesterday</a> on the GameStop website suggested <em>Silksong</em> will be $20, only $5 more than its predecessor at a time when Team Cherry easily could have charged $30 or more. The store listing has since been taken down and might have just been a speculative placeholder.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/hollow-knight-silksong-on-vous-devoile-le-prix-de-sa-version-pc-60443">According to <em>Dealabs</em>‘</a> own leak, the $20 price for <em>Silksong</em> on PC is accurate. No physical editions of the game have been confirmed yet, however.</p> <p>All eyes will be on Steam for when the actual price drops. So far Team Cherry hasn’t actually confirmed how much it will cost. Like almost everything else about the game, the small indie team is keeping that close to the vest. Not that it will matter. Just like the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lwwfrbrtwc2x">lack of reviews ahead of launch</a>, <em>Silksong</em> doesn’t have to play by conventional rules. It’s in a league of its own. In less than a week we’ll finally know if it truly belongs there.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve played more than a few role-playing games, you’ll know how your hero's journey typically plays out. In the prologue, a terrible thing will happen – an event that demands you move quickly to prevent an apocalypse or defeat an all-encompassing evil. In the following hours, you’ll spend 90% of your time completely ignoring that impending threat, instead helping randomers you met in the pub and collecting loot from dungeons. That’s okay, though, because the big bad will always wait for you. The world perpetually teeters on the brink of extinction until you’re ready to fix it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not so in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-blood-of-dawnwalker">The Blood of Dawnwalker</a>, the first RPG from Rebel Wolves, a new studio founded by former CD Projekt Red staff. Its campaign puts you on a clock: you have 30 days and 30 nights to save your family from evil vampires. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That hold-on-while-I-do-a-thousand-side-quests meme “was definitely one of the reasons” for this interesting approach, creative director Mateusz Tomaszkiewicz says with a smile. “I wouldn't say it was the sole reason, but I would say this was definitely a starting point for a conversation.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To properly understand that time pressure system, it’s best to start with how The Blood of Dawnwalker’s campaign is structured. Dubbed a “narrative sandbox,” it doesn’t follow a linear sequence of events. There’s no quest one, quest two, quest three and so on.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“After the prologue, you can go directly to the castle. You could try to rescue your family immediately,” explains Tomaszkiewicz. “There's a variety of quests you can participate in. You can ignore them, or you can do them. There are a lot of activities that are directly targeted against [main villain] Brencis that will weaken him, for example, and make the attack easier. But at any point you can decide, ‘Okay, I've got enough, I'm going to the castle, I'm going to do it.’” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If The Blood of Dawnwalker was a book, then, you’d read the first chapter and then would be free to skip directly to the end. As for the optional chapters between those two points, you can read them in any order… but you’ll need to find the pages first. “You are not railroaded into these plotlines,” Tomaszkiewicz reveals. “You have to find them [in the world] on your own. We do leave breadcrumbs of course, but we want to make sure that it doesn't feel like ‘These are the three plotlines, do them and then go there,’ right? We wanted to enhance the feeling of exploration and finding these stories in the world.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That brings us back to the time system. You have 30 days and 30 nights to explore Vale Sangora, a 14th-century kingdom nestled in the Carpathian Mountains, and undertake as many (or as few) of those plotlines as you want. That time element evolved out of Dawnwalker’s protagonist, Coen. A man suffering from both silver poisoning <em>and</em> a vampiric curse, he lives as a mortal during the day and becomes a blood-sucker at night. “The time passage was kind of central to the character,” Tomaszkiewicz notes, especially since your vampiric abilities allow for a very different, more supernatural playstyle after dark. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Blood of Dawnwalker - Gamescom 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">A Clock That Never Ticks</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the most important thing to know is that there is no real-time ticking clock in The Blood of Dawnwalker. The minutes do not start counting down from the moment you start a new game. This is not Majora’s Mask or Outer Wilds. “We were thinking that if time would flow naturally, it might be quite unpleasant. The playstyle would change on the go [from human to vampire and back to human] constantly without your input,” explains Tomaszkiewicz. “So that's where the time as a resource idea came in.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s best to think of time in The Blood of Dawnwalker as a currency rather than a stopwatch. A bar, split into eight sections and displayed in the upper-right of the screen, represents your daily allowance of that currency. Performing significant actions marked with an hourglass icon, such as completing objectives or engaging in certain conversations, will “spend” a section of the bar. Similar to Deathloop, then, simply exploring or completing lower-level tasks will not progress time. Theoretically, you could stay in the noon period of the seventh day for dozens of in-game hours, provided you don’t do anything marked with that hourglass symbol.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Rebel Wolves is very excited about the way time has shaped The Blood of Dawnwalker’s choices and quest design (of which you can learn more about in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-offers-2-very-different-rpg-playstyles">our recent preview</a>), Tomaszkiewicz is aware that many people will be skeptical of the system. “I know there are a lot of players that are afraid of missing out, so we definitely tried to not cut off too much content,” he explains. “We are aiming, at least in a normal, average playthrough, for you to be able to do 80% of the content.” </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You may have a time limit to save your family, but there is no time limit to complete the game.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Rebel Wolves has twisted temporal rules to deliver on that goal, particularly when it comes to how time-sensitive events are handled. For example, one storyline involves a burning house, but the flames will blaze indefinitely until you actually discover the building. Only then will you need to act before you spend too many sections of the time bar. There’s no chance of you turning up one day to find a house you never knew even existed is now a pile of rubble and ash. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, regardless of how quests and time are handled, there’s always that looming pressure: 30 days and 30 nights to save your family. But there’s unwritten nuance in that deadline. “Don't think about it as a game over thing,” Tomaszkiewicz hints. “It's more like a choice and consequence thing.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s the vital takeaway: you may have a time limit to save your family, but there is <em>no time limit to complete the game. </em>You can continue to play indefinitely after that point. And who is to say that saving your family will even be the most important part of your story? The Blood of Dawnwalker’s Steam page states: “Embark on the quest to save your family, or swear revenge on your sire and destroy everyone standing in your way.” Perhaps that tale of revenge will provide an alternate journey for the main campaign? I ask Tomaszkiewicz to elaborate, but he refuses. That Steam description is already more than enough, he says. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Control Your Dark Urge</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s easy to see time, even when it only moves during specific actions, like sand slipping through your fingers. As something you lose. But it’s important to remember that progressing time brings you closer to one of The Blood of Dawnwalker’s most exciting features: Coen becomes a vampire at night. When the moon rises, you unlock the ability to walk up walls and along ceilings, and to teleport to rooftops and out-of-reach balconies. Such skills unlock a variety of opportunities, not to mention a stealthier play style. And so, if you want, you can skip the days and play only during the night. It’s a “totally viable way to play,” Tomaszkiewicz confirms, albeit with a warning that ignoring the day also means missing quests only available during the waking hours.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A vampire’s supernatural strength and skills come at a price, though, and it’s one we all know: gulping down vast quantities of blood. You’ll need to satisfy Coen’s hunger regularly, and the only truly gratifying meal is found in the neck of a human. You can opt to ignore that hunger, or feast on much less-satiating animals, but there are consequences to such a lifestyle. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If you starve Coen, if you don't feed him enough, and if you go into important conversations, he can lose control and just kill off important NPCs,” Tomaszkiewicz reveals. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rebel Wolves isn’t unique in creating a game in which you can kill significant characters, but it’s doing so in its own way. You can’t just stride up to someone and cut them down with your sword, for instance – it’s always to do with your vampiric urges. But you do have a choice. “You can decide to give into your vampiric nature whenever it comes knocking,” Tomaszkiewicz explains, describing it as “the whispers of your dark nature.” But that’s only possible if Coen is merely hungry. If you <em>starve </em>him, then every conversation is a roll of the dice. The hunger could seize control, and you’ll have no option but to watch him chow down. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If you starve Coen, he can lose control and just kill off important NPCs.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This system is possible thanks to that aforementioned “narrative sandbox” campaign structure. “In a game that has more of a strict core narrative, you couldn't kill off a character that is pivotal to the story, right? Because the story would fall apart,” notes Tomaszkiewicz. Since all quests in The Blood of Dawnwalker (aside from the first and last) are essentially optional, it means anyone can be killed without derailing the story. Instead, those deaths <em>become</em> the story. You can punish characters you hate, or be caught off-guard by surprise slaughter.     </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This bloodlust is part of a wider set of overlapping systems designed to make the kingdom of Vale Sangora feel alive. NPCs have routines, and they’ll raise the alarm if they see you stealing or feeding on their neighbours. Rival factions will brawl each other in the streets. And the evil Brencis watches you from afar. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As you gain more notoriety in the valley, as you do these acts against Brencis, he won’t stay passive,” Tomaszkiewicz reveals. “He will enact these edicts that will hamper your progression. So he might send out more soldiers into the streets, or patrolling the roads, or enforce a curfew. So now it's more difficult to feed at night.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Notoriety initially sounds like GTA’s wanted level, or the escalating response of Metal Gear Solid’s guards. But it’s actually more complex than a simple difficulty spike. “Sometimes it can actually be a boon,” Tomaszkiewicz explains. “It's not just Brencis and his soldiers [who react to your notoriety,] it's also the people in the valley. They will recognize you and be afraid of you. So in some quest situations it actually might be helpful. There are some factions that fight against Brencis, they don't like him. So building up notoriety is actually a good way to gain a good standing with them.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">The End and Beyond</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The narrative sandbox approach means Rebel Wolves has had to pay close attention to how the story ends. The ability to skip over every major quest, or kill off significant characters, means every player will hit the finale with different levels of knowledge. Some may not even know what a Dawnwalker is, while others will have found solutions to all the major problems. And so when I ask how many endings the story has, Tomaszkiewicz doesn’t have an easy answer. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This is a very complicated web of connections,” he says. “I can tell you the designer working on the endings is… let's say <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pepe-silvia" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the meme of [It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia’s Charlie Day] with the red tape</a>. That's him basically. It is a lot of fun, but it's a lot to keep track of.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not the only thing the story team needs to consider, either. The Steam page claims that this project is “the beginning of a brand-new saga built with love for the role-playing genre,” and so The Blood of Dawnwalker is just chapter one. The Rebel Wolves team may be building a game, but they are also building an entire universe that they plan to explore in subsequent games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have ideas for the overarching story of Coen,” reveals Tomaszkiewicz. He says sequels are, of course, not guaranteed, but the team has ideas of where to go should this first game be a success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There is much more in the IP than just vampires, let's say,” he teases. “There is this whole hidden world that we are not exploring on purpose in this first game. We want to leave a lot of fuel for the sequels and so on. But we do leave breadcrumbs and hint at these things. So yeah, we have a general idea of where we want to take Coen.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Such sequels and grander saga ambitions are beyond Rebel Wolves’ grasp for now, just as The Blood of Dawnwalker is beyond our own – at this year’s Gamescom, we were only able to watch a demonstration rather than go hands-on ourselves. And as exciting and promising as that demo was, it’ll take first-hand experience of the narrative sandbox to truly tell if the studio’s bold approach to RPG design has paid off. But just as Coen thirsts for the blood of mortals, I hunger to taste more of this fascinating, risk-taking Slavic fantasy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Executive Editor of Features. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-interview-killing-time-and-major-npcs-in-ex-cdpr-devs-new-rpg]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Drag X Drive Miis" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ca5f41e28f0e2/drag-x-drive-miis.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>August is nearly over, and we've had two first-party releases this month: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Long Title Nintendo Employees Are Obliged to Say in its Entirety</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a>.</p>
<p>The Kirby revamp just came out (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">and it's very good</a>) while Drag and Drive (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-we-need-to-talk-about-x-games">yes, this one's definitely an 'and'</a>) hit the courts back on 14th August. Are you still playing it? I'm willing to bet <em>dozens</em> of you are.</p>
<p>Ah, what a shame. For a game that demonstrates some genuine originality, it just throws up too many roadblocks for the average player, whether it's the novel but uncompromising Mouse Mode controls, the dreary presentation, or the restrictive online team options. It makes for an intriguing pitch — and it really is a blast in <em>exactly</em> the right circumstances — but will anyone be playing this come Christmas? Is anyone playing it now?</p>
<figure><a title="Joy-Con 2 Mouse Mode" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2d7a0d5a6202e/joy-con-2-mouse-mode.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I found myself wishing I could just control the thing with standard stick and button inputs. I know that would circumvent the game's USP and introduce a skill gap, as people using buttons would quickly and easily (I imagine) outperform players sticking to motion controls, so you'd need to split the playerbase via control scheme.</p>
<p>And for a game that's designed to show you the real gameplay possibilities of Mouse Mode beyond the obvious (and beyond the minigames in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Welcome Tour</a>), optional button inputs would be tantamount to admitting defeat. "Yeah, this is <em>our</em> Mouse Mode showcase! But you don't <em>have to</em> use them.<sub>..and it's easier and better if you don't.</sub>"</p>
<p>I reckon Nintendo could frame it as an accessibility win without losing too much face. Ironically, players with any sort of movement impairment in their upper body will likely struggle the most playing Drag x Drive. And given the game's muted debut, alternative control schemes would likely draw in a far larger player base. It's not too late if Nintendo just swallowed its pride.</p>

<p>It's an odd one, because I admire the boldness of the idea and the mechanical execution. Only Nintendo would do something like this, but it's looking like a one-and-done affair for all but the most devoted players with the optimal setups (3v3 over LAN at the Nintendo Switch 2 Experience).</p>
<p>I had a great time with it back in April, and really hoped that would translate to the game proper, which I assumed would have more meat on the bone beyond the demo I played. Bolstered by Nate Bihldorff's comments in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/we-really-want-to-future-proof-the-nintendo-switch-2-interview">our interview</a> that, "in typical Nintendo fashion, there's more game beyond that," I assumed we'd seen only a small slice of the pie.</p>
<p>But no. Beyond the minigames, it's pretty much exactly what I played in April ad infinitum. Can you imagine what a difference a simple change of scenery would make? An outside court by the beach or up a mountain wouldn't fundamentally change anything, but would <em>drastically</em> improve the pervading presentational drabness. Perhaps Nintendo didn't want to distract from the novel mechanics with any trademark colour, but jeez. After half an hour you're jonesing for something beyond Burnished Black, Weathered Chrome, Medium Grey, Metallic Grey, Dark Grey, Dark Sea Grey, Neutral Grey, Grey Grey...</p>

<p>Or how about an injection of personality with some characters? Nintendo's got a few of those, right? <em>Something</em>. I thought <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nintendo_switch_sports">Switch Sports</a> was bland, but Drag x Drive is crying out for some <em>verve</em> and charisma beyond the mechanical thrills.</p>
<p>Perhaps there's a sensitivity and reluctance on Nintendo's part to sitting Mario and co. in wheelchairs, and I understand that a whole other, valid conversation around representation would come from just slotting in Mushroom Kingdom characters that demonstrably, famously, have zero mobility issues. But featureless robots with customisation that extends to a splash of colour and some cat ears? They won't cause offence, sure, but they aren't a satisfactory solution. You can't even make them look like Daft Punk.</p>
<p>Just adding Miis would give the game 1000% more personality. You still wouldn't want to be stuck with it at a party, but right now it feels like a brick wall in the presentation department - a complete turn-off. That is, if the controls didn't make you <a href="https://c.tenor.com/yTxA7WgkBEUAAAAd/tenor.gif">Abe Simpson outta there</a> beforehand.</p>

<p>Before launch, we'd worried that DxD might turn out to be Switch 2's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/arms">ARMS</a>, a game we loved and which still sold multiple millions of copies, but which didn't capture the audience it arguably deserved. Drag x Drive, though, feels like it ground to a halt almost immediately, not even able to sustain <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nintendo_labo_toy-con_04_vr_kit">Labo</a>-levels of novelty. It's got my respect, but the surprise and delight was incredibly fleeting with this one. Imagine if it had an ounce of ARMS or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon</a>'s style to go with the game.</p>
<p>Is there a way Nintendo could pivot and pull it back? Could Miis or regular button inputs change things for you? Would you be upset if they added DxD as a free-to-play perk for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers? Let us know in the polls and comments.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mortal-kombat-2">Mortal Kombat 2</a> movie was set to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-2-film-ties-down-release-date-but-its-not-out-until-next-year">hit cinemas on October 24th</a>, but it has now been delayed by several months to May 15th, 2026.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/08/mortal-kombat-ii-opening-date-1236501771/">Deadline</a>, test screenings have been "strong", but a busy October schedule is likely behind the decision to push back the release date to a more favourable mid-year position.</p>

		<p>Regardless of what the weather does – and it’s been much windier and wetter the last few days – it’s the last few days of summer this weekend for families with children who have needed entertaining for past month and a half. It’s also the tipping point into a September that, as usual, is stuffed with some huge game releases!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/discounty-adds-some-bite-to-cozy-life-sims.1284729/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>There’s a pleasing rhythm to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23878638/japanese-rural-life-adventure-apple-arcade-iphone-game">cozy life sims</a>. The virtual days pass, filled with chores of tending crops or running a business, punctuated by strange mysteries or evolving relationships. At their best, these games merge busywork with exploration and storytelling, in a way that makes them hard to step away from. <em>Discounty</em>, from developer Crinkle Cut Games, applies this idea to running a small-town supermarket. And while in many ways it can still be considered “cozy” like its contemporaries, it also comes with a bit of bite.</p><p>Instead of starting up your own business from scratch, <em>Discounty</em> has you taking over a grocery franchise from your cranky aunt in a small town that has seen better days. It’s a strange place; the most famous resident is the inventor of the keyring, and parts of the surrounding woods have been closed off for safety reasons. But it’s still friendly and comforting in the way small towns are, with a handful of residents who you’re really able to get to know over the course of the game. There’s also plenty of drama.</p><p>Actually running the store is your main job. From open to close, you are the only employee, so you have to deal with everything from managing the cash register — which involves, gasp, doing math — and keeping the shelves stocked so no one complains there’s no coffee or shampoo. But you also handle all the behind-the-scenes work: ordering new products, organizing the storage area, throwing out the trash, even negotiating with local vendors for fresh fish and produce. This part of the game is satisfying because it requires you to focus on what’s immediately in front of you (a bunch of picky customers) while also planning and strategizing for the future.</p><p>As you progress, your shop will expand both in terms of what you can sell and its physical size, which in turn makes the core gameplay loop more complex and challenging. In order to move things forward, though, you’ll have to get involved with the townsfolk. Working with local vendors usually means doing them some kind of favor, whether it’s finding some lost sheep or stocking gross Christmas-themed fish sticks. This can pull you down all kinds of narrative rabbit holes.</p><p>What’s most interesting about <em>Discounty</em>’s story is how it explores a number of real-world issues in its otherwise cozy and silly world. For starters, not everyone is happy about a big chain moving into town. When I finally expanded my shop’s footprint, usually a moment to celebrate in these kinds of games, everyone was mad because I did it by taking over an adjacent tea shop. The cafe had been shut down for years, but everyone still viewed it as an important part of the fabric of the community, and I was dismantling that.</p><p>Sometimes succeeding in the game isn’t actually good for the town itself. And while these threads often hide their darker edge behind humor — in order to get a construction permit, I had to help a city clerk dispose of environmental impact reports — <em>Discounty</em> is surprisingly sharp with its commentary, even if it never goes especially hard at any of its targets.</p><p>That mixture of satisfying gameplay and a story that’s both relatable and genuinely funny is what makes <em>Discounty</em> work so well. It’s not an escape to an idyllic farm or mountain getaway. It’s you doing a job that’s hard and not always pretty, while trying to make the best of things. Most of us know just what that’s like.</p><p><sub>Discounty <em>is available now on the Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.</em></sub></p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/768145/discounty-review-switch-ps5-xbox-steam#comments">0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games-review/768145/discounty-review-switch-ps5-xbox-steam]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/the-exit-8-nintendo-switch-2-edition</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mini-review-the-exit-8-nintendo-switch-2-edition-unnerving-horror-loop-is-worth-the-budget-price.1284708/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>To celebrate the newly-released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emZZexEJO8c">movie adaptation</a> of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/exit-8-nintendo-switch-2-edition">The Exit 8</a>, the Switch version has received a minor, yet welcome upgrade for the Switch 2.</p>
<p>If you're unaware of the premise, The Exit 8 takes place in a looping corridor within a Japanese metro station. Your job is to escape, but to do so, you’ll need to keep an eye on your surroundings, as each loop through the corridor may reveal some odd ‘anomalies’.</p>
<p>If there aren't any anomalies, you simply carry on, but if you spot something out of the ordinary, then you’ll have to turn back. You need to make the correct decision eight times in a row to escape, with a yellow sign indicating which ‘level’ you’re currently at. So if you get it wrong, you’ll reset right back down to zero.</p>
<p>The corridor itself is covered with white tiles, with posters on the left, a few doors on the right, and a sign up above labelled ‘Exit 8’. In each loop, you’ll spot a man walking in the opposite direction — briefcase in one hand, phone in the other. It’s important to keep note of small details like this, as potential anomalies are either blatantly obvious or exceedingly difficult to spot.</p>
<p>Some of the more subtle anomalies might be rearranged posters, a flickering light, or a door left slightly ajar. Meanwhile, the more obvious ones may be a pair of figures blocking your way, the briefcase man suddenly following you <em>very</em> closely, or what I can only assume is blood flooding the corridor. New anomalies have been added to pay homage to the movie, but unless you're intimately familiar with the original, you might not pick up on these.</p>
<p>Not knowing what's around the corner is a large part of what makes The Exit 8 so engaging, but it's also a source of frustration. There were many times I walked through the corridor utterly convinced that nothing had changed, only to find was back at level zero. So you need to take your time and be consistently observant.</p>
<p>On the Switch 2, the game’s performance has been given a nice bump, and it feels like it’s running at a stable 60fps. I wouldn’t say it’s a particularly pretty game, though, and the overall presentation is a little fuzzy in handheld mode, with text on the in-game posters looking quite blurry unless you’re standing right next to them.</p>
<p>I would've liked to see gyro aiming here too, just to make observation a little more intuitive, but the standard twin-stick setup works well enough. It’s such a simple game that every face and shoulder button does the exact same thing: sprint.</p>
<p>Overall, The Exit 8 is a cool experience that's worth trying for the low price, but not one I imagine going back to anytime soon. I wouldn’t call it scary, but there are definitely moments that made me feel uneasy. I think if the developer had really leaned into the horror and made something a bit closer to Hideo Kojima’s <strong>P.T</strong>, we could have had a modern classic here.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/the-exit-8-nintendo-switch-2-edition]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gamescom-2026-dates-location-and-ticket-sales-when-is-gamescom/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gamescom-2026-dates-location-and-ticket-sales%E2%80%94when-is-gamescom-2026-happening.1284702/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Gamescom 2025 was a phenomenal event that broke records, seeing more exhibitors and guests pop up in Cologne than ever before. Next year’s show promises to be an even more ambitious event, and in this guide, we’re breaking down the Gamescom 2026 dates, location guides, and information regarding ticket sales.</p>



<p>If you’re interested in heading to Germany to check out Gamescom 2026, look no further than this guide to learn everything you need to know.</p>







<p>It has been confirmed that Gamescom 2026 will take place between August 26 and 30, 2026. This is later than usual; later than <strong>ever before</strong>, in fact. It’ll be the first Gamescom since 2009 to be held that close to the end of August.</p>



<p>Here are the dates of previous Gamescom events:</p>



<ul>
<li>(Gamescom 2026: 26 – 30 August)</li>



<li>Gamescom 2025: 20 – 24 August</li>



<li>Gamescom 2024: 20 – 24 August</li>



<li>Gamescom 2023: 23 – 27 August</li>



<li>Gamescom 2022: 24 – 28 August</li>



<li>Gamescom 2021: 25 – 27 August</li>



<li>Gamescom 2020: 25 – 29 August</li>



<li>Gamescom 2019: 20 – 24 August</li>



<li>Gamescom 2018: 21 – 25 August</li>



<li>Gamescom 2017: 22 – 25 August</li>



<li>Gamescom 2016: 17 – 21 August</li>
</ul>



<p>This means that Gamescom 2026 will start on Wednesday and run to Sunday, which follows the same format as the 2024 Gamescom. It hasn’t been confirmed, but it’s a very safe bet that Gamescom 2026 will kick off with the <strong>Opening Night Live </strong>showcase, which draws in millions of viewers from around the world.</p>







<p>Gamescom 2026 will take place at the Koelnmesse complex in Cologne, Germany. This sprawling venue plays host to more than 2,000 conferences every year, and Gamescom is arguably the gem of the bunch. It’s a complete takeover that seizes control of a dozen conference halls and expands across the entire city in many ways.</p>



<p>Gamescom has been held at the Koelnmesse since the first iteration in 2009, which drew the attention of 245,000 visitors.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that Cologne <a href="https://www.gamescom.global/en/gamescom-worldwide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">isn’t the only location</a> for Gamescom events, as we now have Gamescom Asia and Gamescom LATAM.</p>



<p>Gamescom Asia is set to take place in Bangkok, Thailand, from October 16 – 19, 2025. Gamescom LATAM will appear in São Paulo, Brazil, from April 29 to May 3, 2026.</p>







<p>Gamescom 2026 tickets are not on sale at present and likely won’t be for quite some time. In 2025, tickets went on sale for the August showcase in April, four months before the event took place.</p>



<p>It’s safe to assume that the same structure will be followed for the 2026 show.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-is-selling-off-this-100w-usb-c-charger-block-with-3-ports-now-at-a-historic-low-price.1284693/</guid>

              <p>Carrying around multiple chargers can be such a pain – your bag ends up heavy and overflowing with cables. Wouldn’t it be nice to have just one charger that handles all your devices at once? That’s exactly where this Baseus 100W USB-C charger block comes in: Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3814/">it’s on Amazon for only $29, down from $49, which is a solid 40% off</a> – definitely a steal at this all-time low price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3814/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Three Ports</h2>
<p>This small charger is a monster with three ports: <strong>two USB-C and one USB-A</strong>. That means you can charge your phone, tablet and even laptop all at once without having to switch back and forth between several different plugs. And don’t worry about it being slow: <strong>it delivers up to 100 watts in total power</strong> which is more than enough to fast-charge something like a MacBook Pro or any other laptop while still keeping your phone and tablet topped up. It’s got this smart PPS technology that adjusts the power depending on what you’re charging so your devices don’t get too much juice and stay safe.</p>
<p>What I totally adore is the way the plug folds: When you’re all done charging, <strong>you just fold it up and it’s really tiny</strong>. It fits perfectly into your bag or even a large pocket, no bulky charger bricks weighing you down. And it’s durable, so you don’t have to worry about destroying it after a few recharges. It’s compatible with so many of the most popular devices, like the new iPhone 16, Galaxy S54, iPad, and so forth, so that you don’t have to be carrying a separate charger for every gadget.</p>



<p>Even when it’s charging three devices at a time, this charger keeps up with the speed: <strong>The USB-C ports split that 100W among themselves in a way that each device gets enough current to charge in a rush</strong>, and the USB-A port also provides fast charging so the old devices get a speed boost without being left behind.</p>
<p>Safety features are also spot on. It’s got inbuilt safeguards to <strong>protect your belongings from overheating, short circuits, or overcharging</strong>. So don’t worry about leaving your devices plugged in overnight. It’s also energy efficient, meaning less wasted power and smaller dent on your electricity bill.</p>
<p>Get it at this sale price while it lasts, and be on your way to quicker and simpler charging of all your electronics wherever you are.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Bon Voyage Charms and Bon Voyage Charms L.E. are the Gacha currency for NetEase’s new game, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/destiny-rising">Destiny: Rising</a>. In other words, these are what you need to use to unlock extra characters and other bonuses. As the game has just launched, there are lots of ways to get Bon Voyage Charms for free.</p>
<h3>How to get Bon Voyage Charms</h3>
<p>The easiest and quickest way right now is to play the PvP and PvPvE activities which are Singularity and Shifting Gates. There are daily limits on the rewards, but Singularity currently has a load of special first-time completion rewards that can be won to earn Bon Voyage Charms. You will also need to spend some Pinnacle Energy to play Singularity, that currency has a max of 360 and you earn 120 every day, and a run of Singularity will cost you 20 Pinnacle Energy.</p>
<p>You can also buy Bon Voyage Charms from a number of places. You can get them by exchanging 180 Lumia Leaves, another currency that can be earned in game, or for Translation Credits which are earned when playing Shifting Gates, and finally you can exchange Crystal Dust for them in the Fortuna shop.</p>



<p>As mentioned, there are lots of other ways to earn Bon Voyage charms during the launch window, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Weekly Sign-in Bonus</li>
<li>The “Spreading Light” referral program, invite pals and earn Bon Voyage charms as they level up.</li>
<li>Character Quests</li>
<li>Primary Quests</li>
<li>Chapter Objectives</li>
<li>Primary Quests</li>
<li>Destination Exploration and Destination Reputation Rewards</li>
<li>Pre-registration rewards : If you did sign up before the game launched, you should have some Charms waiting for you when you log in.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can keep track of many of the Rewards by going to the Events page and tapping on the Rewards Guide. You can also track Lumia Leaf rewards here, which can be turned in to Bon Voyage Charms.</p>
<h3>How to get Bon Voyage Charms L.E.</h3>
<p>For Bon Voyage Charms L.E. (Limited Edition) you are probably going to have to get your wallet out. These can only be used to claim characters who are available for a limited time. They can be bought via a number of methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the Fortuna Shop where you can purchase them using Silver</li>
<li>As Rewards from the Premium Battle Pass</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also exchange Fortuna Crystals and Fortuna Crystal dust for Bon Voyage Charms L.E. but you need rather a lot and you can only do this five times a month.</p>

<figure><a title="Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c573620e4dbb2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>The weekend has crept up on us once again, so it's time to kick back with a game or two.</p>
<p>Before we get to our plans, however, let's look back on all the Nintendo news that happened this week. Honestly, it was a rather quiet one. Nintendo launched a series of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/nintendo-releases-its-me-mario-stop-motion-shorts-watch-them-right-here">stop-motion Mario shorts</a> and the kid-focused <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hello_mario">Hello, Mario!</a> app in Japan (which we went <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/nintendos-new-app-reminds-me-of-a-universal-truth-it-feels-good-to-squash-marios-face">hands-on</a> with), rumours of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/rumour-a-nintendo-direct-is-reportedly-coming-ahead-of-marios-40th-anniversary">September Nintendo Direct</a> started bubbling away, and The Pokémon Company revealed another <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/pokemon-legends-z-as-latest-mega-evolution-looks-particularly-snazzy">new Mega Evolution</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>.</p>
<p>We also shared our reviews on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/roadwarden">Roadwarden</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shantae_advance_risky_revolution">Shantae: Risky Revolution</a>.</p>
<p>So, what's on the cards for this weekend?</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:187146,187176 @ 1756586608 -->
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I have never played Kirby and the Forgotten Land before, so I'm putting that right with the catchily-titled Switch 2 version. I've only played through the first world at this point, but what a sweet little 3D platformer! I'm very much excited to get cosy and play some more of it this weekend.</p>
<p>And I'm keeping Kirby as my main focus for this one. I really want to have it polished off before a certain metroidvania comes to gobble up all my time next week...</p>

<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>I am fully on the Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar train. Choo Choo. I think the game originally came out at a time when I was probably busy doing some boring school-related thing, so I never actually played the original. Also, I guess I always assumed it was a spin-off? Like the Harvest Moon match-3 game, Frantic Farming? I think they came out within a year of each other and I just assumed they were the same kind of thing. Anyway, the remake is pretty great! It's perhaps a little TOO easy — I'm still in spring of year one and I feel like I've made a ton of progress already — but I think they've finally discovered an art style that doesn't look super cheap or derivative! Hooray. I'd still like the character art to look a little less child-like, but we're making progress at least!</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>It's a busy one for me. As Alana mentioned <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/poll-ahead-of-silksongs-release-are-you-finally-playing-hollow-knight">earlier this week</a>, I've finally started <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a>! I'm not sure it's going to have the life-changing impact on me that others experienced seven or eight years ago, but I've enjoyed the couple of hours I've played so far and I'm itching to explore more. But! <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/star_trek_resurgence">Star Trek: Resurgence</a> launched on Switch this week - I've been anxious to play that since 2023.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a> is also an utter delight. I completed my first game the other day (well, I got the Gold cart, but there's loads more I could do) - Avianos, the turn-based, dinosaur, castle-conquering one. I've still barely touched the vast majority of the others, but what a treat this thing is. You'll be hearing me wax lyrical come December, guaranteed.</p>
<p>And on the theme of dinosaurs, I picked up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/lego_jurassic_world">LEGO Jurassic World</a> on sale this week. Following a blisteringly successful viewing of the first film, my kids are obsessed with Jurassic Park and I'm along for the ride, grinning wildly and shedding a tear when they sing along to those John Williams themes and overspending on the 30th anniversary sets Lego released a couple of years ago. You know, for the kids. Compared to the actual Lego, €3.99 for the game is an absolute steal, and it's also the best way to show them the rest of the movies without actually showing them the rest of the movies. Let 'em dream, hmm?</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'm still playing quite a lot of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> at the moment, but the recent reminder that Game Vouchers are on their way out has prompted me to dive back into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pikmin_2">Pikmin 2</a>. Y'see, I'd like to use the vouchers to get the third and fourth games, but I'd also like to complete the second before I, y'know, start the process. OCD, I guess.</p>
<p>I really want to play some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shinobi_art_of_vengeance">SHINOBI: Art of Vengeance</a> too, and you better believe I'll be sinking a few more hours into the new <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/lumines_arise">Lumines Arise</a> demo on PS5 before it disappears!</p>
<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>After finishing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/chibi-robo">Chibi-Robo</a> last weekend, I’ll finally be wrapping up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pipistrello_and_the_cursed_yoyo">Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo</a>, which has gone completely under the radar but is one of the best games I’ve played this year. Creative movement, challenging puzzles, all wrapped up in a Zelda-style overworld with a Metroidvania-esque structure? It’s excellent; do yourself a favour and pick it up.</p>
<p>Otherwise, no new games for me this week (you know why), but I will be downloading that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</a> demo. I’m glad people who’ve never played the series before are checking this one out, and I’m eager to see what the fuss is about with this remake. Enjoy your weekend, folks!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The next season of <em>Kill Team</em> launches with a brand new box, featuring a new setting, new kill teams, and new missions.&nbsp;In this article, we'll take a look at the new kill teams and what else <em>Kill Team</em> Tomb World adds to your games.</p>

<p><em>Kill Team</em> is a skirmish wargame set in Games Workshop's larger <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> setting. As a skirmish game, <em>Kill Team</em> features a small number of elite troops, fighting special operations battles, rather than huge battles fought with entire armies. We've covered <em>Kill Team</em> in depth since the first edition, and you can read our review of the current <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow">Starter Set</a> here.</p>




<h2>The Awoken And The Purgers</h2>

<p><em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Tomb World, although a huge box, is an expansion for <em>Kill Team</em>, and while it contains a lot of content, it requires a copy of the Kill Team core rulebook, dice, and a measuring tool to use. As with previous expansions, it&nbsp;adds 2 brand new kill teams, a new set of non-player operative miniatures and missions, and because it's the start of the new season, it includes the core terrain for this season's kill zone.</p>

<p>The full box contents are:</p>

<ul><li><em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Tomb World Dossier</li>
	<li>10x Adeptus Astartes Deathwatch Miniatures</li>
	<li>8x Necron Canoptek Circle miniatures</li>
	<li>13x Necron Warriors and Canoptek Scarab Swarm&nbsp;NPO miniatures</li>
	<li>Datacards for both kill teams</li>
	<li>Tokens for both kill teams</li>
	<li>Tomb World game board, scenery pieces, and event cards</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kill-team-tomb-world-2.jpg?itok=oSBYL17U 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kill-team-tomb-world-2.jpg?itok=9EJRglJP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kill Team</em> heads back indoors in the close-confines of <em>Kill Team</em> Tomb World.</figcaption></figure><p>The included non-player operatives (NPOs) and event cards are for use in the Joint Ops: Tomb World mission pack for cooperative or solo play. This pack has players battling&nbsp;AI-controlled Necrons. The mission pack has 6 missions and 3 maps for joint ops, and the rules and 3 maps for player vs player games, with the added complication of AI-controlled Necrons.</p>

<p>With the returning Gallowdark-style corridors of kill zone Tomb World, the rules for close quarters fighting are included, along with rules for the unique scenery pieces the box contains, like the teleporter, hatchways, and breachable walls.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kill-team-tomb-world-5.jpg?itok=hySz3deQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kill-team-tomb-world-5.jpg?itok=_3G8OaZ1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The <em>Kill Team</em> Tomb World scenery offers a thematically claustrophic experieince.</figcaption></figure><h2>Seasonal Changes</h2>

<p><em>Kill Team</em> Tomb World is the start of the next season of <em>Kill Team</em>, which means that the <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/oEk5abZ8/kill-team-managing-the-range-of-kill-teams-in-the-new-edition/" rel="nofollow">kill team rotation</a> previously detailed by Games Workshop will come into effect. We should expect a full updated article on which kill teams are legal for tournament play, but all kill teams with existing rules in this edition will still be balance updated and can be used for any games outside of tournaments.</p>

<p>With the new season, we also expect the <em>Kill Team</em> <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/mhstieyb/kill-team-approved-ops-2025-snatch-the-initiative-and-secure-new-objectives/" rel="nofollow">Approved Ops 2025 card pack</a> to release alongside Tomb World. This card pack updates the Tac Ops for the 4&nbsp;archetypes, along with new and returning Crit Ops and the standard Kill Op. It also includes new map layouts for&nbsp;Killzones Volkus, Bheta-decima, Gallowdark, and the new Tomb World.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kill-team-tomb-world-3.jpg?itok=B3WdBSHO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kill-team-tomb-world-3.jpg?itok=5lfHwset 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Deathwatch kill team gives you increbile variety when chosing your 5-man kill team.</figcaption></figure><h2>Suffer Not the Xenos To Live</h2>

<p>Before <em>Kill Team</em> existed as a game, the Deathwatch used the name to describe the temporary groups of Space Marines pulled from every chapter to serve in the Deathwatch's core function of eliminating the Xenos threat. These Space Marines don black armor during their service, leaving only one shoulder pauldron painted in the colors of their original chapter. They then get access to the intelligence and specialised wargear that allows the Deathwatch to serve their purpose.</p>

<p>The Deathwatch kill team has access to 11 operatives, but fields 5 in a kill team. This gives you a huge amount of flexibility going into battle, allowing you to tailor your forces to respond to your opponent. The Tomb World set includes enough sprues to let you build 10 Deathwatch marines, allowing you to build nearly one of each type (having to make a choice between 2 of the 3 Gravis armored marines). This means you can build 2 entire Deathwatch kill teams for games of Joint Ops using the Tomb World or other joint ops rules.</p>

<p>The standout Deathwatch marines for us, and our first Deathwatch kill team loadout, are the Watch Sergeant, who can use a strategy and firefight ploy once per battle for free. The Blademaster Veteran, who wields a Xenophase blade and can fight against every enemy in its control range. The frag cannon-wielding Bombard Veteran who has 2 fire options, the very high damage shell or the torrent ruled shrapnel. The Gunner Veteran, armed with a heavy plasma incinerator, and the Marksman Veteran, who can go on guard to punish any enemies moving into their view, and when using the close quarters rules, immediately go back on guard after performing a shoot action.</p>

<p>All the Deathwatch Marines can perform 2 shoot or fight actions each turn, and can also perform an additional (but different) single point action when they counteract. The Deathwatch also have access to special ammunition, which can be used once per turning point to add 1 of 7 special rules to a shooting attack.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kill-team-tomb-world-4.jpg?itok=OqIyiHfG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kill-team-tomb-world-4.jpg?itok=zkc-1oE- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>While the Canoptek Circle kill team roster is fixed, you get a never ending supply of warriors to throw at your opponent.</figcaption></figure><h2>Dreams Of A Dynasty</h2>

<p>The Necrons are the robotic undead of a long-forgotten empire, sleeping in tombs and awakening when disturbed. Serving the forgotten masters of this sleeping empire are Crypteks, engineers who seek to further their own agendas, whilst serving their masters. The Canoptek Circle kill team are led by a Geomancer Cryptek who can change the form of matter to move through physical barriers, or aggressively to utterly destroy their targets. Supporting the Geomancer are Canoptek constructs, mindless thrawls acting out their will.</p>

<p>The Canoptek Circle has a fixed kill team roster, led by the powerful Geomancer who can use their abilities to damage all operatives near a scenery piece, and move them, or any other friendly operative through walls. The Canoptek Circle deploys 3 obelisk node tokens at the start of the game. These tokens can be used to control uncontest objectives and also create a node matrix if they are within 6 inches of another node, boosting the kill team's abilities if friendly operatives are within the node matrix.</p>

<p>Backing up the Geomancer are 2 Tomb Crawlers, which are large mobile weapons platforms, 1 Accelerator, who can boost other Canoptek operatives' action points by 1, 1 Macroctye Reanimator, who can heal and resurrect other operatives, and 3 Warriors, who aren't very durable, but can damage nearby enemies when killed, and respawn at the start of your turn in your dropzone.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kill-team-tomb-world-6.jpg?itok=WdZ0VKtI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kill-team-tomb-world-6.jpg?itok=mVct7XBJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Deathwatch do not suffer the alien to live in <em>Kill Team</em> Tomb World.</figcaption></figure><h2>Kill Team Tomb World Final Thoughts?</h2>

<p><em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Tomb World is a fantastic start to the new season. The box contains enough miniatures for 3 kill teams (2x 5-man Deathwatch and 1 Canoptek Circle kill team), plus 13 extra NPO miniatures for solo and cooperative play, along with enough scenery to fill a game board with walls to capture the claustrophobic feel of a Necron Tomb.</p>

<p>As a Space Marine player myself, it's great to see the original kill team finally represented, and the fact that you get enough miniatures to build 2 whole Deathwatch kill teams out of the box gives you an insane amount of variety when putting your roster together, or play joint ops straight out of the box. The Canoptek Circle kill team are also very interesting, with a powerful leader and 2 strong weapons platforms, with the respawning warriors that your opponent will never fully get rid of. They offer a thematic Necron experience, as you can throw warriors at your opponent without a care.</p>

                <p>The announcement that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> would release on September 4 was such a surprise that even the most tuned-in Hollow Knight fans were in shock at the news. And now, just days before Silksong releases, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight/" data-ref-id="5000-448603">Hollow Knight</a> is seeing a renaissance with gamers, passing its Steam concurrents records over and over again, hitting a new peak of 56,192 players on August 29, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/367520/charts/#1w" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according to SteamDB</a>.</p><p>For years, Hollow Knight's biggest day was in May of 2022 when the game had over 20,000 concurrent players. Since the announcement of Silksong's impending release date, though, each consecutive day has seen that concurrent peak rising, having <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-just-hit-an-all-time-peak-on-steam-after-silksong-release-date-reveal/1100-6534206/" data-ref-id="1100-6534206">hit 21,000 on August 22</a>, just a day after the announcement, and hit 56,192 today. For a seven-year-old indie game, this is pretty big.</p><p>Of course, it's important to note that SteamDB is not the be-all-end-all of game stats. Steam is a dominant platform for sure, but Hollow Knight is available on all last and current-generation consoles, including Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox, with Switch being a particularly popular platform for the game. Even so, it's indicative that the legend of Hollow Knight continues to grow.</p><p>We got a sneak peek last week, and signs are looking good. "Hollow Knight: Silksong appears to be exactly what we all should have expected: a strong, well-designed, visually lovely game that carries forward the aesthetic and design philosophies of the original with thoughtful, if not earth-shattering, updates," GameSpot's Steve Watts wrote after going <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-is-real-and-i-played-it/1100-6534147/" data-ref-id="1100-6534147">hands-on with Silksong at Gamescom</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Hw3clSJDo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gearbox Main Theatre Show</a> at PAX West, the Texas-based game developer unveiled the endgame and post-launch roadmap for Borderlands 4, which is due to launch in less than two weeks. In the upcoming game, players will continue to progress their characters through weekly challenge missions and unlockable specializations to further customize their loadout.</p>



<p>Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode is returning, albeit reimagined from previous iterations. This post-game difficulty option challenges players with five unlockable levels that increase in difficulty. Additionally, based on lessons learned from previous games in the franchise, players no longer need to replay the campaign to gain new ranks. Instead, players will advance through curated mission challenges that test their chosen build. These challenges grow more difficult as players progress, eliminating the need to re-farm the same gear.</p>



<p>Each Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode rank includes exclusive Firmware set bonuses for gear that players will first find while playing the campaign. The first loot drops with Firmware should start appearing around level 25. The more Firmware a player acquires, the higher their stat bonus will be. These powerful bonuses can be transferred to another item once, after which the original item is destroyed, and the firmware bonus cannot be transferred again.</p>



<p>Multiple incentives will be provided to encourage Borderlands 4 players to continue searching for the best loot. Weekly Wildcards offer rotating missions with a guaranteed Legendary reward. In the Weekly Big Encore Boss, Moxxi’s Big Encore selects one boss for the week that can be unlocked with Eridium for a larger iteration with increased drop rates.</p>



<p>The Maurice's Black Market Machine sends players across Kairos in search of its spoils, offering varied loot for every player. These activities are all available for online matchmaking, as you'd expect in this type of game.</p>



<figure><a href="https://assets.2k.com/1a6ngf98576c/1xMGxsFasYPMmGHR0A89LW/a524992219bfe143ef7a32a04f5a3b92/BL4_Post-Launch-Roadmap-1920x1080__1_.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Gearbox Software then switched to discuss the game's post-launch roadmap, starting with the free updates. Seasonal Mini-Events will kick off in October with Horrors of Kairos offering new Legendary Weapons, Cosmetics, and a new Weather Variant. Invincible Bosses are also returning to test players’ skill and build inside high-level new boss arenas that integrate the new traversal mechanics introduced with Borderlands 4. Powerful new Legendaries are the juicy rewards for players strong enough to defeat Invincible Bosses. Additionally, a new Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode level will release alongside each Invincible Boss.</p>



<p>As for the paid DLCs, there will be two types: Story Pack and Bounty Pack. The first of two announced story packs, scheduled for Q1 2026, features the return of fan-favorite Ellie in "Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned." With a cosmic horror theme and a bloodier, darker tone than the main campaign, this Story Pack includes an all-new region of Kairos to explore, multiple engaging main and side missions, and all-new legendary gear. It also introduces the first post-launch playable Vault Hunter. Additionally, this pack includes four new Vault Hunter skins, two new vehicle skins, three ECHO-4 drone skins, and one ECHO-4 frame, as well as attachments.</p>



<p>The first Bounty Pack will arrive earlier than that, in Q4 2025. In Bounty Packs, Borderlands 4 players will experience narrative-based missions that expand the universe. These missions reveal more about the new characters players encounter on Kairos, beginning with Rush, the gregarious leader of the Outbounders. Each Bounty Pack includes new main missions, a new boss, new legendary gear, one player skin, one ECHO-4 drone skin, one new vehicle, and a Vault card. This allows players to unlock 24 cosmetics and four pieces of rerollable gear.</p>



<p>The second Bounty Pack will land in Q1 2026 alongside the Pearlescent items (which will be free). Pearlescent gear drops will be challenging to find, but their power level matches their coveted rarity. Borderlands 4 is out <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-gold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on September 12</a> for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, while Nintendo Switch 2 fans <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">must wait until October 3</a> to play it. </p>

                <p>In celebrating the legacy of Battlefield, EA recently released a new battle pass for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-2042/" data-ref-id="5000-532981">Battlefield 2042</a>. Called “Road to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a>”, it features unlockable skins and cosmetic items that represent different games in the series. What’s most notable about the pass--beyond the fact that’s completely free--is that it also includes 20 item unlocks for the upcoming Battlefield 6.</p><p>Like most battle passes, the unlockable items are grouped into levels or tiers. In Tier 8, for instance, players will be able to unlock a Battlefield 1 era player card background, card icon, weapon package and more. There are even a few vehicle and soldier skins up for grabs at the later levels; fans looking to unlock the Aurora Vehicle Skin from Battlefield Bad Company 2, for instance, can do so after hitting Tier 30.</p>
