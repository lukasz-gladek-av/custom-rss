            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Rockstar’s parent company, Take-Two Interactive, reconfirmed that <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> is set to launch this November during its quarterly earnings report and conference. Take-Two’s CEO even revealed that marketing for the long-awaited crime sim will start this summer.</p> <p>On Tuesday, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-marketing-will-kick-off-this-summer-as-take-two-confidently-reaffirms-november-release-date?utm_source=bluesky,threads,twitter">as spotted in a press release about Take-Two’s Q3 2026 earnings results by <em>IGN</em></a>, the company confirmed that it plans to start marketing <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> sometime in the summer, which seems to indicate that the game, which has been delayed a few times now, is actually (for real) getting close to launching later this year.</p>

 <p>“I feel good about it. Very good about it,” said Zelnick when asked by the outlet how he felt about <em>GTA 6</em>‘s November 19 release. “Of course, because any time you’re getting closer to marketing beats, you’re obviously in a place where your confidence level is as high as it can be.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/take-two-ceo-googles-project-genie">Zelnick told newsletter <em>The Game Business</em></a>&nbsp;this when asked about the confirmation that<em> GTA 6</em>‘s marketing blitz was just a few months away: “You know me pretty well, for me to even say we’ve got marketing beats coming this summer is a huge departure from what I usually say, which is that our labels will make marketing announcements.”</p>

 <p>Normally Take-Two doesn’t provide details like this, opting to let Rockstar provide those details later, so this is a good sign that <em>GTA 6</em>‘s development is on track. You don’t start committing to expensive marketing plans and telling the press about them unless everyone involved is very confident in the game’s development status. And yes, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-date-delay-borderlands-4-fall-2025-1851757501">in the past, Zelnick has told investors and the public he felt good about <em>GTA 6</em>‘s release date</a>, and then it was delayed. <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-delay-strauss-zelnick-ceo-take-two-interview-rockstar-games-2000617237">But in those cases</a>, he and Take-Two hadn’t committed to a marketing timeframe like this before. And while things can always change, at least for now it seems <em>GTA 6</em> is finally, for real, actually launching as planned on November 19.</p>

<p>The Grand Theft Auto 6 (GTA 6) marketing train is getting ready to get into full gear. </p>



<p>As part of the company’s <a href="https://www.take2games.com/ir" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">quarterly earnings report</a> on Tuesday, Take-Two Interactive confirmed that marketing for GTA 6 will begin this summer. </p>







<p>On top of that, CEO Strauss Zelnick address concerns about a lack of a physical version of the game when it launches in the fall. </p>



<p>In speaking with Variety, Zelnick was asked about the claims that Take-Two Interactive was going to withhold from a physical release of GTA 6 until 2027 in order to prevent leaks before launch. To that notion, Zelnick bluntly said that it was<strong> “not the plan”.</strong></p>







<p>GTA 6 is scheduled to launch for Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5 on November 19, 2026. Take-Two <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-release-date-earnings-call/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reaffirmed the release date</a> as part of the same earnings report. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Late last week, the Department of Justice <a href="https://www.npr.org/2026/01/30/nx-s1-5693904/epstein-files-doj-trump?ref=aftermath.site"><u>released another heavily redacted drip feed</u></a> of files tied to the criminal investigation and subsequent death of Jeffrey Epstein, a man convicted of such heinous sex crimes that his name has practically become synonymous with the idea. The files, which started releasing in late 2025, have implicated <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/a-list-of-powerful-men-named-in-the-epstein-files-from-elon-musk-to-former-prince-andrew?ref=aftermath.site"><u>numerous globally powerful figures including Donald Trump and Elon Musk</u></a>, the latter in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/30/elon-musk-epstein-files-island-visits?ref=aftermath.site"><u>brutally embarrassing fashion</u></a> (both maintain their innocence).&nbsp;</p><p>But sprinkled throughout the files are references to <a href="https://xboxera.com/2026/01/30/jeffrey-epstein-was-banned-on-xbox-live/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Epstein’s banned Xbox Live account</u></a>, <em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>World of Warcraft</em>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/jeffrey-epstein-five-nights-at-freddys-porn-via-4chan-links-emails-show-2000664667?ref=aftermath.site"><u><em>Five Nights At Freddy’s</em> porn</u></a>, the concept of microtransactions, and even specific people like ex-Activision CEO Bobby Kotick, former Rockstar North president and founder of <em>MindsEye </em>studio Build A Rocket Boy, Leslie Benzies, and current Rockstar president Sam Houser.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Aftermath reached out to Kotick, Benzies, and Houser for more information but did not receive responses as of this publishing. Being included in the files doesn’t mean that a person has committed a crime.</p><p>Kotick and Houser have not commented publicly on the matter, though Mark Gerhard, co-CEO of Build A Rocket Boy, <a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-ceo-threatens-youtuber-after-epstein-video-2000665097?ref=aftermath.site"><u>issued a “cease and desist” notice</u></a> in the <em>MindsEye </em>Discord server to YouTuber Cyber Boi immediately following the latter's video titled "Leslie Benzies is in the Epstein Files." The video has since been deleted. A detailing of sexual assault allegations against Benizes contained in the Epstein files remains live on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/leslie-benzies-accused-sexual-assault-in-epstein-files/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Insider Gaming</u></a> (Houser, according to a document in the files, was allegedly aware of the situation).&nbsp;</p><p>In <a href="https://kotaku.com/leslie-benzies-epstein-allegation-gta-mindseye-2000665340?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a statement to Kotaku</u></a>, Benzies denied the allegations: “These allegations are false, I had a 3 months consensual relationship with this person, and I have never met Jeffrey Epstein, nor have I ever visited his island, his properties or travelled on his plane. Any suggestion otherwise is misleading,” he said.</p><p>The files also contain evidence that Kotick exchanged emails with Epstein and others in his circle, but thanks to the US government’s decision to redact and decontextualize them in an obvious effort to sow confusion and discord, it’s unclear if Kotick ever met directly with Epstein or visited his island. Epstein tried to schedule <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02155539.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>dinner with Kotick (and, at one point, Woody Allen)</u></a> in November 2012 in New York. In an email sent on November 18, 2012, Epstein suggests that Kotick, at least, spent some time with him. "bobby Kotick came over last night„ hes great," <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00948221.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Epstein wrote</u></a> to Next Model Management co-founder Faith Kates, who <a href="https://pagesix.com/2025/12/01/society/next-model-management-co-founder-faith-kates-retires-after-jeffrey-epstein-e-mails-resurface/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>stepped down last year</u></a> following a different batch of Epstein emails. Kotick, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01765212.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>said to Epstein</u></a> that he wished “would [sic] could have stopped by the island” in December 2012 following a trip to the Caribbean. The two continued to correspond in 2013, with Epstein <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01787930.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>messaging Kotick</u></a> in May to say “my russian guest missed your arrival yesterday” and Kotick replying “And I missed her. Ill see you both next trip.” (It is unclear to whom they were referring.)</p><p>Also in May 2013, Epstein emailed Kotick <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01974631.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>an unhinged missive about edutainment</u></a> that seems to have originally been written by <a href="https://deepfuture.tech/about-pablos/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>self-proclaimed “hacker, inventor &amp; technology futurist”</u></a> Pablos Holman after Epstein mentioned to Holman that he was meeting with former Chancellor of the New York City Department of Education Joel Klein. Here it is, in its entirety:</p><blockquote>Play "Medal of Honor" or "Call of Duty" and you will learn war history. Here's what I've been thinking.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>Video games are already great at teaching. If they don't assess your level and put an appropriate challenge right in front of you, the game fails. Challenge too hard and you get frustrated and quit playing. Too easy and the game is no fun. That is exactly what a good teacher or tutor would do. Fundamentally the thing that works is a 1 to 1 student teacher ratio. Even if you have a shitty teacher or tutor, you will learn a lot because that person gets to know you and challenges you at your level. That doesn't scale, but computers do. So we have to use computers to replace teachers – or at least augment them.</blockquote><blockquote>Today's video games don't try to teach stuff we care about. Well, except for shooting bad guys. The best scheme I've come up with so far is to use X-Prize or something like it to co-opt the existing video game industry. Give out a prize to the game that comes up with the best way of teaching kids anything from a normal school curriculum. Let them pick whatever they want to teach, any grade level, and just incorporate it into their product. That's the way to get the most brains and the most users for the least money. You want to skip convincing educators and parents about this stuff and just go straight for the kids.</blockquote><blockquote>Imagine you are looking at a door in a video game. It has some squiggly symbols printed on it. Little munchkins walk up to that door and say “Konichiwa.” The door opens and they are greeted by a hot princess with big tits and a thong. The door closes in your face. You are going to fucking learn to read and pronounce Kanji.</blockquote><blockquote>Unleash that on 5th grade boys and then next thing you know, you'll have an entire generation of bilingual kids speaking Japanese to each other behind the backs of their parents and teachers.</blockquote><blockquote>Edutainment is for pussies. It doesn't work. Once kids catch on that you are trying to teach them something they shut down. We have to keep the boobs and guns and profit. You see how much money video games are making these days? Fuck educational reform. We need educational subversion!&nbsp;</blockquote><p>The next day, Kotick <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00695633.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>replied</u></a>: "X prize is a good idea but key is real world rewards. Learn to read: earn cell phone minutes, iPhone credits, virtual items in games."</p><p>Epstein forwarded Kotick’s message to Holman, who reacted by <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01762201.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>saying</u></a>, "I'm all for indoctrinating kids into an economy. You gotta love how his [e]xample for 'real world rewards' is 'virtual items in games.'"</p><p>Many have suggested that this means Epstein played a pivotal role in convincing Activision to embrace microtransactions, but this appears to be a massive overstatement; for one, Holman and Kotick were the ones making the lion's share of the above suggestions – not Epstein. For two, <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 2</em> had just introduced microtransactions prior to the conversation, and <em>Call of Duty: Ghosts</em> would push things further in that direction a handful of months later.</p><p>In 2018, an Epstein advisor <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02624612.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>suggested</u></a> spending a large sum on Activision stock in hopes that <em>Call of Duty</em> could challenge <em>Fortnite </em>for the battle royale throne, but it seems like Epstein and his accountant, Richard Kahn, decided against it (and later <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01030996.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>mocked the advisor for it</u></a>).</p><p>Epstein maintained his fascination with games in the years following, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02466653.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>emailing back and forth in 2016</u></a> with Bitcoin Core contributor Jeremy Rubin about the latter’s idea of a creating “an intellectually sti[m]ulating game where women outperform men,” which, in his mind, would either “provide evidence of universal inferiority which would inform you (society) to not invest in gender diversity as much” or, if the experiment was successful, would help them "learn more about how to get value out of fema[l]e employees." In response to the question of whether any such games already existed, Epstein replied: “motherhood game? card games, video games= hacking. all are games . same result. . poetry. game ma[y]be :).”</p><p>If you’re not already seeing the pattern, it’s clear that Epstein and his associates saw games as mechanisms for profit, coercion, and control, a throughline that persists in his association with two key figures in Gamergate and the surrounding bedlam: Peter Thiel and Steve Bannon.</p><p>Based on available files, Epstein expressed interest in Thiel and his surveillance company, Palantir, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01877201.pdf?utm_campaign=here-s-how-epstein-broke-the-internet&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email"><u>as early as 2012</u></a>, but correspondence between the two began <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02095904.pdf?utm_campaign=here-s-how-epstein-broke-the-internet&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email"><u>in 2014</u></a>. Then, in May 2016, Epstein <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00826876.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>messaged Thiel</u></a> saying that he "would have gladly share[d] your expenses for the gawker suit" and invited him to dinner with Noam Chomsky, of all people (it is unclear if this dinner ever took place). That suit, of course, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2018/02/hogan-thiel-gawker-trial/554132/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>led to the collapse of Gawker Media</u></a> and the sale of its many sites – of which Kotaku, a major Gamergate target (and the former employer of all five members of Aftermath’s core staff), was one. This would <a href="https://www.headcountcoffee.com/blogs/corporate-legends-lost-empires/the-rise-and-gutting-of-gawker-media-the-lawsuit-that-reshaped-publishing?srsltid=AfmBOooL7SERVnKHpFLibbcK-roJWUN-42RO69tPpAe8KghriqIoMML1&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>send ripples through the worlds of media and journalism for years to come</u></a>, leading to a press defanged by the threat of legal annihilation.&nbsp;</p><p>The next month, shortly after the June 2016 referendum that kicked off Brexit, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02459362.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Epstein emailed Thiel</u></a>, saying "brexit, just the beginning" and then, in response to Thiel asking what he meant, "return to tribalism. counter to globalization. amazing new alliances. you and I both agreed zero interest rates were too high, and as i said in your office. finding things on their way to collapse, was much easier than finding the next bargain."</p><p>(ICE now relies on data from Palantir to <a href="https://www.404media.co/elite-the-palantir-app-ice-uses-to-find-neighborhoods-to-raid/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>figure out which neighborhoods to raid</u></a>.)</p><p>Bannon catapulted himself into the public eye in 2012 by taking over Breitbart&nbsp; – a far-right publication and core Gamergate legitimizer – and then parlaying that right-wing revitalization effort into a 2016 gig as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bannon?ref=aftermath.site"><u>CEO of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign</u></a>. Prior to all that, however, Bannon <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/09/trumps-campaign-ceos-little-known-world-warcraft-career/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>worked as CEO of Internet Gaming Entertainment</u></a>, a <em>World of Warcraft</em> gold seller. Epstein maintained his fixation with virtual currency when the two met and began collaborating closely in 2017, with the two <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02521618.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>emailing</u></a> about using crypto to fund a “populist/nationalist coalition” that could “stave off” Time’s Up – aka the #MeToo movement – “for [the] next decade plus."</p><p>Epstein and Bannon would go on to message throughout 2018 and 2019 about various attempts at reshaping the political landscape. <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01614968.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Bannon bragged</u></a> that he had figures and groups like far-right Italian politician Matteo Salvini, Germany’s far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, and right-wing UK politician Nigel Farage dangling from his puppet strings. Epstein, in turn, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02506034.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>waxed grandiose</u></a> of “twenty thousand hackers. showing up at the same place. . .. they will be sharing ideas on hacking crypto ex[c]hanges, voting booths, medical records, crypto wallets," which piqued Bannon’s interest.</p><p>But, <a href="https://www.garbageday.email/p/here-s-how-epstein-broke-the-internet?ref=aftermath.site"><u>as Garbage Day points out</u></a>, this doesn’t mean Epstein, first and foremost a career scuzzball, and Bannon, who flunked out of the White House during Trump’s first term and became a (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/29/us/steve-bannon-prison-release.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>briefly imprisoned</u></a>) podcaster, were <em>responsible </em>for any of what was to come.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><blockquote>Based on the emails to which we currently have access to, populist politics, online disinformation, cyber warfare, and cryptocurrency were all just scaffolding for his work as a financier and sex trafficker. A way to destabilize the global order, make connections with the world’s elites, and continue enriching himself and preying on vulnerable young girls. Reading through his messages, it’s clear that he was someone who was learning to speak the language of social media and far-right populism at the same time everyone else was.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>Were Epstein and Bannon really building a crypto-funded far-right coalition of pro-Russian dictators across Europe? Or were they just LARPing as kingmakers with each other over email? And does the distinction even matter if other powerful figures seemed to believe in their project?</blockquote><blockquote>It is nearly impossible to not get pulled deeper down the rabbit hole while reading through Epstein’s emails. Because, whether or not he did directly influence elections across the globe, he was trying to. And he had the means and the access to believe he could.</blockquote><p>The Epstein files, in their current <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2026/jan/31/jeffrey-epstein-unreleased-files?ref=aftermath.site"><u>incomplete and piecemeal form</u></a>, are if nothing else a useful demonstration of how obscenely powerful people talk to each other – how they seek to exert control and the levers they pull on to do so. These objectives are not implied; they’re stated outright. Resulting class solidarity among the hyper-wealthy is unconstrained by laws, boundaries, or industries. If something can be used to amass more power, it’s on the table. This, obviously, includes video games and the internet, which have played an increasingly pivotal role in securing the far right’s grip on numerous institutions and governments over the past decade.&nbsp;</p><p>It is no coincidence that monstrous crimes against women and children lie at the heart of this deleterious trend, whether Epstein himself succeeded at tilting the global balance of power or not. Far-right ideology begins at home, with the familial unit. However, under this framework family is not treated as a community to be nurtured, but as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jun/08/power-patriarchy-victimhood-denial-three-experts-on-why-men-hurt-women?ref=aftermath.site"><u>property to be owned and controlled</u></a>. The option for a patriarchal man to violently abuse people – including children – is a core appeal of the ideology, which is why far-right politicians and personalities have spent years trying to normalize rolling back laws around <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/06/24/1102305878/supreme-court-abortion-roe-v-wade-decision-overturn?ref=aftermath.site"><u>abortion</u></a>, <a href="https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2025/08/gop-senator-who-said-trans-people-put-girls-at-risk-just-helped-a-relative-who-a-13-year-old/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>consent</u></a>, <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/republican-lawmakers-child-marriage-abortion-1235018777/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>marriage age</u></a>, and <a href="https://19thnews.org/2024/09/neil-parrott-maryland-gop-house-argument-spousal-rape/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>spousal abuse</u></a>.</p><p>The point of the project has always been to consolidate power in the hands of a select few; now we’re seeing exactly who those few are and what they intend for it to look like.

The larger system that turned a blind eye to this – that enabled it via both action and inaction – seems more interested in plucking innocent people off neighborhood streets than <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/01/epstein-files-todd-blanche-photos-00759045?ref=aftermath.site"><u>investigating or prosecuting</u></a> those mentioned in the files.

            <guid>1424554</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>EA's</strong> announcement that it would be <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-confirms-agreement-to-be-acquired-by-pif-silver-lake-and-affinity-partners-for-55-billion/"><strong>going private</strong> in a buyout led by the <strong>Saudi Arabia PIF</strong> and <strong>Silver Lake</strong></a> wasn't the only major deal the company made in 2025. It also <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-ca/news/ea-partners-with-stability-ai">struck a deal with Stability AI</a>, a <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/googles-project-genie-shows-meaningful-progress-in-content-generation-but-it-cant-replace-creative-vision-says-analyst/">generative AI</a></strong> firm that "<em>is unlocking the power of open-source generative AI to expand human creativity,</em>" according to its <a href="https://stability.ai/">website</a>. </p>



<p>At the time of the deal, Stability AI chief executive officer, <strong>Prem Akkaraju</strong>, said, "<em>EA is a pioneer in interactive entertainment and understands that innovation begins with the creator</em>. <em>At Stability AI, we put creators at the center and build around their specific needs. By embedding our 3D research team directly with EA’s artists and developers, we’ll unlock the next level in world-building power</em>."</p>



<p>For EA's part, <strong>Rick Stringfellow</strong>, the head of visual content for the <strong>EA Entertainment</strong> division, said, "<em>EA has always been, and will continue to be, at the forefront of technology, innovation, and play</em>. <em>Partnerships like this are how we evolve the craft of game-making and give our teams the tools to tell deeper, more meaningful stories</em>."</p>



<p>Now, in a new interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/electronic-arts-strategy-stability-ai-deal-1236650229/">Variety</a>, EA's chief strategy officer, <strong>Mihir Vaidya</strong>, digs further into why EA made the deal, and what Vaidya believes the deal does for EA as it moves into the future. "<em>One thing we're super proud of at EA is that, over the course of our history, I think we've taken great pride in our heritage as electronic artists.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>And to be a great electronic artist, you need to have the very best technology and tools available to you. That’s been a core principle of how we’ve kind of thought about technology, is we always are looking out there for the very best technology and solutions for our creatives.</em>"</p>



<p>That's the spirit with which, according to Vaidya, EA found Stability AI, and eventually decided to partner with the company because of what it was capable of and willing to do. "<em>What really stood out to us and why we ultimately decided to partner with Stability was one of the things that we talked to all of our developers was this notion that we can’t control the tools that are available</em>. <em>Certainly there’s gaps in capabilities, but even when the tools were capable, they’re not controllable. That’s incredibly frustrating for anyone in order to see their utility in the context of their work. And when we unpack, well, why are they not controllable?</em>"</p>



<p>"...<em>Turns out you need deep customization. Customization means you have to be able to unpack the model, understand where representations of different concepts and capabilities lie, and then be able to preserve those representations but adapt them at the same time to your specific needs. It’s not a trivial task. It’s very, very difficult. And you need a partner that is able to do that. And Stability was not only able to do that, it was willing to do that</em>."</p>



<p>One thing worth remembering, as is noted in the interview, we won't see any 'fruits' of this deal for a while. GenAI tech is still finding its place within game development, if it even has a place to begin with, and that's without getting into <a href="https://wccftech.com/ai-is-theft-i-have-to-use-it-otherwise-ill-get-fired-gdc-reports-one-third-of-game-workers-are-using-genai-for-daily-tasks/">the <strong>concerns and real disdain</strong> developers</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-will-refrain-from-using-genai-tools-to-develop-concept-art-will-use-it-elsewhere/">players have for the technology</a>.</p>



<p>On those concerns, namely, ones from developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/candy-crush-microsoft-laid-off-developers-being-replaced-by-ai-tools-they-built/">worried that GenAI tools will simply replace them</a>, Akkaruju believes that, while there may be some developers laid off because of GenAI tools, ultimately, there will be more jobs in game development as the industry expands because of the technology, equating it to how ATMs did not bring about the extinction of bank tellers.</p>



<p>"<em>If you add or introduce technology into making something more efficient, what ends up happening is the workforce actually expands. Labour is not fixed, and so if it was fixed, you're absolutely right, that would truly eliminate the jobs</em>," Akkaruju said.</p>



<p>"<em>When those [ATMs] were rolled out in America in the '80s, every bank teller in America was up in arms, and they said, 'This is what we do. We give withdrawals, we take deposits, and you're taking our jobs away with this machine.' And there's more bank teller jobs today than in the '80s, if you go point for point. And why is that? Because the banks did an analysis, and they went from 30 people that they needed for each location down to 13, and they did what came naturally, they expanded</em>."</p>



<p>A fine observation to make, when, as the chief executive officer of the GenAI company, you're not going to be the one losing your job when those layoffs come. And right now, when looking at EA specifically, <a href="https://wccftech.com/20-billion-debt-ticking-time-bomb-ea-studios-says-analyst/">due to the ticking time bomb that is the <strong>$20 billion debt</strong></a> the company is taking on as part of its buyout, layoffs are practically the only thing developers at EA can look forward to. And that's without getting into other major flaws between the immediate and tangible benefits ATMs brought, versus the predominantly theoretical benefits executives tout for GenAI tech that we won't see today or tomorrow, and potentially not for several years.</p>



<p>Vaidya, for his part, said he did not want to <em>"trivialize</em>" the concerns developers have about layoffs due to the introduction of GenAI tools, while still ultimately taking a similar view to Akkaruju. "<em>AI can play a role in augmenting a particular task, what's naturally going to happen is there's going to have to be a recomposition of certain tasks...Over the course of time, there's naturally new job families that also emerge.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>I think the most important thing to do, if this is the case, is to be on the front foot and lead the conversation,</em>" Vaidya continued. "<em>Because otherwise, what happens is this notion of disruption kicks in because you're not ready for that change. And as a result, this is especially the case if if that disruption comes from folks that are not insiders in the industry, but outside of it. And that's one of my biggest worries is that we become observers, as opposed to participants and leaders in this conversation, because market forces will lead to AI being deployed at scale. And there are many players outside of the creative industry today that are trying to leverage AI in the space of sport and entertainment</em>."</p>

            <guid>1424518</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Highguard’s</em> 5v5 mode, which launched over the weekend as a temporary experiment, is now a permanent mode in the free-to-play raid shooter. And while the new mode is better than the old 3v3 option, I’m not sure it’s enough to save this thing.</p> <p>On January 30, after some teasing, <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-big-update-free-shooter-future-patch-notes-wildlight-2000664584"><em>Highguard’s</em> devs announced a new 5v5 mode</a> was being added to the game immediately following fan feedback that the original 3v3 mode wasn’t exciting enough. At the time, <em>Highguard</em> labeled the new option as a “limited time mode.” However, apparently so many players liked it, and the reaction to it was so positive, that the mode is going to stick around permanently alongside the 3v3 mode, which isn’t going away.</p>

 <p>“You’ve been asking, and we’re happy to share—5v5 Raid Mode is here to stay,” <a href="https://x.com/PlayHighguard/status/2018459289933787412?s=20">posted <em>Highguard’s</em> official Twitter account.</a> “We appreciate everyone hopping in over the weekend to give the mode a try. We saw a fairly even split between 3v3 and 5v5, which helped inform our decision.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">You've been asking, and we're happy to share—5v5 Raid Mode is here to stay! ⚔</p> <p>We appreciate everyone hopping in over the weekend to give the mode a try. We saw a fairly even split between 3v3 and 5v5, which helped inform our decision. <a href="https://t.co/S0QfgCE7vK">pic.twitter.com/S0QfgCE7vK</a></p> <p>— Highguard | LIVE NOW! (@PlayHighguard) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayHighguard/status/2018459289933787412?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 2, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Credit to developers Wildlight Entertainment for implementing a 5v5 mode into <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguards-patch-note-fov-ps5-crash-pc-optimization-2000664201"><em>Highguard</em> </a>so shortly after the game’s January 26 launch. And after playing a few 5v5 matches over the last few days, I do think it’s a better version of the game. In my experience, having more players on the map has led to more frequent firefights before the shieldbreaker fully spawns. It also makes raids bigger and more chaotic. It did cause some performance issues during those fights that involved most or all of the players, something Wildlight warned could be an issue. Hopefully, performance can be improved in 5v5 matches because it’s easily the best way to play <em>Highguard</em> and likely should have been the primary mode the game launched with last month.</p>

 <p>All that said, <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-the-kotaku-review-is-it-good-free-ps5-pc-5v5-3v3-update-patch-2000664646">I’m not sitting here suggesting <em>Highguard</em></a> is suddenly a great game now. A lot of <em>Highguard’s</em> issues aren’t solved by adding more players. There are still too many competing mechanics causing issues, the visuals are bland, heroes are dull, combat seems too sweaty for more casual players, and collecting loot isn’t much fun. 5v5 doesn’t change that, even if it does make the game more fun to play.</p>

 <p>I suspect this 5v5 mode will be enough to help <em>Highguard</em> escape <em>Concord’s</em> fate and let it stick around for a few more weeks at least. Beyond that, I’m not sure. I’m not convinced the world needed another online-only team-based PVP hero shooter, even if it now supports 10 players in a match.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new actual play live show is making the rounds. <a href="https://www.glasscannonnetwork.com/tour" rel="nofollow">Glass Cannon Network are selling tickets for Call of Cthulhu Live</a>, a live show that blends improvised storytelling, live performances, and the distinct, Lovecraftian cosmic horror associated with the franchise.</p><h2>The Call of Cthulhu Live Announcement</h2><p>According to an official press release, Call of Cthulhu Live features a fresh approach to the live experience. The show will be a national tour, featuring special guests like Keeper Troy Levallee and players Joe O' Brien, Skid Maher, Matthew Capodicasa, Jared Logan, Ross Bryant, Rob Kerkovich, Sydney Amanuel, Noura Ibrahim, Mary Lou, and more.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The fresh spin on the material is that each show will feature a standalone investigation. Cast members and special guests will vary from show to show, ensuring that every experience at each venue is different. The closest comparison is another live play, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dropout-announces-vod-dates-for-their-actual-play-live-show-dimension20-time-quangle" rel="nofollow">Dimension 20 Time Quangle</a>, except that show had the same cast playing different characters across different settings.</p><p>This structure is in keeping with Chaosium's <em>Call of Cthulhu</em> RPG. Based off the work of H. P. Lovecraft, the stories involve investigators uncovering the presence of supernatural forces beyond mortal understanding. The RPG is a tabletop staple, debuting in 1981. The game, currently on its seventh edition, stands alongside older peers like Cyberpunk and Dungeons &amp; Dragons.</p><p>In keeping with the source material, investigations usually end badly in <em>Call of Cthulhu</em>. Investigators either die or go irreversibly mad from the cursed knowledge they learn by the end. Because of this, investigations are usually self-contained affairs, lending themselves an episodic story structure. A fact to which Call of Cthulhu Live appears to be taking advantage.</p><p>If you are unable to physically attend the shows, the Los Angeles performance of Call of Cthulhu Live will be livestreamed, with digital tickets on sale for that show. It is unclear at this time if this show will appear on VOD.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/stardew-valleys-1-7-update-marriage-map-editor-children-2000665425</link>
            <guid>1424494</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Stardew Valley</span></i><span> is on the verge of turning 10, but it’s not slowing down any time soon. While developer Eric “ConcernedApe” Barone previously stated he was shifting away from development on </span><i><span>Stardew </span></i><span>to work on his next game, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/haunted-chocolatier-stardew-valley-abandoned-release-date-2000664261"><i><span>Haunted Chocolatier</span></i></a><span>, he’s now doubling down on </span><i><span>Stardew Valley </span></i><span>with news about an upcoming update.</span></p> <p><span>In </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-turns-10-the-big-concernedape-interview"><span>a massive interview with </span><i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span> published on Tuesday, Barone revealed some exciting details about the game’s 1.7 update. Possibly most importantly, he revealed that he’s adding two more marriage candidates, though just who they are will remain under wraps until the game’s tenth anniversary on February 26. He also teased long-awaited improvements to the game’s children, which are considered notoriously boring by…most of the game’s players.</span></p>

 <p><span>Other features possibly headed to 1.7 include a farm map editor, which would allow players to build their own maps instead of using the game’s presets. He even raised the idea of adding a social feature to let players share their map designs, which he tied to a staunch refusal of generative AI: “I’m interested in ways to make the game more just infinitely replayable without the use of AI. That’s never going to happen.”</span></p> <p><span>Barone has been occasionally teasing 1.7 since September, but prior to Tuesday, he’s only </span><a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/2001186320765583409?s=20"><span>vaguely hinted</span></a><span> at “new character/social stuff” as well as the update’s obligatory new farm type.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Aside from 1.7, he also said he’d consider developing </span><i><span>Stardew Valley 2 </span></i><span>(and even started work on a sequel at one point but seemingly abandoned it). “In fact, I would love to because it would be fun to work on a whole new set of characters, a whole new world, maybe capture some of that original energy that I had back in 2012,” he said.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Chocolate Versus Countryside&nbsp;</b></h2> <p><span>While Barone clearly has big plans for </span><i><span>Stardew Valley</span></i><span>, he’s also spent the past few weeks opening up about the struggle to balance new </span><i><span>Stardew </span></i><span>content with work on </span><i><span>Haunted Chocolatier</span></i><span>. In </span><a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/2026/01/28/update-im-still-working-like-always/"><span>a blog post late last month</span></a><span>, he revealed he feels that he “shouldn’t have announced the game so early.”</span></p> <p><span>Barone has seemingly flipped between development on the two games quite a bit. Initially, </span><i><span>Stardew</span></i><span> wasn’t even supposed to receive a 1.7 update—in 2025, Barone assured us that he was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stardew-valley-concerenedape-haunted-chocolatier-update-1851778392"><span>“committed to not working on </span><i><span>Stardew Valley </span></i><span>until I’m done with </span><i><span>Haunted Chocolatier</span></i><span>.”</span></a><span> In this latest interview, though, he said that he’s still working on both and has even expanded his team in order to delegate work on </span><i><span>Stardew </span></i><span>updates. While he admitted “the progress isn’t as fast as I would like,” he stated he feels he’s able to take his sweet time on </span><i><span>Haunted Chocolatier</span></i><span> thanks to its lack of preorders and crowdfunding.</span></p>

 <p><span>In the meantime, </span><i><span>Stardew’s </span></i><span>1.7 should tide us over. I’m especially intrigued by the promise of new marriage candidates. Is he adding entirely new characters to the game? Does the addition of exactly two candidates imply that there was some big, juicy divorce in town? We’ll have to wait until the game’s anniversary rolls around on February 26 to find out.</span></p>

There are plenty of rumors going around regarding what will be shown during the February 4, 10 a.m. PT / 1 p.m. ET show, as players look forward to seeing what comes after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/overwatch-2"><u>Overwatch 2</u></a> Season 20: Vendetta.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/03/overwatch-talon-1-1770145039517.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/03/overwatch-talon-2-1770145042777.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Overwatch Taken Over by Talon. Image captured in-game by IGN.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As of last week, however, there is one big question on everyone’s mind: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1qp1ex6/yall_got_this_email_too/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Why did Talon take control of Overwatch</u></a>? Blizzard issued a hostile takeover hotfix last week, changing all iconography from the familiar Overwatch logo to that of the in-universe antagonist faction, Talon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been an unexpected, unexplained villain arc that’s continued through to today, with even official social media accounts affected by the changes. With confusion in the air, it would be strange if Blizzard <em>didn’t </em>talk about Talon during tomorrow’s showcase, so we’re hoping to find out what role it might play in Season 21.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Overwatch Spotlight is a shared moment with our community, for our community,” a recent <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24250387/step-into-the-spotlight/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>blog post</u></a> from the Overwatch team says. “A chance to see where the game is headed, hear directly from the team, and step into the next chapter side by side.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, several clues have the community expecting a more fundamental change for Overwatch 2. Specifically, fans across the internet believe this so-called “next chapter” will see the number 2 dropped from the Overwatch title altogether.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speculation began when Blizzard announced the event last week, as audiences noticed the Overwatch logo featured on official artwork was missing its 2. It’s led many to assume the first-person live-service game could either soon drop the number, or that tomorrow’s showcase should cover information outside of Overwatch 2 itself. Theories for the former started to hold more weight when players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1qro4n1/overwatch_2_invasion_bundle_renamed_to_overwatch/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>seemed to find evidence</u></a> suggesting its story-centered Invasion Bundle had dropped the two from its name, as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The hero shooter, which first launched in 2016 and will celebrate its 10-year anniversary this year, went through a major revamp in October 2022 that saw it transformed into Overwatch 2. It gained three new heroes – Sojourn, Kiriko, and Junker Queen – a visual overhaul, gameplay changes across its dozens of heroes, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-becomes-worst-user-reviewed-game-on-steam-ever-even-as-tens-of-thousands-turn-up-to-play"><u>a lot of hate</u></a>, as players criticized <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-offering-double-xp-and-free-skin-as-apology-for-rough-launch"><u>its unstable launch</u></a> and the controversial adjustments to its monetization strategy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of the more problematic changes have been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-reveals-radical-overhaul-of-overwatch-2-including-return-of-loot-boxes-perks-and-third-person-mode"><u>reverted or altered</u></a> in the years since launch, with 6v6 queue options, additional heroes, map adjustments, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/some-overwatch-fans-are-thrilled-loot-boxes-are-coming-back-some-not-so-much"><u>even loot boxes</u></a> all added within the past year alone. It’s resulted in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-becoming-the-worst-user-reviewed-game-ever-on-steam-overwatch-2s-recent-reviews-jump-to-mixed"><u>a small resurgence</u></a> for the game, as players turn up as Blizzard attempts to steer toward a brighter tomorrow.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another talking point players are hoping to see brought up includes what could be in store for next Season, such as potentially new maps, another collaboration or crossover, Perk reworks, and a theme. Fans are also hoping to see what its next hero may look like after Vendetta was added in Season 20, though the Overwatch team typically launches just one hero every other season, so we may have a slightly longer wait in that regard.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last time the studio put hype like this behind a showcase was last year’s February event, suggesting that whatever the developers have planned for tomorrow will likely be huge. Like the 2025 Spotlight, Blizzard has parternered with a<a href="https://x.com/PlayOverwatch/status/2018469470692360432?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> long list of some of the biggest streamers</a> for this year's show.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, you can see how the inclusion of the latest major mode addition, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-keeps-its-fans-in-the-loop-with-overwatch-2-stadium-summer-roadmap"><u>Stadium</u></a>, had Overwatch players <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-years-of-struggle-blizzard-has-found-itself-in-uncharted-territory-overwatch-players-are-having-fun-again"><u>having fun for the first time in a long time</u></a>.

<figure data-uuid="5cce4b9bd2ec7"><a title="Stardew Valley Sebastian" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5cce4b9bd2ec7/stardew-valley-sebastian.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: ConcernedApe</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/stardew-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Stardew Valley</a> celebrates its 10th anniversary later this month. Yes, really. On 26th February 2026, ConcernedApe's monumental farming sim will turn a decade old. It came to Switch in 2017 and, in the time since it's release, has sold millions of copies and has consistently received a number of big free updates, with the next one — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/stardew-valley-creator-announces-version-1-7-update">update 1.7</a> — on the horizons.</p>
<p>And, speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-turns-10-the-big-concernedape-interview">IGN</a> ahead of the game's big birthday, Eric 'ConcernedApe' Barone gave us a little tease of what to expect from the upcoming update, and they're related to children and marriage.</p><div><figure data-videoid="r3KMxc-vq0o" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r3KMxc-vq0o?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytr3KMxc-vq0o" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/r3KMxc-vq0o?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r3KMxc-vq0o?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed35e359lvznut&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Barone admitted he's "trying to not reveal too much because I like for it to be a surprise", but allowed himself to slip in a few little details into the chat: "Well, there is a popular fan request, which has to do with the children, trying to make the children a little more interesting."</p>
<p>Right now, children don't really have a function in the game — they're key to getting the Full House achievement, and you get some extra dialogue with your spouse, but that's about it. Perhaps we'll be able to talk to them more or maybe they can help on the farm when they're old enough. Who knows!</p>
<p>But long-time fans will also be excited to know that Barone is going to be "adding two more marriage candidates, but I'll reveal who it is on the anniversary day." There are currently 12 marriage candidates in-game, so this will bring up the list of eligible bachelors to 14. And of course, there are no gender restrictions here, either.</p>

<p>Of course, those aren't the only two things coming with update 1.7, which Barone also teases: "...there's a lot of other things in the update as well that no one's really asked for, but I think people will appreciate it."</p>
<p>Sounds like we'll find out a little bit more — at least on the marriage candidates — on 26th February, then! Perhaps we'll get an update on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/psa-stardew-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition-update-and-european-release-on-the-way">Switch 2 Edition patch and European release</a>, too.</p>
<p>Make sure you give <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-turns-10-the-big-concernedape-interview">the full interview a read</a> for some lovely little tidbits about Barone's time developing the game, including how he comes up with ideas, his love of David Lynch, and the fact there's still a secret no one has discovered in-game.</p>
<p>Barone also mentions his next game, <strong>Haunted Chocolatier</strong>, which last week <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/i-am-not-going-to-abandon-haunted-chocolatier-concernedape-responds-to-fan-concerns">he had to calm fears about 'abandoning"</a> due to the long development time.</p>

			<p>The meteoric rise and sustained success of <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/arc-raiders-everything-we-know-about-the-latest-hot-extraction-shooter/"><strong>Embark Studio's</strong> new third-person extraction shooter</a>, <strong>ARC Raiders</strong>, will be one for the history books of the video game industry if things keep going the way they are currently going. A new report from <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/arc-raiders-was-once-again-steams">Alinea Analytics</a> claims that for <strong>the third consecutive month</strong>, ARC Raiders was the number one selling title across <strong>Steam, PlayStation</strong>, and <strong>Xbox</strong>.</p>



<p>That month was, of course, <strong>January 2026</strong>, during which Alinea Analytics says ARC Raiders sold an additional <strong>1.5 million copies</strong> just on Steam. On PlayStation and Xbox, it combined for an additional <strong>1.7 million copies sold</strong>, bringing the game's total lifetime sales to an estimated <strong>15 million copies sold</strong> across all platforms, generating an estimated <strong>$500 million in revenue</strong>, according to Alinea Analytics.</p>



<p>The game even hit a new record for monthly active users (MAU), reaching <strong>10 million MAUs</strong> in January, an increase of <strong>8%</strong> compared to December, <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-estimated-to-have-sold-12-million-copies/">which itself saw a record-high daily active users (DAU) count of <strong>3.2 million players</strong></a> across all platforms.</p>

<p>When ARC Raiders arrived at the end of October 2025, <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-sold-2-5-million-copies-in-debut-week/">it sold <strong>2.5 million copies</strong> in its debut week</a>. Less than a week later, it had sold <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-has-sold-4-million-units-nexons-most-successful-global-launch/">over 4 million copies</a></strong> and even hit concurrent player counts of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-continues-strong-launch-hits-700k-concurrent-players/">over 700K players on Steam</a></strong>. A few weeks later, it had eclipsed <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-reportedly-best-selling-game-on-steam-november-2025/">7.7 million copies sold</a></strong>, and despite it only being out for the last two months of the year, Google's yearly review <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-was-2025-most-searched-videogame-on-google-gta-vi-only-7th/">declared it to be the most-searched video game of 2025</a>.</p>



<p>All of this happened amidst Embark Studios being <a href="https://wccftech.com/nexon-ceo-claims-we-should-assume-every-game-company-now-using-ai-game-devs-say-no/">under fire for its use of <strong>GenAI</strong></a>, as Embark is not afraid <a href="https://wccftech.com/people-have-to-take-step-back-understand-ai-can-be-big-help-developers-benefit-players-says-arc-raiders-boss/">to say with its chest that it will continue to use GenAI tech</a> as it sees fit, and dealing with heavy competition in the shooter genre from other standout hits from 2025, namely, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-schedule-i-hollow-knight-silksong-battlefield-6-steam-best-selling-new-games-2025/">Battlefield 6</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Of course, the question now is whether ARC Raiders will be able to seriously maintain this level of success and player engagement. As 2026 continues to roll on, the bigger releases set for the year, both ones we know about and ones we don't yet know about, could be what eventually causes players to move away from the game. </p>



<p>That said, it doesn't look like its community is going anywhere, considering the fact that since it launched on Steam, it has only fallen below <strong>100K</strong> concurrent players <strong><a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/#48h">once at the time of this writing.</a></strong></p>

              <p><i><span>Magic: The Gathering </span></i><span>is coming for my throat again with a new </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i></a> <span>Secret Lair drop that includes cards featuring party members like Gale and Shadowheart.</span></p> <p><a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/secret-lair-roll-for-initiative-superdrop"><span>The </span><i><span>Magic </span></i><span>x </span><i><span>Dungeons &amp; Dragons </span></i><span>“Roll For Initiative” drop</span></a><span> isn’t just </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3 </span></i><span>characters, but Gale and Shadowheart are getting five cards each alongside several other more general </span><i><span>D&amp;D</span></i><span> characters in a seven-part super drop with a total of around 30 new cards.</span></p> <p><span>The cards will go on sale on February 9 at 9 a.m. Pacific, but the Shadowheart and Gale sets are the major draw. The two join Karlach and Astarion as </span><i><span>BG3</span></i><span> characters who have previously been part of Secret Lair. Because I am a clown, I will be in the queue for the Gale cards, though I am flabbergasted they have a card from </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-sex-scene-romance-intimacy-halsin-gale-1850865892"><span>his astral projection sex scene</span></a><span> from the game. Thank you, Wizards of the Coast. “Why confine ourselves to the pleasures of mortal flesh?” it reads underneath an image of Gale naked and gazing lovingly into the camera. Crazy.</span></p>

I’m sure people who actually care about this game are annoyed it’s becoming </span><i><span>Fortnite: The Card Game</span></i><span> with all its crossovers, but to me they are just pretty pieces of cardboard with characters I like.</span></p>
