<figure><a title="Silksong / Lone Fungus" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d620621c38f20/silksong-lone-fungus.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>After an exceptionally long wait, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> is out now on the Switch and Switch 2, and perhaps one of the most pleasantly surprising aspects of its launch is its price.</p>
<p>You're looking at <strong>$19.99 / £16.75 / €19.99 / ¥2300</strong> for the new release which, given the sheer length of its development and presumptions around its runtime, seems very reasonable indeed. Some folks, however, think that Team Cherry has legitimately priced the game too low, and therefore may be distorting players' expectations regarding what a $20 game should look like (thanks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-hollow-knight-silksongs-cheap-price-a-problem-for-other-indie-games-devs-and-publishers-weigh-up-its-impact">Eurogamer</a>).</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067nrjzmo&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>First up is BastiArtGames, the solo-developer of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/lone_fungus">Lone Fungus</a>, who took to <a href="https://x.com/BastiArtGames/status/1962412246039953783">X</a> and asked what its sequel, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2463220/Lone_Fungus_Melody_of_Spores/">Lone Fungus: Melody of Spores</a>, should be priced at now that Silksong has launched. The game was originally targeting a price of $20, which the developer had considered fair, but is now questioning whether it should be lowered to undercut Silksong.</p>

<p>Similarly, RJ Lake, who is directing the upcoming rhythm game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2240620/UNBEATABLE/">Unbeatable</a>, posted a thread stating that while he is pleased that Silksong is so cheap, it could have severe ramifications on how players perceive the value of games, stating that "'The Gamer' is a creature very bad at knowing why things cost what they do".</p>

<p>Developer Toukana, who worked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dorfromantik">Dorfromantik</a> and is now about to release <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2719750/Star_Birds/">Star Birds</a>, told Eurogamer that the latter's price has also been affected following the game's short delay from 4th September to 10th September:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Yes, Silksong's price has influenced our decision. We're trying not to compete too directly with Silksong, both in terms of release date and pricing. Of course, these are two very different games with potentially different player bases, but there's definitely some overlap. That makes things tricky, especially since Star Birds is a joint project between two studios, together employing more people than Team Cherry."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's an interesting situation, to be sure, but we also think a significant jump in price from the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a> to Hollow Knight: Silksong would have almost certainly ruffled a few feathers. Given the anticipation around the game along with how few people were involved in its development, we reckon Team Cherry probably made the correct decision regarding price.</p>

<p><em>But what do you think, dear readers? Is Silksong priced appropriately, or do you think Team Cherry could have gotten away with pricing it higher? Let us know with a comment.</em></p></section>

			<p>Although you will often have to fight the mutated creatures known as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/cronos-the-new-dawn-how-to-defeat-armored-tier-3-orphans/">Orphans</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/cronos-the-new-dawn/">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> isn't all about combat. In true survival-horror fashion, the game also features various puzzles that will test your knowledge of the mechanics in puzzle-solving as much as in combat.</p>



<p>While making your way towards your target a few hours into the game, you will get to explore the <strong>Hardware Store</strong>, a once-thriving store destroyed by the effects of the Change plague, just like humanity seems to have been. Inside this location, which is easy to spot thanks to signs nearby, you will find a few items you will very much need to stay alive, but this isn't why this store is so important, as you will have to explore it fully to obtain a<strong> critical item needed to proceed in the main mission.</strong></p>



<p>After looking around inside a bit, you will notice that there's a door leading into some office that cannot be opened with keys or any other item. In reality, the door is blocked by Biomass, which you will have to get rid of to proceed. Doing so isn't as straightforward as it sounds, as the Biomass is located inside the office, and thus has to be <strong>burned from inside the room you need to get into.</strong></p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The location of the gas can in the Cronos: The New Dawn Hardware Store</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>From the blocked door, if you head to the right and then to the left, you will find on your left again a window with a broken panel, allowing you to look inside, and more importantly, to shoot inside. <strong>Locate the gas can </strong>inside using the screenshot above as a guide, shoot it with your handgun and you will set the Biomass on fire, allowing you to finally open the door and enter the room. Inside, you will find the <strong>Bolt Cutter</strong> item you can use to open up the other locked door in the Hardware Store, as well as plenty of <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/cronos-the-new-dawn-should-you-bring-the-bolt-cutter-with-you/">other doors found all over New Dawn.</a></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/devolver-digital">Devolver Digital</a> co-founder Nigel Lowrie believes that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> could potentially be the first "AAAAA game".</p>
<p>Lowrie <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-hollow-knight-silksong-is-this-years-gta-6-and-whether-a-juggernaut-stomping-on-your-release-date-really-matters">spoke with IGN</a> on the topic of video game delays in the wake of massive releases like GTA 6 and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. Yet even as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksongs-release-date-causes-delays-for-more-games-than-you-might-think">games shifted release due to Silksong</a>, Lowrie stated GTA 6 will be an industry-shaking event on a bigger scale.</p>
<p>"There are AAA games and then there's AAAA games and I'd argue that Grand Theft Auto is potentially the AAAAA game," stated Lowrie. "It's just bigger than anything else both in the scope and scale of the game and the kind of cultural impact that it has and the attention it demands."</p>

<p>Adam Lieb - CEO of video game marketing platform Gamesight - echoed similar sentiments in the piece, noting: "I would say that GTA for the last year and a half has been a part of almost every conversation around launch dates I have heard."</p><p>Lowrie is correct, of course. GTA 6 is positioned to be a truly monumental release, one that threatens to overshadow not just other games coming out in 2026 but prior releases throughout the history of the industry. The term AAAAA is apt to describe such a monster, though given <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-boss-says-70-skull-and-bones-is-a-quadruple-a-live-service-game">gaming's official first quadruple A game</a> Skull &amp; Bones was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skull-and-bones-review">truly a game like no other</a>, GTA 6 has a big task ahead of it.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/how-to/cronos-the-new-dawn-whats-the-passcode-for-the-storeroom-lock/</link>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/cronos-the-new-dawn/">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> is a survival horror game inspired by some of the series that defined the genre like the Resident Evil and Dead Space, featuring almost every mechanic these series have introduced in the past years, such as limited resources, challenging fights against even the weakest of enemies, and <strong>locked doors that require The Traveler to locate keys and learn passcodes.</strong></p>



<p>During her journey, The Traveler will encounter the first locked door not long before awakening and heading towards her first target. This door is impossible to miss as it is right in your path, but you won't be able to open it as soon as you reach the storeroom, as you will need to input a passcode you have no way of knowing at this point.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The very first locked door you will encounter in Cronos: The New Dawn.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>If you ignore this locked door and proceed in your mission by following the waymarker, you will have to climb down some stairs and reach another big room where you will find some items and a rather<strong> unusual object you can interact with</strong>. This object actually stores a Travelog from another Travel, who will inform you the door in the room above can be opened by inputting the <strong>367</strong> code.</p>



<p>Although opening this door is not required to proceed in the main mission, you will want to backtrack a little to open it up and get the resources stored within. Cronos: The New Dawn is a little difficult in the first couple of hours, and you will need every help you can get to make it through some challenging fights. Also, consider holding onto the Energy you are gathering to purchase some <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/cronos-the-new-dawn-upgrades-to-get/">critical upgrades</a> that will help you even more during the beginning of the game.</p>

            <p>In case you missed it, a plucky little game no one had heard anything about whatsoever <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-is-out-now-on-steam-our-review-is-on-the-way">arrived yesterday</a>. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. Yeah, I know, it's news to me too. Anyway, what's also news is that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> creator Eric Barone has a voice acting cameo in Skong. Though, he's being all coy about revealing when and where you can hear his dulcet tones.</p>
<p>This came to light because of some valiant folks who've already made it to Silksong's end credits, presumably having pulled mammoth sessions last night, as our own Ollie did to provide you lot with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">some helpful early game walkthroughs</a>. Or, you know, they've gone to the extras bit of the main menu and pressed the button that rolls the credits.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Barone's name is just chilling there in a section dedicated to additional characters voices, which also features Team Cherry marketing and publishing fellow Matthew Griffin. Naturally, the question is where do folks have to go to find Barone's cameo?</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/771772/hollow-knight-silksong-stardew-valley-eric-barone-concernedape">The Verge</a>, who reached out to ConcernedApe LLC's head of operations Cole Medeiros, neither he nor Barone would just come out and say where the cameo is, despite confirming it is indeed <em>that</em> Eric Barone. Medeiros told the site that the Stardew and and also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier</a> dev would "rather not say which character(s) so as not to spoil any surprises for anyone".</p>

<p>A new season in Marvel Rivals is right around the corner with Season 4, Heart of the Dragon, poised to land, alongside the latest balance changes with a host of buffs and nerfs.</p>



<p>Releasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-marvel-rivals-season-4-release-exact-release-date-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 12</a>, Season 4 of Marvel Rivals has some big additions, including a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-4-trailer-confirms-ps4-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release on PlayStation 4</a>, a new character, new maps, and plenty more.</p>



<p>Balance changes are just as important as any new content, however, and we’ve got all the details on the buffs and nerfs in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-4-early-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 4</a>.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Changes are afoot. Image via NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As is customary at the start of a new season, a huge number of balance changes are being made in Marvel Rivals, with buffs and nerfs to several heroes.</strong></p>



<p>In the Vanguard department, <strong>Peni Parker </strong>and <strong>Thor </strong>receive boosts to their Ultimate abilities, while <strong>Doctor Strange </strong>has increased damage output. On the flip side, <strong>Captain America </strong>and <strong>Emma Frost </strong>have both been nerfed, having dominated throughout Season 3.</p>



<p>Duelists receiving a boost in the patch are <strong>Scarlet Witch, Blade, </strong>and <strong>Moon Knight, </strong>with Blade still finding his feet following an introduction in Season 3.5, while Scarlet Witch and Moon Knight have seen their effectiveness drop off. Counteracting that are nerfs to <strong>Squirrel Girl</strong>, <strong>Black Panther</strong>, and <strong>Psylocke</strong>, while <strong>Magik </strong>has a bunch of changes following the removal of the Dimensional Shortcut Team-Up ability.</p>



<p>Finally, <strong>Invisible Woman, Jeff the Land Shark, </strong>and <strong>Ultron </strong>are receiving boosts, while <strong>Luna Snow </strong>is having the duration of her Ultimate ability reduced, and <strong>Loki </strong>is also affected by nerfs.</p>



<p>Here’s a full list of all the characters affected with buffs and nerfs.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-take-some-cues-sapkowski-latest-book/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-witcher-iv-will-take-some-cues-from-sapkowski%E2%80%99s-latest-book.1289598/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier this year, during Epic's State of Unreal presentation, we were <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-new-trailer-ps5-60-fps-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">treated to a stunning The Witcher IV tech demo</a> that served as a preview of the level of graphics fidelity CD Projekt RED aims for with the final game. Such a great demo excited the franchise's millions of fans in anticipation of the day they'll get to play it.</p>



<p>There's still a long way before the game's launch, though. While development has been going at full speed (and with more developers than ever, 444 at the last count), CD Projekt RED has confirmed that The Witcher IV won't release before 2027. In the meantime, fans are starving for tidbits, and one such thing was provided this week <a href="https://x.com/PhiWeber/status/1962953933871042847" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via X</a> by Narrative Director (previously Quest Designer on The Witcher III: Wild Hunt and Cyberpunk 2077) Philipp Weber. After sharing a picture of <a href="https://amzn.to/46m9C0h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crossroads of Ravens</a>, the latest book written by saga creator Andrzej Sapkowski (out on September 30 in English), a fellow user asked whether any of the book's points would be taken from this new book into The Witcher IV. This was Weber's response:</p>



<p><em>I can't reveal how exactly we'll do it, but Season of Storms also came out while we developed The Witcher 3, so we still tried to include some of the new elements. You can expect something similar!</em></p>



<p>Granted, Crossroads of Ravens is a prequel book. So was Season of Storms, but Crossroads of Ravens is the earliest book in the timeline as far as Geralt's character is concerned. As such, it's hard to imagine CD Projekt RED incorporating more than just a few general ideas into The Witcher IV, which takes place much later in the storyline.</p>



<p>The good news is that CD Projekt RED has long since 'solidified' its relationship with Sapkowski himself. As you may recall, Sapkowski, a self-progressed non-gamer, initially licensed the game rights for a relative pittance. After witnessing the enormous success of the third installment, though, the author eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-author-million-usd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demanded $16 million from the Polish studio</a>, alleging that those rights were only valid for the first game. </p>



<p>A little over a year later, the two parties <a href="https://wccftech.com/cd-projekt-red-solidifies-relationship-with-andrzej-sapkowski-creator-of-witcher/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached a new agreement</a>, which included a 'framework for future cooperation'. As such, it is possible CD Projekt RED may have already picked Sapkowski's mind to ensure their vision for The Witcher IV is in line with the author's.</p>

Fear not, fans of spirit candy! <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-cats-out-of-the-bag-stardew-valley-update-17-revealed-bagged-cat-content-tbc">The recent announcement of Stardew Valley 1.7 update</a> is not evidence that Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone's next game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier</a> has been banished to the realm of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-favourite-videogame-vapourware-no-silksong-allowed-edition">vapourware</a> - or so sayeth Barone himself, at least. In a brief and caveat-strewn Q&amp;A, the life sim creator has gone into more depth about development on Stardew, revealing that he's not as heavily involved with it as with previous updates. As such, he's still focussing "the vast majority" of his attention on Haunted Chocolatier.</p>
<p>It's even possible that the latter will release before <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>'s next update, but let's not count our Cocoa Loco Little Choc Chicks (£6.99 minus delivery costs) before they've hatched.
</p><!--more-->
<p>

"Recently, I announced that there will be another major content update for Stardew Valley -- the 1.7 update," <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/2025/09/02/on-the-recent-stardew-valley-1-7-update-announcement/">writes Barone on his blog</a>. "You might be wondering: If ConcernedApe is working on Stardew Valley 1.7, will that cause Haunted Chocolatier to take longer? The answer: Maybe a little, but not as much as you might think."
</p>
<p>

Barone goes onto explain that he's been working with a small team on Stardew Valley additions and fixes since update 1.3 - he's still "completely solo" on Haunted Chocolatier "for the time being". 
</p>
<p>
While he was "fully, personally locked-in on content development" for previous Stardew updates, Barone says that with update 1.7, "I have been trying to take more of a "creative director" role in the team, so that (at least for now) I can focus the vast majority of my attention on Haunted Chocolatier." 
</p><p>
"So far, it's been pretty good... we are working at a relaxed pace, we have a ton of ideas, and everything has been high quality," Barone continues. "Eventually, I will have to spend a little more time focused on Stardew Valley, because in order for me to maintain a full connection to the game, I need my hand to touch every piece of new content. And there are some aspects of content development which I insist on doing myself, like the music. 
</p>
<p>
"But with our "no release date" approach to the 1.7 update, it's not certain when that time will come. It might even be after Haunted Chocolatier comes out. (no guarantees though)".
</p>
<p>
Barone adds that "the reality of my life is that I have a very popular 1st game that I still want to take care of, which means that my 2nd game might take a little longer". Stardew Valley's audience is "still growing", he notes, and "it's hard to just stop improving it when there are still things that can be improved. But I hope the approach I am taking for Stardew Valley 1.7 will help keep Haunted Chocolatier on track."
</p>
<p>
Stardewman remains tight-lipped as to what update 1.7 might involve. We don't know a whole caboodle about Haunted Chocolatier, either, other than that it's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/haunted-chocolatier-is-the-stardew-valleys-developers-next-rpg">more of an action-RPG than Stardew Valley</a>, and sees you staffing a chocolate shop with ghosts.</p><p>Let me laboriously do some Audience Engagement and ask: what kind of chocolate would you be <em>least</em> surprised to discover is made by ghosts? I've always found hazelnut truffles a bit sinister. I find that they mysteriously make me fatter - clear indications of paranormal activity.

Will it actually accomplish that goal? Who knows. Paramount boss David Ellison said the company hopes to take a few cues from other storming blockbusters like Top Gun: Maverick. It's a good start, but the proof will be in the pudding.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/what-keywords-subsidiary-high-voltage-games-learned-making-an-original-game" target="_self" data-discover="true">Dragon Front Adventures shows 'support studios' can win big with original projects</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Game developers want to raise $200,000 for Palestine through new charity bundle"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/pc/devs-unite-to-raise-over-200-000-for-palestinians-in-need-through-new-charity-bundle">Game developers want to raise $200,000 for Palestine through new charity bundle</a>&nbsp;</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">A chorus of game developers have rallied together to launch a new charity bundle in a bid to raise $200,000 for Palestinians in need.

It has raised over $32,000 at the time of writing, but there's always room for more.

Word on the street is that developers at both Crystal Dynamics and The Initiative were given a chance to salvage the title by seeking a new funding partner. Yet, despite talks initially progressing with a range of suitors including Grand Theft Auto owner Take-Two Interactive, disagreements regarding who would take ownership of the franchise seemingly created an impasse. The end result? More people out of work.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/wildgate-and-sunderfolk-publisher-dreamhaven-is-making-layoffs" target="_self" data-discover="true">Wildgate and Sunderfolk developer-publisher Dreamhaven is making layoffs</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Former Polygon staffers establish independent video game website Rogue"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/polygon-staffers-reunite-to-establish-independent-video-game-website-rogue">Former Polygon staffers establish independent video game website Rogue</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Video game journalists, much like developers, have been subject to a debilitating deluge of layoffs of late.

The solution for many has been to shun corporate ownership entirely and kickstart independent publications. Enter Rogue, a new worker-owned outlet established by seven former Polygon staffers. The website was formed in partnership with Rascal and will dish out news, guides, interviews, and more. Some articles (including most news and guides) will be free, while other content will be locked behind a subscription. The upshot of that reader-supported model, according to the founding team, is that advertisements and sponsored articles will be consigned to history.

<p>Barone's name was spotted in Silksong's credits, which you can access from the Extras part of the main menu.

<p>But! Neither Mereidos nor Barone will confirm who Barone voices in Silksong. Medeiros said Barone would rather not say so as not to spoil anything. Barone could potentially be any of the weird and wonderful characters you bump into along the way.</p>

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> has already surpassed half a million concurrent players on Steam mere hours after its launch.
</p>
<p>
After years of hype, Team Cherry's bug-filled Metroidvania finally released yesterday. On Steam, Silksong was the most wishlisted game on the charts and that's now converted to a huge number of players.
</p>
<p>
At the time of writing, Silksong has an all-time peak of 535,213 players. That's already the eighteenth highest all-time peak of concurrent players ever, beaten only by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> in terms of games released this year.

<p>
And that player count will only increase over the weekend once more players download the game and get stuck in.
</p>
<p>
What's more, this is just Steam. Silksong is also available across both Switch consoles, PlayStation, and Xbox, as well as on Xbox Game Pass, so there are plenty more people playing the game across all platforms.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silksong-causes-server-chaos-on-xbox-steam-and-nintendo-as-platforms-grind-to-a-halt">surge of players downloading Silksong immediately caused server chaos across almost every platform</a>.
</p>
<p>
It's clear Silksong is proving to be an exceedingly popular release - but does it live up to the hype? We'll have a full review in the near future.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fresh-nioh-3-gameplay-shows-off-new-boss-fight.1289547/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>IGN has published <span>exclusive new boss fight gameplay captured from Nioh 3. The third installment in KOEI TECMO's action RPG series was&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-announced-with-action-packed-trailer-launches-in-early-2026-on-playstation-5/" target="_blank">announced</a>&nbsp;around three months ago during Sony's June State of Play presentation. It</span> is already relatively close to release, being scheduled to launch in early 2026.</p>



<p>Unlike the prior two games, which debuted as PlayStation exclusives for a few months, Nioh 3 will launch right away on PC, too. The game even already has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3681010/Nioh_3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Steam page</a>, although it doesn't list the PC system requirements yet.</p>



<p>Compared to its predecessors, which featured fairly linear environments, this new entry will offer players an open world-style map to explore. Another significant change will be the ability to switch at any time between the Samurai and Ninja fighting styles. According to the developers, the Samurai style offers a gameplay experience similar to previous Nioh titles, though new actions have been added, such as Arts Proficiency, which enhances the power of martial arts, and Deflect, which allows players to block enemy attacks at the last moment. These new actions help create intense and deadly face-to-face confrontations.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the Ninja style excels in quick movements like dodging and aerial actions. This gives ninjas the advantage of attacking from outside the enemy’s range by utilizing various "Ninjitsu" techniques according to the situation on the battlefield. Players can use techniques such as Mist, which leaves a clone after an attack, and Evade, which allows players to narrowly avoid enemy strikes. These techniques help players outmaneuver foes while delivering devastating speed attacks from behind.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Fans already got their hands on Nioh 3 thanks to the limited-time Alpha demo that KOEI TECMO released back in June. The demo was also useful for developer Team Ninja to gauge player satisfaction in the game's various areas. According to the Alpha report <a href="https://teamninja-studio.com/nioh3/us/feedback.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published on the official website</a>, these are some of the improvements that the team is working on for the final game:</p>



<ul>
<li>Improve controls in response to high demand from players.</li>



<li>Improve problem areas in control responsiveness.</li>



<li>Make controls more customizable by adding options.</li>



<li>Adjust gimmicks and enemies that were unreasonably difficult.</li>



<li>Add and improve tutorial visibility.</li>



<li>Adjust the performance and balance of various actions.</li>



<li>Improve the overall quality of background graphics.</li>

                <p>The world of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-4/" data-ref-id="5000-179949">The Sims 4</a> is about to get bigger again with the upcoming expansion pack Adventure Awaits. And while tropical getaways and summer camp experiences are the focus of this pack, it's also bringing back imaginary friends from The Sims 3. You can see one of the imaginary friends in the first trailer for Adventure Awaits, as well as an extended glimpse at your Sims vacation options.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS0NxrRJm6I" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aS0NxrRJm6I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Adventure Awaits doesn't just cater to adult sims. Child sims are also given the chance to have formative moments as they discover archery, diving, papercraft, and other camp activities. As for the imaginary friends, they will appear as four different dolls with a handful of personality types: Goofball, creative, competitive, and evil. Picking the evil option seems unnecessarily risky, but it's your Sim life and you get to make all of the bad decisions you want.</p><p>There are three Gibbi Point vacation neighborhoods included in this pack, including Camp Gibbi Gibbi in the Wanderwood Wilds. There are so many camp activities for children and adult sims that the only thing it's missing is Jason Voorhees to menace the camp attendees. The other neighborhoods in the pack are Crystal Valley and Jellyfish Junction.</p><p>Each neighborhood has its own exclusive activities, and adult sims can take up everything from kayaking to fishing for jellyfish. Players also have the option of turning their sims into park workers as either camp counselors or park rangers. If none of those vacation getaways appeal to you, players can build their own custom resorts. EA has also teamed up with Sims custom creators Jeyjeybink, daniellebuilds, Gryphi, KiwiSimsKate, and Axiisims, all of whom created their own unique experiences for fans to sample.</p><p>A gameplay trailer for The Sims 4 Adventure Awaits will debut on September 10. The expansion itself will follow on October 2 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

<p>And it's seemingly got nothing to do with cost</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Star Wars Outlaws" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/878241ef8df8a/star-wars-outlaws.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, released on <strong>4th September 2025</strong>, is the latest in a long line of Switch 2 titles utilising the Game-Key Card physical release.</p>
<p>It's safe to say that most folks are under the assumption that cost is likely the driving factor behind the use of the Game-Key Card medium, with Nintendo supposedly only offering 64GB cartridges to third-party developers.</p>
<p>Over on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cubusaddendum.bsky.social/post/3lxzsvi6s7c2e">Bluesky</a>, however, Rob Bantin, who is the audio architect for Ubisoft's proprietary Snowdrop engine, explained the decision to use Game-Key Cards, and it's seemingly got nothing to do with cost. Instead, it's all to do with the disc streaming required for Outlaws' open world, with Bantin stating that the Switch 2 cartridges simply don't offer the performance needed for Ubisoft to hit its quality target.</p><div><figure data-videoid="6EOKFq0qA_o" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6EOKFq0qA_o?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6EOKFq0qA_o?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6EOKFq0qA_o?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed60cf74tjlxyq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EOKFq0qA_o" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Snowdrop relies heavily on disk streaming for its open world environments, and we found the Switch 2 cards simply didn’t give the performance we needed at the quality target we were going for. I don’t recall the cost of the cards ever entering the discussion - probably because it was moot.</p>
<p>"I think if we’d designed a game for Switch 2 from the ground up it might have been different. As it was, we’d build a game around the SSDs of the initial target platforms, and then the Switch 2 came along a while later. In this case I think our leadership made the right call."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>John Linneman of Digital Foundry empathised with the reasoning, stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Honestly, and this sucks, I do kinda get it. To match other consoles, they needed storage that was fast like a modern SSD, right? The cost on that stuff has not come down like the flash memory used for SW1 games. I think they probably did what they could and, even still, those carts cost $23 a piece."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Naturally, the explanation here likely won't (and can't) be applied to every Switch 2 game released on Game-Key Card. Some of it is probably going to be tied to cost, but it's nice to see a bit more nuance added to the conversation from both Bantin and Linneman.</p>
<p>Regardless of what side of the fence you sit on, it seems Game-Key Cards are here to stay, whether it's down to cost or technical limitations.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-million-seller-day-one/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-became-a-million-seller-on-day-one-says-konami.1289526/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This morning, Japanese developer and publisher KONAMI <a href="https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000001239.000050711.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater became a million seller on the day of its release (Thursday, August 28), according to KONAMI's own search when combining retail and digital sales.</p>



<p>It's a solid start for the remake of 2004's Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, which was originally released as a PlayStation 2 exclusive and subsequently made it to the Nintendo 3DS in 2012.</p>



<p>The port to Unreal Engine 5 was co-developed by Virtuos, the same studio that recently handled the remaster of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. Unfortunately, despite these two big (and rather successful) assignments, Virtuos recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-developer-virtuos-confirms-mass-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suffered significant layoffs of nearly three hundred employees</a>.</p>



<p>Anyway, here's what Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto thought about Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-ps5-review-based-on-a-hideo-kojima-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in his 9.4/10 PS5 review</a>:</p>



<p><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is the de facto perfect way to experience the rise and fall of Big Boss. Each detail has been meticulously refined and brought to modern standards while leaving nothing behind in the past. While this also means retaining both the campiness and jank, there’s no better way to experience the first Metal Gear Solid title in the timeline. Konami has promised (and delivered) a faithful reproduction of Snake Eater, brought forth into a new console generation without deviating from the title it was based on.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fallout is almost an indictment of consumerism and capitalism. It’s bursting at the seams with shady, titanic corporations that almost always had some kind of dubious or deceptive subplot tucked behind the scenes in the run-up to the nuclear war that wiped the United States off the map. </p>



<p>In this list, we’re breaking down the most iconic brands from Fallout, determining which of the many organisations and corporations in the Fallout Universe stand out amongst the crowd.</p>



<h2 id="h-most-recognisable-fallout-brands">Most Recognisable Fallout Brands</h2>



<p>There are quite literally hundreds of brands, labels, organisations, and corporations in Fallout, but which of them can be counted as the most iconic? Here’s our definitive list to settle that debate and give you a little more visibility of the most iconic brands from Fallout.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-nuka-cola">1. Nuka-Cola</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Nuka-Cola is, without a doubt, the most recognisable and iconic brand in Fallout. It’s probably even more recognisable than Vault-Tec, which we’ll get to in a second. </p>



<p>In the Fallout Universe, Nuka-Cola is one of the biggest corporations, and its influence is felt far and wide across the post-apocalyptic wasteland. It’s the many millions of bottle caps from Nuka-Cola bottles that became the de facto currency after the bombs fell, after all.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-vault-tec-industries">2. Vault-Tec Industries</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Vault-Tec Industries was responsible for the construction of the vaults that housed many thousands of people as the bombs rained down across the United States in the Fallout Universe. </p>



<p>It’s easily one of the most iconic brands from Fallout – its mascot alone, the blond-haired Vault Boy, is one of the most recognisable characters in modern gaming. It might have been a relatively evil, disingenuous corporation, but that’s the point.</p>







<h3 id="h-3-super-duper-mart">3. Super-Duper Mart</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Super-Duper Mart is Fallout’s representation of Wal-Mart, and it’s easily one of the most iconic brands from Fallout. It’s primarily an ‘East Coast’ organisation, so it has only been present in Fallout 3, Fallout 4, and Fallout 76, but that’s enough for the brand to have left a lasting impression on players. </p>



<p>One of the earliest missions in Fallout 3 takes players into the heart of a Super-Duper Mart overrun by Raiders, and that’s a hugely memorable portion of the game.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-west-tek">4. West-Tek</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>West-Tek is one of those Fallout brands that didn’t gain mass prominence until Fallout 76, when players got the opportunity to visit buildings that once housed this titanic technological corporation. </p>



<p>It might not be common knowledge, but West-Tek is one of the most iconic brands from Fallout – it’s the firm responsible for the creation of Power Armor, laser-based weapons, and some of the research into the FEV (Forced Evolutionary Virus).</p>







<h3 id="h-5-general-atomics-international">5. General Atomics International</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>General Atomics International is responsible for a series of robots that are commonplace across the Fallout Universe. Before the Great War, General Atomics International created the Mister Handy, arguably one of the most recognisable robots from the Fallout series – everyone who has played the games has seen one. It also produced Mister Gutsy, Robobrain, and co-created Liberty Prime.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-robco-industries">6. RobCo Industries</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>We couldn’t list Generic Atomics International and not mention RobCo Industries! This iconic Fallout brand was founded by none other than Robert Edwin House — that’s right, <strong>the </strong>Mr. House from Fallout: New Vegas. </p>



<p>As Fallout’s answer to Tony Stark, Mr. House’s corporation was responsible for the creation of a huge array of robots: Eyebot, Protectron, Sentry Bot, Securitron, Liberty Prime, and Assaultron. Not only that, but RobCo manufactured the Pip-Boy, one of the most instantly recognisable devices from the Fallout Universe!</p>







<h3 id="h-7-hubris-comics">7. Hubris Comics</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Hubris Comics is another iconic Fallout brand that, even if you don’t know it, you’ve come into contact with it. In the Fallout Universe, Hubris Comics publishes a range of illustrated items that users can pick up to get buffs and bonuses – namely, the Grognak the Barbarian line of comic books. </p>



<p>From Fallout 3 to New Vegas and from Fallout 4 to Fallout 76, Hubris’ influence has been felt by millions of players in Fallout.</p>



<h3 id="h-8-poseidon-energy">8. Poseidon Energy</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Poseidon is an energy company, which almost immediately makes it an evil corporation in the Fallout Universe. As the world came grinding to a halt, it was iconic brands like this that squeezed every cent possible out of the citizens of the United States. </p>



<p>In Fallout, Poseidon boasted ownership of some memorable locations, like the Helios One plant from New Vegas and the Oil Rig that housed the Enclave. If that wasn’t enough, Poseidon also invented many of the franchise’s Plasma weapons. </p>



<h3 id="h-9-pulowski-preservation-services">9. Pulowski Preservation Services</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Nuclear protection on a budget! Have you ever seen one of the tall, cylindrical, blue devices scattered around Fallout 3, Fallout 4, and Fallout 76? These are the Pulowski Preservation Shelters, and they make up the backbone of a gigantic scam. </p>



<p>Upon the impending threat of nuclear annihilation, one person could buy their way into one of these street-mounted shelters, but the only issue was that they didn’t work. They’re full of skeletons of the foolish citizens who were eager to hide in them to escape the nuclear fire.</p>



<h3 id="h-10-red-rocket">10. Red Rocket</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Red Rocket is a corporation and one of the most iconic brands from Fallout, without any shadow of a doubt. It operated a network of gas stations across the United States of America in the Fallout Universe, and in the wake of the apocalypse, many of them became makeshift shelters and small settlements for survivors. </p>



<p>They’re instantly recognisable, almost always because of the large model rockets in a ‘launch pose’ on the rooftops of the gas stations littered around the wasteland.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Lenovo’s Legion Go <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24088011/lenovo-legion-go-review">was a polarizing handheld gaming PC</a>, and that won’t change as the company officially announces its successor today: the new Legion Go 2 is slightly bigger, heavier, and costs <em>at least</em> $400 more than the original.</p><p>But in many other ways, it looks like Lenovo listened — and so this handheld, with its Switch-like detachable wireless controllers, built-in kickstand, and hidden optical mouse, might just be the ultimate portable PC when it arrives this October.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/13/24342995/i-played-with-the-new-legion-go-2-too">We already knew</a> its newly sculpted controllers made it far more comfortable to hold and mouse around; now, it also has 50 percent more battery and possibly the best handheld screen money can buy.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->18</strong><span><figcaption><em>The Legion Go 2’s mouse mode, unique among Windows handhelds.</em></figcaption> <cite>Photo: Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></span></p></section><p>Not only did Lenovo find an 8.8-inch OLED panel — with the inky blacks and gorgeous color OLED can afford — it’s a true 30–144Hz variable refresh rate screen with a native landscape orientation, meaning even games that can only maintain 31 or 32fps on its handheld chip should still give you every extra frame of smoothness over 30. The original Legion Go didn’t have VRR at all, and many VRR screens only go down to 48Hz, so 30Hz is a nice improvement.</p><p>And because Lenovo picked a lower-resolution panel at 1920 x 1200 instead of the overkill 2560 x 1600 of the original, it should be that much easier for its new Z2 or Z2 Extreme chip to deliver enough frames, too.</p><div><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Spec</td><td>Legion Go 2</td><td>Legion Go</td></tr><tr><td>Starting price</td><td>$1,099</td><td>$699</td></tr><tr><td>Screen</td><td>8.8-inch 1920 x 1200 OLED with 30–144Hz VRR, 500-nit with 1000-nit peak</td><td>8.8-inch 2560 x 1600 IPS at 144Hz or 60Hz, 500-nit</td></tr><tr><td>Chip</td><td>AMD Ryzen Z2 or Z2 Extreme</td><td>AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme</td></tr><tr><td>Memory</td><td>16GB (Z2) or 32GB LPDDR5X-8000 (Z2E)</td><td>16GB LPDDR5X-7500</td></tr><tr><td>Battery</td><td>74 watt-hour</td><td>49.2 watt-hour</td></tr><tr><td>Size w/ pads</td><td>11.64 x 5.38 x 1.66 inches (295.6 x 136.7 x 42.25mm)</td><td>11.76 x 5.16 x 1.6 inches (298.8 x 131 x 40.7mm)</td></tr><tr><td>Tablet size</td><td>8.11 x 5.38 x 0.9 inches (206 x 136.7 x 22.95mm)</td><td>8.27 x 5.16 x 0.79 inches (210 x 131 x 20.1mm)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>2.38 pounds (1079g)</td><td>1.88 pounds (854g)</td></tr><tr><td>Ports</td><td>USB4 x2, MicroSD UHS-II, 3.5mm headset</td><td>USB4 x 2, MicroSD UHS-II, 3.5mm headset</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Speaking of those chips, the AMD Ryzen Z2 and Z2 Extreme probably <em>aren’t</em> big upgrades over the last wave of handhelds. In fact, AMD admitted to me at CES that the Z2 is a match for the Z1E, but with software enhancements. The Z2E is a modest upgrade over the Z1E, according to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku8gm6vXrQs">ETA Prime’s early tests with an MSI Claw A8</a>. Every frame counts in a handheld where the latest games struggle to play smoothly, but I would hope for more. Perhaps Lenovo got more out of it — I recall the original Legion Go being a tad faster than the original ROG Ally despite using the same Z1E chip.</p><p>You can also now get 1TB of storage by default in North America, with 2TB in the highest-end config. All but the entry-level SKU have 32GB of RAM. There’s also a fingerprint reader in the power button now, which is quickly becoming a standard feature on Windows handhelds.</p><p>And those sculpted controllers, which you’ll also be able to buy and connect to the original Legion Go since they use the same mounting system, now have a proper pivot-point D-pad instead of the flat and shallow cross button of the original. They still feature drift-resistant Hall effect joysticks, too, and at CES I saw that the right pad’s mouse skate accessory now locks into place so you don’t fling it off when using the FPS mouse.</p><p>I’m afraid that handheld gaming PC prices are headed the wrong direction. The Legion Go 2 starts at $1,099.99 with an AMD Z2, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage. You’ll spend $1,199.99 for the model with 32GB of RAM, $1,349.99 for a Z2 Extreme with 32GB / 1TB, and $1,479.99 for the same with 2TB. I already thought the MSI Claw 8 AI Plus was pricey after MSI bumped it $999.99, and while this is pricier still, I wouldn’t be surprised if that Claw’s Intel Lunar Lake chip may be competitive with the Z2E in Lenovo’s new handheld.</p><p>But price and performance aren’t everything, and Lenovo already has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/704903/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-os-review-z2-go-z1-extreme">the $830 Legion Go S with SteamOS</a> for those who need to spend a little less for good performance. The Legion Go 2 may tempt those who’d pay extra for the best Windows handheld experience — though I suspect we may be redefining the Windows part of “best Windows handheld experience” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/763357/microsoft-asus-xbox-ally-handheld-hands-on-notepad">after the Xbox Ally X arrives</a> on October 16th.</p><p>Speaking of Windows and SteamOS, Lenovo isn’t announcing a SteamOS version of the Legion Go 2 at this time, spokesperson Jeff Witt tells <em>The Verge</em>. As of embargo time, Lenovo hasn’t confirmed when or if the Legion Go 2 will get the same Xbox full-screen experience as Asus’ Xbox Ally handheld, but Microsoft has said <a href="https://www.theverge.com/microsoft-xbox/682463/xbox-full-screen-windows-upgrade-ally">some non-Asus handhelds will get it in 2026</a>.</p><p><em>Photography by Antonio G.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-making-of-kaiju-no-8-the-game</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-making-of-kaiju-no-8-the-game.1289502/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of the time, a game based on a successful manga is made <em>after</em> the anime adaptation has been airing for some time, but that wasn’t the case with Kaiju No. 8 The Game. (You can <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hands-on-with-kaiju-no-8-the-game"><u><strong>read our hands-on impressions here</strong></u></a>, by the way.) It tells its own story within creator Naoya Matsumoto’s world, as well as referencing pivotal events from the mainline narrative, and is one of the rare instances in which the game and anime were being developed in parallel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When this game began its development, the manga was only getting started,” says Kaiju No. 8 The Game’s Producer Shinya Fujita. “So there was still a lot of information that we didn’t know yet. And also at the same time, the manga was to be adapted into an anime as well. So this made it very difficult.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team started working on Kaiju No. 8 The Game more than two years ago, and the anime only started airing in mid-April last year. This meant that the game development team and the anime production effort (which involved both <a href="https://www.production-ig.co.jp/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Production I.G</u></a> and <a href="https://www.khara.co.jp/news-en/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Studio Khara</u></a>) were both exploring what this world would look like in action and how best to bring the characters – and kaiju – to life.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://games.aktsk.jp/en/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Akatsuki Games</u></a> “often referred to the manga for unreleased characters, weapons, and locations,” reflects Fujita. The team also had access to Naoya Matsumoto, the writer and illustrator of the manga, and “his advice and support were crucial,” confirms Fujita, who goes on to say that he was “surprised by his deep knowledge of game development and respect for the process.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not to say that Akatsuki Games was disconnected from the anime. As its production moved ahead, the team were able to work with both studios on specific things. Fujita says that while his team looked to the manga for their character designs, they received invaluable help for the weapon designs from Production I.G, who “were able to create references that were very detailed and easy to understand”, and leveraged the expertise they’d gleaned from the likes of Ghost in the Shell. The team also received references for kaiju designs from Studio Khara, which had been brought onboard to oversee the kaiju designs in the anime; a natural fit given this is the studio established by Hideki Anno and responsible for the Rebuild of Evangelion films.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Kaiju No. 8 The Game Gameplay</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The work on background designs also lined up with the anime. “We received a lot of art boards from Production I.G,” says 3D Artist Kazushi Matsumoto. “Every day we’d be checking what the new materials were. In the early stages sometimes we’d find that our 3D design didn’t match the art board so we’d have to remake it. It’s not like we had all the reference material we needed in the first place – we had to work closely with Production I.G. In the case that we had exactly the same location as the anime, we’d have Production I.G review our designs as well.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One area that was completely separate, however, was the audio side of the game. “I deeply admire the anime's exceptional music,” says Sound Artist Yasuaki Iwata, “and the sound team is inspired by the anime's music and takes a reference [from it] while creating entirely new compositions tailored specifically for the game experience.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Since music strongly reflects a composer's individuality,” adds Sound Director Mitsuhiro Hikino, “we carefully structured our team. We were fortunate to have experienced game composers with extensive game experience and theatrical music composers who excel at creating music that complements visuals… We centered our music around genres like Japanese digital rock and used instrumentation familiar to fans of the IP and its culture. We deliberately kept melodies subtle to prevent the music from overpowering the experience, instead allowing it to complement and enhance the impressive visuals.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Producing work that stands up next to the excellent anime was obviously important to the team, but so too was ensuring that the manga’s author, Naoya Matsumoto, was happy with their vision for his world. And sometimes that meant changing tack. Japanese mobile games often have provocative new outfits for their characters that players can acquire through their gacha system, incentivising them to invest more time and/or money in the game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Sexy costumes… [are] pretty common in the Japanese mobile game industry,” says Art Director Yuya Kuroyabu. “When we proposed this plan, Matsumoto-sensei said ‘well, no – this [approach] is not for this IP.’ So we studied the IP concept again and tried to come up with some unique designs for this game.” The upshot is that the character outfits stay true to the fact that they’re all soldiers in the Japan Anti-Kaiju Defense Force or CLOZER (a specialised military outfit central to the story), keeping this game more closely aligned with the manga and anime, and reworking the concept of ‘fan service’ in the process. “The essence of the design,” concludes Kuroyabu, “is the military style.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most important of all, however, was getting Matsumoto’s blessing for Kaiju No. 8 The Game’s original storyline. It takes place at a specific time in the manga and anime’s arc, and features all the main characters. “We, the game developers, proposed ideas [to Matsumoto-sensei],” Producer Shinya Fujita explains. “We wanted to create a unique setting for the game,” so came up with the concept that Kaiju Dimensional Gates were opening up around the globe, triggering an all-in response from anti-kaiju forces. “Then, building on to the Kaiju Dimensional Gate setting,” Fujita continues, “we created the original story and then created the character Sagan Shinomiya.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/05/original-characters-1757049946835.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The three original characters, with Sagan front and centre.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Sagan is a very important character,” Fujita explains, “because she's the only game-original character connected to the anime/manga cast.” Given how central Kikoru and Isao Shinomiya are to Kaiju No. 8’s story, it genuinely is a pretty big deal for the game to introduce Kikoru’s non-blood related sister. “We didn’t actually have any instructions from Matsumoto-sensei,” says Art Director Yuya Kuroyabu on whether the team had free reign to create the character, “but we proposed ideas and spent a lot of time communicating.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This included pivoting away from what Fujita describes as “a completely different character design” to find the current version which “was the better fit for this military setting.” “Because she plays such an important role, we wanted to make sure we get her right,” he concludes.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“Sagan is a very important character, because she's the only game-original character connected to the anime/manga cast.” - Shinya Fujita</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Sagan is joined by a couple of other new characters – Chester Lochburn, CLOZER’s strategist, and Suited, CLOZER’s weapons development guru – and the team have been quite clever in how they approach their gameplay designs. Characters in this game fall into three broad categories – Attacker, Support and Defender – and as you might imagine, given their overwhelming offensive power, many of the core cast from the manga/anime fit into the Attacker category. It makes sense, then, for the new characters to help bulk out the numbers in the other roles so that players can build well-rounded squads focused on their favourite characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Matsumoto on board for the story and new characters, there was still the question of how to handle series protagonist Kafka Hibino. After all, he’s simultaneously one of the weakest <em>and </em>strongest characters in the manga/anime. The team have followed Matsumoto’s lead by keeping this duality and allowing Hibino to use his Ultimate to transform into Kaiju No. 8 mid-fight, going from a pistol packing support player to an absolute beast. It really is binary too, as his transformation completely replaces his human moves with kaiju ones and strips him of his pistol in favour of bare knuckle brawling. “After transforming, he gains access to powerful abilities like AOE attacks and high-damage Ultimate, allowing players to truly feel his strength,” says Producer Shinya Fujita.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team have even created a standalone Kaiju No. 8 character that starts in Kafka’s transformed state. “While this version can't equip weapons like other characters,” Fujita comments, “he possesses incredibly powerful base stats even without them. Pretty much what this means is that in the game you can skip the process of acquiring or leveling up weapons; he's simply strong from the get go.” Even so, balance is key. “We want to avoid situations where a specific character becomes almost mandatory to progress,” explains Fujita, “or where players can't freely use the characters they genuinely want to play.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/05/gameplay-ui-squad1-1757050045669.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Kaiju No. 8 on the squad loadout screen.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is also reflected in the game’s monetisation strategy – which is always a thorny topic when it comes to live service titles, but particularly those with heavy gacha components. “Our goal is for fans to enjoy playing with their favourite characters, even if it impacts rarity,” says Fujita, “[so] we provide more opportunities for casual users to collect characters and enjoy the game.” The examples he gives of this are gifting players the choice of a rare character, as well as Kikoru/Kafka at launch, plus the free characters from the pre-registration campaign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Coming back to Kafka, as you’d imagine he’s central to the game’s new story, and there’s a lot of it, with each mission bookended by cutscenes or dialogue sequences. If it feels to-the-point, that’s very much deliberate. “In the main Kaiju No. 8 story, the focus is heavily on maintaining narrative momentum,” explains Fujita, “and thus everyday life aspects are intentionally not depicted. To fill in those gaps, we created the character stories.” This is a separate mode with small stories based around the major characters. “We hope players will enjoy the casual conversations between characters and discover new parts of their personalities that aren't seen in the main story.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even so, in keeping with the manga and anime, there are still some pretty goofy, playful sequences in the main story. “We’re trying to stay as true to the original work's artistic direction as possible,” says Fujita, while also wanting to “show a ‘cooler side of Kafka’ in the game,” as compared with how he’s often portrayed in the anime.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“We’re trying to stay as true to the original work's artistic direction as possible…” - Shinya Fujita</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the enemies, this is where the game really takes off. “There will be 20-30 different genres [of kaiju],” says Art Director Yuya Kuroyabu. A few examples pulled from the series include Wyvern-type, Lizard-type and Ant-type, but we can’t wait to see what else the team comes up with. Kuroyabu mentioned that the team were inspired by kaiju movies, particularly the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokusatsu" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Tokusatsu</u></a> genre, and utilised classic elements from those films such as low camera angles to emphasise size.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The kaiju designs also have to fit neatly into a fun gameplay framework. “Our core philosophy for this game is to prioritise clarity,” explains Producer Shinya Fujita, “so we've tried to give kaiju abilities that can be inferred from their appearance. For example, Fungal-Type kaiju might inflict status ailments like poison, while Spider-Types might use web attacks to reduce your speed.” These status effects may be easy enough to counter on their own, but when the game starts throwing multiple types at you simultaneously, it’s going to get a bit more complicated. You can read more about how the game plays in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hands-on-with-kaiju-no-8-the-game"><u>our hands-on impressions</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the kaiju design that Art Director Yuya Kuroyabu is most excited about, it comes down to how the team are helping to flesh out existing details in Matsumoto’s world. “The one I want to call out is Kaiju No. 1,” he says. “I forget which episode [it was in], but it did show up in the original manga and anime – but only from the bust up – so no one knew what the rest of it looked like… and now we’ve designed it, so you can find out in the game! We also used this kaiju as one of our key visuals as well. It’s a special one for me.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/05/original-story-1757050156816.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">More than a little imposing…</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">3D Artist Kazushi Matsumoto shares a similar sentiment. “There are a lot of things that aren’t from the manga or anime that we’ve realised in the game,” he says, “so we’re looking forward to the players discovering them. Plus, we’ve prepared a lot of content for not only Kaiju No. 8 fans, but for Japanese anime lovers too.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now that Kaiju No. 8 The Game is out in the wild, there’s the question of what comes next. “We're planning event stories that'll let players get to know individual characters better,” says Fujita, “along with high-difficulty battle content for players seeking more challenging gameplay. And of course, we're also planning story events featuring characters in special seasonal outfits.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And presumably, in keeping with Matsumoto’s wishes, those outfits will not be overtly sexy. Regardless, “the most important thing” about running a live service game, says Fujita, “is to have love for the IP. Being a fan helps understand what other fans want.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Cam Shea visited Akatsuki Games in Tokyo as a guest.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s almost the weekend, and it’s time for another invigorating round of NYT Connections. If you’re nursing a killer streak, you’ll want to keep that going with today’s puzzle, and fortunately, I’m here to help you. Below, I’ve outlined the best NYT Connections hints for today (#817), as well as the answers, if you want the fastest solution possible.</p>



<p>Being a bit of a Star Wars nerd, today’s NYT Connections hints excited me, but once again, it was a case of the puzzle throwing a curveball to subvert expectations. Read on to get the NYT Connections clues you need to resolve today’s puzzle.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-september-5">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (September 5)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll get started with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will be enough to spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #817</p>



<ul>
<li>HAN</li>



<li>SOLO</li>



<li>FREE</li>



<li>ZING</li>



<li>RAM</li>



<li>KICK</li>



<li>STAG</li>



<li>BUCK</li>



<li>SINGLE</li>



<li>SONG</li>



<li>JACK</li>



<li>TANG</li>



<li>MING</li>



<li>PUNCH</li>



<li>BILLY</li>



<li>ZEST</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>–<em>These words pack a sensory wallop—think of what gives a dish its lively edge or a personality its spark. You might find them in a food review or a boxing metaphor</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>These all describe someone flying solo—whether at a wedding, on a dating app, or just living that independent life. No plus-one required.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>These names belong to male animals, often used colloquially or in farming circles. If you’ve ever met a goat named Billy or a rabbit named Jack, you’re on the right track.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>These are not just history test answers—they’re the ruling houses that shaped centuries of Chinese civilization. Think dynasties that built walls, wrote poetry, and changed the course of empires.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Being a bit of a history buff, I appreciated the nod we got to the <strong>obvious </strong>above. Admittedly, this was one of the easiest NYT Connections puzzles this week, and it didn’t take too long to figure it out.</p>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, September 5.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>

<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>–<em> </em>KICK, PUNCH, ZEST, ZING</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – FREE, SINGLE, SOLO, STAG</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BILLY, BUCK, JACK, RAM</li>

</ul>



<p>And here’s the visual solution for today’s NYT Connections:</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In February, <em>Civilization VII</em> released to what feels like (the internet wasn't around in the 90s!) the worst reception in series history,<a href="https://aftermath.site/civilization-vii-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> its major new features dividing fans and distancing the game from what many have long loved about it</a>. Now,<a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-update-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> even as the team at Firaxis work to update the game</a>, many of them are being laid off.</p><p>After a number of former Firaxis staff like artists, writers and producers, predominantly from the <em>Civ VII</em> team, began posting earlier today that they'd been let go,<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/2k-confirms-layoffs-at-civilization-developer-firaxis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> 2K confirmed with Game Developer</a> that there had been a "staff reduction today at Firaxis Games", with the site estimating that "dozens of workers have been impacted by the cuts".</p><p>Using absolutely meaningless filler words as cover for the move, 2K said the layoffs were part of an effort to increase "adaptability, collaboration, and creativity" at Firaxis, none of which sound like they can be boosted by laying off dozens of the people who worked there.</p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/civilization-vii-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As I said in my <em>Civ VII</em> review</a>, its development sounded like a mess, which would be a strategic misstep made at levels far above those affected today by layoffs:</p><blockquote><p>It's clear something has gone very wrong during the game's development. There are now multiple<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1i3wpql/vii_release_ui_spotted/#lightbox" target="_blank">&nbsp;examples</a>, both from early demos in 2024 and hidden in the final game's<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://imgur.com/a/y4pQqYr" target="_blank">&nbsp;code</a>, of&nbsp;<em>Civ VII</em>&nbsp;once having an almost&nbsp;<em>entirely&nbsp;</em>different interface. For that aspect of the game to have been overhauled so close to release sure would explain why things look so bland and rushed--one of my earliest notes from playing this was "looks like an iPad version of&nbsp;<em>Civ V</em>"--and why the interface was the first thing&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/message-from-firaxis-games/" target="_blank">Firaxis have said</a>&nbsp;they'd be fixing, because what if they're not really fixing it at all, but just...finishing it.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>The game sold well, however,<a href="https://gameworldobserver.com/2025/02/07/civilization-7-record-pre-orders-take-two-q3-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> reportedly breaking pre-order records for the series</a>. In May,<a href="https://aftermath.site/take-two-zelnick-layoffs-roll7-intercept" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick</a> said he had been "thrilled with Civ 7 so far", with the game currently sitting in the<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1kluj5q/civilization_vii_is_so_far_the_8th_bestselling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> top 10 best-selling games of 2025 list</a>.
