            <p>Last week, soulslike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wuchang-fallen-feathers">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a> got a patch that rendered a number of its bosses unkillable, seemingly in response to pressure from some Chinese players. For those who aren't keen on the patch's changes, which particularly transforms the challenge you'll face in the game's fourth region, there's now a mod dedicated to undoing them by letting you roll back to a previous version.</p>
<p>For a more in-depth view of the changes patch 1.5 made and what they mean for the game, it's well worth reading <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-bosses-made-unkillable">our Jeremy's story</a> on it from last week. The short version is that a number of big foes associated with the Ming dynasty have been made to fall down in exhaustion when you defeat them, rather than being killed. As you might imagine, this has implications not just in terms of the minute-to-minute experience of playing Wuchang, but also the story it tells.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>'s busted <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-4-gets-some-further-tweaks-to-its-mod-destroying-next-gen-update">next-gen update</a> last year, modders are trying to help players who're keen to roll their game back to a previous version. AVK95 has stepped up to the task with the self-explanatory '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/wuchangfallenfeathers/mods/213?tab=description">Rollback censorship patch</a>'.</p>
<p>"Wuchang 1.5 massively downgrades the game experience," its creator wrote in the mod's description. "Most late game bosses, NPCs and enemies now get exhausted instead of dying and give you meaningless banter instead of story advancing dialog from the original game. Basically patch 1.5 has ruined the game's story and immersion."</p><p>The mod will take you back to version 1.4 of Wuchang, which meas that in getting rid of patch 1.5's boss tweaks, you'll also be ditching more useful changes like quickened up healing animations and a revamping of how Wuchang gets back up after being knocked down. If you choose to download it, you'll get a file called WuchangRollback.exe, which it instructs you to extract and then run in your game's root folder.</p>
<p>Once that's done, you'll have to disable the game's ability to automatically update by heading into its properties menu via your steam library. Lastly, you'll need to start the game each time by clicking a file called 'Project_Plague-Win64-Shipping', rather than clicking play on Steam itself.</p>
<p>It's a fair amount of palaver to go through, but with Steam lacking a feature like fellow storefront GOG.com's <a href="https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/4419630535057-The-rollback-feature-reverting-to-a-previous-version-of-the-game">built-in rollbacks</a> for games that don't offer <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/164mwsj/psa_how_to_rollback_to_a_previous_game_version_on/">previous versions as betas</a>, it's probably the best you'll get for now. As you saw with that Fallout update, there can be other ways to pull off rolling back a patch, such as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fo4/comments/1ccxyxb/pc_players_here_is_a_guide_on_how_to_rollback/">re-downloading old depot files</a>, but that's usually no walk in the park unless you find some instructions you can follow to the letter.</p>
<p>There might end up being a better solution if someone develops a mod that only gets rid of patch 1.5's controversial changes or, ideally, developers Lenzee opt to offer a version of the game that does the same. As of right now, there's just AVK95's mod, which also doesn't work with the Xbox Game Pass version of Wuchang.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>While you might not recognize David Hayter if you walked past him on the street, you’d certainly become wide-eyed if you heard his Snake voice. The legendary voice actor, who commanded the role of Snake for many years in MGS, recently revealed that he has finally played Metal Gear Solid 5—a tough ask, given he was replaced as Snake’s voice actor.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kojima-working-on-physint-all-by-himself/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hideo Kojima</a> is the creative visionary behind Metal Gear Solid. There’s no denying MGS wouldn’t be what it is without him. But the gruff, roughness of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/david-hayter-mgs-konami/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David Hayter</a>‘s Solid Snake voice added to the character’s aura of the years. However, Hideo Kojima replaced Hayter with Kiefer Sutherland for Metal Gear Solid 5: Ground Zeroes and The Phantom Pain. This hurt Hayter a lot.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Time is the ultimate healer. Credit to Konami</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hayter told <a href="https://gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2016/03/25/david-hayter-playing-metal-gear-solid-v-would-have-been-60-hours-of-humiliation.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Informer</a> in 2016 that playing Metal Gear Solid V would have been “60 hours of humiliation.” He also added that Kojima had been trying to replace Hayter before The Phantom Pain, before ultimately doing so with Kiefer Sutherland—best known for the TV show 24.</p>



<p>As a result, Hayter didn’t play The Phantom Pain or Ground Zeroes: “Yeah. That’ll be 60 hours of humiliation that I can’t get to. I haven’t played the latest two iterations, because it’s just too painful.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/all-is-forgiven-after-being-dropped-for-metal-gear-solid-5-david-hayter-now-says-its-my-favourite-gameplay-of-the-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a> reports that David Hayter has finally played Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain: “And then I played it and I’m like, I think this is my favourite gameplay of the series. The fact that you can go into the same scenario each time, and the [enemy] soldier’s gonna be doing the same thing, but you can take on different routes or different strategies of attack, makes it feel like time travel.”</p>



<p>He added that the gameplay is “badass” and “all is forgiven.”</p>



<p>David Hayter was returned to the role of Snake in the upcoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-a-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>. The voice actor has new lines as the remake looks to provide new content for all fans. Are you happy to hear the OG voice actor is back for the Snake Eater Remake? What’s your favorite Snake line?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There’s a fresh new trailer for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, showcasing the new Z-A Battle Club with up-to four player battles. Check it out!</p>
<p><iframe title="Enjoy Pokémon Battles Like Never Before in Pokémon Legends: Z-A!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y30vuKRtYPw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Z-A Battle Club completely mixes up the traditional flow of Pokémon battling that you’ve known since the very first games, putting a three minute timer in place and tasking everyone with knocking out as many opposing Pokémon as possible! The trainers who strike the finishing blow will earn a point, with the defeated trainer respawning back at the edge of the arena with another one of their Pokémon ready to go, though you can still switch Pokémon for a tactical change.</p>
<p>This is all possible thanks to Pokémon Legends: Z-A now having real time battles where you can move around the combat arena. It also make area of effect attacks much more impactful, such as when Mega Dragonite is summoned and unleashes a meteor strike to wipe out all three opponents at once in the final ten seconds.</p>
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is coming to both Switch and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>&nbsp;on 16th October.</p>

<p>Launching next month</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Publisher Feardemic has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bad_cheese">Bad Cheese</a>, a new survival horror from developer Simon Lukasik, will launch on the Switch (with backwards compatibility on Switch 2) on <strong>1st September 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Much like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bendy_and_the_ink_machine">Bendy And The Ink Machine</a> before it, Bad Cheese utilises old-school 'rubber hose' animation, which was perhaps most notably used in the 2D action-platformer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cuphead">Cuphead</a>. It's difficult to gauge exactly what the aim of the game is, but it appears that you'll be navigating a spooky 3D environment, interacting with various objects, and solving tactile puzzles to progress.</p>
<p>We have to admit, it doesn't necessarily look <em>scary</em>, but the atmosphere seems to be fairly effective, and there's definitely some creepy monster designs being utilised throughout the trailer.</p>
<p>Now let's check out the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- Face your demons –</strong> You all live together. You, Dad, Mom, Brother, and the rest of the demons. Try not to cause problems so you don’t have to be punished<br>
<strong><br>
- Help around the house –</strong> Scrub, sweep, clean, make fries, kill spiders, bring Daddy his pills – essentially, be a good kid<br>
<strong><br>
- Find hidden treasures –</strong> Explore the house and look for treats and action figures scattered around. This might be the only fun part about living here<br>
<strong><br>
- Just try to get by –</strong> Visit various parts of the house, face difficult situations, and experience the gruesome reality of a child-mouse trying to maintain a sense of normalcy in an abnormal household</p>
</blockquote>

            <p>Hello all! And a very happy This Week to you. I'm back from break just in time for Gamescom. Gamescom! *Broadway overture kicks in* A time of booths and blaggardry! Of queues and carousing! Of flinching away from cosplayers promising Free Hugs! Of getting caught in a human logjam between the major exhibition halls and the lavatories! Of miniature walled villages operated by triple-A publishers, hosting their own local culture of finger food! Of strung-out crypto investors filling the alcoves with their musical cries of "DOGECOIN FOR SALE, DOGECOIN FOR SALE!" Of waifu bodypillows and army recruiters! Of finding the event's secret best game tucked away among the b2b stands! Of long walks back to the hotel across the bridge of locks, wondering how it ever came to this!</p> <!--more-->
<p>Such are my terrible memories, anyway. James is attending the Cologne-based games convention for RPS this year. The rest of us will be stationed atop the Treehouse with telescopes and crossbows, scouring the skies for News with which to feed the exuberant and impetuous Maw. In advance of all that, here's a rundown of new PC games, together with the bare bones of a conference schedule.</p>
<h2>Monday 18th August</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stick-it-to-the-stickman">Stick It To The Stickman</a> entangles corporate careerism with punching with the golden era of Newgrounds animation. Mark has already been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stickbossman-i-think-youll-find-my-chainsaw-has-an-appointment">sticking it to the demo</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tuesday 19th August</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sword-of-the-sea">Sword Of The Sea</a> is the latest Journey-me-do from Abzu and The Pathless devs Giant Squid. It's about doing ollies on a claymore. I was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sword-of-the-sea-is-an-enveloping-but-not-cutting-meditation-on-flow-journey-and-vintage-tony-hawk">quite impressed</a> by the SGF demo.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/voidbreaker">Void/Breaker</a> is a glistening goldfish bowl full of robots, destructible buildings and moddable guns.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/757940/Raygun_Gadabout/">Raygun Gadabout</a> is a retro-future sci-fi with splattery Rick &amp; Morty stylings. Possibly an Earthworm Jim for people who don't like Earthworm Jim since its creator went a bit Wrong.</li>
<li>They do the Geoffs in different voices at <a href="https://www.gamescom.global/en/program/onl">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a>, featuring Blandoman Extraordinaire and his Fashion Friends, plus some videogames. The main show starts at 11am PT, 2pm EDT, 7pm BST and 8pm CEST.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wednesday 20th August</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2896760/Azooma_Escape/">Azooma Escape</a> is a comedic stealth adventure about breaking out of an overbearing family gathering, from a Saudi independent team.</li>
<li>Xbox are doing their first Gamescom broadcast today at 6am PT, 9am EDT, 2pm BST and 3pm CEST. Perhaps they'll share further details of the external inquiry Microsoft have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/15/microsoft-launches-inquiry-claims-israel-used-tech-mass-surveillance-palestinians">recently commissioned</a> into their alleged complicity with war crimes.</li>
<li>The Future Games Show is next up on the Gamescom schedule at 11am PDT, 2pm EDT, 7pm BST, and 8pm CEST. We can expect: the voice actors behind Solid Snake and Lady Dimitrescu. Now there's a fanshipping for you.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thursday 21st August</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2631450/Bean_Beasts/">Bean Beasts</a> is a lushly pixelled tower defender in which your towers are Pokenots and your traps are upgradeable - truly, these are dark times for tower attackers.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/herdling">Herdling</a> is about ushering befuddled goat things up a mountain. It's from them wot did Far: Lone Sail.</li>
<li>It's time for Eggsbogs Gamecome All Ye Faithful round two at 6am PDT, 9am EDT, 2pm BST, and 3pm CEST. Perhaps they'll have another crack at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dear-microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-please-prove-that-an-ai-didnt-write-your-insulting-vacuous-blog-about-why-youre-laying-off-thousands-during-a-time-of-huge-profits">justifying the mass layoffs</a> in this one.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Friday 22nd August</h2>
<ul>
<li>Let's leave Friday wide open and spotless as the freshly fallen snow, to catch any larger unexpected Gamescom revelations. Maybe somebody will wear another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/splitgate-2-boss-admits-the-trumpish-hat-he-wore-at-summer-game-fest-was-a-publicity-stunt-after-it-goes-sour">politically ill-advised hat</a> on stage. Maybe James will go full gonzo. According to my meeting notes, he's promised to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-know-ill-use-deep-rock-galactic-to-identify-the-mushrooms-in-my-palm-pot">eat all those mushrooms he found in his planters last week</a>. I think that would be a wonderful way to close the expo, personally. I'm sure you'll all remind him.</li>
</ul>
<p>*Broadway overture crackles and slows into a nightmarish series of undersea noises* Good luck with the Geoffalypse, all.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Mega Evolution will make a Pokémon TCG Pocket debut later this year, with the first cards also being revealed during the closing ceremony of the Pokémon World Championships in Anaheim.</p>



<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is bringing Mega Evolution back to the mainline games when it releases on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October 16</a>, while the return of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolutions-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mega Evolution in the physical TCG</a> has already been released in Japan with the first English sets due later this year.</p>



<p>Now, Pokémon TCG Pocket is following suit with Mega Evolutions confirmed to arrive “this fall” as part of a “new season,” which could be in line with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-devs-plan-to-release-a-major-update-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">huge update that has already been teased</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-tcg-pocket-unveils-first-mega-evolution-cards">Pokémon TCG Pocket Unveils First Mega Evolution Cards</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Coming soon. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>A trailer shown at the Pokémon World Championships featured a recap of some of the additions to the game we’ve seen so far, followed by the reveal of the Mega Evolutions symbol and a first look at several cards.</p>



<p>Mega Altaria ex, Mega Blaziken ex, and Mega Gyarados ex were all featured, showing the art style for the cards and confirming how they will be utilized in the game.</p>



<p>Similar to the latest physical TCG sets, Mega Pokémon will not evolve from their standard forms. Instead, Mega Blaziken evolves from Combusken, Mega Gyarados evolves from Magikarp, and Mega Altaria evolves from Swablu.</p>



<p>Mega Evolution in Pokémon TCG Pocket will also be a high-risk vs reward strategy as, while they will be among the strongest cards in the game, with all the revealed cards having 210 HP and dishing out high damage, the opponent will secure three points if your Mega Evolution Pokémon is knocked out.</p>



<p>It remains to be seen whether the battle format will change for Pokémon TCG Pocket’s new season, but currently, securing three points ends the match. Therefore, a strategy is required on when to introduce them and when to retreat.</p>

<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo/The Pokemon Company</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The Z-A Battle Club is ready for its newest Link Battle entrants! Up to four players can take part in battles where they attempt to defeat as many of each other’s Pokémon as they can within the three-minute time limit.</p>
<p>When any of your Pokémon faint, you will return to your starting point and reenter the battle with all your Pokémon fully recovered. Defeating an opponent’s Pokémon earns you a point, and those points determine your ranking. Mega Power orbs, which can be collected to Mega Evolve your Pokémon, may also appear around the stage, as well as items to boost your Pokémon’s stats temporarily.</p>
<p><strong>Real-time battling gets serious</strong></p>
<p>In this title’s new battle system, some moves may work differently than in prior games in the Pokémon series. Moves have a wide range of effects—launching attacks in a fixed radius to deal damage to multiple Pokémon at once, targeting distant Pokémon by attacking in a straight line, and more. Launch attacks from places your opponents don’t expect or sweep through groups of opponents as you lead your partner Pokémon to victory by making full use of a variety of moves.</p>
<p><strong>Climb the ranks to earn rewards</strong></p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo/The Pokemon Company</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Test your real-time battling skills against Trainers around the world in Ranked Battles. You’ll earn points based on your placement in four-player Link Battles, and may earn an additional kicker based on your performance. Similar to the main story, you’ll start off at Rank Z and can climb the ranks to the ultimate Rank A.</p>
<p><strong>Enjoy real-time battles with your friends</strong></p>
<p>Looking to settle who’s the best Trainer once and for all? Challenge your friends in Private Battles! You can input a Link Code to connect with nearby players using local communication or distant players online. Once you’re all connected, you can adjust the battle rules to your liking and battle against up to three other players.</p>
<ul>
<li>Link Battles can be played between Pokémon Legends: Z-A, Pokémon Legends: Z-A – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, and Pokémon Legends: Z-A with the upgrade pack applied.</li>
<li>A paid Nintendo Switch Online membership is required to participate in battles via the internet.</li>
<li>In order to enjoy online play, you will need to have downloaded the latest update data.</li>
<li>The Pokémon Video Game Championships at the 2026 Pokémon World Championships will be played on <a href="https://champions.pokemon.com/en-us/">Pokémon Champions</a>.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is set for rlease on Switch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> on 16th October.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A will feature online ranked battles and a four-player PvP mode, it has been revealed at the Pokémon World Championships in Anaheim.</p>



<p>Due to be released on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October 16</a>, Pokémon Legends: Z-A is the next big release for the franchise heading into a huge year in 2026, where Pokémon celebrates a 30th anniversary and is widely expected to release the tenth generation of Pokémon.</p>



<p>Legends: Z-A follows on from the success of 2021’s Pokémon Legends: Arceus, which featured open-world catching mechanics for the first time, but big steps forward are being taken in the latest entry to the series with online support.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Big features. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>One of the biggest disappointments with Legends: Arceus was the lack of online features, with no battling, trading, or Mystery Gift system. That all changes in Legends: Z-A, however, which will feature them all.</p>



<p>Ranked battles will provide competitive action for trainers around the world, with private matches also being available, while the trading mechanics suggest that trade evolutions will return—having been replaced by single-use items in Legends: Arceus.</p>



<p>Another piece of big news revealed at Anaheim was a four-player PvP mode, where trainers will compete within a time limit to secure the most knock-outs, with Mega Evolution confirmed to be available in the mode.</p>



<p>The four-player mode follows on from the four-player co-op introduced in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, though that was restricted to open-world exploration and did not include battle features. Instead, battles remained in the same one-vs-one format we’ve become accustomed to.</p>



<p>Introducing a four-player PvP mode in Legends: Z-A could mean big things for the tenth generation of the game, given Scarlet &amp; Violet took a lot of the mechanics from Legends: Arceus and introduced them to the mainline games—including open-world catching and exploration.</p>

<figure><a title="﻿Pokémon Legends: Z-A" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0fcf4b662e776/pokemon-legends-z-a.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The ﻿Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>During the 2025 Pokémon World Championships, it was announced Link and Ranked Battles would be coming to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> for the Switch and Switch 2 as part of the Z-A Battle Club.</p>
<p>These battles will allow up to four trainers to join in on battles where they attempt to defeat as many of each other's Pokémon within a set time limit of 3 minutes. You'll need to make full use of a variety of moves as well as Mega Evolutions as you "go on the offensive".</p>
<p>Here's the official PR, and you can check out the latest trailer below this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Trainers will be able to jump into the Z-A Battle Club in the <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> game in the newly revealed Link and Ranked Battles. In the Z-A Battle Club (Link Battles), up to four players will race to defeat as many Pokémon as possible within the time limit to take the top spot.</p>
<p>In Ranked Battles, up to four Trainers can compete online from around the world to earn points. When players earn enough points, they will rise in rank. Trainers will start off at Rank Z and can be promoted all the way up to the ultimate Rank A.​</p>
<p>Players can earn in-game rewards when a battle ends or when their rank increases, with additional rewards granted based on their final rank when the season ends after a set time period. Since rewards vary by season, active participation is necessary to climb the ranks and earn rewards. Players will also be able to enjoy Private Battles with their friends using local communicationor with those farther away online.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A arrives for the Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>16th October 2025</strong>, with pre-orders now officially live. This includes a Nintendo Switch 2 + <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> bundle offer.</p>

<p>The latest game in the <i>AI: Somnium Files</i> series arrived last month, and it’s shorter than the previous ones. <i>No Sleep for Kaname Date</i> is actually a spin-off that takes place between the first two games, <i>AI: The Somnium Files</i> and <i>AI: The Somnium Files -Nirvana Initiative-</i>, as well as sees the return of our original protagonist, Kaname Date.</p> <p>This time around, Kaname Date must save our favorite idol Iris after she gets abducted by a UFO and is forced to play various escape games to survive. Directed by Kazuya Yamada supervised by original series creator Uchikoshi, <i>No Sleep for Kaname Date</i> implements escape room puzzles similar to that of the <em>Zero Escape</em> series, which Uchikoshi also created. These escape room scenarios help pad out N<em>o Sleep for Kaname Date</em> despite its much shorter length.</p>  <p><i>No Sleep for Kaname</i> has five chapters for you to play through, along with multiple “dead-end” endings.</p>

 <p>In the game, you’ll have to go through “Somniums” (different from the escape rooms) which are pseudo puzzles that you’ll need to solve in order to progress the story. During these Somnium investigations, you’ll be on a timer, so you won’t have time to examine every item. But examining every item unlocks “eyeballs,” which are in-game currency that lets you unlock bonus content for after you’ve beaten the main story (don’t worry, there are no real-world microtransactions). You can also earn more eyeballs by finding collectibles throughout the game.</p> <p>Some of the bonuses you can unlock include concept art and extra endings called “alternate alternate endings.” They cost a certain amount of eyeballs to unlock, and some of the bonuses may not appear until you’ve reached certain alternate endings in the story.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000618125" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000618125"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000618125">© Screenshot: Spike Chunsoft Co., Ltd.</figcaption></figure> <p>You will have to replay certain chapters, Somniums, and escape room puzzles to find the alternate endings, but thankfully, the game’s flowchart notes which chapters have them. That way, you won’t have to blindly search for them.</p>

 <p>That being said, a full playthrough of No Sleep for Kaname Date should take you about 12-15 hours to complete, depending on how good you are at solving escape puzzles.</p> <h2><span id="how-many-achievements-does-no-sleep-for-kaname-date-have"></span>How many Achievements does <em>No Sleep for Kaname Date</em> have?<span></span></h2> <p><i>No Sleep for Kaname Date</i> is available for Switch and Steam. While the former doesn’t have an achievement system, the latter does. Since this game is much shorter than the others, you’re looking at about an extra five hours to unlock all of the achievements.</p> <h2><span id="is-no-sleep-for-kaname-date-on-playstation-or-xbox"></span>Is No Sleep for Kaname Date on PlayStation or Xbox?<span></span></h2> <p>Right now, <i>No Sleep for Kaname Date</i> is only on Switch and Steam. While the previous two games are on all platforms, including PC, PlayStation, Switch, and Xbox, <i>No Sleep for Kaname Date</i> has not been announced for PlayStation and Xbox.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000618126" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000618126"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000618126">© Screenshot: Spike Chunsoft Co., Ltd.</figcaption></figure> <p>However, that doesn’t mean that developer Spike Chunsoft won’t bring them over later. 2023’s Master Detective Archives: Rain Code was a Switch exclusive until it came to all other platforms a little over a year later. Given <em>AI: The Somnium Files</em>, it’s definitely possible that <i>No Sleep for Kaname Date</i> will arrive on other platforms in the future.</p> <hr> <p><i>No Sleep for Kaname Date – From AI: The Somnium Files</i> launches on July 25 for Switch/Switch 2 and PC.</p>

              <p>Soccer (or football) is the most popular sport in the world, so it makes sense that an exciting online multiplayer game that nails the fundamentals of the pastime would be well-received. And developer Sloclap has succeeded at this by kicking the ball directly into the goal with <i>Rematch</i>. Following in the footsteps of beloved titles like <i>Rocket League</i> with its vibrant, arcade-style gameplay that pits teams together in frenetic showdowns, <i>Rematch</i> is basically everything someone could ask for in a soccer game.</p> <p>So, if you’re diving into <i>Rematch</i>‘s fast-paced matches and wondering whether you’ll be able to team up with friends on other platforms, you’re probably curious about the game’s crossplay functionality. Here’s what you need to know about crossplay in <i>Rematch</i>.</p> <p>Unfortunately, <b><i>Rematch</i></b><b> does not feature crossplay </b><b><i>yet</i></b>. However, that shouldn’t get you down too badly, as Sloclap has some good news for soccer fans awaiting this feature. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2138720/view/625556610639462619">It’s been confirmed</a> that cross-play will arrive around the end of August with Patch 3:</p>

 <blockquote><p>“Patch 3 should hopefully arrive by the end of August, and will fix some remaining known issues, and importantly introduce Crossplay to the game (at last!). Some gameplay tweaks might also be introduced in Patch 3 (looking at you, Ippy Slide), but that’s still to be confirmed. More news very soon!”</p></blockquote> <p>At <a href="https://www.playrematch.com/post/rematch-launch-priorities-next-steps">launch the studio stated</a>, “It’s very important for us that our players are able to enjoy <i>Rematch</i> with their friends, so along with bugfixes, crossplay is our absolute highest priority, we’re committed to delivering this feature swiftly, and we’ll share a more precise deadline as soon as possible.”</p> <p>So, we should expect to hear more about this feature in the coming days as Sloclap continues to work diligently on the popular game. In the meantime, you’ll have to stick to playing <i>Rematch</i> with pals within your gaming ecosystem. It’s a bummer, but at least you know it’s temporary!</p> <hr> <p><i>Rematch</i> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p>

            <p>In news unlikely to surprise you, modders have already rolled back the "downgraded game experience" introduced with Wuchang: Fallen Feathers' latest patch, 1.5, for PC players.</p>
<p>While the Steam rating was already 'mixed', players have wasted no time sharing their dismay,  complaining in Steam reviews that the developers "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198119960294/recommended/2277560/">sacrificed the original game's vision to appeal to a loud, nationalist minority</a>" and made "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198210163620/recommended/2277560/">plot change[s that make] the story completely different, and even make some of the characters motivation pointless</a>".</p>

<p>These changes include revising boss fights so that you no longer kill them, but merely "exhaust" them, which some <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198322527246/recommended/2277560/">say</a> "breaks the whole plot of the game".</p>
<p>For its part, developer Leenzee didn't note any significant changes were coming with the latest patch, only <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2277560/WUCHANG_Fallen_Feathers/#app_reviews_hash">detailed</a> some balancing and bug fixes, saying the patch "added some 'Wuchang' voice to complete the story, and added some NPC dialogues".</p>
<p>Now, as noted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-remove-censorship-patch-1-5-on-steam-mod/">TheGamer</a>, a mod for Wuchang: Fallen Feathers entitled "Rollback censorship patch - STEAM" seeks to undo those very changes.</p>
<p>"Wuchang 1.5 massively downgrades the game experience," the mod developer wrote. "Most late game bosses, NPCs and enemies now get exhausted instead of dying and give you meaningless banter instead of story advancing dialogue from the original game. Basically patch 1.5 has ruined the game's story and immersion."</p>
<p>Uploaded on Friday, 15th August, the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/wuchangfallenfeathers/mods/213?tab=description">mod</a> is already fast approaching 1000 downloads, with one user <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/wuchangfallenfeathers/mods/213?tab=posts">writing</a>: "Thank you. Hate seeing artistic integrity being sacrificed on the altar of politics again".</p>
<p>Ed thought Wuchang: Fallen Feathers' new PC patch offered "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wuchang-fallen-feathers-has-managed-to-sidestep-soulslike-fatigue-and-it-keeps-getting-better">improved performance and much-needed balance adjustments to tweak some of its infuriatingly cheap difficulty"</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>■ Q&amp;A</strong></p><p><strong>Is Swords of Legends a canonical sequel to the <em>Gujian</em> franchise, or more of a spin-off?</strong></p><p><em>Swords of Legends</em> is the official sequel to the <em>Gujian</em> single-player series developed by Shanghai Aurogon Studio. Building on the foundation laid by its predecessor, it will further expand the series’ universe and lore.</p><p><strong>Is it a premium single-player title or a <a title="Genres > Free-to-Play [425 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/free-to-play">free-to-play</a> live-service project? Which platforms will it launch on? Will there be a mobile version?</strong></p><p><em>Swords of Legends</em> is a premium single-player title planned for release on PC and consoles, with no mobile version. It is not a free-to-play title.</p><p><strong>What’s the game genre? Is it Soulslike? Is it open world?</strong></p><p><em>Swords of Legends</em> is an action RPG with a strong, well-paced main story and rich cinematic storytelling, complemented by side quests and deep exploration. Neither a Soulslike nor a fully <a title="Genres > Open-World [696 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/open-world">open-world game</a>, the gameplay structure is closer to a “wide linear” experience, allowing players to approach the <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,470 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> at their own pace within the guided progression.</p><p><strong>We noticed a clear shift in art direction and atmosphere compared to earlier entries. What kind of story are you telling this time?</strong></p><p>As always, the game is set in an original fantasy world inspired by Chinese mythology and mystical folklore. This time, we’re expanding the <em>Gujian</em> universe by placing players in the role of an “Underworld Enforcer”—a unique figure who traverses between the realms of the living and the dead. You may have spotted familiar figures like the Ox-Head and Horse-Face guardians in the trailer; they will act as companions on your journey.</p><p>However, this is not a mere retelling of classic myths—players will personally guide lost souls, helping them resolve lingering regrets. Each soul has a deeply personal backstory. For example, in the trailer, you saw a woman dancing before a set of bronze bells, unable to let go of her attachment to the mortal world, willing to pay any price to remain.</p><p><strong>How challenging is the combat?</strong></p><p>We are not aiming for punishing difficulty or purely skill-gated combat. For example, “soul capturing” is both a narrative mechanic to the story and a core combat build. Players can capture the souls of certain monsters and summon them to assist in battle, with some offering <a title="Genres > Co-Op [315 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a> combo attacks—such as the special drop attack triggered in the trailer when fighting alongside the Ox-Head and Horse-Face. Exploration will also yield a variety of utility items to aid in combat, and flexible weapon-skill loadouts will allow players to adapt to different enemy types. Our goal is to ensure players of all skill levels can have fun—and, as in any good <a title="Genres > RPG [17,506 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a>, enjoy the satisfying journey of growing stronger.</p><p><strong>I’ve never played any game of <em>Gujian</em> franchise before. Will I need to catch up on the previous titles to enjoy this one?</strong></p><p>No. Each entry in the <em>Gujian</em> franchise tells a standalone, complete story, and this installment is no exception—it introduces new characters and a self-contained narrative.</p><p><strong>What’s the current development status? Will the game be ready soon?</strong></p><p>Back in 2021, we were still in the early stages of initiating the project and conducting preliminary research. We set very high-quality expectations for the new title, and after exploring various technical approaches, we decided to develop it using Unreal Engine 5. This choice came with a significant budget requirement, which was a major challenge at the time.</p><p>While learning the engine, we also carried out early-stage research and planning. In early 2024, we secured investment, allowing the Swords of Legends team to gradually expand. As a result, the game has been in full development for about two years.</p><p>We have now entered the mass production stage, and with the release of the first trailer, we aim to showcase our progress so far and attract more exceptional talent to join our team.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/single-player-chinese-action-rpg-swords-of-legends-formerly-gujian-4-revealed-for-consoles-and-pc]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="SIWIQU S3 MAX TV Dock Station For Nintendo Switch 2 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0706b57b5d6ff/siwiqu-s3-max-tv-dock-station-for-nintendo-switch-2-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Gavin Lane / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's own dock is a non-nonsense device that just works. You slide your console in, crack the Joy-Con off, and boom, you're off to the races. Given the larger size of Switch 2, though, its dock is a substantial slab of black plastic and various third-party firms have stepped in with offerings that are a little more portable.</p>
<p>Antank is one such company, and the S3 MAX TV Dock Station for Nintendo Switch 2 — also known as the SIWIQU Dock Station in some parts — is certainly smaller than the dock that comes with the console. Weighing in at 109 grams (compared to 383 grams), you'll barely notice you're carrying it in your satchel, backpack, or anywhere else you care to secrete your hardware.</p>
<p>Antack sent me the standard model for review, although they have another one that includes an Ethernet port for wired internet connection. Otherwise, on the back of the dock, you get the expected ports: two USB-A slots, a USB-C port for the power, an HDMI port going to your TV, and a button to switch between TV-out and the Switch 2's own display. Beyond the dock itself, in the box you get a little foldout manual with the tiniest text I've ever seen, and that's your lot.</p>

<p>For $35.99 / £28.99, it should come as no surprise that you're not getting Nintendo-level build quality and materials, and the lightness here doesn't help sell the S3 as a premium bit of kit, either. But it's fine; the red and blue end caps match up with the accents around the Joy-Con, and sitting beside your TV, it looks pleasant enough.</p>
<p>You're also not getting an AC power adapter, the requisite cable, or an HDMI cable, and Antack recommends using Nintendo's official gear. If you've got a Switch 2, you'll obviously have that already, but if you're buying this as a cheap dock for a second room, you'll need to factor into your budget another $34.99 / £24.99 for the power adapter, plus an HDMI 2.1 cable (the ultra high speed variety).</p>
<p>Setup is as simple as you'd expect. Connect the cables, turn your TV on, and boom. It works. In fact, I had to reconnect the console a couple of times — apparently a quirk that's been ironed out with <a href="https://antank.net/pages/s3-max-firmware-update">a firmware update</a> I've subsequently run according to the <a href="https://antank.net/pages/s3-max-firmware-update-guide-for-windows">instructions on Antack's website</a> — but then it just functioned as advertised.</p>

<p>A little blue LED on the front indicates that everything's powered up. The S3 supports 4K (8K, in fact, according to the blurb, although you won't get that out of your Switch and I've got no way to display 8K content) and up to 120Hz output - although the Switch 2 can only manage 120fps at 1080p, and you'll need a 120Hz+-capable TV, naturally. Several hours of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a> delivered image quality on a 55-inch LG OLED that looked indistinguishable from the official dock to my eyes. HDR fired up just as with the standard offering, and everything just worked.</p>
<p>Back to the unit itself, Antank's website blurb mentions a "spring-buffered docking port", although I can't see any evidence of a spring on my unit. The connection at the bottom is totally rigid and fits the console port snugly once you seat the thing correctly, which can take a couple of tries.</p>
<p>Having the system 'unsheathed', you'll definitely note the heat it's pumping out in a way you may not when it's resting in Nintendo's dock. The S3 effectively blocks the console's air intakes along the bottom edge, which gave me pause, but temperature-wise, the fact that the system isn't wrapped in black plastic helps disperse heat from the casing and "provides better cooling than the original charging dock", according to Antank. I don't have the equipment to measure that, unfortunately, and I'd question if the cooling is 'better' than Nintendo's dock, but it seemed roughly the same to me from a volume and temperature perspective.</p>
<p>Switching to handheld mode by hitting the round button on the rear, I noticed the console's fan whirring up more in the summer heat. Given the fact that you can charge via the top USB-C port anyway, I'd prefer to have those intakes uncovered in tabletop mode, personally. Yes, a cable sticking out the top isn't aesthetically pleasing, but I'd rather not tax my still-relatively-new system more than necessary when it's not outputting to the TV. Perhaps I'm being overly cautious, but honestly, I don't see much point in the tabletop button when that's built into the console as-is.</p>

<p>The size reduction is a boon, certainly, but the S3 does come with some minor irritations. Firstly, you'll need to hold the dock down before pulling to remove the console - there's no slide-in/slide-out here. The tight fit means that the S3 doesn't work with third-party cases, either, so you'll need to remove them beforehand. Also, the dock doesn’t seem to communicate with the TV to wake it from standby, if that’s something you’re used to with the standard dock.</p>
<p>While three rubber 'feet' prevent it from slipping, the dock relies on the power and HDMI cables being connected to provide stability and prevent everything toppling backwards at the slightest touch. Obviously, the Switch 2 has its own kickstand, so using the S3 as a makeshift stand doesn't make sense anyway - just be cautious when you're setting things up and don't put your system in the dock until the cables are connected.</p>
<p>And that's it. It's definitely more of a travel accessory in my eyes; if I were in the market for a second dock for the home, I'd probably pay the extra for the slide-in/out convenience (and the necessary cables) of the official option. If you're the kind of person eager to travel as light as possible, or who feels a missed opportunity when playing your Switch 2 in the shadow of a big hotel-room TV, the S3 might be for you, though.</p>
<p>And even factoring in the necessary extras, you're still a fair way off the $124.99 / £92.99 that Nintendo wants for a second dock with those essentials included. For the budget-conscious gamer, then, or travellers who fancy being able to hook up on the fly, it's a good option.</p>
