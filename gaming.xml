            <p>Chinese megacorp <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> has doubled down on its assertions that it is not a Chinese military company, saying that if the US Department of Defense does not "resolve any misunderstanding", it will "undertake legal proceedings".</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://static.www.tencent.com/uploads/2025/01/07/ed277c23e9fe0fc870fb9f02350e7658.pdf">public statement</a> - which the company said it makes on a "voluntary basis" - it stressed the firm was "neither a Chinese military company nor a military-fusion contributor to the Chinese defence industrial base" and that while the allegation "does not affect [Tencent's] business", the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-labels-tencent-as-a-chinese-military-company">the US Department of Defense made a "mistake" when it publicly classified the firm as a Chinese military company</a>.</p>
<p>Initially, the company insisted that the inclusion on the list was simply a misunderstanding, but this subsequent statement takes a much firmer line, saying: "The Company intends to initiate a Reconsideration Process to correct this mistake.</p>
<p>"During the process, it will engage in discussions with the U.S. Department of Defense to resolve any misunderstanding, and if necessary, will undertake legal proceedings to remove the company from the CMC List. The company will make further announcement(s) as and when appropriate."</p><p>As Tom reminded us when this first bubbled up last week, Tencent's reach across the global video games industry is enormous. It owns <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> developer Riot Games, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> maker Funcom and UK outfit Sumo Digital, in addition to several of its own companies, such as Pokémon Unite maker Timi Studios. It is also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-discussing-buyout-options-with-tencent">in discussions with Ubisoft over a potential stock buyout</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A development build for Titan Quest 2 has been leaked online. </p>



<p>First spotted by <a href="https://en.gamegpu.com/game/v-set-utekla-sborka-titan-quest-2-beta-3-1-for-developers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameGPU</a>, the build is a beta version of the game from early November. This build, dupped Beta 3.1, doesn’t feature any multiplayer aspects. Rather, it’s deployment was for internal testing of various gameplay features. You can watch some of the leaked gameplay <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVIDMQ_DNYQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">if you’d like</a> should it not be taken offline.</p>



<p>Obviously, it’s not a final build of the game and players should expect changes between what they see and what they’ll get.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to THQ Nordic and developer Grimlore Games for comment on the reported leak. As of publishing, however, no response has been received.</p>



<p>A sequel to 2006’s Titan Quest, fans have been waiting nearly 20 years for the next game in the series. The mythology-themed action RPG <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-titan-quest-2-will-not-feature-pay-to-win-or-loot-box-mechanics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won’t feature any</a> pay-to-win or loot boxes, according to its developers.</p>



<p>“We do despise this with a passion,” Grimlore Games said. “There will never ever be any monetization mechanic in the game, urging you to spend money on any gameplay-related item to give anybody an advantage.”</p>



<p>Regarding its planned early access release, they added that they want players involved from the start, and for the game to “stand its own ground”.</p>



<p>“We want Titan Quest 2 to stand its own ground within the ARPG genre and we are convinced that there is only one way to pull it off: swarm intelligence,” they said.</p>



<p>Titan Quest 2 is scheduled to launch in sometime in 2025, and will be available for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. An exact release date has yet to be announced. </p>

            <p>Awesome Games Done Quickly has "come to a thrilling close", securing an incredible $2,556,305 - that's £2.1m - for the Prevent Cancer Foundation.</p>
<p>The week-long fundraiser wrapped up last night with a speedrun of Super Metroid after attracting over 2000 in-person attendees and "tens of thousands" of viewers on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>.</p>

<p>Speedrunners came from all over the world to "race through a bevy of games new and old", often with "zany incentives and challenges to drive donations", including a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4AomNJHzHk">full-blown live concert</a> during <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crazy-taxi">Crazy Taxi</a>, Dr. Doot playing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> with a saxophone as a controller - which is embedded above - and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmrIvD1UNFI">an opera performance by trained singer Xem</a> after completing his <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ratchet-clank">Ratchet &amp; Clank</a>: Going Commando run. </p>

<p>Since 2010, Games Done Quick has raised more than $54 million (£44.2m) for charities worldwide, including Doctors Without Borders, Malala Fund, Organization for Autism Research, and more.</p>
<p>Next up is Back to Black, the first all-Black speedrunning charity event, which will run 6th-9th February and benefit racial justice nonprofit Race Forward. Summer Games Done Quick returns to Minneapolis, Minnesota to raise funds for Doctors Without Borders in July.</p>

<p>Peanut Butter speedran Gyromite, a puzzle platformer released on the NES, in 26 minutes and 24 seconds, which is around a minute slower than his own world record, but well within the 30-minute slot he'd been allocated.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The latest trailer for Atomfall, Rebellion’s upcoming open-world survival shooter, has emerged online. It’s a seven-minute trailer that explores the game’s core mechanics, including interactions with NPCs, crafting and upgrading items, traversing quests, and dealing with factions.</p>



<p>It’s a fantastic glimpse into this upcoming title, which is set to be released in March and is coming to Xbox Game Pass on day one. I was fortunate to play Atomfall at Gamescom and speak to the developers – I can attest to how stellar this game is.</p>



<p>And yes, it’s kind of like Fallout in the UK.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-prepare-for-atomfall">Prepare for Atomfall</h2>



<p>Atomfall is <strong>kind of </strong>like Fallout, but it’s perfectly unique. It’s set in the UK’s Lake District, which means it’s an idyllic game with gorgeous vistas and sumptuous, lush environments. It’s an alternate history game, taking the real-world Windscale Nuclear Disaster of 1957 and making it something otherworldly and almost ethereal.</p>



<p>From tussling with brutal ‘raiders’ in above-ground post-apocalyptic settlements to diving into twisted, horrifying bunkers, Atomfall promises to offer a varied and diverse experience. It’s all about survival, and that means that the typical mechanics you’d expect are present:</p>



<ul>
<li>Scavenging, buying, and bartering for resources</li>



<li>Upgrading and repairing weapons and other items</li>



<li>Looting and trading across the open world</li>



<li>Building a character that suits your playstyle</li>



<li>Managing weight, health, and tools</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the full video:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Introducing Atomfall | Official Gameplay Overview Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iCGyfXGPSvc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>I’m a huge Fallout fan, and I’m mourning the immense weight on our plates until Fallout 5 comes out. While Atomfall isn’t technically a <strong>fully </strong>post-apocalyptic game set in a nuclear wasteland, it’s damn close. Most importantly, it <strong>looks </strong>like a Fallout game, featuring robots, some bizarre weapons, kooky faction members, and a branching, winding story filled with side content.</p>



<p>In some ways, it’s a blend between Fallout and STALKER.</p>



<p>When I played Atomfall at Gamescom, I was immediately won over. Not only does it look stunning, but it plays well, and as it’s a survival game at heart, decision-making is key. Should you take a cricket bat and try to overpower a guard in a settlement to get a gun before using a few rounds to fight the others, or should you try and stealth-kill everyone in the camp? Or avoid it entirely? It’s up to you.</p>



<p>Atomfall will be released on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5 and PC on March 27.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[CI Games is The Latest Company To Rebel Against ‘Forced DEI’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/force-dei-in-gaming-ci-games-company/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ci-games-is-the-latest-company-to-rebel-against-%E2%80%98forced-dei%E2%80%99.1080219/</guid>

<p>Recently, Arrowhead Studios’ CCO, Johan Pilestedt, spoke out against forcing DEI into games. He explained that ‘if it doesn’t add to the game experience, it detracts’, suggesting that titles with forced DEI aren’t ‘good games’.</p>



<p>Now, CI Games, the publisher behind Lords of the Fallen, has taken a similar stance against DEI in gaming. In a recent investors chat, the company’s global marketing director, Ryan Hill, took an authoritative tone, clearly stating that the company won’t integrate ‘any social or political agencies into these experiences’ because it’s just too risky.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-many-players-do-not-appreciate-this">‘Many Players Do Not Appreciate This’</h2>



<p>In a statement secured by <a href="https://strefainwestorow.pl/czaty-inwestorskie/20250108/ci-games-marek-tyminski" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Strefa Inwestorów</a> during a recent CI Games investor call, Ryan Hill, who heads up marketing on a global scale for the firm, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>While some videogames have recently taken the opportunity to embed social or political agendas within their experiences, it is clear that many players do not appreciate this, and as a result, we have seen a number of high profile releases underperforming commercially during the last year alone.</p>



<p>Our games will always be developed to maximise player enjoyment and commercial success, and as such, we will not be integrating any social or political agencies into these experiences going forward having observed the high risk this can present.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Like Arrowhead’s Johan Pilestedt, Hill recognised that ‘shoehorning’ DEI into games to tick a box or fulfil an agenda can do more harm than good, as we’ve seen in recent years. It’s one of the reasons why many games are labelled ‘woke’ and subsequently review-bombed.</p>



<p>In a follow-up post on social media, CI Games’ CEO, <a href="https://x.com/tyminski_marek/status/1877836661305819433" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marek Tyminski</a>, reiterated that the company <strong>will not </strong>integrate DEI elements in their games just to fit a political or social agenda.</p>



<p>Do you think forced DEI is a huge problem in games, or is it being blown up too much? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

			<p>NetEase's free-to-play superhero shooter Marvel Rivals continues to perform extremely well. Its launch month <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-remains-one-of-top-played-games-across-3-platforms-in-us-sonic-frontiers-gets-resurgence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was already great</a>, having registered over 20 million players across all platforms, but the debut of Season 1 has pushed it even further. A few hours ago, the game pulverized its <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-path-of-exile-2-and-marvel-rivals-all-broke-records-this-weekend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prior concurrency record</a> (480K players) on Steam, setting a new peak at 644K online players on Valve's platform, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2767030/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to SteamDB</a>.</p>
<p>The first season began just two days ago with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-season-1-begins-january-10-adds-fantastic-four-to-roster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arrival of the Fantastic Four</a>: Mister Fantastic (who has been assigned to the Duelist class in the game), Human Torch (also a Duelist), the Thing (Vanguard), and the Invisible Woman (Strategist). The addition of these highly popular Marvel characters, who are soon getting their own movie in the MCU, is sure to be a big reason for the further surge in popularity.</p>
<p>But there's more. The developers have added an all-new game mode titled Doom Match. Here, 8 to 12 players battle on a single map, each belonging to a different faction, and all factions are hostile to each other. Players earn points by knocking out enemies, and at the end of the match, the top 50% of players by default is considered the winning side.</p>
<p>Season 1 also introduced a seasonal event called Midnight Features. Players can complete the seasonal activities to unlock limited-time rewards, including exclusive galleries, costume, spray, unit, nameplate, and more. Starting yesterday, Twitch users may even unlock exclusive Drop rewards, such as the Hela: Will of Galacta spray, nameplate, and costume, and more.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/unnamed-1-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Needless to say, Season 1 came with its own Battle Pass, which features more than twice the amount of content of the Season 0 pass, according to NetEase. The so-called Eternal Night Fall Luxury Battle Pass includes 10 costumes and their related content, such as sprays and emotes.&nbsp; The price for the Season 1 Luxury Battle Pass is set at 990 Lattice and players will receive 600 Lattice and 600 Units back by completing it. The good news is that the developers have introduced a mechanism for Battle Pass and Chrono Tokens that ensures that Luxury Battle Passes never expire. Moreover, Tokens purchased with Lattice are retained under certain conditions.</p>
<p>Lastly, the Chinese website Game Look <a href="http://www.gamelook.com.cn/2025/01/562110" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> an estimate of how much Marvel Rivals might have earned in its first month. They anticipated $54.5 million earned through Steam, $27.2 through PlayStation 5, and $2.7 through Xbox Series S|X. Considering that it's also available on the Epic Games Store and through its own PC client, Game Look believes total earnings outside China were around $100 million. When factoring in the estimated earnings from the Chinese version of the game, the total goes up to $136 million. Should the game keep up this pace, it could turn into a franchise capable of earning over $1 billion per year, although that would be no small feat, since live service games often experience downturns in player interest.</p>
<p>By the way, Marvel Rivals can now be played via NVIDIA's GeForce NOW cloud platform, and it has been confirmed that support for NVIDIA's new <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-8x-faster-dlss-3-multi-frame-generation-enhanced-upscaling-rtx-20-above/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation</a> tech for GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards will be coming soon.</p>

<p>When developer Full Circle <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-latest-skate-entry-is-live-service-free-to-play-game">first began sharing details</a> of its new Skate project - which is officially known as Skate, rather than <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/skate-4">Skate 4</a> - back in 2022, the studio explained it wasn't "a sequel", nor "a remake, a reboot, [or] a prequel". Instead, it was described as an "authentic evolution" of the series intended to reflect "where skateboarding and gaming is in the real world".</p>
<p>Skate will be available on PlayStation, Xbox, PC (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-stake-is-coming-to-pc-via-steam">including Steam</a>), and mobile devices when it releases in early access later this year - some 15 years after the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/skate-3">Skate 3</a>. It will also boast <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-latest-skate-entry-is-live-service-free-to-play-game">cross-play and cross-progression support</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The French Revolution is an ideal period of history to set a video game. Warring factions, apocalyptic-like societal collapse, buckets of gore, surely everything a good video game story needs. Sadly, Liberté entirely fails to capitalise on the juicy era in which it is set. Indeed, it succeeds accidentally in only one aspect, just like the French Revolution, Liberté is an absolute mess.</p>
<p><iframe title="Liberte - PlayStation Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NXli7PqJeC4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Ostensibly a top-down isometric hack n’ slash action RPG, Liberté is best described as an experience to be avoided. Visually the game is lumbered with the blocky, charmless visuals of a bad PS2 game. Despite the rudimentary graphics however, Liberté made my PS5 sweat like a member of the aristocracy paying a visit to Madame Guillotine. Frequent painful frame drops, several second freezes, and ominous black loading screens plague the far too long run time. Characters regularly drop in and out of existence, as if they are teleporting, only they shouldn’t be. At points, Liberté isn’t far off being unplayable.</p>


<p>Combat is basic and tedious, with no sense of impact from attacks. Player character Rene goes up against the same obviously cloned French Soldiers again and again. A dash and a combo or two are your lot, but frankly, so easy is the game that these skills are likely all you’ll need to storm through each tiny mostly linear level. Like a peasant rampaging through the Bastille, the game offers no resistance. Oh, other than by crashing and wiping out all your progress of course.</p>


<p>Liberté has one good idea, and even that it bungles. Rene is awarded abilities by acquiring cards from a deck. To activate the abilities, the player must elect to destroy a number of the cards in order to equip a favoured power-up. It could be a neat risk and reward mechanic, requiring the player to carefully consider the combat situation they are facing and respond accordingly. Problem is, your initial combo is so effective you don’t even need to use your abilities. Worse still, these powers, despite sounding cool – wielding a guitar as a weapon, lobbing a multitude of axes – visually they are limp and indistinct, offering no thrill in their use at all.</p>
<p>The story is nonsensical, the dialogue resolutely boresome, the characters flat and vapid, and the whole experience feels like little has changed since the game was in early access two years ago.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Avoid Liberté like a one-way ticket to the Guillotine. Instead, if you want to experience the French Revolution, read a book instead. It will be more interactive, the loading times will be much improved, and the graphics will probably be better too.	</p></div>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/evercade-unveils-its-latest-cartridge-release-%E2%80%93-indie-heroes-collection-4.1080186/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/12/evercade-unveils-its-latest-cartridge-release-indie-heroes-collection-4/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The Evercade family went from strength to strength in 2024, between the arrival of new hardware in the shape of the revised EXP-R, the tabletop Evercade Alpha, and the Gameboy-styled HyperMegaTech Super Pockets, as well as the steady stream of new cartridges to play on your system of choice. That only looks to continue in 2025, and while they’re teasing us with new announcements just around the corner, the first of this year’s software releases is Indie Heroes Collection 4, a lovingly put-together collection of modern-retro titles from a batch of indie developers.</p>
<p><iframe title="Evercade - Indie Heroes Collection 4 - Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IuNvVeX5iEE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This collection includes a stonking 11 different games, covering a range of genres, including puzzlers, platformers and action-adventures, meaning you’re going to have this particular cartridge stuck in the slot for weeks to come. There’s even a bit of Jane Austen in there, so you can assume that it’s also educational and perfect for anyone studying English Literature*. (*Evercade offers no guarantee of improved educational performance.)</p>
<p>The games on Indie Heroes Collection 4 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Curse of Illmoore Bay – Battle supernatural forces in this action-packed platformer.</li>
<li>Block’Em Sock’Em – A fun and fast-paced puzzle brawler where strategy meets chaos.</li>
<li>Nyghtmare: The Ninth King – Explore a haunting realm in this dark fantasy action-adventure.</li>
<li>Jane Austen’s 8-bit Adventure – Dive into a charming, literary-inspired journey filled with wit and puzzles.</li>
<li>Collie Defense – Strategically protect your territory in this quirky defense game.</li>
<li>Flea!2 – Bounce back into action with this zany sequel to the cult classic.</li>
<li>Batty Zabella – Embrace the spooky vibes in this delightfully eerie adventure.</li>
<li>Murtop – Explosive arcade fun meets burrowing mayhem in this high-energy retro game.</li>
<li>Soko Banana – A puzzling delight where you help a clever monkey navigate complex mazes.</li>
<li>Starseed – Embark on an intergalactic journey in this sci-fi action adventure.</li>
<li>Block Droppin’ – Test your reflexes in this addictive block-dropping arcade game.</li>
</ul>


<p>Sean Cleaver, Head of Marketing for Blaze Entertainment said, “With Indie Heroes Collection 4, we continue to celebrate the incredible creativity of the indie gaming community,” He continued, “This collection offers something for everyone, from gripping adventures to mind-bending puzzles and nostalgic platformers. It’s a testament to the thriving modern retro scene.”</p>
<p>The new cartridge will be part of the red-coloured home console line and be numbered #43, slotting perfectly into this awesome physical collection. The price of this cartridge will be £19.99, $24.99 and €24.99, and it will release at some point in February 2025. <a href="https://evercade.co.uk/cartridges/indie-heroes-collection-4/">Pre-orders will open on January 30th from Evercade retailers</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Game of Thrones: Kingsroad – last day to sign up for the closed beta]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/12/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-last-day-to-sign-up-for-the-closed-beta/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-%E2%80%93-last-day-to-sign-up-for-the-closed-beta.1080180/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/12/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-last-day-to-sign-up-for-the-closed-beta/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The Game of Thrones furore seems like a long time ago. The original book, A Song of Ice and Fire was released in 1996, while the TV show finished in 2019. Still, “You know nothing, Jon Snow” remains part of our daily banter, and the series legacy on the page and the screen is as strong as ever, thanks to the ongoing House of the Dragon show filling in many of the world’s blanks. Netease are hoping to continue the franchise’s popularity with the arrival of Game of Thrones: Kingsroad, and today is the last day you can <a href="https://gameofthrones.netmarble.com/en/cbt?utm_source=ign&amp;utm_medium=news&amp;utm_campaign=cbt">sign up for the upcoming closed beta test</a> for the game.</p>
<p>Game of Thrones: Kingsroad is set for release later this year on iOS, Android and PC, and this closed beta will be the first time for players to go hands-on with the title. It was announced very recently at The Game Awards show, with the accompanying trailer certainly looking the part, capturing the bleak and wintry world of northern Westeros.</p>
<p><iframe title="[Game of Thrones: Kingsroad] Gameplay Sneak Peek" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I7HUNq-H0mQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Game of Thrones: Kingsroad will see you take on the role of an unknown new character, who, through a quirk of fate, becomes the heir to House Tyre, a small noble house in the north of Westeros. There’ll be a fully featured character creation tool, so you can get your heir looking just right, and players will be able to select from one of three classes inspired by iconic roles within the original series – Sellsword, Knight or Assassin. There’s going to be a focus on player vs player combat, and it looks as though it has a touch of For Honor about it, though whether it turns out to be as in-depth or challenging as Ubisoft’s game remains to be seen.</p>
<p>The Closed Beta will run January 16 to January 22nd for Android and PC, while the game will eventually launch on iOS as well. Netease are known for creating visually impressive titles, and their take on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/05/16/ni-no-kuni-cross-worlds-review-ios-android-pc/">Ni No Kuni</a> was absolutely beautiful, even if the gameplay couldn’t match up to the original PS3 release. Game of Thrones has never managed to turn in a truly great video game adapatation, though the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/11/19/telltales-game-of-thrones-episode-six-the-ice-dragon-review/">Telltale series</a> did a decent enough job of bringing the world to life.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in seeing how Game of Thrones: Kingsroad turns out, this is the perfect chance, though you only have <a href="https://gameofthrones.netmarble.com/en/cbt?utm_source=ign&amp;utm_medium=news&amp;utm_campaign=cbt">today to get your sign-up in</a>! If you do take part then you’ll receive exclusive rewards for your character once the game officially launches later this year.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[CDL Teams Try To Crack Down on Snaking Once Again]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cdl-teams-crack-down-on-snaking/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cdl-teams-try-to-crack-down-on-snaking-once-again.1080177/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cdl-teams-crack-down-on-snaking/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Snaking has been a huge issue in the Call of Duty League for a good year or two. It’s a mechanic that’s so easily abused, and for many of today’s competitors, it’s a muscle memory or reflex action that can leave them berated by their peers. During the CDL Minor I tournament that’s unfolding right now, C9’s ‘Sib’ blatantly snaked, and other pro players called that action out.</p>



<p>On social media, LAT’s Ghosty revealed he’d started a vote for Cloud 9 NY to be <strong>blacklisted </strong>from pro scrims for one week because of Sib’s snaking on Hacienda during a round of Hardpoint.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-uphold-the-law">Uphold the Law</h2>



<p>To give credit to Sib, he’s not trying to avoid the branding he’s received from Ghosty on social media. By way of a response to what Ghosty said, Sib held his hands up:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Nah yeah im hearing you. No justifying me on the lambo</p>



<p>But like Daniel how long is this “precedent” really lasting?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He’s referring to this moment:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Bizarrely, Sib requested that Ghosty keeps ‘the same energy all year’, explaining that players don’t care about GAs ‘come tournament time’, and that by COD Champs, ‘nobody says anything’. Ghosty came back with an authoritative tone:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Can’t disagree about champs with it being the last event but I just want to set precedent for this since we always let shit slide in prior seasons- We’re discussing it in chat but it WILL NOT be one week as that’s not similar to last years punishments</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Other pro players like Royal Ravens’ Gwinn came onto the thread. He asked jokingly if Ghosty is ‘officially GA commish’, which could be a spot that sorely needs filling.</p>



<p>TJHaly, who was a ‘victim’ of Sib’s snaking, said <a href="https://x.com/GGBreakingPoint/status/1878259655790760423" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in a post-match interview</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think I just needed to snake a bit more on that map to get some more kills or something. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Do you think snaking is still a legitimate concern in Call of Duty esports, or should it be discredited as just another mechanic? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals%E2%80%99-season-1-arrives-with-new-costumes-maps-and-more.1080168/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/12/marvel-rivals-season-1-arrives-with-new-costumes-maps-and-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Marvel Rivals is good, isn’t it? More chaotic and unbalanced than its inspiration, Overwatch, but that means it’s also wilder, less prescribed, and arguably a lot of fun. It helps that Marvel Rivals is packed full of recognisable comic-book characters, and the development team at NAME are already adding more to that roster with the arrival of Season 1 – Empire of Eternal Night, with new characters Mister Fantastic and Invisible Woman representing the Fantastic Four in a fan-friendly way. Seriously, between this and Pedro Pascale, expect to see a lot of Mr Fantastic fan art in the next few months.</p>
<p><iframe title="Season 1 Battle Pass: Darkhold | Official Trailer | Marvel Rivals" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FWR6mwGDTI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The first, and perhaps most important arrival with Season 1 – Empire of Eternal Night is the new Battle Pass, entitled Darkhold. This book of the damned is thoroughly evil, so each of the new character skins gives them a darker vibe than you might be used to. Wolverine definitely has something of a Van Helsing vibe, while Moon Knight’s outfit is more like an eclipse than normal. As a Rocket Racoon main I’m looking forward to nabbing his Steampunk outfit for sure.</p>
<p>If you’re not trying to pimp out your current character, perhaps you’re planning on playing as one of the new ones. Duelist-class Mister Fantastic brings some Dhalsim-like stretchy melee to the mix, his limbs shooting out to smack enemies around, while he can also pump himself up to take more damage. His special sees him repeatedly bouncing up and down on a controllable area, which looks as though it’s going to cause absolute chaos.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mister Fantastic: Stretching Into Action | Character Reveal | Marvel Rivals" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQjjy1po-ik?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s also Mister Fantastic’s partner to think about. Sue Storm appears – or is that disappears? – as Invisible Woman, a Strategist class character bringing concussive blasts and shields to bear against her opponents. She can fire individual blasts, or use a powerful push to force enemies out of the way or bounce them off the side of a map which looks deeply annoying already.  Her special can hide an area from sight, stopping external characters from being able to see in, while trapping those inside.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Invisible Woman: Unseen Force | Character Reveal | Marvel Rivals" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MhgYIMEG1Zo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Once you’ve settled on who you’re playing as, there’s two new maps for you to explore. The first of these is the Sanctum Sanctorum, with Dr Strange’s mystic home appearing so that you can make a horrible mess of it. Stalking the halls, players can expect to see a variety of odd and unusual sights, while checking out a range of fan-teasing artwork, set off by a portrait of Dr Strange and his dog, Bats.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Empire Of Eternal Night: The Mystical Sanctum Sanctorum | Map Reveal | Marvel Rivals" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pVlerpIo3Pk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The second new map is Midtown. Empire of the Eternal Night has seen Dracula and his cohort attacking New York, and here recognisable Marvel landmarks like the Baxter Building have clearly been having a hard time of it. There’s plenty of destruction for you to work your way around, all topped off by a cheeky inverted A on the Avengers building where the horizontal line blinks in and out so it looks like a ‘V’. For vampire, right?</p>
<p>Marvel Rivals Season 1 – Empire of the Eternal Night launches on January 10th on all platforms, and also coincides with the game’s launch on GeForce Now, so you can indulge in the darker side of Marvel wherever you are!</p>

            <p>Pure Rock Crawling is about steering off road vehicles across rocky terrain. It's about pumping the gas pedal and wrenching the steering wheel just so, such that you lurch forward and over the obstacles, rather than tumbling backwards. It's MudRunner without the mud, with a knockabout simplicity presumably as a result of its apparently one-man development team. It launched last October but I hadn't heard of it until today, when a new map was added, and now I want to play it.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/824720/Pure_Rock_Crawling/">Steam page</a> boasts of the features you'd want: it's got soft body physics on the tires, suspension that you can tweak as if you know what you're doing, and a range of different kinds of terrain to free roam around. The latest hunk of terrain is a map called Ghost Mine, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/824720/view/518576368664969762">based on photogrammetry assets created by the game's maker after a trip to Death Valley</a>.
</p>
<p>It seems like Pure Rock Crawling was released in Early Access in April 2018 and hit 1.0 in October 2024. I really don't know how I've never heard of it before, but it looks like its 1.0 release hasn't stopped there being a trickle of new updates in the months since. 
</p>
<p>I liked <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/spintires">Spintires</a> back when it came out some ten years ago, then lost track of it when it became mired in the mud of controversy and was succeeded by MudRunners. There's something supremely satisfying about getting up and over an obstacle, whether you're driving a big rig or even a dirt bike in a game like Trials. I have no interest in high scores or improving my times, but I will absolutely have a go at hauling myself up a mountain.
</p>
<p>Pure Rock Crawling is 50% off to coincide with the release of the new map, making it £6.39/$7.49/€7.39 at the time of writing.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-minecraft-seeds-java-survival-seeds">Minecraft</a> is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-rps-100-2024">the best PC game</a>, according to me and the RPS staff who dare not cross me. I played it for three hours today and, among the many build challenges and adventures, a small story formed around a baby pig. We named him Porky, we caged him as our pet, and in an unfortunate accident, we watched as he fell to his death from the sky island that was our home. RPS in peace, Porky.
</p>
<p>How many befriended pigs like Porky have there been across the last several hundred hours of play? I'm not sure - dozens, hundreds - but soon such pigs might have a new form. After 15 years, Mojang are adding new types of pig to Minecraft.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Specifically, it's getting two new pig variants. The cold pig is coated with fur and will be found in cold and frozen biomes; the warm pig will found in the sandy biomes and is rust-brown. Mojang are calling it the "warm pig" because they know that, fundamentally, all pigs are hot.
</p>
<p>These cute porkchops are part of a handful of minor updates coming to Minecraft, which are all currently available to test in the Java Edition (and only some available to test in Bedrock).
</p>
<p>Forest biomes are also now getting falling leaves, which will flitter from the tree canopy and leave leaf litter on the ground. Leaf litter can be used to decorate blocks and rustles when you walk through it. In meadows and birch forests, you'll also find wildflowers, which have multiple stages of growth and can be gathered to craft into dye. Only the falling leaves are present in Bedrock preview and beta currently.
</p><p>Lastly, the Lodestone crafting recipe is being amended. This block, which compasses point towards to help players find their way home, previously required eight chiseled stone bricks and a netherite ingot to make. Netherite isn't easy to come by in Minecraft, requiring a long and lucky visit to the Nether to obtain Ancient Debris. Given that the Lodestone is meant to help players with the simple task of not getting lost near their home, that seems a bit daft, so a Lodestone can now be crafted with a simple iron ingot in place of the netherite instead. This turns a late-game item into something early or mid, which makes more sense.
</p>
<p>All of these changes are small, but god, I play so much of this game now. I am pumped for there to be leaves on the ground. My hobbit homes are going to look so quaint with leaves on the ground outside.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> received a patch earlier this week <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvel-rivals-patch-makes-hulk-less-hulky-hawkeye-less-shooty-and-the-goddess-of-death-deader-just-in-time-for-season-1">which made Hulk less hulky</a> and paved the way for the launch of its first season. It also did something else: disabled the mods players had been using to add custom skins to the game.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-season-1-update-appears-to-have-disabled-mods-much-to-the-dismay-of-fans-of-custom-skins">IGN</a>, players are reporting that the latest update adds asset hash checking, effectively blocking the use of edited files inside the game.
</p>
<p>The move maybe comes as no surprise. Marvel Rivals is a free-to-play hero shooter that makes money by selling premium skins to players. Allowing mods enables players to make versions of those skins themselves for free. A number of such skins have proven <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/marvelrivals/mods/">popular on Nexus Mods</a> since Rivals' launch last year, including replacing Iron Man with Vegeta and the Winter Soldier with CJ from GTA: San Andreas.
</p>
<p>I can think of no live service game (of this type) that allows this kind of modding, and the game's terms of use have forbidden mods since the off. Publishers NetEase have also stated publicly that players risk being banned for modifying any game files.
</p><p>Inevitable or not, I am forced to write my little spiel once more: that games are better with mod support, and first-person games thrived once upon a time in part due to mods, and all of this used to be fields. I honestly doubt the existence of some daft, free, user-made skins is going to eat into Marvel Rivals' bottomline, and I'm sure there are technical workarounds that would allow the practice without threatening the integrity of online matches. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a> has thousands of mods, for example.
</p>
<p>One supposes that there's another issue here: that license holder Disney wouldn't be too pleased if the Marvel characters they've leant NetEase end up covered in visible nipples. Cowards.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
