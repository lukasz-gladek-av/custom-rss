<p>The deal, which is expected to close in Q1 FY 2027, was confirmed earlier today, following a report last week from <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/ea-private-deal-buyout-video-game-maker-808aefec?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAjGI4bh2ChypG-9gaU4qrQZFignKjZm8EjJFqEKJbszfMv0Uyk0spCKAkIGRcw%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68d6e0aa&amp;gaa_sig=Zf9usHKAPLc-xSauIbct6cEJae6QEXZDp84TM7SJsSlbIQtorAg_Hxy8OCUW_MYx6L4o8fLt5FyADejiqmwsQA%3D%3D">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>. The company is most famous for its series of sports titles, <strong>The Sims</strong>, <strong>Battlefield</strong>, and for publishing BioWare's <strong>Dragon Age</strong> and <strong>Mass Effect</strong> series.</p>
<p>Notably, the deal is made up of an equity investment of $36 billion dollars, with a $20 billion dollar debt in EA's name. This, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lzy2ieztws2w">as Schreier puts it</a>, could lead to layoffs, more monetisation, and cost-cutting measures.</p><div><figure data-videoid="zEeK-8I84eI" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zEeK-8I84eI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zEeK-8I84eI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zEeK-8I84eI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed61cb68viysom&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>835k</span></a></p>
</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Andrew Wilson, Chairman &amp; CEO of Electronic Arts has shared this statement on the deal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Our creative and passionate teams at EA have delivered extraordinary experiences for hundreds of millions of fans, built some of the world’s most iconic IP, and created significant value for our business. This moment is a powerful recognition of their remarkable work.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, we will continue to push the boundaries of entertainment, sports, and technology, unlocking new opportunities. Together with our partners, we will create transformative experiences to inspire generations to come. I am more energized than ever about the future we are building.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The PIF previously owned 9.9% of the company and was already the third-largest institutional owner of EA. As a reminder, the PIF owns stakes in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/saudi-arabias-pif-further-reduces-its-stake-in-nintendo">Nintendo</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/02/5percent-of-capcom-acquired-by-saudi-arabias-public-investment-fund">Capcom</a>, Embracer Group, and Take-Two Interactive.</p>
<p>Turqi Alnowaiser, the PIF's Deputy Governor and Head of International Investments, says that “PIF has demonstrated a strong commitment to [global gaming and esports] sectors, and this partnership will help further drive EA’s long-term growth, while fueling innovation within the industry on a global scale.”</p>
<p>In terms of the other acquirers, Silver Lake is one of the companies potentially involved with TikTok's US spin-off, while Affinity Partners is the investment firm founded by the current US President's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.</p></section>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silent-hill-f-reaches-1-million-copies-sold-faster-than-the-silent-hill-2-remake.1311475/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Silent Hill f officially arrived on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S this past September 25, 2026, <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/corporate/ja/news/topics/20250929/">and according to Konami, by Sept. 26, 2025</a>, the latest entry in the Silent Hill franchise and the first one to make several big changes such as setting the game in Japan and not in the US for the first time, hit one million copies sold.</p>



<p>One million copies sold in one day is a huge milestone for what is the first new Silent Hill game in years and a continuation of the momentum that Konami was able to kickstart with the help of Bloober Team delivering above and beyond what players expected in the Silent Hill 2 Remake.</p>



<p>It took the Silent Hill 2 Remake <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-becomes-million-seller/">a week to hit one million copies sold</a>. Konami could have had no better endorsement in the return of its beloved horror series than to see the first brand-new entry hit the same sales milestones as a nostalgia-charged remake six days faster.</p>



<p>"<em>The remake of Silent Hill 2 released last year, surpassed one million units shipped worldwide within a week of its release, but Silent Hill f is growing in shipments at an even faster pace in each</em> <em>region, including Japan</em>," Konami writes in its announcement of the sales milestone.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It's good to see one of the videogame industry's most influential series make such a strong return with its last two entries, but more particularly with Silent Hill f simply because it's the first brand-new game because of how many big swings and risks it takes to change things up.</p>



<p>In our review of Silent Hill f, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-f-review-a-beautiful-nightmare/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo wrote</a>, "<em>With an engaging story full of haunting, disturbing sequences, a finely tuned balance of everything that makes survival horror great, and combat deeply rooted in resource management, Silent Hill f is a triumphant return for the series after its long hiatus. Its short length and minor PC performance issues may disappoint some, but no fan of the franchise, or the genre, should miss one of the best survival horror releases in years.</em>"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has announced the release date for the next major&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>update, and since it'll arrive not long before the spookiest day of the year, you can expect lots of creepy treats to enjoy.</p>

<p>Per a press release, Version 2.3, which will, naturally, follow on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-22-release-date" rel="nofollow">September's Version 2.2</a>, will be arriving on October 15th, bringing three brand new Agents for your team, a new map to explore, and more.</p>

<p>First and foremost, you'll be exploring the brand new Timesworn Hills area, which, as HoYoverse says, is a place where "ghost stories echo through abandoned ruins". You'll be investigating the disappearance of miners in the region, which will lead to the discovery of "unsettling truths".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-version-2.3-release-date-spook-shack.jpg?itok=fgIjtAP4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-version-2.3-release-date-spook-shack.jpg?itok=R4R73ypu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.3 will have you investigating miners' disappearances alongside the Spook Shack faction.</figcaption></figure><p>Naturally, you'll also be recruiting new Agents to your cause, starting with Lucia, an S-rank Ether Support Agent who can boost her allies' HP and damage, making her a valuable asset as you explore the Timesworn Hills.</p>

<p>She's joined by Yidhari, an S-Rank Ice Rupture Agent whose damage is boosted as her HP falls. You'll need to strike a balance between risk and safety if you want to maximize her damage potential.</p>

<p>Your final new Agent in&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.3 is Komano Manato, an A-Rank Fire Rupture Agent who gains damage as his HP scales. S-Rank Agents Vivian and Ju Fufu will also be available during this update as rerun banners.</p>

<p>You can also expect a new powered-up version of Soldier 0 - Anby, who first debuted during&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-16-march" rel="nofollow">Version 1.6</a>, as well as a new turn-based combat challenge and the return of the Snap! Shining Strike photography event.</p>




<p>News of this latest&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>update comes shortly after HoYoverse announced two brand new free-to-play games being added to its lineup, namely <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hoyoverse-honkai-nexus-anima" rel="nofollow">autochess creature-collector&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hoyoverse-honkai-nexus-anima" rel="nofollow">Honkai: Nexus Anima</a>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hoyoverse-petit-planet-cozy-life-sim" rel="nofollow">cozy life sim&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet</em></a>.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em><a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/en-us/main" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">for free right now</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, as well as mobile devices. Version 2.3 launches on October 15th across all platforms.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-didnt-wait-for-prime-big-deal-days-fire-tv-stick-hd-is-already-down-to-almost-free-2000629372</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-didn%E2%80%99t-wait-for-prime-big-deal-days-fire-tv-stick-hd-is-already-down-to-almost-free.1311460/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Lots of awesome movies that hit theaters over the summer have finally released to streaming. So if you missed them on the big screen, now’s your chance to see them on the small-to-medium screen. James Gunn’s take on<em> Superman&nbsp;</em>starring David Corenswet as the titular super-powered man arrived on HBO Max. There you can also check out Tim Robinson and Paul Rudd’s painfully awkward, intense, and hilarious <em>Friendship</em>. And Zach Cregger’s invigorating horror flick <em>Weapons&nbsp;</em>can now be rented from most places that offer digital on-demand. But in order to watch any of these, you’re gonna need something to stream to —something like Amazon’s Fire TV Stick. Right now, you can get one for dirt cheap. These things normally aren’t too pricey to begin with, starting at $35. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4359/">For a limited time, however, you can snag one for about half price at just $18.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4359/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Amazon has upgraded its line of Fire TV Sticks over the years and this is the latest model, albeit, the first in the lineup. It doesn’t support 4K, and it’s still stuck back on Wi-Fi 5. While it does only stream in Full HD 1080p, most streaming service charge extra for 4K streaming to a point where they’re not even worth it. Netflix’s premium plan is now up to $25 per month. That’s more than you’re paying for the Amazon Fire TV Stick and that’s just for a single month. You’ll likely be streaming most content in regular HD anyway, so in practice, you may not even notice the difference between getting this one or shelling out for the Fire TV Stick 4K.</p>



<h2>Xbox Games Right to Your TV</h2>
<p>One big bonus of the Fire TV Stick is it now supports Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. You no longer need an Xbox console to play Xbox games. Stream games from the cloud like&nbsp;<em>Black Myth Wukong</em>, <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, or even the newly released <em>Borderlands 4</em>. The first two are just part of Game Pass, but the latter does require you to purchase a copy.</p>
<p>If you are intrigued by the prospect of playing Xbox titles directly off the Fire TV Stick, you can consider picking up the unit bundled with a Luna Controller. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4360/">That normally goes for $105, but has also been marked down halfway to just $53</a>. You can also choose to pair a different Bluetooth controller such as the official Xbox core wireless controller. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4359/">Otherwise, just go with the standard Fire TV Stick HD, now only $18.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>There Are No Ghosts at the Grand&nbsp;</em>was revealed during this year's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">Xbox summer showcase</a>, and it was an instant highlight of the show for me. It's a mixture of reggae musical, renovation sim, and spooky mystery adventure game, and what's more, it's tiny UK studio Friday Sundae's first title.</p>

<p>I got a chance to sit down with a demo of the game, which showcases a slice of gameplay during which I (partially) renovated a hotel, sojourned down to a creepy abandoned island, and fought off monstrous chair-spider ghosts.</p>

<p>All of that might sound like tremendous fun, and I have faith that with a little extra time, it could be. Unfortunately, the demo I played is in serious need of some extra work before it's ready to open its doors to the public.</p>

<h2><em>There Are No Ghosts at the Grand&nbsp;</em>Is Ambitious as Heck</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/there-are-no-ghosts-at-the-grand-preview-renovation.jpg?itok=9gMkHCD2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/there-are-no-ghosts-at-the-grand-preview-renovation.jpg?itok=-kGJaHGy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>There Are No Ghosts at the Grand</em>'s renovation mechanics are simple, but satisfying.</figcaption></figure><p>During my time with&nbsp;<em>There Are No Ghosts at the Grand</em>'s demo, which lasts around 30 minutes, I got to experience a tasting platter showing off all three of its core pillars. It's a pretty brief demo, and I don't think it necessarily does the full scope of&nbsp;<em>No Ghosts&nbsp;</em>justice.</p>

<p>The renovation mechanics on offer here are...fine. If you're expecting the depth of something like <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/house-flipper" rel="nofollow">House Flipper</a>&nbsp;</em>or <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/powerwash-simulator" rel="nofollow"><em>PowerWash Simulator</em></a>, you're likely going to be disappointed; the systems are fairly surface-level, and they don't amount to much more than "point the right gun at the thing".</p>

<p>Still, the feelings of hoovering up loose debris or popping broken pieces of a boat back onto its hull are satisfying, and I can imagine that the areas you'll be expected to renovate will increase in complexity as you progress through the full game.</p>

<p>There's a fun little twist on the renovation mechanics whereby you need to use your house-flippin' tools to right the scenes of memories so they can progress, but again, they're not too much more than just following on-screen instructions.</p>

<p>During this demo, I didn't get much of a chance to explore <i>No Ghosts</i>' gorgeous English seaside setting, but I'm hoping that the full game will offer more incentive to wander the environs of the Grand and uncover hidden secrets. It's hard to say how well exploration and narrative will stack up since the demo is so short.</p>

<p>It's impressive that Friday Sundae is attempting to cram a reggae musical into&nbsp;<em>There Are No Ghosts at the Grand&nbsp;</em>as well, but I have to say I'm a little worried about how that element is going to pan out.</p>

<p>This demo offers one brief musical sequence, which admittedly isn't anywhere near enough to express a full opinion, but the character animation feels a little too stilted for singers to express the full range of the songs' emotions.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether Friday Sundae's game can capitalize fully on the immense potential of incorporating musical sequences into its exploration-renovation loop, but on the strength of the song snippet presented during this demo, I'm skeptical.</p>


<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/there-are-no-ghosts-at-the-grand-preview-memory.jpg?itok=s3PC3PDZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/there-are-no-ghosts-at-the-grand-preview-memory.jpg?itok=UgQfltwr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I had to restart this section multiple times because of bugs.</figcaption></figure><p>Let's get one thing out of the way first: this is a demo, and it's an early one at that.&nbsp;<em>There Are No Ghosts at the Grand&nbsp;</em>is not due to launch until 2026, so Friday Sundae has plenty of time to rid itself of some of the more bothersome bedbugs in its hotel's rooms.</p>

<p>That's a good thing, too, because I encountered no shortage of bugs during my time with this demo. I had to restart chapters multiple times due to game-breaking (demo-breaking?) progress bugs, and the starting position for one chapter restart in particular is halfway through the floor.</p>

<p>Performance-wise, my rig struggled with&nbsp;<em>No Ghosts&nbsp;</em>as well. This is perhaps an even more subjective criticism than any other I've offered so far, but I'm running an RX 9070 XT and a Ryzen 7 9700X (plus 64GB of RAM), which is way above the game's minimum specs.</p>

<p>Despite that, performance was iffy, with lots of slowdown and chugging in scenes that weren't even particularly busy. Not only that, but some sections stuttered and froze up for several seconds, and while they always righted themselves in the end, I constantly worried each hitch would be the point at which the demo crashed.</p>

<p>I couldn't find a way to change the graphical options beyond resolution upscaling, and changing those options didn't seem to alter performance for me at all. Again, though, I should stress that there's every chance you won't experience these issues. We all know how mercurial PC gaming can be.</p>

<p>At the end of the demo, Friday Sundae sets up an exciting escape sequence, and my support character yelled at me that there was no way I could take all of the things chasing me, so I should just "leg it", in his words (a colloquialism I appreciated seeing as a Brit).</p>

<p>However, when I then dispatched every enemy chasing me with relative ease,&nbsp;<em>There Are No Ghosts at the Grand&nbsp;</em>didn't seem to know what to do, so it just kind of didn't do anything for a while before a title drop anticlimactically brought the demo to a close.</p>

<p>It was a funny moment, sure, but it also made me worried about <i>No Ghosts</i>' future. Yes, there's still lots of time for Friday Sundae to fix it, but I'm not sure this demo was ready for release, at least not in my eyes. This one's going to need a lot more time in the oven.</p>

<h2><em>There Are No Ghosts at the Grand&nbsp;</em>Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/there-are-no-ghosts-at-the-grand-preview-petting.jpg?itok=PQaRA2Oy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/there-are-no-ghosts-at-the-grand-preview-petting.jpg?itok=--oLLint 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The cat is very, very cute.</figcaption></figure><p>I'm really rooting for Friday Sundae and&nbsp;<em>There Are No Ghosts at the Grand</em>. The genre mixture on offer here is so unique and so mad that I want nothing more than for this game to launch and blow me away.</p>

<p>Sadly, on the strength of this demo, I think it's got a very long way to go before it can achieve that. It's messy, janky, and glitchy, so it's safe to say that a lot of renovation is needed before this hotel is ready to admit guests, even for the demo itself.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Silent Hill f Sales Top 1m, Outpacing Silent Hill 2 Remake]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-f-sales-1m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silent-hill-f-sales-top-1m-outpacing-silent-hill-2-remake.1311427/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Konami has announced that&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f</em>, the latest entry in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>survival horror franchise, has managed to hit a major sales milestone, and it's outpacing the last big release in the series as well.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/corporate/ja/news/topics/20250929/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a> (for which we're using machine translation),&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>sales topped one million within a single day of the game's launch. Naturally, that figure includes both physical sales and digital shipments.</p>

<p>As Konami says in the press release,&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>managed to rack up a million sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-1m" rel="nofollow">in its first week</a>, which means that&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f</em>&nbsp;reached the same milestone significantly faster than its predecessor. Konami will doubtless take this as an encouraging sign for the franchise as a whole.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/silent-hill-f-sales-1m-kneeling.jpg?itok=KJEVVgw- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/silent-hill-f-sales-1m-kneeling.jpg?itok=uklUoOrg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The latest&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>game,&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f</em>, has reached a million sales already.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>went on to pass the two million sales mark <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">in January this year</a>, and if&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>continues at its current pace, then it won't take the latest title in the series too long to pass its predecessor on that milestone as well.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f</em>, it's the latest entry in the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>series, although it's technically a spinoff of the main games that doesn't require any prior knowledge to enjoy.</p>

<p>Developed by Hong Kong-based studio NeoBards, the game revolves around Hinako Shimizu, a high school student who must get to the bottom of why her sleepy town of Ebisugaoka has suddenly become wreathed in fog and populated by dangerous monsters.</p>

<p>Konami's goal with&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>was to return the franchise to its Japanese roots, hence the setting being a Japanese town rather than the more Westernized locales of prior titles.</p>




<p>News of&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f</em>'s strong sales performance will likely come as a relief to Konami; the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/konami-bloober-team-new-silent-hill" rel="nofollow">revealed back in June</a> that it's working on a remake of the original&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>alongside&nbsp;<em>SH2&nbsp;</em>remake developer Bloober Team.</p>

<p>While we wait for more on that, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2947440/SILENT_HILL_f/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/silent-hill-f/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/silent-hill-f/9n5nfrqv2hqq" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>

I think the middle section of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v"><u>GTA 5</u></a> is amazing. When we got the three characters working… I think it was not flawless, but it was so smooth, that middle section. I thought that was really amazing.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Silent Hill F Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Silent Hill f was developed by NeoBards Entertainment, while Bloober Team made the Silent Hill 2 remake. The new game is set in 1960s Japan and follows the character <a href="https://silenthill.fandom.com/wiki/Hinako_Shimizu" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hinako Shimizu </a>as she solves puzzles and fights horrible monsters.</p><p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/silent-hill-f-review-spirited-away/1900-6418411/" data-ref-id="1900-6418411">Silent Hill f review</a> scored the game a 9/10. "Silent Hill f is not just a return to form, it's a remarkable evolution; it's a visual spectacle, a mastercraft in psychological horror, a work of narrative brilliance, and a new benchmark for the Silent Hill series," reviewer Jessica Cogswell said.</p><p>No new Silent Hill games have been announced, but a movie--Return to Silent Hill--is set for release in 2026 from director Christophe Gans. He also directed 2006's Silent Hill movie. 2026 will also see the release of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-movie-release-date-cast-story/1100-6534453/" data-ref-id="1100-6534453">new Resident Evil movie from director Zach Cregger.</a></p>

            <p>A new live action <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> trailer has been released which takes shots at Call of Duty's celebrity-focused marketing strategy, introducing a squad of household names including actor Zac Efron before quickly blowing them up.</p>
<p>This squad, which also features basketball player Jimmy Butler, country singer Morgan Wallen, and MMA fighter Paddy Pimblett walk across a ravaged bridge to Smashing Pumpkin's The World Is A Vampire. They all represent one of the classic Battlefield specialist classes, with weapons covered in colourful camos and charms.</p>
<p>After Zac Efron and his crew explode, they are replaced with a collection of standard looking modern military soldier types take their place and engage in typical video game live action trailer shenanigans. It's a two-birds with one stone affair where EA has clearly taken a little pot shot at its largest competitor, while also highlighting several key selling points for Battlefield 6 - those being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-leads-will-avoid-goofy-crossover-skins-to-stray-true-to-battlefield">a lack of gaudy cosmetics</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-multiplayer-takes-a-bold-risky-new-direction">the death of a limiting specialist system</a>.</p>

<p>Battlefield 6 has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-battlefields-biggest-open-beta-ever-says-ea">proved exceptionally popular judging by its open beta tests</a>, and has established itself as a real competitor to Call of Duty this year.

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-privately-acquired-in-55bn-deal-by-group-of-investors-including-saudi-arabias-investment-fund-and-donald-trumps-son-in-law">Earlier today, EA announced it is to be acquired by the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund, investment firms Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners for $55bn</a>. Now a private company, the deal was financed with roughly $36bn from the trio and $20bn worth of debt. This deal marks the largest all-cash sponsor take-private investment in history according to EA's official press release on the matter.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>EA is going to be acquired by an investor consortium for $55 billion, as it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-reportedly-closing-in-on-deal-to-go-private-massive-50-billion-buyout/">widely rumored last week.</a></p>



<p>In a new <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/EA-Announces-Agreement-to-be-Acquired-by-PIF-Silver-Lake-and-Affinity-Partners-for-55-Billion/default.aspx">press release shared today</a>, the publisher of successful titles like the Battlefield series, whose <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-october-10-pre-orders-open-two-open-beta-weekends/">highly anticipated sixth entry is launching next month on PC and consoles</a>, confirmed it has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by an investor consortium comprised of PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners in an all-cash transaction of $55 billion. Going into further details, the agreement's terms indicate the Consortium will acquire 100% of EA, with PIF rolling over its existing 9.9% stake in the company.</p>



<p>The press release continues that the acquisition agreement was given the go-ahead by the EA's Board of Directors after the opportunity was carefully evaluated. According to Luis A. Ubiñas, the Lead Independent Director of the board, it was concluded that the opportunity delivers compelling value for stockholders and is in the best interests of all stakeholders.</p>



<p>Although EA has entered into the acquisition agreement, the transaction is expected to close in Q1 FY27, and will be subject to closing conditions, including approval of regulatory bodies and EA stockholders. After the transaction is closed, EA's common stock will no longer be listed on any public market.</p>



<p>Andrew Wilson, Chairman &amp; CEO of EA, commented on the news, saying:<em> "Our creative and passionate teams at EA have delivered extraordinary experiences for hundreds of millions of fans, built some of the world’s most iconic IP, and created significant value for our business. This moment is a powerful recognition of their remarkable work. Looking ahead, we will continue to push the boundaries of entertainment, sports, and technology, unlocking new opportunities. Together with our partners, we will create transformative experiences to inspire generations to come. I am more energized than ever about the future we are building."</em></p>

            <p>Remember when you were young, and had your first crush? All of a sudden your hormones are going nuts, and here's this person you can't think about without your face contorting into a goofy smile, or talk about without bashfully giggling. Well, it seems that's how part-time Gearbox exec and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hey-randy-im-not-sure-if-saying-that-a-real-fan-will-figure-out-how-to-pay-80-for-borderlands-4-is-a-good-look">full-time social media poster</a> Randall Steward Pitchford II feels about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>'s freshly revealed first DLC Vault Hunter.</p>
<p>It's understandable to be fair. Which of us hasn't found ourselves gazing longingly at a former casino robot dressed like a goth version of John Wayne, before volunteering to help animate its card-throwing? Sometimes, C4SH rules not just everything around you, but your very heart.</p>

<p>C4SH is the name of this cowbot, whom you'll be able to play as if you splash out for him when he arrives alongside the game's first story DLC early next year. The Vault Hunter's "a drifter who chases the probability-breaking highs of cursed eldritch artifacts, with his bio continuing that the first story DLC, Ellie and the Vault of the Damned, "is full of cosmic horrors that harbor uncanny curios, some of which can surely bend the odds in C4SH's favour."</p><p>As you might have guessed, C4SH is aimed at folks who like playing in a way that comes with high risk for potentially high reward, with the buckarndroid's skills being deliberately unpredictable. That's all cool, but the more important thing emphasised in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/nfyubGFy_AE">C4SH's reveal at the Tokyo Game Show</a> is this: Randy Pitchford fucking LOVES him.</p>
<p>"C4SH is important to me because I think he and I have a lot in common," the exec said during this on-stage reveal, having previously descibed the cowboy robot as "very dear to me, very personal to me." What's engendered these strong feelings in such a famously chill and dispassionate fellow? Well, Pitchford has both won and lost while doing some real life gambling, the CEO said, and he's also a professional magician. "I’ve mastered sleight of hand with playing cards, and we used my demonstration to help animate the character in the game," said the smitten Gearbox skipper.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">We'll have more to share in the coming months about C4SH and Story Pack 1, but for now, check out what's up next in our post-launch roadmap, including our first Seasonal Mini-Event, Bounty Pack, and Invincible Boss. <a href="https://t.co/FUYq5qduqO">pic.twitter.com/FUYq5qduqO</a></p>— Borderlands (@Borderlands) <a href="https://twitter.com/Borderlands/status/1972142127967850710?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 28, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>So, if you've ever wondered what it's like to basically be Randy Pitchford - or at least a cyborg Clint Eastwood that he sees a lot of himself in - now's your chance to find out. I assume there's a posting interface built into the HUD when you load in as C4SH. Either that, or you'll have to run two monitors for the authentic experience of arguing with tweeters about the capabilities of their game-playing boxes as you play Borderlands. Remember: when it feels like you should probably stop posting, do not stop posting.</p>
<p>As they've revealed C4SH, Gearbox have also put out a DLC roadmap for Borderlands 4. Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned, the first story pack C4SH arrives as part of early next year, also includes extra main and side missions in a new zone of Kairos and new gear. Hopefully the majority of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4s-latest-update-aims-to-deliver-more-performance-fixes-ends-up-causing-more-stuttering-for-some">performance issues</a> which've plagued the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> since release will be sorted by then, so you can enjoy C4SH rather than crash.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The version 2.3 update for <em><a title="Games > Zenless Zone Zero [27 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/zenless-zone-zero">Zenless Zone Zero</a></em>, dubbed “Memories of Dreams Bygone,” will launch on October 15, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [207 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-997143"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>In this latest update, players will team up with Spook Shack and set foot in the newly unlocked Timesworn Hills, where ghost stories echo through abandoned ruins in the Hollow. Lucia, Yidhari, and Komano Manato join the battlefield as new Agents, accompanied by fresh gameplay, new outfits for Vivian and Manato, and engaging events.</p><p>The newly revealed Timesworn Hills region, known for its abundant Lumite ore deposits, conceals abandoned research facilities and testing ground ruins where chilling legends thrive. Tales of miners who vanished within the Miasma, the tolling of a phantom bell, creatures that gaze into people’s hearts, and hypnotists capable of ensnaring victims in endless dreams haunt the land. This new adventure begins with the case of missing miners and Porcelumex employees, drawing Proxies into the Hollow to uncover unsettling truths.</p><p>The new members from Spook Shack bring not only fascination with haunted tales but also formidable strength to the battlefield. Lucia, an S-Rank Ether Support Agent and devoted Ethereal fan, wields dreamlike powers to recreate Ethereals in combat. By accumulating Dream Points, she can enter a Dream state and unleash Ether Veil: Wellspring, boosting all allies’ max HP while enhancing team damage through increased Sheer Force and triggering Aftershocks. Yidhari, an S-Rank Ice Rupture Agent, embodies both risk and resilience. She gains Sheer Force based on her max HP, and her ice attacks always inflict Sheer DMG, piercing through enemy defenses. Her damage increases as her HP percentage drops, rewarding a delicate balance of HP loss and recovery. Meanwhile, Komano Manato, now joining the battlefield as an A-Rank Fire Rupture Agent, unleashes Sheer DMG with strikes that scale from his max HP. In addition, S-level agents Vivian (Ether – Anomaly) and Ju Fufu (Fire – Stun) will return in this version’s banners.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_997145"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> continuously gears up to deliver eventful content and optimized combat experiences. In Version 2.3, Soldier 0 – Anby will be enhanced through refined combat mechanics and boosted performance to unleash her latent combat potential. New gameplay “Threshold <a title="Genres > Simulation [843 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/simulation">Simulation</a>” offers both tactical and combat challenges as Proxies deploy multiple squads to withstand interconnected battle scenarios. The event “When Dreams Remain Unfinished” introduces turn-based combat, where players command various categories of monsters with unique traits and tactical positioning. Completing the event also grants Agent <a title="Series > Mana [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/mana">Mana</a>to as a free reward. Additionally, the beloved “SNAP! Shining Strike” photography event returns with an upgrade, offering more freedom with camera controls, diverse filters and frames, allowing players to capture stunning scenes.</p><p>As New Eridu’s story continues to unfold, <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> offers a heartfelt glimpse of what lies ahead. Future agents — including Banyue, Dialyn, Zhao, and Ye Shunguang — are set to join the Proxies’ journey in the near future. As a token of gratitude for embarking on the adventures still to come, Proxies can claim an extra 600 Polychromes in addition to the regular rewards of 10 Encrypted Master Tapes and 10 Boopons during Version 2.3.</p></blockquote><p><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,514 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [8,018 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [24,420 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/zenless-zone-zero-c7c151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zenless-zone-zero/id1606356401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.Nap&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.</p><p>Watch a new set of trailers and the version 2.3 special program below.

            <p>EA has officially been acquired by a group of investors including Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund in a private transaction worth $55bn.</p>
<p>EA chairman and CEO Andrew Wilson will continue to lead the company - known for its sports games, BioWare's RPGs, The Sims, and forthcoming shooter <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> - with the transaction expected to be completed in Q1 FY27.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/investors-including-saudi-s-pif-are-reportedly-in-advanced-talks-for-a-50bn-leveraged-buyout-of-ea">News of the acquisition came over the weekend</a>, before an official announcement today. The investor group comprises the PIF, as well as investment firms Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners.</p>
<p>"Our creative and passionate teams at EA have delivered extraordinary experiences for hundreds of millions of fans, built some of the world's most iconic IP, and created significant value for our business. This moment is a powerful recognition of their remarkable work," said Wilson.</p><p>"Looking ahead, we will continue to push the boundaries of entertainment, sports, and technology, unlocking new opportunities. Together with our partners, we will create transformative experiences to inspire generations to come. I am more energised than ever about the future we are building."</p>
<p>"Electronic Arts is an extraordinary company with a world-class management team and a bold vision for the future. I've admired their ability to create iconic, lasting experiences, and as someone who grew up playing their games - and now enjoys them with his kids - I couldn't be more excited about what's ahead," said Jared Kushner, CEO of Affinity Partners. Kushner is US President Donald Trump's son-in-law.</p>
<p>PIF <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saudi-arabias-public-investment-fund-increases-stake-in-ea-by-55">increased its stake in EA in 2023</a>; now its 9.9 percent stake will roll over. The organisation also holds stakes in a number of gaming companies including Nintendo, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a>, Embracer, Capcom, and more.</p>
<p>Ubisoft is another, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-mirage-to-get-surprise-free-story-dlc-later-this-year">Assassin's Creed Mirage set to receive a surprise free DLC</a> set in 9th century AlUla, an ancient Arabian city.

<p>The PIF was designed to diversify Saudi Arabia's revenue via investment in foreign companies. It's chaired by Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the country's controversial ruler <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-concludes-saudi-crown-prince-ordered-jamal-khashoggis-assassination/2018/11/16/98c89fe6-e9b2-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html">blamed by the CIA for the assassination of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi</a>, who has upheld the country's <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/middle-east/saudi-arabia/report-saudi-arabia/">notoriously poor human rights record</a>.</p>

It's got a wonderful art style, and pretty much any of you can play it right now, for free, since it's a browser game.

And in a nice touch, you’re not alone; it’s got a very basic form of multiplayer, so popping in and out of the game are other messengers from around the world, who you can communicate with via emoji and just generally follow around and hang out with.</p><p>I would have paid $20 for this on Steam; the fact you can just fuck around with it for free in a browser is wild.

<p>After so many years of performance issues on the original Switch, I haven’t quite gotten used to the fact that most games on Switch 2 hit a stable 60fps and that modern third-party blockbusters run on it well. As such, I raised a sceptical eyebrow when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/resident-evil-requiem-has-been-officially-confirmed-for-switch-2">announced for Nintendo’s second handheld hybrid</a> during the last Nintendo Direct. From what we’ve seen of it up until that point, the ninth mainline Resident Evil is a graphical stunner and not something I would expect or even want to play on a less powerful console.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long for Capcom to convince me otherwise. Both on the chaotic showfloor of the Tokyo Game Show and tucked away in a conference room, a confident Capcom had Requiem running in handheld mode on the Switch 2. Still sceptical, I sat down for a 30-minute run-through of the same demo you might’ve seen PS5 footage of from Gamescom 2025 and came away impressed with what Capcom has managed to do.</p>
<p>As this was an impromptu hands-on, I only had a small stand for my iPhone 16 available. As you can tell in the footage, the screen was pushed slightly far from me and angled back to avoid the fluorescent lights in the conference room.</p>
<figure data-uuid="7400cb56870cd"><a title="Resident Evil Requiem Switch 2 Gameplay" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7400cb56870cd/resident-evil-requiem-switch-2-gameplay.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The demo begins with new protagonist Grace Ashcroft suspended upside down on a gurney in a rundown hotel. Freeing herself, she then must find a way to escape. Problem is, the gate to the ward she’s in requires a second fuse to open. The fuse, of course, is in a locked room she needs to find a key for, and even then, the fuse itself requires a tool to break from its locked encasement. Oh, and there’s a massive, gnarly monster that resembles an old woman chasing her through the poorly lit corridors.</p>
<p>As you can tell, this demo leans heavily into the classic survival horror side of the franchise. Grace can’t suplex the monster grandma like Leon Kennedy might have, but she did survive a couple of swipes from her massive claws. As a fan of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">Resident Evil 7</a>, I felt right at home as the monster stalked me through holes in the ceiling and leapt out of doorways to ambush me as I solved the puzzle required to escape.</p>
<p>Even on the small handheld screen, my heart was pumping as Grace pushed a noisy cart across a room in order to climb up it and reach a screwdriver. It was at this moment, with the quality headphones Capcom provided, that I thought how amazing an experience it would be to play Requiem late at night while cosy in bed instead of at my desk or on the sofa—though I do have two caveats when playing this way.</p>

<p>In handheld mode, I found my brief time testing the over-the-shoulder third-person mode a bit disorienting; the first-person perspective felt much more natural on the smaller screen because I could make out items I could pick up on shelves and other details much more easily.</p>
<p>That said, if the third-person perspective feels better for more action-heavy sections that fans have speculated about since the game’s announcement, the option to switch between the two while also switching between handheld and docked mode might give the Switch 2 version an edge over other consoles and PC. I could see myself taking down bosses on my monitor with a grenade launcher and switching to the handheld mode as I solve puzzles while avoiding unkillable monsters.</p>
<p>However, I can’t comment on how much visual fidelity is lost between the Switch 2 and beefier hardware, as there wasn’t another version to directly compare it with. When looking at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a8gK0YdUpY&amp;embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendolife.com%2F&amp;source_ve_path=Mjg2NjY">Switch 2’s reveal trailer</a> side-by-side with the <a href="https://youtu.be/POz1-EmLsTY?si=89ijO9dsImK-zCgA">original announcement trailer</a>, hair and textures in general clearly lose quite a lot of fidelity. To me, however, the game looked amazing on the smaller screen at (presumably) 1080p. While I didn’t have enough time to squint at how many pixels Grace’s hair had as she ran for her life, the differences in the trailers didn’t seem so drastic.</p>
<figure data-uuid="dd9d88b685b34"><a title="Resident Evil Requiem Switch 2 Gameplay" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/dd9d88b685b34/resident-evil-requiem-switch-2-gameplay.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Which brings me to my second caveat: the relative dimness of the Switch 2’s screen in a well-lit room seemed insufficient for such a dark, atmospheric game. This obviously isn’t Capcom’s fault, but compared to something more colourful like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_iii_hd-2d_remake">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a>, which I personally have found no problem with in bright rooms, I worry that you’ll pretty much only be able to see Requiem clearly while hiding beneath your covers after midnight.</p>
<p>You can see this in my footage; at first, the fluorescent lights of the room obscured the bottom half of the screen. Once I angled those out of the way, I was pretty much looking at a mirror image of myself while I stumbled my way through the dark corridors.</p>
<p>Regardless, my experience with RE Requiem has broken me of that Nintendo stigma that third-party blockbusters can’t run on their hardware. I did not notice any dropped frames and — at least in handheld mode — the visual downgrade on the Switch 2 doesn’t seem that drastic.</p>
<p>As a result, I’m seriously considering picking up Requiem on Switch 2 over other versions, as avoiding the grandma monster seems a little bit more spooky and immersive when everyone else is asleep and tucked into bed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Another one of the biggest game publishers in the world is being sold. On Monday, Electronic Arts announced a <span id="_ctrl0_ctl46_spanNewsDetailsTitle">$55 billion deal to take the publisher behind massive franchises like <a href="https://kotaku.com/respawn-layoffs-star-wars-jedi-apex-legends-titanfall-1851778330"><em>Madden</em>, <em>The Sims</em>, and<em> Apex Legends</em></a> private, selling to Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, Silver Lake Partners, and President Donald Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner’s Affinity Partners.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>The all-cash deal values the company at a 25-percent premium over its mid-August stock price and is set to be finalized by mid-2026 pending shareholder and regulatory approvals. Current CEO Andrew Wilson will remain the head of the publisher which will stay headquartered in California. Roughly $20 billion of the sale is debt-financed through JPMorgan Chase Bank.</p> <p>The sale builds on Saudi Arabia’s existing 10 percent ownership of the company which was built up in recent years amid investments across the larger gaming industry. Those included the $4.9 billion purchase of <em>Monopoly Go!</em> mobile game maker Scopely in 2023 and the gobbling up of <em>Pokémon Go</em> and Niantic’s other gaming businesses earlier this year <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-go-scopely-niantic-saudi-arabia-monster-hunter-1851769360">for $3.5 billion</a>. The current $55 billion buyout of EA is not just the government-backed Public Investment Fund’s largest gaming acquisition to date, it’s also the largest sale ever to take an existing public company private.</p>

 <p>“Our creative and passionate teams at EA have delivered extraordinary experiences for hundreds of millions of fans, built some of the world’s most iconic IP, and created significant value for our business. This moment is a powerful recognition of their remarkable work,” Wilson said in a press release. “Looking ahead, we will continue to push the boundaries of entertainment, sports, and technology, unlocking new opportunities. Together with our partners, we will create transformative experiences to inspire generations to come. I am more energized than ever about the future we are building.”</p>

 <p>Founded back in 1982, EA has become a gaming empire vast with studios across the globe like <em>Mass Effect</em> maker BioWare <em>Split Fiction </em>developer Hazelight, as well as franchises like <em>Battlefield</em> and <em>EA Sports FC</em> (formerly known as <em>FIFA</em>). It’s not yet clear how the deal will effect the size and scope of the roughly 15,000-person publisher, though this much money rarely changes hands without lots of people losing their jobs.</p>

 <p>“EA has been challenged to innovate in the last decade,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SIFTDGames/videos">Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter</a> told <em>Kotaku</em> in an email over the weekend <a href="https://kotaku.com/report-saudi-arabia-and-other-investors-nearing-50-billion-deal-to-buy-ea-2000629291">after news of the deal first leaked</a>. “Several franchises have faded (<em>Mass Effect, Dragon Age, Burnout, NFS</em>), some failed (<em>Anthem</em>) and only a handful continue to produce. They suck at mobile and appear too focused on pleasing investors and not focused enough on pleasing gamers. I think the Saudis have the potential to jump-start mobile and to try innovative moves like making Ultimate Team free.”</p>

 <p>Saudi Arabia’s funding partners include the private equity firms Silver Lake and Affinity Partners, the latter of which was founded by Kushner after Trump left office in 2021. Roughly half of its reported funding, approximately $2 billion, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/10/us/jared-kushner-saudi-investment-fund.html">is also from Saudi Arabia</a>. “Electronic Arts ​is ​an ​extraordinary ​company with a ​world-class ​management ​team and a bold vision ​for ​the ​future,” Kushner said in a statement. “​I’ve admired their ​ability to create iconic, lasting experiences, ​and ​as ​someone ​who ​grew up playing their ​games ​- and now enjoys them with his ​kids–I couldn’t be ​more ​excited about ​what’s ​ahead.”</p>

 <p>The deal arrives amid fresh criticism of people selling out to the Saudi Royal family despite its record of human rights abuses. Organizations backed by PIF held the Esports World Cup in Riyadh this summer and hosted talks with high-profile industry figures like Hideo Kojima and Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot, whose company is currently producing an <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> DLC set in Saudi Arabia. Outside the world of gaming, famous comedians like Bill Burr and Dave Chappelle were recently criticized for attending the Riyadh Comedy Festival.</p> <p>“From the folks that brought you 9/11,” quipped <em>WTF</em> podcast host Marc Maron <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DO9RDQ0ks4P/?hl=en">last week</a>. “Two weeks of laughter in the desert, don’t miss it! The same guy that’s gonna pay them is the same guy that paid that guy to bone-saw Jamal Khashoggi and put him in a f***ing suitcase. But don’t let that stop the yuks, it’s gonna be a good time!”</p> <p>The full press release is below:</p> <blockquote><p>Under the terms of the agreement, the Consortium will acquire 100% of EA, with PIF rolling over its existing 9.9% stake in the Company. EA stockholders will receive $210 per share in cash. The per share purchase price represents a 25% premium to EA’s unaffected share price of $168.32 at market close on September 25, 2025, the last fully unaffected trading day, and a premium to EA’s unaffected all-time high of $179.01 at market close on August 14, 2025.</p> <p>PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners bring deep sector experience, committed capital, and global portfolios with networks across gaming, entertainment, and sports that offer unique possibilities for EA to blend physical and digital experiences, enhance fan engagement, and create new growth opportunities. The transaction represents the largest all-cash sponsor take-private investment in history, with the Consortium partnering closely with EA to enable the Company to move faster and unlock new opportunities on a global stage.</p> <p>“Our creative and passionate teams at EA have delivered extraordinary experiences for hundreds of millions of fans, built some of the world’s most iconic IP, and created significant value for our business. This moment is a powerful recognition of their remarkable work,” said Andrew Wilson, Chairman &amp; CEO of Electronic Arts. “Looking ahead, we will continue to push the boundaries of entertainment, sports, and technology, unlocking new opportunities. Together with our partners, we will create transformative experiences to inspire generations to come. I am more energized than ever about the future we are building.”</p> <p>“PIF is uniquely positioned in the global gaming and esports sectors, building and supporting ecosystems that connect fans, developers, and IP creators,” said Turqi Alnowaiser, Deputy Governor and Head of International Investments at PIF. “PIF has demonstrated a strong commitment to these sectors, and this partnership will help further drive EA’s long-term growth, while fueling innovation within the industry on a global scale.”</p> <p>“This investment embodies Silver Lake’s mission to partner with exceptional management teams at the highest quality companies. EA is a special company: a global leader in interactive entertainment, anchored by its premier sports franchise, with accelerating revenue growth and strong and scaling free cash flow. We are honored to invest and partner with Andrew – an extraordinary CEO who has doubled revenue, nearly tripled EBITDA, and driven a fivefold increase in market cap during his tenure,” said Egon Durban, Co-CEO and Managing Partner of Silver Lake. “The future for EA is bright, we are going to invest heavily to grow the business and we are excited to support Andrew and the EA team as the company accelerates innovation, expands its reach worldwide, and continues to deliver incredible experiences to players and fans across generations.”</p> <p>“Electronic Arts ​is ​an ​extraordinary ​company with a ​world-class ​management ​team and a bold vision ​for ​the ​future. ​I’ve admired their ​ability to create iconic, lasting experiences, ​and ​as ​someone ​who ​grew up playing their ​games ​- and now enjoys them with his ​kids – I couldn’t be ​more ​excited about ​what’s ​ahead,” said Jared Kushner, Chief Executive Officer of Affinity Partners.</p> <p>“The Board carefully evaluated this opportunity and concluded it delivers compelling value for stockholders and is in the best interests of all stakeholders,” said Luis A. Ubiñas, Lead Independent Director of EA’s Board of Directors. “We are pleased that this transaction delivers immediate and certain cash value to our stockholders while strengthening EA’s ability to continue building the communities and experiences that define the future of entertainment.”</p> <p><b>Transaction Details</b></p> <p>The transaction was approved by EA’s Board of Directors, is expected to close in Q1 FY27 and is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals and approval by EA stockholders. Following the close of the transaction, EA’s common stock will no longer be listed on any public market.</p> <p>The transaction will be funded by a combination of cash from each of PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners as well as roll-over of PIF’s existing stake in EA, constituting an equity investment of approximately $36 billion, and $20 billion of debt financing fully and solely committed by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., $18 billion of which is expected to be funded at close. Each of PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners plan to fund the equity component of the financing entirely from capital under their respective control.</p> <p>Upon completion of the transaction, EA will remain headquartered in Redwood City, California and continue to be led by Andrew Wilson as CEO.</p></blockquote> <p><em>Update: 9/29/2025 8:58 a.m. ET: Added more information about EA, details of the deal, and a quote from an analyst.&nbsp;</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iv">Dawn of War 4</a> got a new gameplay trailer over the weekend, and while excitement continues generally for the upcoming real-time strategy game, the video has sparked a number of complaints from some within the Warhammer 40,000 community.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s start with the voice acting, which some are saying sounds flat. The complaints here stem from comparisons to Relic’s much-loved Dawn of War, which came out in 2004. Based on the new video, the chatter from the Space Marines especially doesn’t have enough oomph, and lacks the metallic ‘vox’ texture the Space Marines usually have when speaking through their helmets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My best guess here is that the developers at King Art Games needed the Space Marines to sound sufficiently different to the Adeptus Mechanics, one of Dawn of War 4’s brand new factions. The Ad Mech are the fanatical worshippers of the Machine God of Mars, tech priests who have discarded their humanity in favor of cybernetics. Their voices have that metallic vox-ness to them by default, which may have forced King Art’s hand when it came to the Space Marines' audio. After all, on chaotic battlefield, the player needs to know which faction is saying what.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Voices for Space Marines aren't good, compared to DOW1 or DOW2,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dawnofwar/comments/1nst8b0/comment/ngpg480/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said the wonderfully named redditor KillerKanka</a>. “You know it's missing that ZEAL, the mechanical filter, the ‘COME. SHOW ME WHAT PASSES FOR FURY AMONG YOUR MISBEGOTTEN KIND’ or ‘SPESS MEHRINESS ATTAAAAACK’ or ‘STRIKE FROM THE SKIES, BROTHERS.’ It's much easier to correct, tho, but still.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Looks promising, but please fix the Space Marine voice acting,” added <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dawnofwar/comments/1nst8b0/comment/ngrk15a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ImSorryOkGeez</a>. “That dude does not sound like he is ready to burn heretics, kill mutants, or purge the unclean.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the Orks in Dawn of War 4, the voice work we hear in the video is nowhere near as over-the-top cockney as Warhammer 40,000 Orks traditionally sound, and indeed how they sound in Dawn of War 1. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then there’s a growing row about the inclusion of Primaris Marines, which, well, if you’re not in the weeds on Warhammer 40,000, this one may prove to be a head-scratcher.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Firstborn” Space Marines, as they’re known, were essentially replaced within the setting by Primaris Marines. They’re bigger, tougher, stronger, and faster than the OGs, but some within the fandom absolutely hate them for their softer redesign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a lot to unpack here, but essentially this debate about the Primaris Marines boils down to a feeling that Games Workshop has “toned down” the Space Marines over the years so that they look a little less like the religious fanatics the lore suggests they are, and more like the poster boys Warhammer 40,000 needs to attract new fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dawn of War, which came out over 20 years ago now, leaned into the Warhammer 40,000 of that time, and so its Blood Ravens (the Space Marines chapter at the heart of the Dawn of War games) delivered on that fanaticism. Dawn of War was based on Warhammer 40,000 4th Edition (we’re now on the 10th), and so the Astra Militarum were called the Imperial Guard, the Aeldari were called the Eldar, and the Necrons didn’t speak.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dawn of War 4, due out 2026, was always going to have a different feel in keeping with the Warhammer 40,000 of today, the grimdark far future we see in Amazon animations, in video games like the record-breaking Space Marine 2, and perhaps (hopefully!) in Henry Cavill’s Warhammer 40,000 Cinematic Universe. Dawn of War 4 was always going to feature Primaris Marines, which have been the default Space Marines for almost a decade now.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 4 - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m not surprised by complaints around the voice work, which probably could do with a shot in the arm, or the complaints about the Primaris Marines (this is an ongoing complaint about all things Space Marines). The Warhammer 40,000 fandom, perhaps more than any other, is big on tradition. But I am surprised to see complaints about the game’s visuals, which I think look pretty detailed. King Art has spoken about going hard on sync kills, which Dawn of War 1 was famous for, and we see those in action here. Some are saying Dawn of War 4 looks too colorful, but to me it looks fine.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are more extreme reactions online, some of which compare Dawn of War 4 to the critical and commercial flop that was Dawn of War 3. It’s impossible to make such a comparison based on what we’ve seen of Dawn of War 4 so far, and King Art has made it clear from the start that it’s using Dawn of War 1 as its reference point for the game with base building and big armies the focus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, with each new video, Warhammer 40,000 fans will continue to have their say on Dawn of War 4, right up until launch and beyond. Heresy is at the heart of the Imperium, and so perhaps King Art knew full well it was going to have to deal with a healthy dose itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-nearing-50-billion-deal-with-saudi-arabia-and-other-investors-to-go-private-report/1100-6535057/" data-ref-id="1100-6535057">rumors</a> were true: Electronic Arts has announced that it's sold itself in a $55 billion deal. EA sold itself to an "investor consortium" made up of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners, and the private equity firm Silver Lake.</p><p>EA said the all-cash deal "positions EA to accelerate innovation and growth to build the future of entertainment." EA CEO Andrew Wilson is still on board as CEO.</p><p>The investor consortium will take over 100% of EA. The PIF already had a 9.9% stake in EA prior to this deal.</p><h2><strong>$210 per share</strong></h2><p>It's a good day for EA stockholders, too, as they are getting $210 per share in cash as part of the deal--that's a significant premium over what the stock was trading for last week.</p><p>"Our creative and passionate teams at EA have delivered extraordinary experiences for hundreds of millions of fans, built some of the world’s most iconic IP, and created significant value for our business. This moment is a powerful recognition of their remarkable work," Wilson said. "Looking ahead, we will continue to push the boundaries of entertainment, sports, and technology, unlocking new opportunities. Together with our partners, we will create transformative experiences to inspire generations to come. I am more energized than ever about the future we are building."</p><p>PIF's Turqi Alnowaiser said, "This partnership will help further drive EA's long-term growth, while fueling innovation within the industry on a global scale."</p><p>Silver Lake's Egon Durban shared an enthusiastic quote, too. He said, "The future for EA is bright, we are going to invest heavily to grow the business, and we are excited to support Andrew and the EA team as the company accelerates innovation, expands its reach worldwide, and continues to deliver incredible experiences to players and fans across generations."</p><p>As for Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law said, "Electronic Arts ​is ​an ​extraordinary ​company with a ​world-class ​management ​team and a bold vision ​for ​the ​future."</p><h2>Cost-cutting concerns</h2><p>Part of the deal is being funded by $20 billion in debt financing. That's a lot of debt, and people are already wondering and worrying about cost-cutting measures. It remains to be seen, however, if EA under its new ownership will undergo a cost-cutting plan. Oftentimes large mergers and acquisitions lead to cost-reduction programs that result in layoffs and other downsizing.</p><h2><strong>Wilson's memo to staff</strong></h2><p>EA shared Wilson's memo to staff regarding the sale. The news broke around 8 AM ET on September 29, so it's likely a number of staffers are waking up on their Monday morning to discover what went down. Wilson said the deal is "in the best interests of our company and our stockholders."</p><p>He added: "This moment is a recognition of your creativity, your innovation, and your passion. You have built some of the world’s most iconic IP, created stories that have inspired global communities, and helped shape culture through interactive experiences. Everything we have achieved--and everything that lies ahead--is because of you."</p><p>The executive went on to say the deal represents a "new era of opportunity for EA" thanks to the size of the deal--$55 billion.</p><p>"Our new partners bring deep experience across sports, gaming, and entertainment. They are committed with conviction to EA--they believe in our people, our leadership, and the long-term vision we are now building together," Wilson said. "Our values and our commitment to players and fans around the world remain unchanged."</p><h2>Not a done deal</h2><p>To be sure, what was announced today, September 29, was the deal itself. The actual transaction is not finalized and is subject to government scrutiny. That being said, EA said it expects the deal to close in Q1 FY27. The deal closing is subject to "customary closing conditions," including regulatory approval and a sign-off by EA stockholders. Should the deal close, EA's stock will be removed from public markets. The deal is also subject to certain termination fees of more than $1 billion.</p><h2><strong>Saudi Arabia's involvement</strong></h2><p>The PIF has attracted significant controversy over Saudi Arabia's <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/middle-east/saudi-arabia/report-saudi-arabia/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wide range of human rights violations</a>. The PIF, through its Savvy Games Group, has invested in or acquired numerous gaming companies over the years. Before EA, Savvy bought <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-developer-set-to-be-acquired-by-saudi-arabias-scopely-in-3-5-billion-deal/1100-6530064/" data-ref-id="1100-6530064">Pokemon Go developer Niantic's gaming division for $3.5 billion</a>.

<p>I don't have a Gandalf to stride in here, whack me with a staff and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=267nNfzyL5E">rally the troops</a>. James would have played the part, I'm sure, but he's not in today. Perhaps he's out buying coffee. Please let that be the case. Also, please let somebody <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-are-about-to-be-bought-for-50-billion-by-saudi-arabia-and-jared-kushners-investment-firms-claims-report">buy EA or equivalent</a> so that we have a chunky morsel to appease the beast, before it ruptures the continuum and turns Mars into Belgium again. Casting my gaze wildly at the events calendar, I see only the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/events?year=2025">GamesIndustry.biz HR Summit 2025</a> on 2nd October. I can't feed HR people to the Maw! After all, they're vitally needed for approving my holidays. Please, let somebody post a link to something straightforwardly huge in the comments. While you scrape around for ideas, here's the latest new game round-up.
</p>
<h2>Monday 29th September</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3862550/Bonapartes_Bluff/">Boneparte's Bluff</a> is a free and simple-looking abstract strategy game in which the pieces lie to you.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tuesday 30th September</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles">Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles</a> is a revamp of the venerable PS1 strategy RPG. Dom over at Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-review">says it's pretty good</a>.</li>
<li>It seems likely you're in the mood for xenomorphs, after Alien: Earth, so maybe cock a squint at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alien-rogue-incursion">Alien: Rogue Incursion</a>'s Evolved Edition (pictured), the new headset-free version of a VR horror game that is apparently a bit mid.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1969370/LEGO_Party/">LEGO Party!</a> is a four-player minigame bonanza with an unnecessary and frankly condescending exclamation mark. People should know well enough to supply their own dang exclamation marks when they play "party" games.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wednesday 1st October</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3690460/FLICK_SOLITAIRE/">Flick Solitaire</a> is a solo card game with a lot of decks from different artists. It's free-to-play and launching in early access. There are in-app purchases and season passes, but "all core gameplay, collecting decks, and completing them can be experienced for free". A suspicious CTRL+F of the Steam page reveals no mention of NFTs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thursday 2nd October</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3560370/al/">Éalú</a> is an atmospheric puzzler with hand-made, stop-motion animations. It's about a wooden mouse trying to escape a maze.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1984270/Digimon_Story_Time_Stranger/">Digimon Story Time Stranger</a> is a monster-taming RPG about those collectible creatures who aren't Pokemon and also aren't currently being sued for trying to be Pokemon.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Friday 3rd October</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3386900/Castle_of_Heart_Retold/">Castle Of Heart: Retold</a> is a prettied-up version of a lush Slavic side-scroller in which a knight must continuously murder vodniks to stop his body turning to stone.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's your cue. Fill me in on any important breaking news, or major games releases not mentioned here. Please, I beg of you. I'm literally writing this from inside the Mawmouth, peering out at you through a forest of quantum strings as thick as baleen. It smells awful in here. I'm sitting on a rancid chunk of Borderlands DLC, attempting to wipe the kaiju dribble off my laptop screen. Time to test out this Boneparte Bluff game, I guess, while Mark embarks on an emergency expedition to locate any massive standalone mods we've forgotten about.</p>
