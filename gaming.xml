                <p dir="ltr">From the first trailer, I knew Neva would be an emotional experience. Nomada Studio's previous game, Gris, was a poignant exploration of grief and the effects it can have on a person, told through the lens of a young girl who'd just lost her mother. Neva explores familial bonds through a different but just as emotional lens: parenthood.</p><p dir="ltr">The relationship between Alba and Neva mirrors a mother/child relationship through most of the game. The wolf starts as a small cub, curious about the world and ready to explore, and eventually he becomes a strong protector, equaling his mother's capabilities. From there, the two fight against the blight that's affecting the world, with Neva learning new abilities in every season.</p><p dir="ltr">The journey encompassing this coming of age includes some of the strongest voice acting you'll find in a video game this year. However, unlike games like Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and Metaphor: ReFantazio, which are bursting with dialogue, Neva accomplishes this feat with a much smaller script; throughout the entire five-hour adventure, only one word is ever spoken.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415496-neva-best-of-2024.png" data-ref-id="1300-4415496" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415496-neva-best-of-2024.png" data-ref-id="1300-4415496"></a><figcaption>One of many gorgeous scenes throughout Neva.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415496-neva-best-of-2024.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Neva's control scheme is standard fare for an action-platformer: one button to attack, one button to jump, one button to dodge, etc. Included in the control scheme, though, is a button specifically designated for calling Neva. No matter what you're doing, or where you are, a simple press will make Alba say "Neva" and call out for the good wolfie girl.</p><p dir="ltr">While the mechanic has its uses--you can call Neva to your side if she's far away, or instruct her to jump up a ledge--it's mostly just there for the player's enjoyment. Calling Neva usually results in Alba giving her companion a little scratch behind the ears--which means yes, in Neva, you can pet the dog.</p><p dir="ltr">Its biggest contribution to the story, and what sends Neva into the upper echelon of 2024 voice acting, is the emotion Alba conveys whenever the button is pressed. When there's little danger around, and Neva is sniffing around or standing still, Alba's voice is calm, loving, and light. The character's love for her companion comes through, especially when it's followed by sounds of delight from both characters following a loving head scratch.</p><p dir="ltr">Press that button in a more urgent moment, however, and Alba's voice becomes <em>much </em>heavier. There's urgency in her calls, permeated by a sense of panic. Her anxiety and fear come to the surface, and all it takes is a change in inflection. It's powerful stuff, and it makes using the call button more than worth it even in hectic situations.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415498-neva-best-of-2024-2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4415498" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415498-neva-best-of-2024-2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4415498"></a><figcaption>Neva is trapped, and Alba fights to free her companion.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415498-neva-best-of-2024-2.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">There's one moment in particular that really highlights how effective this voice acting can be. Alba and Neva are separated, and the player as Alba must traverse a perilous maze in order to reunite with the wolf. Throughout this endeavor, pressing the call button makes Alba utter a cry of pure terror, helplessly shouting into the void in search of her lost companion. The fear of the unknown is palpable, and I start to feel Alba's anxiety with her as I hear her call the wolf's name.</p><p dir="ltr">Now, putting Alba's ability to call out for Neva on a button is not without its pitfalls. By doing this, Nomada ran the risk of some players not being able to hear the exceptional voice work at hand, simply because they were so focused on the action on screen that they were too busy attacking and dodging to press the call button.</p><p dir="ltr">However, Nomada brilliantly trained us to keep it in the back of our minds through the mechanic I mentioned earlier: the one where Alba uses her call to summon Neva to her side. The player now knows that calling Neva can summon her, so once the two are separated, it's natural to press the button and see if it works--and when it doesn't, to keep trying it in the hopes that maybe it will work eventually.</p><p dir="ltr">Anyone who's ever been in care of a child and lost sight of them--be it in a store, a theme park, or even in their own homes--can relate to this feeling of paralyzing fear, uncertainty, and doubt… as well as the feeling of sheer relief when Alba finds Neva happily sitting on a platform, not a care in the world, as if nothing happened. Kids these days!</p><p dir="ltr">Neva is a profound analysis of parenthood, and all of the highs and lows that come with it. The raw emotion is best conveyed through its voice acting, credited to Cristina Peña, and putting Alba's voice under the player's control makes it that much more effective. Nomada Studio deserves a ton of credit for finding a way to convey the intricate complexities of being a caregiver--and even more credit for doing it with a single word.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>More Best Of 2024:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/our-favorite-games-of-2024-that-didnt-make-the-top-10/2900-6090/" data-ref-id="2900-6090">Our Favorite Games That Didn't Make The Top 10</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-ps5-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6054/" data-ref-id="2900-6054">Best PS5-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6080/" data-ref-id="2900-6080">Best Switch-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-pc-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6083/" data-ref-id="2900-6083">Best PC-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-new-xbox-games-of-2024/2900-6081/" data-ref-id="2900-6081">Best Xbox Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2024/2900-5065/" data-ref-id="2900-5065">Best-Reviewed Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/best-of-2024/">Best Of 2024 hub</a></li></ul>

Top-ranked former world champion Magnus Carlsen recently showed up to a tournament in jeans, refused to change, got fined, and then threatened to back out of the event altogether. The International Chess Federation (FIDE) then proceeded to blink first.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The drama kicked off on December 27 when Carlsen showed up to the World Rapid and Blitz Chess Championships in New York wearing denim instead of slacks. FIDE said the chess world all-star was in violation of the event’s dress code and hit him with a $200 fine. When Carlsen refused to go pick up dress pants from the TJ Maxx just a block away from the Cipriani Wall Street venue, the federation upped the ante and removed the champion from his 9th round matchups.</p><p>Carlsen then called the federation’s bluff by saying he would back out altogether, ditching the Blitz Chess Championships in which he was set to defend his current title. The federation responded with a lengthy blog post announcing possible exceptions to the dress code to be made at the judges’ discretion. </p><p>“The principle is simple: it is still required to follow the official dress-code, but elegant minor deviations (that may, in particular, include appropriate jeans matching the jacket) are allowed,” the December 29 <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.fide.com/news/3366&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.fide.com/news/3366" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announcement read</a></span>. “In the end, it is New Year time, and I sincerely hope that nobody would try to undermine the festive mood, including by abusing this additional flexibility.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d5T4w5bEz8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d5T4w5bEz8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In an interview directly after the incident</a></span>, Carlsen said that he had come to the event from a meeting and hadn’t had time to change. He added that while he had offered to change for the matches the following day, that wasn’t enough for the federation. “I’ll probably head off to somewhere where the weather is a bit nicer than here,” he quipped. But now that FIDE has backed off of its “draconian” decision, Carlsen is once again set to appear in the Blitz side of the tournament. </p><p>The five-time world champion wasn’t the only one dinged over his attire. Eighth-ranked Ian Nepomniachtchi was also fined by FIDE for wearing “sport shoes.” But Carlsen’s protest certainly made for more drama. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hans-niemann-magnus-carlsen-cheating-scandal-lawsuit-1849684477&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hans-niemann-magnus-carlsen-cheating-scandal-lawsuit-1849684477">Hans Neimann</a></span>, who Carlsen previously accused of cheating in chess’ now-infamous <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/chess-champion-anal-bead-magnus-carlsen-hans-niemann-1849542639&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/chess-champion-anal-bead-magnus-carlsen-hans-niemann-1849542639">“anal beads” scandal</a></span>, said the champion had manufactured the jeans fiasco on purpose. </p><p>“Allowing a single actor to make a mockery of the tournament and then bending the knee is disappointing,” he <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/HansMokeNiemann/status/1873549360862232682&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/HansMokeNiemann/status/1873549360862232682" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a></span>. “FIDE has a responsibility to protect the sanctity of the game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-2025-outline-pvp<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>publisher Focus Entertainment has shared what's coming to the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k&nbsp;</em>shooter in 2025, and if you're a fan of the PvP game modes, you'll be pleased with the roadmap.</p>

<p>In a new <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/135-december-community-update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">December community update</a>, Focus first looks at the last few months for&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>, highlighting things like major updates and the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-player-count-5m" rel="nofollow">rather impressive sales figures</a>.</p>

<p>Following the 2024 recap, Focus then moves onto highlighting what you can expect from next year in&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>, and the first thing on the agenda is more PvP content. The publisher says it knows PvP fans feel "left out", and so next year will bring a new map, custom lobbies, and more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/space-marine-2-pvp-content-roadmap-2025-fight.jpg?itok=dtcfyyLb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/space-marine-2-pvp-content-roadmap-2025-fight.jpg?itok=Zq_a15T3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Focus Entertainment knows&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>PvP fans feel "left out" right now.</figcaption></figure><p>New PvE stuff is also coming next year, starting with the Horde mode, which was teased back when&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>'s first post-launch roadmap was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-roadmap" rel="nofollow">revealed in late August</a>. New Operations and enemies are also on the way for you to tackle.</p>

<p>We also got a look at the next champion making his way to&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>, and it's a Salamander sniper. Focus acknowledges that the Raven Guard Chapter would have been "an obvious choice" for a sniper, but that the studio has "different plans" for the Raven Guard.</p>

<p>More customization options are also coming, alongside a new Datavault option on the Battle Barge. It'll allow you to read "unlockable information on most elements from the game", in case you want to brush up on your&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>lore.</p>




<p>In case you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>, it's a third-person shooter set in the grim darkness of the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k&nbsp;</em>universe.</p>

<p>The game sees protagonist Demetrian Titus returning from the first game. Having spent time with the Deathwatch in order to prove himself free of heresy, Titus is re-inducted into the Ultramarines and tasked with eradicating a Tyrannid infestation on the planet Kadaku.</p>

<p>Like its predecessor,&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>emphasizes both close-quarters combat and ranged weaponry, and it's also got a renewed focus on co-op play. Fittingly enough, its credits also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-credits-totalbiscuit" rel="nofollow">feature a rather touching tribute</a> to a man who championed the original title.</p>

While you could argue that this situation has folks throwing around the phrase “pay to win” a little too liberally, the bug in question is certainly one that should be addressed by developer NetEase.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195896" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Spider-Man 2's New Web Wings Make It Feel Like A Proper Sequel" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="112" data-playlist="195896,195859,196032" data-current="195896"><div><p>Spider-Man 2's New Web Wings Make It Feel Like A Proper Sequel</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195896/195896_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195896/195896_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195896/195896_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195896/195896_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21410.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Fans have realized that when <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-overwatch-2-concord-best-hero-shooters-1851726774&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-overwatch-2-concord-best-hero-shooters-1851726774"><em>Marvel Rivals</em></a></span><em> </em>is running at lower framerates, some hero abilities do less damage or are generally less efficient than they are at higher framerates. In other words, if you’re playing the shooter on a high-end PC that can run the game at a higher framerate, you’ll find your enemies will take more damage from certain attacks than they would if you were playing on a machine that runs the game at a lower framerate. Other idiosyncrasies include certain attacks executing more quickly, or seemingly losing range at lower framerates. The reason some fans are calling this “pay to win” is because if you can afford a beefier PC, you can circumvent the issue entirely.</p><p>Currently, this bug is known to impact five characters: Star-Lord, Wolverine, Doctor Strange, Magik, and Spider-Man. At the moment, this is a bigger problem for players on PC than on console, as those all play at the same framerate across the board. However, <em>Marvel Rivals </em>is crossplay, which means you could be teamed up with a PC player affected by this, so it’s a problem for everyone until it’s fixed.</p><p><em>Marvel Rivals </em>has received a few patches that have primarily focused on bug fixes, so that seems to be top of mind for the team. Now that this issue has been discovered, hopefully NetEase will be looking into a fix.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/what-to-expect-from-xbox-in-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m starting to feel like Charlie Brown from The Peanuts comics, and Microsoft is the Lucy who keeps pulling the football away right as I go to kick it. Every year I write this feature, and every year I say that this looks like The Year™ where everything comes together for Xbox. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-to-expect-from-xbox-in-2024"><u>Last year</u></a>, in fact, I specifically said, “Looking ahead to 2024, that positive momentum looks set to continue and, with any luck, snowball.” Microsoft arguably didn’t live up to that for the first 10.5 months of the year, with only the visually-full-but-gameplay-empty Hellblade 2 dropping in May after many years of waiting. But to the big-spending publisher’s credit, it did end the year extremely strong, dropping three exclusive bangers in a row: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review"><u>STALKER 2</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-review"><u>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</u></a>, and my personal vote for Game of the Year in 2024 and the game that I think is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/indiana-jones-is-the-best-xbox-exclusive-in-years-unlocked-671"><u>the best Xbox exclusive in years</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review"><u>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, can Microsoft keep that positive end-of-2024 momentum going into 2025? Call me Charlie Brown if you must, but yes, I genuinely believe that 2025 could be Xbox’s strongest and most bountiful year since at least 2021, when it dropped Forza Horizon 5, Halo Infinite, and Psychonauts 2. Let’s dig into why I’m optimistic…</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>A Fountain of Fantasy and Firearms</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Xbox’s 2025 kicks off rather quickly and, from everything we can tell, rather impressively with Obsidian’s first-person fantasy RPG Avowed, due to be released on February 18. This “Skyrim Lite” is set in the studio’s established and well-loved Pillars of Eternity universe, it’s supposed to be around the same meaty-but-not-gargantuan 25-40 hours long as Obsidian’s most recent first-person RPG The Outer Worlds, and it’s impressed us more and more every single time we’ve <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avowed-we-finally-played-obsidians-first-person-rpg-and-its-fantastic"><u>played it</u></a>, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avowed-the-final-preview"><u>quite recently</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next, while it doesn’t have a firm release date yet, id Software’s unexpected zag of a prequel, Doom: The Dark Ages, is almost a lock for 2025. In fact, I’d wager an In-N-Out Burger lunch that it drops in the first half of the year for two reasons: 1) Doom Eternal shipped in March of 2020, meaning that in just a few months, it will have been a full half-decade since the last Doom (which itself followed four years after Doom [2016]). In other words, it’s time! Particularly since the idTech engine is already firmly in place despite the jump to a new console generation. And 2) I’d bet <em>another </em>In-N-Out lunch that the long- and eagerly anticipated reboot of Fable being cooked up at Playground Games – which, remember, got tagged with a 2025 release window in its Xbox Showcase 2024 trailer – is going to be Xbox’s big Fall/holiday game at the end of the year. That means Doom probably ships before the holidays. But whenever it does – and remember that it’s already confirmed to be a multiplatform release on day one – it’s probably going to kick some serious ass for Xbox next year, judging by how good id Software’s last two Doom games have been.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Back to Fable: in my opinion, the revival of Fable has higher potential – both critically and commercially – than almost anything else in Xbox’s portfolio short of Call of Duty, The Elder Scrolls, and Fallout. We’ve seen Playground’s take on the British-charm-tinged action-adventure-RPG a few times now, and each time it’s been crystal clear that not only does Playground “get” Fable (it’s British itself, which no doubt helps), but that the game looks absolutely incredible as well. Who knew that the ForzaTech engine could render a jaw-droppingly beautiful fantasy forest just as well as a racetrack? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s one other huge reason to be optimistic about Fable, and that’s Playground’s track record. Simply put, this studio has not only never missed, it’s never made anything less than a consensus 9 out of 10. Its last game, the aforementioned Forza Horizon 5, was IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/game-of-the-year-2021"><u>2021 Game of the Year</u></a>. And it clearly is being given plenty of time to cook, as Fable was formally announced in 2020 with work having already been done prior to that. Microsoft knows it can’t fumble Fable a second time, and I couldn’t be more excited about what has been shown so far.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next, while it certainly isn’t nearly as big a name as Fable, we can’t forget about South of Midnight, the third-person action-adventure from We Happy Few developer Compulsion Games that’s leaning heavy into the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/south-of-midnight-first-preview-compulsion-games-bets-big-on-art-music-and-deep-south-folklore"><u>folklore of the bayous of the Deep South</u></a>. This one’s nothing like the developer’s past games, which is admittedly riskier but also more intriguing. Microsoft has tabbed this one for 2025, so consider South of Midnight as something of a wild card for next year.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another smaller-name Xbox exclusive that I think everyone will be talking about if it comes together when it finally ships in 2025 is Replaced. It’s a pixel-art, cyberpunk-styled side-scrolling action-adventure game that oozes style and, as I discovered when I <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/replaceds-beautiful-design-leaves-us-wanting-more-ign-live-2024"><u>played</u></a> it over the summer, is much deeper than I expected. Replaced has the potential to join the long list of legendary Xbox-exclusive indies that includes games like Limbo, Braid, and Inside.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, don’t forget about Xbox’s actual biggest franchise (since they now own it), Call of Duty. It’ll stay on PlayStation, of course, but Xbox fans will get it day one on Game Pass. The 2025 Call of Duty is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-reportedly-a-black-ops-2-sequel-set-around-2030"><u>rumored to be a future-set Black Ops 2 sequel</u></a>, so perhaps Treyarch is handling the campaign on this one after Raven Software did a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review"><u>stellar job</u></a> on this year’s Black Ops 6 campaign. And the other, much quieter juggernaut in the Xbox portfolio, Minecraft, will probably get <em>some </em>kind of big in-game content, what with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/a-minecraft-movie-latest-trailer-reveals-steves-origin-story"><u>the Minecraft movie on the way</u></a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>What About Hardware?</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Barring a 180 from Xbox boss Phil Spencer’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-reiterates-there-is-no-need-for-a-mid-generation-refresh-for-xbox-series-xs-right-now"><u>previous comments</u></a>, Microsoft won’t be pushing a mid-gen upgrade to the Xbox Series X (an Xbox Series XX, if you will) in 2025, if ever. And though <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-plans-to-release-an-xbox-handheld-but-its-years-away"><u>a handheld Xbox is in development</u></a>, we’re unlikely to play it or even see it in the coming year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So should we expect any new hardware in 2025? Probably not – at least in terms of raw horsepower. The Xbox Series S got a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-series-s-with-1tb-ssd-in-carbon-black-unveiled-at-xbox-showcase"><u>storage upgrade</u></a> in 2024, as did the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-series-x-all-digital-edition-officially-announced-xbox-games-showcase-2024"><u>Series X</u></a>. And we’ll no doubt see a bevy of new special-edition controllers and maybe even that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-leak-reveals-potential-one-hand-controller-mobile-controller-more"><u>upgraded controller codenamed Sebile</u></a> mentioned in the FTC leaks from over a year ago, but 2025 does not appear to be the year for Xbox to drop any new silicon.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Anything Else?</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Rare’s Everwild appears to be in limbo and/or development hell, as we haven’t seen or heard from it in years. Might it reemerge in 2025? Maybe, but I’m not holding my breath. Meanwhile, Halo is being reset at the studio level, which in my opinion means the next Halo game is likely to either be a reboot of the franchise altogether or a remake of Halo: Combat Evolved. Either way, it’s going to be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/future-halo-games-moving-to-unreal-engine-as-developer-343-industries-officially-changes-its-name"><u>built in Unreal Engine 5</u></a>, and it’s probably going to take a while. InXile’s steampunk RPG Clockwork Revolution was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wasteland-developer-inxile-unveils-clockwork-revolution"><u>announced</u></a> in 2023 with a release window of “coming in due time.” The Outer Worlds 2 has been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/outer-worlds-2-announced-xbox-e3-2021-summer-of-gaming"><u>revealed</u></a>, and we now know it is coming in 2025, so that means Obsidian plans to ship <em>two </em>first-person RPGs in the same year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And speaking of first-person RPGs, will that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-fallout-3-remaster-and-more-leaked-from-microsoft-document"><u>rumored Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remaster</u></a> actually happen? How about Contraband, from Just Cause developer Avalanche Studios, which was in the 2021 Xbox Showcase and hasn’t been seen or heard from since? All we know is that it’s “a co-op smugglers' paradise set in the fictional world of 1970s Bayan.” Should it reemerge in 2025, it’s unlikely that it also ships next year as well, given the usual PR/marketing cycles on big-budget games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The wild card for 2025 is Double Fine, the endlessly creative and versatile studio headed by game design legend Tim Schafer that is coming off of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2021-nominations-announced"><u>2021 Game Awards Game of the Year nominee</u></a> Psychonauts 2. I’d expect Schafer and the studio to announce their new project soon, but as to whether it actually comes out in the next 12 months is anybody’s guess. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Games to Play on Xbox Series X|S</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, anything from this year’s Xbox Showcase that didn’t have a release year at the end of the trailer can safely be assumed to be a 2026 (or later) release. That means I’m not reasonably expecting to play Gears of War: E-Day, Perfect Dark, or State of Decay 3 in the next year. And that’s OK! It finally feels like Xbox is starting to pump out not just a steady stream of first-party games, but a consistently <em>good </em>stream of them. This is what Xbox has been building towards since they first started acquiring studios in 2018 to try and fix their first-party games problem, and dammit I think this is the year they finally do it. Please don’t pull that football away from me again, Lucy-Microsoft.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/30/game-of-the-year-2024-biggest-disappointments/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Whether you buy into the awards season or not, it’s an ideal opportunity to reflect on the past twelve months; for the most part we’ve been highlighting the very best games of 2024, but it hasn’t all been sunshine and lollipops. It’s been another year of breakout hits and exciting announcements, brought down by some pretty major flops and worrying wider trends.</p>

<p>It goes without saying, really. If last year’s layoffs weren’t devastating enough for the industry, 2024 took things to the next level with thousands more workers losing their jobs without an end in site. Game developers around the globe have been forced to downsize, merge, or close their doors for good with high profile casualties including Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/07/arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks-closed-by-microsoft/">Tango Gameworks</a> (thankfully <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/12/tango-gameworks-is-back-as-krafton-revives-hi-fi-rush-studio/">rescued a few months later by Krafton</a>) and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/07/arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks-closed-by-microsoft/">Arkane Austin</a>, as well as myriad smaller studios and indies.</p>

<p>From rising development costs and changes in consumer habits to the post-pandemic lurch, the video game business is still ludicrously lucrative, but money is pooling around a smaller number of key pillars of gaming than before, making big bets increasingly risky.</p>

<p>The job losses have been catastrophic, resulting in countless workers leaving the games industry for good, the ensuing instability no doubt warding off a generation of up-and-coming talent in the process. It’s not just those who create your favourite games either, it’s those who report on them with a large number of media outlets either been scaled back or shut down completely, displacing an untold number of journalists.</p>
<h2>Concord – Also Disappointing</h2>
<p>There was one pretty big omission from the previous section: the closure of Sony’s Firewalk Studios and the embarrassing eradication of its one and only game, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/30/concord-review-a-fun-frenetic-hero-shooter/">Concord</a>. The writing was on the wall though we didn’t expect things to pan out quite so disastrously for everyone involved.</p>

<p>It’s clear that Sony, like every major publisher, has been wanting a larger slice of the live service pie for a long time now. However, arriving so late to the party with Concord – long after Overwatch, Fortnite, and Warzone – the remaining crumbs were little to sustain a modest multiplayer title, let alone an ambitious new IP with a hulking AAA budget. It didn’t matter how strong the core gameplay was, there just wasn’t enough interest. And instead of dangling a roadmap in front of players and relying on them to occasionally splurge on a neat skin or battle pass as Warner Bros. did with the year’s other huge flop, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/05/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review/">Suicide Squad</a>, Sony <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/03/concord-is-shutting-down-this-week-refunds-being-issued-while-they-explore-options/">axed the game within weeks of its big launch</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/29/sony-permanently-shuts-down-concord-and-developer-firewalk-studios/">closed the studio a couple months later</a>.</p>
<p>After a recent winning streak, this comes as a real blow to the PlayStation brand and is sure to have a ripple effect on other multiplayer projects Sony had in the pipeline, as well as its willingness to invest in new IP.</p>
<h2>Toxic Gamers – Also Disappointing</h2>
<p>Toxicity has always been an issue in gaming. However, where it was once limited to multiplayer trash-talking and forum board trolling, it has become a industry within itself. A machine fuelled by blind hatred and misinformation, piloted by talentless husks who try to make a living from inciting “anti-woke” rage while never creating anything of value themselves. The mere presence of minority representation or, God forbid, a modestly clothed female protagonist, is met with senseless vitriol.</p>
<p>It’s a sickening trend that has made online gaming spaces less and less habitable by folks with a reasonable brain cell count and always begs the questions – why are people, particularly grown men, getting so upset about entertainment products? The second-hand embarrassment is almost unbearable.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>We’ll be back to the lighter and brighter side of gaming tomorrow with our overall Game of the Year winner, but in the meantime</em></p>

			<p>At the moment, the reason behind these hacks is unknown, but clearly, it's so that they can get their hands on the valuable resources that can help you to become powerful in the late game. Path of Exile 2 finally made its way into <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-path-of-exile-2-and-marvel-rivals-all-broke-records-this-weekend/">Early Access after being highly anticipated</a> by those who are fans of the cRPG genre. However, it seems that those who are in the late game have logged on to find that their accounts have been compromised, with highly valuable resources missing from their stash and their inventories. Since inventories are shared between characters, this allows for easier leveling of any other classes that the player may try out. To lose such valuable items is a huge, devastating loss, as a lot of them require a ton of grinding to be able to obtain them in the first place.</p>
<p>Most shockingly, it seems that the hackers managed to make it past Steam 2FA without a bat of an eye. Some of those who were affected have said that they received an email from someone trying to get into their account, but somehow, they still managed to slide past the Steam 2FA anyway. If it's that easy to do, it means that Steam will likely have a bigger problem than just what is currently going on with Path of Exile 2.</p>
<p>People are sharing their stories on the<a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3667200" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> official Path of Exile forums</a>, where they share how they found out that their accounts had been compromised. It doesn't spell good news for those who were impacted, as Grinding Gear Games has said that they are unable to roll back the materials that were stolen by other players, basically leaving players to grind for the materials all over again, with hours of gameplay lost to a hacker.</p>
<p>It's reported that the hacker is known on the forums, as he would share updates as he was going. However, he would continuously change his username, making it hard to keep track of him. Whether there were more people involved remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it isn't just impacting Path of Exile 2. Even those who are still playing the original Path of Exile are finding their resources impacted, with tons of Gems and other valuable resources completely missing from their account. As a result of the hack, some players are finding that their accounts have now been banned, and they have lost access to the game.</p>
<p>Grinding Gear Games is tackling this and is working to resolve the bans on accounts that were impacted, but it's said that this process can take weeks to deal with, meaning that players won't have access to their Path of Exile 2 accounts for the unforeseeable.</p>
<p>If you've been hacked, please let us know your story in the comments.</p>

Historically, Sonic’s one-sided love affair with the pink, hammer-wielding hedgehog has consisted of Amy fawning over the blue blur. He’s fast, charming, and a hero to the people. It’s easy to see why Amy would grow infatuated with a guy who saved her life but is emotionally unavailable. However, the <em>Sonic</em> series has started to flip the dynamic in recent years. The <em>Sonic Boom </em>version of our hero is implied to have feelings for Amy, but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@captaintoadthemushroom/video/7303124575229938976&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@captaintoadthemushroom/video/7303124575229938976" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mostly through gags and teasing</a></span> from his friends. And in <em>Sonic Frontiers</em>, Sonic is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBIH0j3UyLE&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBIH0j3UyLE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more or less confirmed</a></span> to have finally come around to the idea of a romantic relationship with Amy, so we’ve definitely moved out of the “Amy hopelessly chasing Sonic” era of their dynamic. With Sega having mostly shed this lopsided relationship, Paramount has the opportunity to turn the entire thing on its head in the live-action universe.</p><p>We still don’t know anything about Amy’s role in the movies, but we do know that Ben Schwartz’s take on Sonic is defined largely by him being a pop-culture-brained doofus prone to bursts of emotion, often in the name of defending those he cares about. As shown in the first movie, he’s been in isolation for much of his life, and he’s not quite the smooth talker we’ve seen in the games. Hell, I’m not even sure Sonic has ever spoken to a woman hedgehog based on what we’ve seen of him in the movies. He was forced to leave his home planet and go to Earth at a young age, and he was the only hedgehog we saw in those early scenes. You expect me to believe that guy is gonna be anything other than an absolute dumbass tripping over himself trying to sort through all those feelings? Amy, meanwhile, is shown to be confident and capable in the few seconds we see of her, rather than the damsel in distress she started as in the games. This seems like the perfect opportunity to play with the relationship, and fans are already hoping to see the two’s romantic story flipped on its head.</p><p>What’s notable about Amy’s debut in the movies is that it’s a direct inverse of her introduction in the games. When Amy was first brought into the fold in <em>Sonic CD</em>, Sonic saved her from his robot doppelganger, Metal Sonic. In <em>Sonic 3</em>’s post-credits scene, she is the one who saves him from a squad of robot hedgehogs. So it seems like Paramount is already sowing the seeds for a “reverse” Sonic and Amy relationship. Still, we won’t know for sure until <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 4</em> premieres in 2027.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Leave it to the Like a Dragon game series, which is essentially a playable Japanese-crime soap opera when you get down to it, to rethink that idea.

This picture of Ichiban is your chance to back out now.</strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414286-like-a-dragon-iw-03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4414286" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414286-like-a-dragon-iw-03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4414286"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414286-like-a-dragon-iw-03.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Like a Dragon: Yakuza introduced us to Ichiban for the first time. As a longtime fan of the series, I was initially suspicious. I wondered, who's this guy? Who's this goofy-looking dork with hair like he bit down too hard on a live wire?</p><p dir="ltr">He quickly won me and many other Yakuza fans over quickly with his enthusiasm and seemingly bottomless well of optimism that he can pull from whenever he or someone he cares about seems to be cornered.</p><p dir="ltr">It was Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, though, that really cemented him as the new protagonist of this series. Sure, Like a Dragon: Yakuza had its share of drama, but Infinite Wealth put him through the wringer. He meets his first party member, Tomizawa, when Tomizawa takes him to a back alley of Honolulu to scam him. Then he meets his second, Chitose, when she drugs him and leaves him naked on a public beach (with only the most rudimentary command of English, too). After those early-game betrayals, he goes through bunches more, including the discovery that one of his warmest recent friendships was a ruse by the person who engineered Ichiban being fired from his job in disgrace.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414287-like-a-dragon-iw-04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4414287" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414287-like-a-dragon-iw-04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4414287"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414287-like-a-dragon-iw-04.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In the final moments of the game, though, Ichiban tracks that man down and convinces him to turn himself in to the cops. Ichiban carries the guy through Kamurocho to the police station, even as people huck trash at them the whole way.</p><p dir="ltr">The game opens on Ichiban trying to help ex-yakuza find legitimate jobs, and ends with him trying to rehabilitate someone who literally tried to destroy every bit of his life, and even those of his friends.</p><p dir="ltr">Kiryu will always be my favorite protagonist, but the way Ichiban plays reflects the difference in their approaches. Kiryu is kind of a time traveler, acting like the yakuza depicted in old crime movies. His missions are often about helping people, but they're often framed more like life lessons. For Ichiban, though, every chance to help someone is like a chance to cannonball off a diving board; he rushes into it against his own best interests and is immediately all-in. He trusts first and forgives quickly. It makes him seem naive at times, as we see in the opening hours of the game. But what it becomes is a rallying point for everyone around him. He's naive, yes, but he's also confident, brave, and reliable, and it's a virus that begins to infect all of the people around him who had been pushed out of society in different way.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414288-like-a-dragon-iw-05-jacked-danny-trejo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4414288" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414288-like-a-dragon-iw-05-jacked-danny-trejo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4414288"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414288-like-a-dragon-iw-05-jacked-danny-trejo.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Throughout Infinite Wealth, you build relationships with each of your party members, and when you stop by the watering hole they all chill at after a hard day of questing, you have the chance to take that relationship to the next level (no, not like that) by listening to them vent about their own rough histories, and then helping them overcome them.</p><p dir="ltr">Kiryu spends games trying to honorably isolate himself from everyone he knows and loves, seeing his presence as a curse on their lives--that the drama coming around them is entirely his fault. Ichiban is the opposite, though, as he works overtime to unite everyone around him.</p><p dir="ltr">So many games put you in the shoes of grimdark or tortured people--Alan Wake, Spider-Man 2's version of Peter Parker, Space Marine 2's Captain Titus, FFVII's Cloud, James Sunderland of Silent Hill 2, to name a few recent examples. Some of my favorite game characters are among that list, but even so, Ichiban continues to stand out as special in modern gaming: a video game hero who's excited to be there, ready to get a team together, and take on all challengers without ever coming across as trite, false, or annoying.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>More Best Of 2024:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/our-favorite-games-of-2024-that-didnt-make-the-top-10/2900-6090/" data-ref-id="2900-6090">Our Favorite Games That Didn't Make The Top 10</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-ps5-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6054/" data-ref-id="2900-6054">Best PS5-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6080/" data-ref-id="2900-6080">Best Switch-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-pc-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6083/" data-ref-id="2900-6083">Best PC-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-new-xbox-games-of-2024/2900-6081/" data-ref-id="2900-6081">Best Xbox Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2024/2900-5065/" data-ref-id="2900-5065">Best-Reviewed Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/best-of-2024/">Best Of 2024 hub</a></li></ul>

			<p>The Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR issues will be fixed in the near future, according to one of the game's developers.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-call-of-duty-black-ops-6s-ps5-pro-upgrades-are-more-substantial-than-you-may-think">Digital Foundry</a>, the game's Principal Rendering Engineer Michal Drobot confirmed that the game's PSSR issues, which include white flickering pixels appearing in certain scenarios and smearing issues with ultra-fine details, will be addressed very soon, as fixes for these issues are already in the pipeline and will be rolled out soon once the relevant patch goes through QA. Reportedly, these issues are caused by PSSR not being fine-tuned for denoising the image in its current state, and, as such, works better in anti-aliasing the image but not denoising the flicker created by shadows, variable rate shading, and SSR.</p>
<p>Besides confirming that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will soon be fixed on PlayStation 5 Pro, Digital Foundry provided an in-depth look at how the development team improved the game on the system over the base model and how the engine was improved for the latest entry in the series. You can find the full analysis below.</p>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Xbox One. You can learn more about the game in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-raining-fire/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Treyarch has arrived guns blazing with this year's Call of Duty entry. All three pillars of Campaign, Multiplayer, Zombies are among the best they've been in years. While some players might lament the addition of Omnimovement to the gunfights, there's a dynamic feel to the new mechanics that make Call of Duty feel more like a personal action movie.</em></p>

<p>PlayStation isn’t giving up on live service games any time soon. In a recent interview with Japanese outlet <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202412/26274" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Famitsu</a>, PlayStation Co-CEO Herman Hulst said that the company still believes in the model despite recent hiccups like Concord.</p>



<p>“The game business is constantly changing due to various factors, including technological advances, new genres and ways of playing,” Hulst said via auto translation. “However, one thing that remains constant is people’s desire for great entertainment experiences, and attention to games continues to grow. However, this has also created competition, and like many companies in the industry, we have had to make changes to our business to solidify a more sustainable operating base.”</p>



<p>Hulst continued by saying PlayStation will “continue to focus on developing live service titles along with the story-driven single-player titles that our players want.”</p>







<p>As far as why a  continued effort towards live service games, Hulst pointed to Helldivers 2’s success as a reason. The co-op title from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-biggest-surprise-hit-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arrowhead Game Studios showed how</a> a live service game can succeed in the modern era, and it’s something that Sony and PlayStation are paying attention to.</p>



<p>“We are learning a lot as we establish the ability to develop high-quality live service titles within SIE,” he said.&nbsp;“Helldivers 2 attracted many players through continuous content provision, and achieved results that support the potential of live service titles.”</p>



<p>What do you think of PlayStation moving forward with more live service games? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/item-shop-management-sim-recettear-is-getting-an-hd-remaster-next-year.1071294/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/recettear-hd-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EasyGameStation has announced&nbsp;<em>Recettear HD</em>, a remastered version of the cult classic 2007 item shop management sim that's coming next year.</p>

<p>Right now, we don't know a lot about the project. In <a href="https://x.com/Recettear_EGS/status/1873564667366506965" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an announcement post</a> on social media platform X (for which we're using machine translation), EasyGameStation simply says "we will open an item shop again in 2025", ending the post with the hashtag #RecettearHD.</p>

<p>Given the project's name, we're assuming it's not a ground-up remake of the game, but rather a remastered version for modern systems. Presumably, that also means we'll be seeing it on consoles, although it's difficult to say at this early stage.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/recettear-hd-remaster-2025-dungeon.jpg?itok=RTTQRLD5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/recettear-hd-remaster-2025-dungeon.jpg?itok=5v_BVVSw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Recettear HD&nbsp;</em>is coming sometime next year.</figcaption></figure><p>The screenshots released so far for the game include a shot of Recette standing in her item shop, as well as an adventurer exploring a dungeon and battling slimes.</p>

<p>In the first shot, we can see controller glyphs that somewhat resemble those of the Nintendo Switch, although all we've got to go on right now are an "A" and a "Y", which could also easily refer to Xbox controller glyphs.</p>

<p>We also don't yet know whether this version of the game will be localized outside of Japan, although one social media post seems to suggest that this will indeed be the case.</p>

<p>Andrew Dice, the founder of&nbsp;<em>Recettear&nbsp;</em>localization studio Carpe Fulgur, noted&nbsp;<em>Recettear HD</em>'s <a href="https://x.com/SpaceDrakeCF/status/1873584405652062392" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement on X</a>, promising more info "in the year to come". If Carpe Fulgur is involved, then it's very likely we will be seeing&nbsp;<em>Recettear HD&nbsp;</em>in the West.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/recettear-hd-remaster-2025-shop.jpg?itok=iq_StUKf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/recettear-hd-remaster-2025-shop.jpg?itok=wPFfYfby 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Recettear HD&nbsp;</em>looks like it'll be coming to the West, and probably to consoles as well.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with the original&nbsp;<em>Recettear</em>, it's an item shop management sim-slash-dungeon crawler along the lines of&nbsp;<em>Moonlighter&nbsp;</em>(which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/moonlighter-2-announced-2025" rel="nofollow">is itself getting a sequel next year</a>), although it's much more light-hearted and satirical than Digital Sun's game.</p>

<p><em>Recettear&nbsp;</em>revolves around Recette Lemongrass, a girl who must pay back a loan on behalf of her father by running an item shop. She must haggle with customers, send adventurers out on epic quests to retrieve loot, and generally deal with the vagaries of JRPG capitalism.</p>

<p><em>Recettear HD&nbsp;</em>lands sometime next year, although we don't know when or where yet. The original version is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/70400/Recettear_An_Item_Shops_Tale/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, and it's currently up for grabs at a tidy discount as well.</p>

The first trailer is full of nostalgia for the ‘60s comic books that launched the superhero, but with some stutter-y cel-shaded visuals that aren’t rubbing everyone the right way. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195896" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Spider-Man 2's New Web Wings Make It Feel Like A Proper Sequel" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="112" data-playlist="195896,196053,195859" data-current="195896"><div><p>Spider-Man 2's New Web Wings Make It Feel Like A Proper Sequel</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195896/195896_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195896/195896_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195896/195896_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195896/195896_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21410.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Streaming on Disney+ starting January 29, <em>Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man</em> tracks Peter Parker experimenting with his powers, costumes, and burgeoning social media popularity while juggling friendships and homework. The first trailer also teases the show’s different timeline in which Osborne, who is normally the Green Goblin, is the technological visionary standing by Spider-Man’s side instead of Stark’s Iron Man. It ends with a first look at the web-slinger’s white and black Fantastic Four suit as well. </p><p>Parker is voiced by Hudson Thomas, Osborne by Colman Domingo, and Aunt May by Kari Wahlgreen, with appearances by Charlie Cox’s Matt Murdock, Hugh Dancy’s Doctor Octopus, and other members of the <em>Spider-Man</em> supporting cast. Originally pitched as an origin story for Tom Holland’s version of the character in the MCU, <em>Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man</em> is now its own thing, free from the shackles of the live-action productions’ deep and convoluted lore. </p><p>The trailer nails the fusion of modern sensibilities with retro-looking styles, though its lithograph-inspired animation isn’t impressing everyone. Some fans think it looks too choppy and flat. Others are wondering if it’s a budget issue or if this was the intended effect. It certainly doesn’t look smooth, but the comic-book aesthetic comes with its own virtues.</p><p> There are already plenty of <em>Spider-Man</em> cartoons in more traditional styles, so I’m excited to see something that’s taking a fresh visual approach to the well-worn source material. Then again, I’ll also go to the mat defending the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Mm4ZGawqdk&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Mm4ZGawqdk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wild-looking 3D MTV series from 2003</a></span>. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stardew-valley-sales-40m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Smash hit indie farming sim&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</em>is somehow continuing its meteoric ascent despite the fact that it's almost nine years old, at least if its latest sales figures are anything to go by.</p>

<p>Over on the official <i>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</i>site's <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/press/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press portal</a>, Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone says that the game has managed to shift a staggering 41 million copies "as of December 2024".</p>

<p>According to Barone, more than 26 million of those copies have been sold on PC alone, while 7.9 million copies have been sold on the Nintendo Switch. The game's success being primarily PC-based makes a lot of sense given that that's the first platform on which it was released.</p>

Just a couple of months after the game's initial launch, it had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stardew-valley-breaks-million-copies-sold" rel="nofollow">crossed a million sales</a>, hitting <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stardew-valley-1-on-switch-eshop-over-35m-owners-on-steam" rel="nofollow">3.5 million players on Steam alone</a> in January 2018.</p>

<p>Even on mobile platforms, where free-to-play games reign supreme and upfront paid products often struggle,&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stardew-valley-ios-version-crosses-1-million-in-sales-on-itunes" rel="nofollow">managed to rake in $1 million</a> in sales on iOS within just a few weeks of its launch on the app store.</p>

<p>It's clear that&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</em>has struck a chord to an even greater degree than other cozy farming sims; it arguably spearheaded the current wave of such games, especially in the indie sphere, so its success makes a lot of sense through that lens.</p>

<p>The game, which is heavily inspired by the&nbsp;<em>Story of Seasons&nbsp;</em>(formerly&nbsp;<em>Harvest Moon</em>) franchise, even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/harvest-moon-creator-on-his-new-game-and-how-stard/1100-6445583/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">attracted praise</a> from that franchise's creator Yasuhiro Wada, who said&nbsp;<em>Stardew&nbsp;</em>"carries on the legacy of the original&nbsp;<em>Harvest Moon&nbsp;</em>very well".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stardew-valley-sales-40m-sign.jpg?itok=ZE5YXRQO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stardew-valley-sales-40m-sign.jpg?itok=N9wkuq20 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's no wonder Eric Barone is taking his time with his next game.</figcaption></figure><p>As for what Barone is working on next, he's currently developing a new cozy life sim-style game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/haunted-chocolatier-is-next-game-from-stardew-valley-developer-concernedape" rel="nofollow">by the name of&nbsp;<em>Haunted Chocolatier</em></a>.</p>

<p>The game's development is progressing slowly, largely because Barone is still working on&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley</em>, which he describes as a "big and popular game" to which he has "a lot of attachment".</p>

<p>He also says that&nbsp;<em>Haunted Chocolatier&nbsp;</em>will "still take a while", but that following the&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</em>1.6 release on all platforms, he "<a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/stardew-valley-1-6-mobile-console-release-date/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">would like to finish&nbsp;<em>Haunted Chocolatier&nbsp;</em>next</a>".</p>

<p>Here's hoping that happens sooner rather than later. Until then,&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/stardew-valley/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/stardew-valley/C3D891Z6TNQM" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/stardew-valley-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and mobile platforms.</p>
