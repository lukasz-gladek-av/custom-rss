Just within the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/06/13/a-deep-dive-into-dragon-age-the-veilguards-expansive-character-creator">character creator</a>, there are hundreds of options to customize things like hair, body type, what your playable character Rook's face looks like, and so much more. There are also a ton of armor options, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Companions have an armor slot, a ring slot, an accessory slot, and a weapon slot, while Rook has access to even more – a helmet, two weapon slots, a belt, an amulet slot, and two ring slots. A belt having its own slot might sound odd as it's not an armor piece people typically think of when kitting out an RPG warrior. However, the belt is an important facet of Rook's kit. The better Rook's belt, the better the potency of their healing potions, which are replenished by destroying green pots scattered about the world. That's not all, though, as higher-quality belts can proc [<em>editor's note</em>: proc is a term used as a shorter way of saying "programmed random occurrence"] additional effects like momentary invulnerability.&nbsp;</p>

</article><p>When creating your character, you can immediately view aspirational armors, which won't play into Rook's class until the "mid-to-late game," according to game director Corinne Busche. You can also toggle Rook's starting gear and casual wear in the creator, giving you a pretty good look at how Rook will look in more laidback cutscenes, in combat, and how they might appear later in your Veilguard journey. Busche tells me a lot of the gear in Veilguard is bespoke to your Rook or their followers, which is to say, an armor piece for a Warrior-class Rook probably won't be in a chest for a Mage-class Rook. On a similar note, armor designed for companion Bellara Lutara can't be used for another companion like Lace Harding.</p>

<p>In just my few hours viewing Busche play the game as part of my visit to BioWare's Edmonton office for our current <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/cover-reveal/2024/06/09/cover-reveal-dragon-age-the-veilguard"><em>Game Informer </em>cover story</a>, I see a lot of armor to collect from things like chests scattered about Arlathan Forest, for example, and elsewhere. Some of it looks awesome, and some of it doesn't quite line up with my personal taste. That's how it goes in the genre of RPGs.</p>

<p>However, Busche tells me there is transmogrification, or transmog for short, in the game, and calls it "robust." This means you can take an armor's stats and apply it to a different piece of armor. In other words, if you have a really cool piece of armor you like and find a new piece with better stats but don't want to give up the look of your current armor, you don't have to. Transmog allows you to take that new armor's stats and apply them to your current armor, giving you all the benefits while keeping the visual style you prefer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Transmog isnt just for Rook, though; you can transmog armor and other things for your companions as well. I don't get to see how Veilguard's transmog system works in-game, but just knowing it exists allows me to rest easy knowing my Rook will look as fashionable as possible while saving Thedas.&nbsp;</p>

While the teaser gave little away story-wise, the trailer did showcase the long-running fighting game's central characters, Sol Badguy and Sin Kiske. The trailer, which is stylized in a similar fashion to the game's cutscenes, pits the pair against a mysterious new foe named Unika, who has a grudge against Gears. </p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Arc System Works America (@ArcSystemWorksU) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArcSystemWorksU/status/1808932912542462425?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 4, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Guilty Gear stands head and shoulders above other fighting games series thanks in part to it being one of the flashiest anime fighters of all time. Consequently, Guilty Gear also has a reputation for being one of the <a href="https://youtu.be/QIjtNL7Pfqw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>hardest story timelines to follow</u></a>. A case in point is the fact that the story mode for Strive's predecessor, Guilty Gear Xrd Rev 2, is essentially an uninterrupted hour-long anime unto itself. For folks wondering where Guilty Gear Strive: Dual Riders will sit in the series storied lore, here's a plot synopsis for the show:</p><p>"After the decline of the once robust fields of science and technology, a new energy source known as magic fuels the modern era," the official description reads. "Humanity creates forbidden biological weapons: Gears. Those Gears eventually stand against humanity in a rebellion. Although they manage to overcome in the struggle for survival known as the Crusades, humanity’s losses are so great that even after several decades pass, their emotional wounds remain unable to fully heal. </p><p>"Sin Kiske, the child of a human and a Gear, heads to his father Ky and mother Dizzy’s wedding ceremony. Their wedding breaks the ultimate taboo: a union between a human and a Gear. Even with the world at peace, it took many years for such a ceremony to come to fruition. Despite the complex array of emotions surrounding it, the wedding ceremony is met with blessings. When suddenly, a mysterious girl appears… The fated child inheriting Gear blood–and the mysterious girl who despises Gears. Their meeting would shake the world."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/guilty-gear-strive-review"><u>our review</u></a> of Guilty Gear Strive, we gave the game a 9/10, saying, "Guilty Gear Strive sets a new standard for anime-like fighting games with its visuals, stellar netcode, and flexible fighting system that encourages and rewards creativity."</p><p>Isaiah Colbert is a freelance writer for IGN.

<p>The rise in popularity of gacha-style games, following the immense success of Genshin Impact and Honkai: Star Rail, led to additional titles from the same studio and many similar developers. But the former continues taking the world by storm, now with Zenless Zone Zero. But there’s a bit of confusion surrounding the release. Is Zenless Zone Zero mobile only?</p>



<h2 id="h-what-can-i-play-zenless-zone-zero-on">What Can I Play Zenless Zone Zero On?</h2>



<p>Thankfully, the answer to whether Zenless Zone Zero is mobile-only is a resounding “No.” You can play ZZZ on multiple systems, including PC, PlayStation 5, Android, and iOS. It’s free to play, though there are numerous microtransactions and in-game currencies to purchase with real-world money.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-zenless-zone-zero-on-console">Is Zenless Zone Zero on Console?</h2>



<p>Currently, the only console that supports Zenless Zone Zero is PlayStation 5. It’s unlikely miHoYo will backport the free-to-play gacha game to last-gen systems. Furthermore, none of their previous titles launched on Xbox Series X|S. We don’t expect this one to, either!</p>







<h2 id="h-is-zenless-zone-zero-free-on-ps5">Is Zenless Zone Zero Free on PS5?</h2>



<p>Yes! If you visit the PlayStation Store and search for “Zenless Zone Zero,” you’ll find the recent release completely free to download and play. There are no strings attached; add the game to your account, then wait for the rather large download size of around 60GB to finish before hopping in-game!</p>



<h2 id="h-will-zenless-zone-zero-be-on-nintendo-switch">Will Zenless Zone Zero Be On Nintendo Switch?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, it’s improbable that Zenless Zone Zero will launch on Nintendo Switch. While the studio unveiled Genshin Impact for Nintendo Switch, it never came about. They went quiet following its announcement, and many still wait impatiently for the handheld’s chance to play.</p>



<p>It’s likely Zenless Zone Zero won’t even receive an empty announcement for a Nintendo Switch port.</p>

			<p>A few hours ago, Rocksteady sent out an email newsletter to announce the release date and details for Suicide Squad Kill the Justice League Season 2.</p>
<p>The big addition is the playable new character Mrs. Freeze, also known as Nora Fries. She's an alternate version of Mr. Freeze, who is more commonly found in DC adaptations (including Batman Arkham City, where the Caped Crusader fights him in one of the boss battles). The newsletter did not go into further details on Mrs. Freeze's moveset, but the developers will likely do so shortly, given that Season 2 is coming to Suicide Squad Kill the Justice League next Thursday.</p>
<p>Episode 3, called Frozen Hearts, will add an Elseworlds Mayhem map, a Superman versus Flash Brainiac fight, an 'ever-changing' Metropolis,&nbsp;new Infamy sets and Notorious gear such as the Killer Frost Infamy set, Firefly Notorious, and Parasite Notorious Melee, and of course, a new Battle Pass.</p>
<p>Episode 4, called Winter, brings a Green Lantern versus Superman Brainiac fight, new incursions, new Infamy sets and Notorious gear such as the Captain Cold Infamy set, Icicle Notorious, and Trickster Notorious Melee, and new Shop items.</p>
<p>It does look like Rocksteady will keep its promise to deliver four seasons of post-launch content for the game despite its massive failure. As revealed by parent company Warner Bros., Suicide Squad Kill the Justice League <a href="https://wccftech.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-contributed-to-200-million-lower-ebitda-for-wb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contributed</a> to a $200 million lower EBITDA compared to last year's outstanding performance bolstered by Hogwarts Legacy. The game was also panned by critics, including Wccftech's Nathan Birch, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gave it just 5 out of 10</a>:</p>
<p><em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League has a sprinkling of that classic Rocksteady charm, delivering polished visuals, fluid traversal and combat, and some snappy repartee, but the whole experience is bogged down by dreary, repetitive mission design, empty live service elements, and a feel-bad story that’s mean-spirited to the point of feeling oddly resentful.</em></p>
<p>The studio isn't at any risk of being shut down, though. According to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, it will be given the chance to return to what it does best: a single-player game. Meanwhile, some Rocksteady employees <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-directors-cut/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are helping on a Hogwarts Legacy Director's Cut</a>.</p>

<p>Fortnite has just announced the commencement of the <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1808863497897304138" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">All Sweat Summer</a>, during which players can embark on exclusive quests to earn unique summer-themed rewards. In addition, Fortnite has decided to implement significant changes to the Ranked Mode as part of the All Sweat test. </p>



<p>These changes are designed to immerse players in a tournament-like experience. Discover all the alterations to Fortnite’s Ranked mode below.&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-time-to-sweat">Time to Sweat</h2>



<p>The Fortnite Status account has announced a series of changes that will be implemented in Ranked Battle Royale and Zero Build between July 4 and July 18. Among these changes, all vehicles and vehicle items, including the upgraded boss cars, will be disabled. The unique and new weapon of Chapter 5, Season 3, the Nitro Fists, will also be disabled. </p>



<p>Lastly, players will no longer be able to hire characters, but enemy NPCs and Bosses with medallions will still be present. It’s time to bring out your competitive spirit, as Fortnite’s All Sweat Test for Ranked mode has begun. The development team will be closely monitoring player feedback during this time.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>During All Sweat Summer, Ranked Battle Royale and Zero Build will be switching things up a bit! From July 4 to July 18:</p><p>– Vehicles and vehicle items are disabled, including Boss Cars.<br>– Nitro Fists are also disabled.<br>– Characters are no longer Hireable, but hostile Characters… <a href="https://t.co/nLBFutgq7u">pic.twitter.com/nLBFutgq7u</a></p></div>— Fortnite Status (@FortniteStatus) <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteStatus/status/1808864035380601000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 4, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>For those wondering, you don’t need to worry about the entire season being vaulted; these changes only arrive for Fortnite’s Ranked Modes. The standard Battle Royale and Zero Build Mode will still include all the elements introduced for Fortnite’s Chapter 5 Season 3, Wrecked. </p>



<p>This consists of the newly announced <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1808139084440736232" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Magneto mythic, </a>which allows players to defend themselves with a metal shield and shoot projectiles at other players, builds and vehicles to cause damage.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/generative-ai-map-of-the-united-states<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Maybe you’ve been on Twitter and seen the video of “<a href="https://x.com/bindureddy/status/1807928777357644027" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stunning AI spaghetti art</a>” that one gormless loser has claimed is proof that generative AI will one day win Oscars and Grammys. This is what I do every time I hear that claim: I ask ChatGPT to draw a map of the United States.</p><p>Before I show you the image that ChatpGPT produced for me today after being given the prompt “use ascii art to draw a map of the United States,” I want you to imagine the contours of the United States in your mind. It’s July 4th, after all, a day when we celebrate America’s freedoms, such as … and … and who could forget …. You might not be able to remember all of the states names, but I can picture the Florida panhandle and the weird triangle part of Texas and the curvature of California. Hold that image in your head, and now scroll down.</p><hr><figure></figure><p>Is this a fluke? A one off? No. Here’s another response to this prompt that looks like a little dog.</p><figure></figure><p>Generative AI is stupid. It is not a thinking machine. Art is made by people who can see and interpret symbols, and then re-interpret them into new images. At the very least it is made by people who can picture the United States in their mind and draw a vague outline of it when prompted. All the rest is stunning AI spaghetti art.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s a claw machine game! It’s a deckbuilder! No, agreed, that sounds like it makes no sense, but look at the video above! See! It’s a 2D <em>Slay the Spire</em>-style battling roguelite, but you get your weapons and attacks from a claw machine above you. I mean, that’s scientifically genius.

It describes itself as an RPG, while the footage seems to show some sort of QTE-based turn-based combat, all set within a paint-based explosion of color that seems very inspired by Holi.</p><p><em>Aikyam</em> is coming to consoles as well as PC, with the support of various Canadian funding groups.

It’s hard to argue you’ve played too many of those. However, rather than just looping against your will, here the game is about manipulating the situation to uncover all the secrets and solve the crime.</p><p><em>The Posthumous Investigation</em> is inspired by the works of 19th century Brazilian author, Machado De Assis, who I could pretend to have heard of, or just link you to the same <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machado_de_Assis&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machado_de_Assis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia article I just read</a></span>.</p><p>This is coming from the co-developer of mobile game <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://slashquest.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://slashquest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Slash Quest</em></a></span>, which by odd coincidence is the game I’ve been playing on my tablet all week.</p><p>Developer: Mother Gaia Studio</p><p>Release Date: Q4 2024</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2718010/Slash_Quest/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2718010/Slash_Quest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wishlist</a></span></p></div><div><p>Crafting games pretty much took over for a while there.

A spelling that isn’t even close to as strange as the game. This is about raising your very out mushroom child, from spore to... young woman? Calling itself a “life simulation game,” it sure looks a lot more like a super-fucked-up RPG to me, and I am very much wishlisting it as I type this. (Literally, I stopped mid-sentence and did it.) Ooh, and there’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2484580/Mushroom_Musume/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2484580/Mushroom_Musume/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a demo</a></span>.</p><p>Did the trailer... did it say “commit murder”?</p><p>Developer: Mortally Moonstruck Games</p><p>Release Date: Q4 2024</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2484580/Mushroom_Musume/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2484580/Mushroom_Musume/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wishlist</a></span></p></div><div><p>OMG, you <em>have</em> to check out the trailer above.

They <em>are</em> voxels! <em>Dawn Apart </em>is a fully destructible base-building sim, that’s combining building a space colony with the high fashion of factory building. It’s about, um, colonizing a planet and exploiting its resources, so you’ll also want to defend your buildings from the locals. Except—phew—apparently you can just jack all that in and instead try to destroy the corporation by starting a rebellion!</p><p>Developer: Industrial Technology and Witchcraft</p><p>Release Date: TBA</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1866300/Dawn_Apart/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1866300/Dawn_Apart/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wishlist</a></span></p></div><div><p>My job here is to write a useful summary of what the game’s about, but having watched the trailer above I just want to make explodey-bang noises with my mouth, then pa-chew pa-chew sounds as I pretend to fire magic spells. I think that would be the perfect description of <em>Blood For The Old Gods</em>. </p><p>It describes itself as “a flintlock fantasy roguelite where you shoot, summon, and survive your way across the war-torn countryside,” but I still think “pa-chew!” captures it better. This looks stunning!</p><p>Developer: Foggy Box Games</p><p>Release Date: “Early Access Soon”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2668030/Blood_for_the_Old_Gods/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2668030/Blood_for_the_Old_Gods/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wishlist</a></span></p></div><div><p>In case you’ve ever wondered what the criteria for guaranteed inclusion in a list like this might be, I will reveal it to you for reading all the way through this slideshow. It’s making your game entirely out of scanned-in pieces of fabric. Shhhh, don’t tell anyone else.</p><p>That’s why <em>Hyperdrive Inn</em> is here, an adventure game set in an infinite hotel “on the edge of collapse.” It looks spectacularly bonkers, and there’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2561260/Hyperdrive_Inn/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2561260/Hyperdrive_Inn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a demo</a></span> to make sure.</p><p>Developer: Horsefly Games</p><p>Release Date: October</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2561260/Hyperdrive_Inn/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2561260/Hyperdrive_Inn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wishlist</a></span></p></div><div><p>Third-person story-led game <em>Spiral</em> has a wonderful-looking aesthetic, and a very tough-sounding subject matter. It’s a game about cognitive degeneration, as an older man called Bernard says goodbye to his childhood memories. Handled well, this could be very touching. There’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1579390/Spiral/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1579390/Spiral/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a demo</a></span> ahead of a September release.</p><p>Developer: Folklore Games</p><p>Release Date: September</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1579390/Spiral/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1579390/Spiral/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wishlist</a></span></p></div><div><p>This looks a bit like if <em>Hades</em> hated you. A really ace-looking roguelite brawler, set in the world of an ‘80s graphic novel, in what promises to be a “punishing” game.</p><p>What stands out to me in the trailer is how your own character’s attacks are telegraphed in the same way as the enemies’, with marks on the ground in front of you—I think that could be a really neat design. Oh, and all the blood. There’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1266060/Lethal_Honor__Order_of_the_Apocalypse/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1266060/Lethal_Honor__Order_of_the_Apocalypse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a demo</a></span>, too.</p><p>Developer: Viral Studios</p><p>Release Date: 2024</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1266060/Lethal_Honor__Order_of_the_Apocalypse/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1266060/Lethal_Honor__Order_of_the_Apocalypse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wishlist</a></span></p></div><div><p>The stranger the premise, the more intrigued I become. <em>Underboard</em> wins here, with an aut0-battler set on a chess board that’s all about team-building. Yes please.</p><p>You apparently will assign rules, spells and tactics to your team of characters before a battle, and then watch it play out accordingly.

You may have heard of the global craze for taiyaki inspired by the work <em><a title="Games > Kanon [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/kanon">Kanon</a></em>, but are you familiar with its original creator and head writer, Naoki Hisaya? I had the honor of being a sub-writer for that project. Naoki Hisaya started the trend of ‘<a title="Genres > Visual Novel [417 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/visual-novel">visual novel</a>s that make players cry,’ a pursuit that I have passionately followed for over 20 years. The pinnacle of this journey is <em>Heaven Burns Red</em>. Whereas Hisaya used sophisticated storytelling techniques to evoke tears, I took a rather direct approach, and that’s the essence of <em>Heaven Burns Red</em>. To think that this work would be released in places where he sparked the taiyaki craze—such a delightful coincidence feels like fate. We eagerly look forward to sharing <em>Heaven Burns Red</em> with you. Thank you.”</p><p>Jun Maeda, a Japanese writer and composer. He is considered a pioneer of visual novel and his notable works includes <em>AIR</em>, <em>CLANNAD</em>, <em>Little Busters!</em>, and <em>Angel Beats!</em>. </p></blockquote><p>Watch the western announcement trailer and a video message from Jun Maeda below.

It's a "deluxe collector grade figure with 42 points of articulation and 12 different accessories including multiple face plates and alternative hands." The figure will be released in August 2024, with preorders now available.</p><p>Coming soon after in The Shapes Collection is Kratos and Atreus from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-review">God of War Ragnarok</a>, Varl from Horizon Forbidden West, and Jin Sakai from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-review">Ghost of Tsushima</a>. These figures have between 24 and 34 points of articulation depending on the model, and two to four different accessories each.

"We made sure the many articulation points made sense and even the finest textural detail shows up on the figures."</p><p>Creative director at Ghost of Tsushima studio Sucker Punch Jason Connell chimed in too. "Jin’s Ghost armor has so many beautiful details, including intricate fabric patterns and overlapping armor plates that are integral to the design of his character," he said. "In addition to his katana, it’s also always important to us to see all of his various Ghost tools represented to capture his different fighting techniques."</p><p>PlayStation didn't reveal if further figures would be released down the road, but as these four just scratch the surface of its wealth of franchises, it's perhaps likely. Other potential figures could include Ellie from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-i-review">The Last Us</a>, Nathan Drake from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/11/uncharted-4-a-thiefs-end-review">Uncharted</a>, Spider-Man from, well, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvels-spider-man-2-review">Spider-Man</a>, and more.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/dragonballgames/status/1808863367324430671" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on X today, the official Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot account revealed that the game has now reached 8 million copies sold.</p>



<p>The team thanked players for their support in reaching the milestone. However, they also teased that “we hope you look forward to what’s coming next.” The devs did not confirm any clear details about this, but it could possibly signal future DLC. </p>



<p>The most recent DLC for the game was Goku’s Next Journey, which released in February 2024. It expanded beyond Kakarot’s main story, concentrating on material from the anime.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Over 8 millions of you have shown your support for DRAGON BALL Z: KAKAROT. </p><p>Thank you for helping us reach this great milestone – we hope you look forward to what’s coming next! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DBZK?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DBZK</a> <a href="https://t.co/c8TnMYbW0o">pic.twitter.com/c8TnMYbW0o</a></p></div>— Dragon Ball Games (@dragonballgames) <a href="https://twitter.com/dragonballgames/status/1808863367324430671?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 4, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>CyberConnect2’s hit action RPG Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot originally launched in 2020 to solid reviews. It still has an 8.1 user score on Metacritic, as well as “Very Positive” reviews on Steam, four years after launch.</p>



<p>Kakarot only recently joined Steam in Japan, and the game is currently having a major sale on Steam through July 11, 2024.</p>



<p>The devs could potentially reveal more about the future of Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot at Tokyo Game Show this year. The event is coming in September 2024, and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tokyo-game-show-2024-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">schedule and theme</a> for this year were confirmed last February.</p>



<p>In the meantime, Dragon Ball fans might also look forward to Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero. The anticipated fighting game now has a release date <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for October 11, 2024</a>. It will also have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-leak-teases-special-edition-pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a special edition</a> available in physical format.</p>

			<p>Considering the vast amount of killing and death that takes place in many games, it’s rare to have any consideration of what happens afterwards. Other than technical discussions about whether enemy bodies remain visible or disappear to save on processing power, the fate of the dead generally remains unanswered. Well, Autopsy Simulator promises to change this and puts the cadaver front and centre. Or, at least that’s what the premise of the game suggests. As things stand, however, the game actually turns out to be a rather different kettle of fish.</p>
<p><iframe title="Autopsy Simulator | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/imJTlY8Tv-s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The simulator genre in general suggests an attempt to more or less accurately represent some kind of profession or activity, starting off with simple tutorials before developing in complexity and difficulty such games have encompassed everything from farming to power washing. Such an approach being applied to the messy but fascinating business of working a mortuary had my interest piqued. Things start off relatively well as the tutorial aspects are introduced through the fantastical in-game technique of your character filming lectures for prospective students. This beginning left me excited for the addition of more developed examples and looking forward to the training wheels being taken off. Unfortunately this never really happens and the five autopsies you carry out during the game are all strictly on rails.</p>



<p>Aesthetically, Autopsy Simulator is solid enough with effective graphics and audio. The interior of the bodies and associated organs are detailed and respond to your interventions with a grisly but realistic feeling of squishiness – obviously I’m not speaking from direct experience here! Voice acting is far more important here than I expected going in, but is functional rather than exceptional. This is a shame as what the game morphs into absolutely requires you to have sympathies for your player character. This is a game that follows the trend of ‘simulator’ games being infused with stories, and it becomes clear early on that you are mourning the loss of your late wife, which becomes the dominant motif throughout. While this could have made for an emotionally involving narrative, the execution is lacking.</p>

<p>Rather than a clinical but mechanically deep simulator or a genuinely creepy thriller that takes advantage of the natural unease created by the proximity of corpses in the game, Autopsy Simulator plays out as a pretty generic sad guy horror game with a twist ending that is as predictable as it is disappointing. A great deal of the game ends up with you wandering around areas finding the next interactive object to unlock the next section with no real puzzles or player involvement. As a result I found myself stuck between wanting the narrative parts to be over and finding the autopsies underwhelming and overly simplistic.</p>
<p>The elephant in the room is the inevitable comparisons and parallels to Mortuary Assistant – many people who enjoyed that game a couple years ago will be drawn toward Autopsy Simulator for the aesthetics and seeming tone alone, but they are very different experiences. Mortuary Assistant is much more a horror game than Autopsy Simulator, which feels much more like a hidden object game and walking sim set in and around the morgue.</p>

<p>All this being said, there are plans for an extra autopsy only mode which will be added as a free update in the future and if this is handled well then it might be worth revisiting what feels more like a proof of concept attached to a sophomoric thriller narrative than a full game. It is a real shame as the base mechanics for the actual autopsy sections, with the building blocks of possible puzzles to ascertain cause of death, have real potential. It’s just potential that is currently unfulfilled.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		I went into Autopsy Simulator with expectations and hopes for a game that confronted the messy realities of mortality and gave an insight into the neglected world of the mortuary. However, the game at present is so preoccupied with telling a hackneyed story that it is difficult to recommend. Hopefully the promised autopsy only mode will remedy this.	</p></div>
