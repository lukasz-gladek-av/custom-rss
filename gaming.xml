		<p>A trio of Resident Evil games are heading to Nintendo Switch with Resident Evil 7, aka Resident Evil Biohazard, and Resident Evil 8, aka Resident Evil Village, all launching on the same day as the new game, Resident Evil Requiem.</p>
<p>You can read our hands of preview of<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/20/resident-evil-requiem-preview-first-person-frights-third-person-delights/"> Resident Evil Requiem here</a>, and there’s a handy video as well.</p>
<p><iframe title="Resident Evil Requiem Preview – First person frights, third person delights" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pIE471UnNVc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The ninth mainline Resident Evil game casts players as Grace Ashcroft who – as RE law dictates – finds herself embroiled in an apocalyptic scenario that has players running a gauntlet of jump scares as they peel back layers of a grander conspiracy.</p>

<p>Much like Resident Evil 7, and Village, Requiem will feature first person gameplay and visuals powered by Capcom’s silky smooth RE Engine. Instead of being chased by the shambling undead, Gamescom footage shows Grace and her mother escape the clutches of someone who appears to be a deranged serial killer. It’s definitely a change of direction for Resi though one that will no doubt loop back to the familiar tropes this series is known for, with fan favourite characters likely to make an appearance at some point.</p>
<p><iframe title="Resident Evil Requiem - 2nd Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tOYqFlgF6t8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Director Koshi Nakanishi gave insides on how the game is built around the concept of addictive fear –&nbsp;as in, the cathartic effect of overcoming fears. He also discussed how that ties in with the new protagonist, FBI agent Grace Ashcroft, who is shy and introverted, needing to overcome her fears and leaning on her training to be able to use a gun and fast deduction skills.</p>
<p>Leon had been in consideration to be the lead character for this new game, and would certainly have been popular, so why not return to the franchise staple?</p>
<p>“We always thought about making Leon the protagonist,” Nakanishi-san said. “But making a horror game based around him is difficult. He wouldn’t jump at something like a bucket falling. No one wants to see Leon scared by every little thing, so he’s actually quite a bad match for horror.”</p>
<p>All three Resident Evil games will launch on Nintendo Switch 2 on 27th February 2026.</p>

<p>Fortune of battle</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Closing out today's Nintendo Direct was a surprise announcement — we're getting a brand new Fire Emblem game on Switch 2 in 2026.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fire-emblem-fortunes-weave">Fire Emblem: Fortune's Weave</a> looks absolutely incredible and appears to take place in an arid region with a huge colosseum seemingly a central feature.</p>
<p>Expect more tactical gameplay, some rather lovely character designs, and a few hints at some interconnected lore...</p>
<p>Here's what we know so far:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Heroic Games have begun. The newest entry in the Fire Emblem series is set to enter the arena. The debut trailer provided a glimpse of the intertwining story, characters and turn-based tactical RPG gameplay that awaits players when the game launches for Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026."</p></blockquote><blockquote>

<p>And it's not a Cloud Version!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Following recent rumours, Capcom has confirmed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> will launch on the Switch 2 alongside the other platforms on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>This entry will follow Grace Ashcroft as she investigates mysterious deaths, including that of her mother, <strong>RE: Outbreak's</strong> Alyssa Ashcroft. The game will also feature the ruined remains of Raccoon City and the R.P.D station.</p>
<p>It's also been confirmed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil: Village</a> will be heading to the Switch 2 on the same date. Both titles originally launched on the Switch as Cloud Versions to much criticism, so hopefully these native versions will go toward restoring some faith from Nintendo fans.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-is-bringing-back-the-virtual-boy-with-a-new-nintendo-switch-and-switch-2-compatible-accessory-and-switch-online-classic-titles.1296240/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo is bringing back the Virtual Boy. No, really. Nintendo will once again sell the Virtual Boy, this time as an accessory for your Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 device, to play Virtual Boy games through a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-online-adds-game-boy-game-boy-advance/">Nintendo Switch Online Plus Expansion Pack</a> subscription. It'll be available on February 17, 2026.</p>



<p>The Virtual Boy accessory is required to play any of the Virtual Boy classic titles added to Nintendo Switch Online, as this is technically the latest 'classic console' Nintendo is adding to the subscription. Your Switch or Switch 2 slots into the Virtual Boy headset with the joycons removed, and with your face in the headset, you'll be able to play games like Mario's Tennis, Galactic Pinball, Teleroboxer, and more.</p>



<p>All 14 of the Virtual Boy titles released in North America will be making their way to the subscription service over time, though the three mentioned above were the only ones that showed some gameplay, so expect Mario's Tennis, Galactic Pinball, and Teleroboxer to be among the first games released for the new version of the Virtual Boy when it arrives in February 2026.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Virtual Boy – Nintendo Classics arrives February 17th (Nintendo Switch 2 / Nintendo Switch)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0aXT9wzOLFg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>You'll have to be a Nintendo Switch Online subscriber to buy one in the first place, and while it's not clear yet how much it'll cost, there will be a classic cardboard version also available, that will hopefully be cheaper than the plastic version shown in the above trailer.</p>



<p>Whatever the cost, Nintendo has already proven it can <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-labo-vr-kit-announced/">make money by selling cardboard to its players</a>. And while it's great for people who were fans of the headset when it first launched and catastrophically bombed, it can't help but be a little comical, considering that this iteration of Nintendo's foray into VR will last longer than the original did, since it will almost certainly be on sale for longer than a calendar year.</p>

			<p>Resident Evil Requiem, the next entry in the survival-horror series by CAPCOM announced earlier this year, is coming to Nintendo Switch 2 as well as on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>



<p>A new trailer shown during today's Nintendo Direct provided a first look at the Switch 2 version of the game, which seems to look fine despite a noticeable visual downgrade over the other versions of the game and 30 FPS gameplay, and confirmed the game will hit the new generation Nintendo system on February 27, 2026, the same day it launches on the other systems. Additionally, as previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/ports-of-every-re-engine-game-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2/">rumored</a>, Resident Evil VII Biohazard and Resident Evil Village will also launch on the Nintendo Switch 2 on the same day.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Although we have yet to see any combat, Resident Evil Requiem is setting out to be one of the best entries in the series. During Gamescom last month, I had the chance to try out the game, and I was thoroughly impressed by the game's visuals and sound production, which create an amazing atmosphere that will only feel more eerie and scary when I finally will be able to experience the game under the proper conditions in a few months. You can learn more about what else the game seems to be doing really well in my<a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/"> preview.</a></p>



<p>Resident Evil Requiem launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Nintendo Switch 2 on February 27, 2026.</p>

            <p>Supergiant Games have finally done The Thing, following some patch teases that'd left things in a bit of an '<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sike-hades-2-devs-supergiant-had-another-pre-full-release-patch-hiding-under-their-himation">either go or get off the pot' situation</a>. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a>'s full release is nigh, with version 1.0 set to drop later this month.</p>
<p>I'm pleased, because the sequel to the horniest ancient Greek roguelike of all time was already very good in early access form. I'm also terrified, because it's not like September hasn't already had enough games to fight for my attention, between <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>.

<p>Anyway, Hades 2 version 1.0 arrives September 25th, as announced during today's Nintendo Direct. That showcase featured the launch trailer you can check out above, which teases the battle "beyond the underworld" which awaits Melinoë as she continues her war against Chronos, the insufferable time fellow.</p><p>Developers Supergiant have confirmed in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/512967793587520056?l=english">post on Steam</a> that this update'll be free so long as you already own the early access version of the game, while the current price will be staying the same if you're buying for the first time. 1.0 also brings "cross-saves between the Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 versions and the version here on Steam", if you want to utterly betray your PC roots and build on your progress over on one of the Mario devices.</p>
<p>"Hades II is our team's first-ever sequel, and we've been giving it everything we've got for more than four and a half years," the devs added. "Since May of 2024, we've been developing in Early Access, taking feedback from our player community to try and fully realize this game's potential. The result is the biggest game we've ever made, and one we hope you'll find to be a worthy successor to its namesake."
</p>
<p>Our Brendy wrote the following about Hades 2 when he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2-early-access-review">reviewed its initial early access version</a> last year:</p>
<blockquote>Roguelikes, I feel, don't suffer as much as other genres from the early access path. The first Hades did it and it quickly became one of our best action games. So, I hereby grant you permission to crack through as much as this follow-up has got to offer, to get briefly obsessed, and then to put it aside for months. The piecemeal, adaptive storytelling is still there too, eschewing anything so simple as the classic three-act structure. Which, for me, makes long absences that much easier to bear. Like the game's own shrouded Narcissus, Hades 2 is already inviting and attractive, even in its unfinished form.</blockquote>
<p>Now, get out of the Melinoë, I've got to go remind myself how to do a Hades so my first version 1.0 run doesn't end in embarrassing fashion after about three rooms. </p>

              <p>The rumors were true. Capcom’s blockbuster horror series is finding a new home on Switch 2. Not only will <a href="https://kotaku.com/re9-resident-evil-9-trailer-teaser-sgf-summer-game-fest-1851783941"><em>Resident Evil Requiem</em></a> be a day-one release on Nintendo’s portable console in February 2026, but <em>Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</em> and <em>Resident Evil Village</em> will be joining it as a collection on the same day.</p> <p>The Switch 2 trailer opened with <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-9-grace-trailer-gamescom-mother-2000618547">FBI agent Grace Ashcroft</a> investigating a series of murders in a spooky hotel amid one jumpscare after another. The footage appeared to be taken from a Switch 2 though the trailer didn’t immediately confirm that. If that’s the case, the ninth mainline <em>Resident Evil</em> isn’t looking too shabby on the weaker hardware.</p>  <p><em>Requiem</em> is out February 27, 2026 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC as well. That’s also the day that some older <em>Resident Evil</em> games will finally make their way to Nintendo’s platform. Gold editions of Capcom’s <em>Resident Evil 7</em> and <em>Resident Evil Village</em>&nbsp;will both arrive then as well.</p>

 <p>These unexpected<em> Resident Evil</em> ports were rumored prior to today’s Nintendo Direct, with leakers suggesting the rest of the modern <em>Resident Evil</em> series, including remakes of <em>3</em> and <em>4</em> as well as <em>Resident Evil Village</em>, will arrive on Switch 2 eventually as well.</p> <p>While not confirmed, that fact that Capcom seems to be having so much success getting RE Engine games running on the new console is a good sign that we could see some of Capcom’s other blockbusters arrive on it, including maybe <em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em> and <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>. The latter is still in rough shape even on PC, though, so we’ll have to wait and see.</p>

                <p>The Switch 2 is about to become a hub for horror, as during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-september-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7026/" data-ref-id="2900-7026">September Nintendo Direct</a>, Capcom announced that it was bringing ports of Resident Evil 7 and Resident Evil Village to the Switch 2, while Resident Evil 9: Requiem will come to the console as well.

The first full-length game to utilize the RE Engine, Resident Evil 7 returned to the survival-horror roots of the franchise and it received critical acclaim. Capcom's Resident Evil 2 and 3 remakes were also well-received, and the Resident Evil 4 remake was one of the best video games of 2023.</p><p>The next game in the series, Resident Evil: Requiem, launches on February 27, 2026, for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch 2.

According to a press release, "Mysterious distortions" appear in Lumiose City, which connect to "Hyperspace Lumiose." The teaser also showcases the designs for both Mega Raichu forms, with Mega Raichu X having two tails and Mega Raichu Y sporting longer, pointer ears.</p><p>Preorders for the DLC will come with "Holo-X and Holo-Y apparel items," which will be available for use in Pokemon Legends: Z-A when it launches on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 on October 16.</p><p>A new trailer for the base Pokemon Legends: Z-A game premiered right before the DLC reveal.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Fire Emblem is back, and for the first time, it's launching on Switch 2. Fortune's Weave, the latest in the series, centers around a coliseum, which seems to hold the "heroic games," but if we know anything about the series, this seemingly friendly competition will eventually devolve into a massive war between kingdoms. You can check out the reveal trailer below.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j6eNaiftiWE"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j6eNaiftiWE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The trailer focuses on four main characters. Cai (the apparent protagonist based on the fact that we see him freely roaming around the city), says, "I only want to fight so I can save my father's life," making him an unwilling participant in the game. Meanwhile, Theodora boasts about her strength and hopes to be a worthy queen, Deitrich (who looks a lot like Castlevania's Alucard) wants to confront some kind of darkness, and Leda is on a quest for revenge so intense that killing her foe isn't enough. It seems that the winner of the games will get a wish granted by the kingdom's "divine sovereign," which tracks, given that the titular Fire Emblem is typically an artifact that grants one's wishes.</p><p>The trailer ends with what appears to be Sothis, the magical girl in the player's head in Three Houses, now an adult. She remarks on the years being long, and given that it's been six years since Three Houses hit Switch, I'm inclined to agree. The trailer ends with a release window: 2026. I'm a huge fan of both <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/fire-emblem-three-houses/head-of-the-class">Three Houses</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/fire-emblem-engage/propelling-to-the-future-using-the-past">Engage</a>, so I'm excited to learn more about Fortune's Weave next year.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/09/12/fire-emblem-fortunes-weave-comes-to-switch-2-in-2026]]></content:encoded>

First we got a bit of business involving the likes of a 40th anniversary ticket for the Nintendo Museum in Japan and a reminder about the Mario theme park land over at Epic Universe, Florida.

Yup, we got a name for the Mario movie sequel - officially titled The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> Movie - plus a first trailer tease.

The delightfully daft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-bros-wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a> is the latest Switch 1 game to get a Switch 2 upgrade. Alongside the excellent base adventure we've seen before, it includes a new mode called Meetup in Bellabell Park. It's essentially a world packed with mini-games where players can work with or against their friends. Nintendo is also teasing other new content for a later reveal, and if that appeals, it's out "spring" next year. Oh, and there's a new Talking Flower toy coming too.

After a rapid-fire rundown of games to come, we got something spooky. The latest instalment in Capcom's long-running survival horror series, Resident Evil Requium, is heading to Switch 2 on 27th February next year. And that's not all! Resident Evil 7 and 8 are also on the way, both Switch 2 bound on 27th February.

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> at long last has a release date on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
First <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-is-coming-to-switch-2">unveiled at the Switch 2 reveal Direct</a>, the game was aiming for a winter launch. Now we have a firm date: 22nd January 2026.
</p>
<p>
Notably, this is the Intergrade version, meaning it includes the Yuffie DLC as well as the first game.

<p>There's no official word yet on whether the game's follow-up Rebirth, or indeed the forthcoming final entry in the trilogy, are also coming to Switch 2.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/full-final-fantasy-7-remake-series-heading-to-switch-2-director-suggests">comments from director Naoki Hamaguchi</a> suggest the full trilogy will eventually make its way to Nintendo's new console.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>One of the early exclusive highlights of the Switch 2 era, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> is getting just that little bit bigger with a new tandem DLC pack that adds DK Island and Emerald Rush to the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Donkey Kong Bananza – DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush DLC, out now! (Nintendo Switch 2)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tkyp0u73cPY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>DK Island adds… well, it adds Donkey Kong’s home island to the game, letting DK and Pauline explore the idyllic scene. That’s nice, but Emerald Rush adds a new challenge mode through the full game. Taking the chance to join the Void Crew (after the end of the game, of course) you’ll go on an emerald smashing romp through each world, having to clear as much of the green stuff as possible to unlock the mode in later stages.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you’re on the fence about DK Bananza, you’ll be able to download a free demo on Switch 2 and check out the deformative platforming action.</p>
<p>The game is a lot of fun. In my <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/16/donkey-kong-bananza-review/">Donkey Kong Bananza review</a>, I said, “Donkey Kong Bananza is an intoxicating cacophony of brawling, digging and platforming. It’s a new style of 3D platformer from Nintendo that, for better and for worse, embraces the destructive chaos of letting players tunnel through and deform the world.”</p>

		<p>The Metroid Prime 4 release date has been confirmed, the game set to launch for Switch and Switch 2 on 4th December 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond launches December 4th (Nintendo Switch 2 / Nintendo Switch)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6tSSTH0Z8_M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Also revealed through this announcement was a big new gameplay feature. Samus is able to hop onto a rad looking stretchy motorbike and race across the alien landscape, not just exploring, but also battling enemies at high speed.</p>
<p>We got to go hands on with the game back at the Switch 2 reveal event in April, saying “For now, though, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is easily one of our most anticipated games for the Nintendo Switch 2. It’s sure to be a great experience on the original Switch as well, but pushing the graphics to higher levels and the mouse mode are the cherry on top.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/06/13/metroid-prime-4-in-development-for-nintendo-switch/">Metroid Prime 4 was first announced back at E3 2017</a> but the project did not progress as well as expected and was not meeting the company’s high standards in its initial form. As such, they taken the drastic measure of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/01/25/nintendo-reboot-metroid-prime-4-development-with-retro-studios/">restarting the project in 2019</a> with series producer Kensuke Tanabe reuniting with Retro Studios, who had first revitalised the Metroid series with the original Metroid Prime game on GameCube.</p>

<p>While that has slowly but surely come together, there’s been the popular launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/06/metroid-dread-review-switch/">Metroid Dread</a> in 2022, as well as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/10/metroid-prime-remastered-is-a-perfect-reminder-of-this-gamecube-great/">Metroid Prime Remastered</a> in early 2023. Both wetted the appetite for more Metroid games for fans, and it’s great to see Metroid Prime 4’s development has come far enough for Nintendo to pin a release date on it. We can’t wait to see more, though.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo is out to kill off the PSVR 2, announcing the return of Virtual Boy games as part of Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack, debuting on 12th February 2026 for both Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p><iframe title="Virtual Boy – Nintendo Classics arrives February 17th (Nintendo Switch 2 / Nintendo Switch)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0aXT9wzOLFg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>What’s the catch? Well, since these are all stereoscopic 3D games, you will need a dedicated Virtual Boy accessory in order to play, giving you split lenses for each eye. Thankfully, while there is a full-on plastic recreation of the Virtual Boy which you drop your Switch or Switch 2 console into, there is also a cardboard counterpart –&nbsp;likely similar to the VR Labo contraption from early in the last generation.</p>
<p>Mario’s Tennis, Galactic Pinball, and Teleroboxer had their specific shout-outs, but 14 games will be dished out for the Switch Online library in due course.</p>


<p>The full line up will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>3D Tetris</li>
<li>Galactic Pinball</li>
<li>Golf</li>
<li>Innsmouth no Yakata</li>
<li>Jack Bros.</li>
<li>Mario’s Tennis</li>
<li>Mario Clash</li>
<li>Red Alarm</li>
<li>Space Invaders</li>
<li>Teleroboxer</li>
<li>V-Tetris</li>
<li>Vertical Force</li>
<li>Virtual Bowling</li>
<li>Virtual Boy Wario Land</li>
</ul>
<p>This leaves a few games out from the complete library of 22 games that were originally released, some exclusively in Japan or North America. These are Nesters’ Funky Bowling, Panic Bomber, SD Gundam Dimension War, Space Squash, Virtual Fishing, Virtual Lab, Virtual League Baseball and Waterworld.</p>
<p>The Virtual Boy was an ignominious flop in the mid 90s, selling only 770,000 united before being discontinued, though has later come to be appreciated for its bold step toward what has eventually become VR gaming. Part of its failure has to be put down to the technology of the time, so while it offered stereoscopic 3D, it exclusively used red LED lights to render the graphics and give a sense of depth. Additionally, instead of being strapped to your head like a modern VR headset, the Virtual Boy sat on a tabletop mount, providing a fixed view to players of its games and giving an awkwardness to how you engage with the system, no doubt contributing to the headaches, dizziness and eye strain that the system became known for inducing.</p>
<p>Nintendo’s desire to constantly experiment and innovate has seen them return to 3D on various occasions, though. The most famous, of course, was the Nintendo 3DS, which featured an autostereoscopic top screen that could create 3D without the need for glasses. While impressive, the impact of this diminished over time until Nintendo released 2D-only versions of the 3DS. A fun little aside for the Nintendo Labo project on original Switch had a cardboard VR adapter, similar in concept to early VR adapters for phones, where you slot the screened device into a box with lenses to get the same effect. It’s this notion that is being revived for emulating the Virtual Boy in 2026.</p>
