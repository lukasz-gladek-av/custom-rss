Whether they’re <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/15/16151292/undertale-playstation-4-vita-release">pushing the boundaries of the medium</a> and or offering <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame">a creative spin on classic ideas</a>, indie games can be just as interesting as big-budget epics.</p><p>Sometimes, though, indie games can fly under the radar. But we here at <em>The Verge</em> love seeking out hidden gems, so we want to use this space to share some of our favorite smaller games that we’re checking out so that you might find something new, or potentially your next obsession.</p><p>We’ll be highlighting interesting games you may not have heard of and sharing a little bit about why you should play them. This list will be updated pretty frequently, too — so check back often to see some new recommendations. </p></div><section id="updates-section"><ul><li role="article" id="stream-entry-536262cb-a0dd-424e-b4ed-acbc0477d41f"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/25/24351112/lok-digital-review-word-game-iphone-android-steam">Lok Digital is a surreal puzzle game full of made-up words</a></h2><p>At a glance, <a href="https://lok-digital.com/"><em>Lok Digital</em></a> seems like another cute and clever word game, a perfect distraction to keep on your phone for idle moments. But look closer, and it’s clear something just isn’t right. Yes, it’s a game about creating words to fill out a puzzle board. Except those words aren’t actually real — and they all have special powers. Think of it like an alien take on Scrabble. It takes a while to wrap your head around, but <em>Lok</em>’s surreal setup makes for an excellent brain-scratching puzzler.</p><p>There is actually a story of sorts here. <em>Lok</em> takes place in a black-and-white fantasy realm, and your goal is to help little worm-like creatures progress through each level. The stages are grids of squares, and your goal is to turn each one black. (I have no idea how this helps the creatures move, but just stay with me here.) You turn them black by placing letters to spell out words. Completed words will black out squares, and certain words also have the ability to black out even more.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/25/24351112/lok-digital-review-word-game-iphone-android-steam">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-e887dbd2-3c1e-4d9f-b3e5-a1e680b6e5d9"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/18/24344598/antonblast-review">Antonblast is an out-of-control platformer with its heart in the ’90s</a></h2><p><em>Antonblast</em> is kind of like playing a zany Saturday morning cartoon. It’s brash, maximalist, and often, you’ll feel like you don’t actually understand what’s happening. Somehow, that chaos gels into something that actually makes sense — and, at times, is even calming.</p><p><em>Antonblast</em> just launched in 2024, but it looks like a long-lost side-scrolling platformer from the 16-bit era of the SNES or Sega Genesis. That’s not just due to the fantastic pixel art. There are fun touches like delightfully ’90s-era character designs and Mode 7-like effects, such as your character splatting against the screen when you die, that really make it feel like a missing classic of the era.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/18/24344598/antonblast-review">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-0e685471-7967-498d-a4ed-3c7d132ba74e"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24339211/skate-city-new-york-review-apple-arcade">The best mobile skateboarding game now has a New York sequel</a></h2><p>For me, skateboarding has always been about getting into a flow state. Much like playing <em>Tetris</em>, I’m at my best when I’m skating almost subconsciously, not thinking and acting in the moment. It’s not an easy zone to get into, and music has always been my shortcut. So the greatest compliment I can give to <em>Skate City: New York</em> is that I’ve spent the past week fine-tuning the perfect playlist, all so that I can also perfect my runs in the game.</p><p><em>New York </em>is a sequel to the original <em>Skate City</em>; both are available through Apple Arcade, though the first game was eventually ported to consoles as well. It comes from Snowman, the studio behind the <em>Alto </em>series, and the shift to New York is a lot like the move from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/19/8064545/altos-adventure-iphone-ipad-snowboarding-game"><em>Alto’s Adventure</em></a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/21/17035830/altos-odyssey-sequel-iphone-game-ios-adventure-snowboarding"><em>Alto’s Odyssey</em></a>. It’s not an entirely new experience but, rather, one that changes the setting and adds some seemingly small — but very impactful — tweaks.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24339211/skate-city-new-york-review-apple-arcade">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li></ul></section></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That’s according to Developer Second Dinner, which <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1882957014898454727">announced yesterday</a> it was starting the process of restoring the game to Google’s Android app store at 6PM PT / 3PM ET that day. The developer <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1882905320001089938">said in another post</a> it expects the game to return to both Google’s and Apple’s app stores “as early as next week.” </p><p><em>Marvel Snap </em>was caught up in the TikTok outage last weekend because its original publisher, Nuverse, is owned by TikTok parent company ByteDance. The game came <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/20/24348353/marvel-snap-tiktok-ban-back-online">back online for players</a> on Monday and <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1881535498709266691">Second Dinner said</a> it planned to “bring more services in-house and partner with a new publisher.” As of now, <em>Marvel Snap </em>is still “provided, operated, and managed by Nuverse,” according to the <a href="https://sf19-draftcdn-sg.ibytedtos.com/obj/ies-hotsoon-draft-sg/Snap/snap_privacy_policy_en.html">privacy policy</a> on the game’s website.</p><p>An admin of the <a href="https://discord.com/servers/marvel-snap-978545345715908668"><em>Marvel Snap</em> Discord server</a> also announced a set of compensation packages for players affected by the outage. As seen in screenshots <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelSnap/comments/1i99zmp/compensation_galore/">posted to Reddit</a>, that includes in-game credits, tokens, and special variants for accounts that were created in the US or that showed US activity in the 30 days prior to the outage. Non-US players will also get a “Global Gratitude Package” with similar, though fewer, benefits. </p><p>Other apps that went down last weekend, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/21/24348629/capcut-back-online-us-tiktok-bytedance">such as CapCut</a> and Lemon8, have since come back online but still aren’t listed in the iOS and Android app stores. Although President Donald Trump has directed the US Attorney General <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/20/24348213/trump-tiktok-ban-executive-order-sale-delay-china">not to enforce the US TikTok ban</a>, it’s unclear whether he can shield Apple or Google from legal liability if they host the apps in defiance of the law.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But look closer, and it’s clear something just isn’t right. Yes, it’s a game about creating words to fill out a puzzle board. Except those words aren’t actually real — and they all have special powers. Think of it like an alien take on Scrabble. It takes a while to wrap your head around, but <em>Lok</em>’s surreal setup makes for an excellent brain-scratching puzzler.</p><p>There is actually a story of sorts here. <em>Lok</em> takes place in a black-and-white fantasy realm, and your goal is to help little worm-like creatures progress through each level. The stages are grids of squares, and your goal is to turn each one black. (I have no idea how this helps the creatures move, but just stay with me here.) You turn them black by placing letters to spell out words. Completed words will black out squares, and certain words also have the ability to black out even more.</p><p>It sounds kind of weird at first, and that feeling is only exacerbated by the dictionary of words you’re working with. They are gibberish. The game eases you into this fictional language, though, slowly introducing new words that each add a new wrinkle to the puzzles. The word “Lok,” for instance, lets you black out any square on the board, while “Be” lets you write the letter of your choice on a blank square. As your selection of words grows, so do the techniques at your disposal.</p><p>Here’s a GIF that gives an idea of how it plays out:</p><div><p><cite>Image: Letibus Design and Icedrop Games</cite></p></div><p>I didn’t quite understand it at first, but <em>Lok</em> really clicked for me when I stopped thinking of it like other word games, such as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/25/23037899/knotwords-wordle-crossword-puzzle-game-zach-gage-iphone-android-pc"><em>Knotwords</em></a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23660809/wordle-new-york-times-interview-zoe-bell-gdc-2023"><em>Wordle</em></a>. It’s a puzzle game, just one where certain combinations of letters are used to solve problems. You don’t need to think of the best words you know; you need to use the existing ones in clever ways to clear out every square. It feels immensely satisfying when you discover the right way to chain together gibberish to solve a puzzle. And while it can be difficult, the game does a great job of easing you along. It ramps up slowly, has a helpful hint system, and also provides an easy-to-reference list of all the words you’ve uncovered so far.</p><p>As a puzzler, <em>Lok</em> really nails the balance of challenge and scale, giving you bite-sized problems that still feel good to solve. It’s perfect for mobile where you might only have a few minutes to play (though the game is also available on PC and was <a href="https://www.blazgracar.com/lok">originally a physical puzzle book</a>). But it also goes a step further in creating an extremely chill vibe, with its lo-fi soundtrack and cozy monochrome visuals. It really does feel like you’re dropping into an alien world — one where you have to discover a whole new language to make it through.</p><p><small>Lok Digital <em>is available now on iOS, Android, and PC.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24350342/razer-laptop-cooling-pad-review-hyperboost-synapse-rgb<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Keeping your laptop cool while gaming doesn’t just improve its performance; it also prolongs the life of its components and helps avoid <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Wiki/What_to_do_with_a_swollen_battery">battery bloat</a>, an affliction that becomes more common with age. Razer says its $150 <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-pc-accessories%2Frazer-laptop-cooling-pad">Laptop Cooling Pad</a> works with laptops of any size and will lower CPU and GPU temperatures by up to 18 percent. (It also, naturally, has an RGB strip.)</p><p>With some Razer gaming laptops, it can go even further. When the cooling pad is connected via USB to a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23588660/razer-blade-16-2023-review-specs-features-design">2023</a> or 2024 Razer Blade 16, a feature called <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338041/razers-150-cooling-pad-is-getting-a-software-update-that-makes-its-laptop-gpus-go-faster">Hyperboost</a> automatically adjusts fan speed and cooling mode and lets the laptop allocate up to 20 extra watts each to the CPU and GPU. (Razer is bringing Hyperboost to more models over the coming months.)</p><p>I’ve played around with the Razer Laptop Cooling Pad for the last few weeks, both before and after the Hyperboost update. And while it isn’t quite as impressive as Razer claims, I did notice a significant improvement in 1080p performance in games that were previously held back by a lack of power to the CPU.</p><p>I tested the Razer Laptop Cooling Pad with a top-of-the-line 2024 Razer Blade 16 with a mobile Nvidia RTX 4090 graphics card and Intel Core i9-14900HX CPU, as well as with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338041/razers-150-cooling-pad-is-getting-a-software-update-that-makes-its-laptop-gpus-go-faster">2024 Asus ROG Zephyrus G16 (AMD version)</a>. It’s possible to cycle through preset fan speeds and RGB lighting configurations using buttons on the side, but fine control requires installing Razer Synapse, which might be a deal-breaker for some people even if the price isn’t.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Hello, Synapse, my old acquaintance.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Let’s address the elephant in the room first: Razer’s cooling pad gets <em>loud</em>. With the 140mm fan spinning full bore, I measured <a href="https://www.iacacoustics.com/blog-full/comparative-examples-of-noise-levels">62 decibels</a> right next to the laptop and about 56 to 58 decibels in what I would consider a realistic gaming position. (My apartment has a noise floor of about 40 decibels.) It’s not ear-splitting, but the fan’s constant volume and mechanical timbre are distracting — it sounds close enough to a vacuum cleaner to startle my cat. For comparison, the built-in fans on both laptops I tested output at less than 50 decibels using their Turbo power profiles.&nbsp;</p><p>Razer’s quest to create a laptop cooling pad that can fit any device also means that it’s large by necessity. Not only does it take up more space on the desk than your laptop alone but it also requires external power and uses a bulky adapter that crowds out the plug next to it on the power strip. It comes with three different top plates that snap to the pad magnetically. The plate for laptops from 14 to 16 inches and the one for 18-inch laptops use memory foam strips to create an airtight seal between the fan chamber and the intake vents at the bottom of the laptop. The third, for fanless or ventless devices like the MacBook Air, is totally flat. The back boasts three USB-A 2.0 ports that remain accessible no matter the size of the laptop on top.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Three USB 2.0 ports mean you can keep your mouse and keyboard plugged into the cooling pad.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>It’s a good thing that Hyperboost works, at least in certain circumstances. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nVfKMjUFQc">In his review of the 2024 Razer Blade 16</a>, YouTuber Jarrod’sTech noted that both it and the 2023 model underperform at 1080p. That’s because, by default, they allocate more of their total power allowance to the GPU, but at lower resolutions, most games are held back by the CPU.&nbsp;</p><p>Hyperboost blows past that. With more power to the CPU, the 2024 Blade 16 put out 123 frames per second in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> at 1080p with every setting maxed out (except ray tracing), compared to the 90fps I measured without Hyperboost. <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> was similar: at 1080p max settings, I measured 204fps with Hyperboost on and 185 with it disabled.</p><div><p>Once you leave 1080p, the advantage evaporates</p></div><p>Once you leave 1080p, the advantage evaporates; the GPU becomes the limiting factor, and pumping more power into it grants diminishing returns. At the Blade 16’s native 1600p resolution (and above, if you’re using an external monitor), I measured about the same frame rate with or without Hyperboost, give or take a frame or two. Temperatures are still noticeably lower, with the power-hungry Intel Core i9-14900HX staying below 90 degrees Celsius and the RTX 4090 keeping under 70 degrees under torture testing, but the 2024 Blade 16 already had a great cooling system thanks to its thickness. Thermal throttling was never a concern.&nbsp;</p><div><p><figcaption><em>You can use the Razer Laptop Cooling Pad with any laptop. Nobody can stop you.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The Razer Laptop Cooling Pad will do a good job of cooling non-Razer gaming laptops, too — with or without Synapse. It prevented the AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 processor inside the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24324299/asus-rog-zephyrus-g16-2024-gaming-laptop-review-amd-strix-point">Asus ROG Zephyrus G16</a> from reaching its 95 degrees Celsius ceiling when benchmarking, which it usually hits quite fast. Even the strip above the keyboard, which often hits 115 degrees Fahrenheit, topped out at a comparatively balmy 90 degrees under full load.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, I couldn’t get a statistically significant frame rate improvement in games or synthetic tests on the ROG Zephyrus G16 — even after taking advantage of the thermal headroom to overclock the CPU and GPU. </p><div><p><figcaption><em>Pictured: one of the very few laptops that work with Hyperboost.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Therein lies the biggest problem with the Razer Laptop Cooling Pad. It certainly pushes air around, but only people with a Hyperboost-compatible Razer Blade 16 — a <em>very</em> small segment of the overall gaming population — will see a difference in performance, and even then, only in CPU-limited games. </p><p>Of course, it’s possible that Hyperboost will make more of a difference in other Razer laptops, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335984/razer-blade-16-laptop-thin-ryzen-amd-cpu-nvidia-gpu-240-hz-oled-display">the slimmer Blade 16 that Razer announced at CES</a> the same day it released Hyperboost. The new Blade is about as thick as the ROG Zephyrus G16, which uses drastic power and temperature limits to keep heat under control in its slim chassis. Maybe the new Blade 16 will manage the heat just fine, like the 2024 model, but perhaps the timing isn’t entirely coincidental.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLaptops/comments/1ftiwce/new_razer_cooling_pad_150_usd_thoughts/">Reddit users</a> have pointed out, Razer’s $150 cooling pad has a lot in common with similar cooling stands from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/llano-External-Computer-15-6-21in-Adjustable/dp/B0CMTCB8Q6/?tag=theverge02-20">Llano</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/IETS-Equipped-Turbo-Fan%EF%BC%885-5inch-Diameter%EF%BC%89-14-1-19-3/dp/B0CDC3XW44/?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">IETS</a>: all require external power, use an adjustable-speed 140mm fan, have RGB and a USB hub, and seal to the laptop with memory foam, but the Llano and IETS coolers cost closer to $100. Many of them even have adjustable tilt levels, which the Razer cooling pad lacks. We haven’t tested them, but unless you have a compatible Razer Blade or <em>really</em> want the RGB lights on your laptop cooling pad to sync with Chroma, something more basic will work just as well for $50 less.</p><p><em>Photography by Jonathan Hilburg for </em>The Verge.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The US-specific awards are available to eligible accounts created before 20th January in the US and were either created in the US or have played in the US in the last 30 days. The global spoils go to all players who aren't in the US and had also created an account before 20th January.</p>
<p>Interestingly, players will still receive the package even if they kept playing through the outage via a VPN, or, indeed, are non-US players who fancy firing up a VPN just to "try and receive the US downtime package".</p>
<p>Second Dinner <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1882949189463949462">said</a> it is "still working on" how it'll deliver the rewards, but players should expect them next week.</p>
<p>"Your outpouring of support to all of us at Second Dinner was heard and greatly appreciated. Marvel Snap isn't just our job but it's our passion," the team added. "It's a passion that we share with many of you all around the world.

		<p>Well…. it’s been quite the tumultuous week in the real world, but gaming has provided a pleasant escape. Oh sure, it hasn’t all been super rosy in the games industry at large, but there’s plenty excitement after a couple of great new game announcements and updates on some of the biggest games coming to Xbox (and PS5) later this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-rumored-for-nintendo-switch-2-as-phil-spencer-teases-more-multiplatform-support/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-is-out-on-may-15-gets-pc-specs-80-price-no-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got its May 15 release date</a> and proper unveiling at the Xbox Developer Direct 2025, with id Software also providing lots more info to the press in a presentation and Q&amp;A that we reported on <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-is-the-biggest-and-best-game-weve-ever-made-says-id-story-is-out-of-the-codex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>So far, the game is officially slated to launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. However, <a href="https://xcancel.com/eXtas1stv/status/1882945918074282253?t=4lqcSUs-rJfJsq3p-rVdoA&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Spanish leaker eXtas1s</a>, DOOM: The Dark Ages will also be released for the newly announced Nintendo Switch 2. According to him, this particular news is being withheld because Nintendo reportedly has to give the green light for any new game coming to the Switch 2 (rather than the original Switch) before an announcement can happen.</p>
<p>Now, this isn't at all surprising. After all, Microsoft has already shown no problems with supporting Nintendo's platforms and is all-in on increasing multiplatform support. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer was just featured in a new video Q&amp;A published <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAl5yVpNc3o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Danny Peña's YouTube channel</a>, where the executive once again teased more multiplatform games and expressed excitement for the Switch 2.</p>
<p><em>I want people to be able to experience the games that we build, the services that we offer, on as many devices as we can. Obviously, some of the devices out there, some of the platforms are closed. They don't allow everything that we do to show up on those platforms.</em></p>
<p><em>The thing that I've learned and continue to learn when I'm listening to creators not only our own studios but other teams building games is every creator out there wants to build a game that can</em><br>
<em>find as many players as they want and frankly there aren't many platforms out there that try to build connections to people on so many different screens. It's almost like single platform, single</em><br>
<em>device, single game, and that's kind of the history of our business. We're really taking an approach of we want people to be able to play Xbox on many different screens. Now, not every experience will be the same. </em></p>
<p><em>We obviously love the native experience we have on our own platform and our own hardware and that's something that will continue for us, but we're not going to put walls up around where people can engage with the great games our studios are building or where they can experience Xbox. [...] I</em><br>
<em>want everybody to be able to play on Xbox, and it does mean more of our games shipping on more platforms, not just PlayStation. We love the work that we do with Nintendo, we love what we do with Valve on Steam, and that's going to continue, we'll do more of it.</em></p>
<p><em>[...] I was exchanging emails with the CEO of Nintendo. I gave him a big congrats. I said, my old eyes appreciate the larger screen. Nintendo with their innovation and what they mean in this industry, I just always applaud the moves that they make. I think they did like a little flash video. I know we'll get more details over time. I'm really looking forward to supporting them with the games that we have and I just think they're such an important part of this industry. </em></p>
<p><em>Who would ever bet against the success of that team? I mean, they are just masterful at what they do. The Switch is a massive success and I think the Switch 2 will be as well.</em></p>
<p>Really, the only doubt anyone could have about DOOM: The Dark Ages eventually getting on the Switch 2 is on a technical level. Then again, 2016's reboot <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-switch-impressive-subpar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched on the original Switch</a> with the help of Panic Button, which also ported DOOM Eternal to Nintendo's hybrid console. As such, the rumor isn't farfetched at all.</p>
<p>Of course, Switch 2 users won't be able to enjoy all the bells and whistles. On PC, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-features-dlss-4-path-tracing-at-launch-indiana-jones-alan-wake-2-updated-with-new-rtx-technologies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will support path tracing and NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation</a>. We still have to wait for confirmation from Nintendo, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-ray-reconstruction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to rumors</a>, the Switch 2 should support NVIDIA DLSS 2 Super Resolution plus Ray Reconstruction (3.5) but not Frame Generation.</p>

I got sent both by Games Workshop to check out for review, so read on for my thoughts!</p>

<h2>Asurmen</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-aeldari-asurmen-.jpeg?itok=CqCyozqQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-aeldari-asurmen-.jpeg?itok=9khmoe2c 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Asurmen leads the charge with his Bloody Twins pistols and his Sword of Asur!</figcaption></figure><p>Asurmen is the first of four incredible Leaders I was sent with this mailing, and his abilities are all about amping up the movement of the unit he can be attached to (Dire Avengers), and unleashing a major attack once per battle.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Asurmen Stats:</strong> Move: 7” / Toughness: 3 / Save: 2+ (INV 4+) / Wounds: 5 / Leadership 6+ / Objective Control: 1</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Asurmen Abilities At A Glance:</h3>

<ul><li aria-level="1"><strong>Tactical Acumen: </strong>While leading a unit, this ability allows that unit to make a free 6” move after they’ve shot in their shooting phase.</li>
	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Hand of Asuryan: </strong>Once per battle, you can use this ability on this model when shooting to give its weapon (Bloody Twins) a DMG characteristic of 3 and Anti-Infantry 3+ and Devastating Wounds.</li>
</ul><h3>Asurmen - How To Play Tips</h3>

<p>Asurmen works best when attached to a unit of Dire Avengers, where he can help them use their already speedy 7" movement to get across the battlefield even faster with his Tactical Acumen ability. I've seen success in playtesting letting him lead a group of Avengers quickly toward an objective, shooting and moving for free. Then, I hunker down on the point with him, and wait for him to use his Hand of Asuryan ability until someone really scary comes along to contest it. And as soon as it's within that sweet 24" range of my Bloody Twins, I unleash hell!</p>

<h2>Baharroth</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-aeldari-baharroth-model.jpg?itok=bg72KqDe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-aeldari-baharroth-model.jpg?itok=z0mRYfGv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Would it surprise you to learn that Baharroth, with his gigantic, gleaming wings, is a Leader designed to be attached to a unit of Swooping Hawks?&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Baharroth Stats:&nbsp;</b>Move: 14” / Toughness: 3 / Save: 2+ (INV 4+) / Wounds: 5 / Leadership 6+ / Objective Control: 1</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Baharroth Abilities At A Glance:</h3>

<ul><li><strong>Cloudstrider:&nbsp;</strong>While this model leads a unit, if at the end of an opponent's turn this unit isn't within engagement range of any enemy units, you can remove the unit from play and set it up in Strategic Reserves. Also if using Deep Strike you can use this ability, setting up the unit anywhere as long as its 3" away horizontally from all enemy units (and it cannot charge this turn).</li>
	<li><strong>Cry of the Wind:&nbsp;</strong>Each time this model is set up on the battlefield, until end of that turn, when it makes a ranged attack successful unmodified hit rolls score critical hits.&nbsp;</li>
</ul><h3>Baharroth - How To Play Tips</h3>

<p>Because both of Baharroth's special abilities rely on him being attached to a unit, he's not really worth it as a solo character. Sure, he's got some heavy hitting weapons, but you can't use his&nbsp;Cloudstrider ability unless he's leading a unit. So best way to go with Baharroth is to attach him to Swooping Hawks, and then bounce around the board all game - getting into important positions, firing with the Cry of the Wind bonus, and truly keeping your opponent on their toes!</p>

<h2>Swooping Hawks</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-aeldari-swooping-hawks.jpg?itok=mZNibZuQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-aeldari-swooping-hawks.jpg?itok=HxWCydoJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Now let's look at the unit Baharroth can lead, Swooping Hawks, who get a nice new sculpt with this new release!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Swooping Hawks Stats:&nbsp;</strong>Move: 14” / Toughness: 3 / Save: 4+ / Wounds: 1 / Leadership 6+ / Objective Control: 1<br><strong>Swooping Hawks Exarch Stats:&nbsp;</strong>Move: 14” / Toughness: 3 / Save: 4+ (INV 5+) / Wounds: 2 / Leadership 6+ / Objective Control: 1</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Swooping Hawks Abilities At A Glance</h3>

<ul><li><strong>Grenade Pack Flyover:&nbsp;</strong>Once per turn, in your movement phase when this unit is set up on the battlefield or ends a normal, advance, or fall back move, it can use this ability to select one enemy unit with 8" and visible and roll one d6 for each Swooping Hawks model in this unit. On a 4+, that enemy unit suffers 1 mortal wound (max 6 mortal wounds). Can't use grenade stratagem if you've used this ability.</li>
	<li><strong>Aspect Shrine Token:&nbsp;</strong>As with almost all warrior units in this army, you also get an aspect shrine token, which lets you (once per battle) change the result of one hit roll or one wound roll made by this unit to a 6.</li>
</ul><h3>Swooping Hawks - How To Play Tips</h3>

<p>Now we're getting spicy! Since that grenade pack flyover includes whenever the model's been set up, you can combo this off with Baharroth's Cloudstrider ability to pop them into position and then, on your turn, move them into range to hit your opponent with a Grenade Pack Flyover. Remember, you won't be able to do the Flyover when you set them up, since Cloudstrider says you set up at the end of your opponent's turn, but it's still a great way to throw in some extra damage each turn on your own terms.</p>

<h2>Fuegan</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-aeldari-fuegan.jpg?itok=Vhto0P8x 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-aeldari-fuegan.jpg?itok=Bil6MDEt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Fuegan, in his fire-red armor, can lead a group of Fire Dragons into battle!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Fuegan Stats:&nbsp;</strong>Move: 7” / Toughness: 3 / Save: 2+ (INV 4+) / Wounds: 5 / Leadership 6+ / Objective Control: 1</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Fuegan Abilities At A Glance</h3>

<ul><li><strong>Burning Lance:&nbsp;</strong>While this model is leading a unit, you add 6" to the Range characteristic of Melta weapons equipped by models in that unit.</li>
	<li><strong>Unquenchable Resolve:&nbsp;</strong>The first time this model is destroyed, at the end of the phase roll a d6. On a 2+ you get to set him back up on the battlefield as close as possible to where he fell (as long as not within engagement range of enemy units) with his&nbsp;<em>full wounds remaining</em>.</li>
</ul><h3>Fuegan - How To Play Tips</h3>

<p>While his Burning Lance ability is HUGE (6" extra added to your Fire Dragons unit is absolutely devastating), this is probably the best leader in this group to run unattached to another unit (if you have to). His ranged weapon, Searsong, has beam and lance firing options, and that Unquenchable Resolve ability makes him one of the toughest units in the entire Aeldari army! Still, if you have a Fire Dragons unit in your army, best to attach him as the leader!</p>

<h2>Fire Dragons</h2>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Fire Dragons Stats:&nbsp;</strong>Move: 7” / Toughness: 3 / Save: 3+ / Wounds: 1 / Leadership 6+ / Objective Control: 1<br><strong>Fire Dragon Exarch Stats:&nbsp;</strong>Move: 7” / Toughness: 3 / Save: 3+ (INV 5+) / Wounds: 2 / Leadership 6+ / Objective Control: 1</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Fire Dragon Abilities At A Glance</h3>

<ul><li><strong>Assured Destruction:&nbsp;</strong>In your shooting phase, each time a model in this unit attacks a Monster of Vehicle unit, you can re-roll the Hit roll, you can re-roll the Wound roll, and you can re-roll the Damage roll.</li>
	<li><strong>Aspect Shrine Token:&nbsp;</strong>Again, same as with the Swooping Hawks, you also get an aspect shrine token, which lets you (once per battle) change the result of one hit roll or one wound roll made by this unit to a 6.</li>
</ul><h3>Fire Dragons - How To Play Tips</h3>

<p>If you combo this unit with Fuegan, those melta guns are going to go from a 12" range up to a whopping 18" range - that's extremely high for a weapon as powerful as a melta weapon, AND it goes without saying, but since Melta weapons do extra damage when you're within half range of the weapon, adding this extra 6" makes that even more dangerous. Also of note, the Assured Destruction ability is a major upgrade from the last edition, which only let you&nbsp;re-roll a Wound roll of 1 and re-roll a Damage roll of 1. So get in there, get in close, and start melting your enemies!</p>

<h2>Lhykis</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-aeldari-lhykis.jpg?itok=QEEQdKg0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-aeldari-lhykis.jpg?itok=oW-CxPBG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The award for the coolest looking model in this whole batch has to go to Lhykis, a leader who can be attached to a unit of Warp Spiders!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Lhykis Stats:&nbsp;</strong>Move: 12” / Toughness: 3 / Save: 2+ (INV 4+) / Wounds: 5 / Leadership 6+ / Objective Control: 1</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Lhykis Abilities At A Glance:</h3>

<p><strong>Empyric Ambush:&nbsp;</strong>While this model is leading a unit, that unit is eligible to declare a charge in a turn in which it used its flickerjump ability.<br><strong>Whispering Web:&nbsp;</strong>In your Shooting phase, after this model has shot, select one enemy unit hit by one or more of those attacks. Until end of turn, each time a friendly Aeldari model makes an attack that targets that unit, an unmodified Hit roll of 5+ scores a Crit.</p>

<h3>Lhykis - How To Play Tips</h3>

<p>Lhykis is another one of these leaders who thrives when attached to his designated unit (which I'll cover right under this section), and if you shoot with him first while leading a unit, the rest of that unit will benefit from his Whispering Web ability! Important to note that he himself doesn't have the Flickerjump ability, which feels a bit odd!</p>

<h2>Warp Spiders</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-aeldari-warp-spiders.jpg?itok=2CoYGSQ3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-aeldari-warp-spiders.jpg?itok=o-W0rR-T 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>We're finishing this coverage up with everyone's favorite zippy little dudes, the Warp Spiders!&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Warp Spiders Stats:&nbsp;</strong>Move: 12” / Toughness: 3 / Save: 3+ / Wounds: 1 / Leadership 6+ / Objective Control: 1<br><strong>Warp Spiders Exarch Stats:&nbsp;</strong>Move: 12” / Toughness: 3 / Save: 3+ (INV 5+) / Wounds: 2 / Leadership 6+ / Objective Control: 1</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Warp Spiders Abilities At A Glance</h3>

<ul><li><strong>Flickerjump:&nbsp;</strong>In your Movement phase, each time this unit is chosen to make a Normal move, it can use Flickerjump. If it does, until end of turn this unit is not eligible to declare a charge and its Movement stat is 24". Each time this unit uses this ability, at the end of the phase you roll d6 for each model in the unit. For each 1, this unit suffers 1 mortal wound.</li>
	<li><strong>Aspect Shrine Token:&nbsp;</strong>Once more, with feeling! This unit has an aspect shrine token, which lets you (once per battle) change the result of one hit roll or one wound roll made by this unit to a 6.</li>
</ul><h3>Warp Spiders - How To Play Tips</h3>

<p>How you want to play this unit I think really depends on whether they've got Lhykis attached to them. If they do have Lhykis, I think the best play here is to use your Warp Spiders as super-charging Melee attackers, blasting across the battlefield and then charging their enemies in a flash! If not, you should really consider using them to get into great/interesting positions out the battlefield fast, holding positions of power, and firing down on your enemies from afar.</p>

<p>It's hard to look at this new batch of Leaders for the Aeldari and not appreciate the simple, clean, and efficient synergies at play here. I really feel like 10th edition's decision to make leaders attachable to units has widened that design space significantly. Also, almost all of these units got a physical and rules glow up. These leaders are a must if you've already got the units they lead, but if not - you may not get the full value out of them.</p>

		<p>There is going to be a Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves open beta, with SNK confirming that it will take place in February. The exact dates and timing of the open beta have been set for between February 20th 12 AM PST to February 24, 2025 11:59 PM PST, with those taking part able to choose from eight characters and two control schemes. The beta will be available on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam.</p>
<p><iframe title="FATAL FURY: CotW ｜Official Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lHjjlpCoBOQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>SNK has not announced which characters will be making the cut for the Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves open beta yet, with those details to be confirmed at a yet unknown later date. The playable modes in the beta will be an offline tutorial mode, and three online modes; Ranked Match, Room Match, Casual Match. The two control schemes have for the game have previously been confirmed as Arcade Style and Smart Style. Arcade Style is a classic multi button input scheme to pull off combos and special moves, while Smart Style uses directional inputs and single button presses to perform special moves. The beta will also give players a proper first impression of the new REV system, which combines a system of REV Arts, REV Accel, and REV Blows to fill a REV meter that will then unleash powerful offensive moves.</p>
<p>The Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves beta will not require a &nbsp;PlayStation Plus or Xbox Game Pass Core/Ultimate subscription, so anyone with an internet connection can experience it. SNK has stated that any save date from this open beta will not be transferrable to the retail release on Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves either. Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves confirmed release date is set for April 24th, 2025. It will get a physical release on PS5 and PS4, with a digital release on all confirmed platforms too. The first season pass will include five additional characters, including Street Fighter’s Ken and Chun Li.</p>

<p>You didn’t read the title wrong. A new live-action reboot of Resident Evil is being made. Let that sink in. After several disastrous attempts, it looks like the franchise will finally get a respectable movie. At least that’s what the names involved in the project indicate.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/resident-evil-reboot-zach-cregger-1236117563/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, the production of the movie will be handled by Constantin Film and PlayStation Productions. PlayStation’s involvement took many people by surprise, after all, this is a Capcom IP.</p>



<p>The project will be written and directed by Zach Cregger. Shay Hatten, who worked on John Wick 4 and Army of the Dead, is co-writer. Cregger is known for Barbarian, a great horror movie. His next film, Weapons, also a horror film, was very successful with test audiences, which explains all the hype surrounding the director.</p>



<p>At the moment, four companies are in a bidding war to secure the rights to the film. According to THR, Netflix and Warner Bros. are leading the bidding.</p>



<p>According to THR’s sources, Cregger already has a vision for the project. He plans to make a horror movie that takes the franchise back to the tone of the first games, released in the 90s. Back then, the games had a strong survival horror vibe. It was a very different approach, without action elements embedded in recent games.</p>

<p>We’ve reached the stage where everyone is already accepting, but an extra confirmation doesn’t hurt.</p>



<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAl5yVpNc3o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Danny Peña</a>/Gamertag Radio, Phil Spencer, the head of Xbox, talked about various topics and, among them, the brand’s strategy of launching its exclusives on more platforms.</p>



<h2 id="h-more-xbox-games-will-become-multiplaform">More Xbox games will become multiplaform</h2>



<p>It was during this conversation that Phil confirmed that more Xbox games will be coming to PlayStation, the rival platform. If you read our articles, you already know which games are coming to PS5 in 2025.</p>



<p>Speaking about the first-party titles, Phil said (via <a href="https://x.com/shinobi602/status/1882965755546788339" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@Shinobi602</a>): ”<em>We love our platform and our hardware but we’re not going to put walls up where people can engage with the great games our studios are building(…)our games will show up in more places, no doubt!</em>“</p>



<div><article><p><span>New Xbox Interview with </span><a href="https://twitter.com/gamertagradio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@gamertagradio</a><span> | Phil Spencer 

On Xbox first party games:

“We love our platform and our hardware but we’re not going to put walls up where people can engage with the great games our studios are building(…)our games will show up in more places, no…</span></p></article></div>



<h2 id="h-why-buy-an-xbox">Why buy an Xbox?</h2>



<p>Listening to the Xbox CEO’s justification, the hosts asked him why gamers should buy an Xbox console since the company seems to be moving away from the concept of exclusives altogether. Phil said:</p>



<p>“<em>I want people to pick hardware based on the capabilities of that hardware and the choices that they want to make about where they want to play. We want our hardware to win based on the capabilities that we have(…)hardware critical and fundamental to what Xbox is – not trying to gatekeep the games off different places</em>“</p>



<h2 id="h-a-magical-year-in-the-making">A magical year in the making</h2>



<p>Like it or not, this is a new era for Xbox. The company’s 2025 promises to be one of the best years in Xbox history, if not the best. With Avowed, DOOM: The Dark Ages, South of Midnight, The Outer Worlds 2, and perhaps Fable, the players will be very busy throughout the year.</p>



<p>At the Xbox Developer Direct held this week, we discovered that Xbox Games Publishing is responsible for publishing Ninja Gaiden 4, a game that promises to put the franchise back on top.</p>

<p>Premier Season 2 of Counter-Strike 2 has been officially <a href="https://www.counter-strike.net/newsentry/520829437562848128" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> by Valve, bringing to an end what’s felt like the longest first season of the game’s main competitive mode. When Season 2 begins, a couple new changes to the game’s rifles might shake up the meta.</p>



<p>Full details for Season 2 below.</p>



<h2 id="h-welcome-to-cs2-season-2">Welcome to CS2 Season 2</h2>



<p>With Season 1 coming to an end, active Premier players that earned a rating will “receive a commemorative Premier Season One Medal.” This medal will feature various stats from across the season, including their map distribution, rating history, overall K/D, total multi-kills, and their win/loss record.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The major changes coming to Counter-Strike 2 in Season 2 are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cs2-adds-train-to-map-pool/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Train-Vertigo substitution in the map pool</a>, and changes to the M4A4 and FAMAS. The M4A4 will get a price reduction down to $2900, which matches its silenced counterpart, the M4A1-S. The FAMAS is getting buffs to its standing and crouching accuracy values, as well as a price cut, which should make it an extremely more viable option during half-buy rounds.</p>



<p>When Season 2 begins, player will need to win 10 matches in Premier in order to refresh their rating. Players will also be able to earn a Premier Season Two Medal, which will have custom colors and bars to represent peak rating and total wins. To be eligible to receive a Premier Season Two Medal, players will have to win 25 matches and have an active rating when the season ends. Season two will end after the BLAST Austin Major, which concludes on June 22.</p>



<p>The only thing missing from the CS2 Premier Season 2 announcement is a start date. Considering how long Season 1 lasted, and given that Season 2 supposedly will end in just 3 months, it has to start sooner rather than later.</p>



<hr>

            <p>
There was a brief moment back in 2021 when it seemed like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> creator Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone might finally be done with his mega-popular farm-life sim - until, that is, update 1.6 was suddenly announced and rapidly took on a life of its own. And now Barone has admitted it's unlikely he'll ever 'definitively close the book' on its development, saying (probably not entirely seriously) he might still be adding things "50 years from now".
</p>
<p>
Stardew Valley was an immediate hit when it released back in 2016, selling over 400K copies in just two weeks. Nearly nine years later, that number has reached the 41m mark, and Barone, somewhat remarkably, has continued to expand the game - most recently in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valleys-16-update-is-finally-here-with-some-impressively-lengthy-patch-notes">last year's 1.6 update</a>, which was originally supposed to be relatively modest in scope when it was announced in 2022, but grew increasingly ambitious as time went on.
</p>
<p>
That's despite Barone having seemingly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-doesnt-know-if-there-will-be-another-update-focused-on-next-game">drawn a line under Stardew Valley's development</a> a year earlier, when he confirmed he'd be focusing his attention on a new game - later <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-reveals-haunted-chocolatier">revealed to be Haunted Chocolatier</a>. But while Barone has now resumed development of his second title following a pause for Stardew Valley's 1.6 update, he's admitted he doesn't think he'll ever necessarily be done with his farming game.
</p>

<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/24/g-s1-44510/the-legacy-and-future-of-the-farming-game-stardew-valley">NPR</a>, Barone revealed that even though he's now been working on Stardew Valley for more than 12 years, "I don't want to definitively say that the book is ever closed, because I think I will always have a desire to come back and maybe add a thing or two. You know, maybe even 50 years from now, I might add something." 
</p><p>
That doesn't mean Barone doesn't see a natural end point for the title, however. "I think a game can have too much content," he explained. "And I ultimately want Stardew Valley to be the best game it can be. So if I feel like it's starting to become kind of overwhelmed with content to the point where it's detrimental to the game's entertainment factor, I would stop."
</p>
<p>
And for the time being, at least, it does appear Barone has taken a step back from Stardew Valley following the rather lengthy two-year development of its 1.6 update. As he revealed in December last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-confirms-hes-back-working-on-next-project-haunted-chocolatier">work has now resumed on Haunted Chocolatier</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Even though Haunted Chocolatier has only been revealed publicly to a tiny degree," he said at the time, "in my own private world it's a special place, and I'm very attached to the characters, themes, and ideas." It does, however, sounds like its release is still some way off, with Baron explaining, "It's going to be a lot of work still, but it's okay, I'm addicted to the grind."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/nvidia-winding-down-support-for-older-gpus-including-the-legendary-750-ti-and-1060/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Nvidia is launching the first volley of RTX 50-series GPUs based on its new Blackwell architecture, starting with the RTX 5090 and working downward from there. The company also appears to be winding down support for a few of its older GPU architectures, according to these <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-toolkit-release-notes/index.html">CUDA release notes</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpu-drivers/nvidia-starts-phasing-out-maxwell-pascal-and-volta-gpus-geforce-driver-support-status-unclear">Tom's Hardware</a>.</p>
<p>The release notes say that CUDA support for the Maxwell, Pascal, and Volta GPU architectures "is considered feature-complete and will be frozen in an upcoming release." While all of these architectures—which collectively cover GeForce GPUs from the old GTX 700 series all the way up through 2016's GTX 1000 series, plus a couple of Quadro and Titan workstation cards—are still currently supported by Nvidia's December Game Ready driver package, the end of new CUDA feature support suggests that these GPUs will eventually be dropped from these driver packages soon.</p>
<p>It's common for Nvidia and AMD to drop support for another batch of architectures all at once every few years; Nvidia last dropped support for older cards <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/nvidia-drops-kepler-windows-7-8-8.1-support/">in 2021</a>, and AMD dropped support for several prominent GPUs <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/amd-pulls-back-on-drivers-for-aging-but-popular-graphics-cards-and-igpus/">in 2023</a>. Both companies maintain a separate driver branch for some of their older cards but releases usually only happen every few months, and they focus on security updates, not on providing new features or performance optimizations for new games.</p>
