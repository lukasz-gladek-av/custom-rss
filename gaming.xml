That said, the new superhero title does attempt to spice things up with fun concepts like destructible environments and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-hero-shooter-overwatch-team-attacks-how-1851718182&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-hero-shooter-overwatch-team-attacks-how-1851718182">Team-Up abilities</a></span>. One of the more unique original ideas the game puts forward is the Season Bonus, although it’s left most of us just confused if anything.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195624" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: August 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="279" data-playlist="195624,196395,196049" data-current="195624"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: August 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21125.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The biggest problem with Season Bonus is that there isn’t any official explanation for it. Outside some brief mentions in-game, the most information I can find on it was just a bunch of players in the official Discord asking questions and occasionally getting an evaluated guess of an answer from a fellow player. But after some rigorous testing and cross-references with other materials, I’ve put together a handy breakdown of everything you need to know about Season Bonuses.</p><h2 id="h8376"><a id="whatis"></a>What is a Season Bonus?</h2><p><strong>Season Bonuses are class-specific buffs provided to a set of characters: </strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Vanguards get extra health </strong></li><li><strong>Duelists get a damage boost </strong></li><li><strong>Strategists get a healing bonus</strong>&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Each of the characters receiving these bonuses is involved in Team-Up Abilities. More specifically, each one serves as an anchor or initiator for them.</p><p>We’re assuming that this isn’t just a massive coincidence and the characters mentioned above were chosen for their Team-Ups role. The yellow symbol for Season Bonus is also used to infer to Team-Up Anchors after all. Adjusting these bonuses could be a way to motivate players to use these characters, or perhaps be a method of balancing on the developer’s part. Something that ties into both of those is the presumption that Season Bonuses will only last throughout the season. </p><p>The next season could adjust the values of these bonuses or provide them to entirely different characters. If these are indeed meant to be tied to Team-Ups, we could also see the debut of new ones and potentially the shelving of others. Again, we can only make guesses about Season Bonuses since we don’t have a proper explanation. Fingers crossed we have a detailed breakdown come time for Season One.</p><h2 id="h8377"><a id="activate"></a>How to activate a Season Bonus</h2><figure id="" data-id="522818f18a5795f8d58c6ce1dcd161aa" data-recommend-id="image://522818f18a5795f8d58c6ce1dcd161aa" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Hero Profile page for Groot, shows his Team-Up Anchor Season Bonus in the bottom left." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Hero Profile page for Groot, shows his Team-Up Anchor Season Bonus in the bottom left." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="522818f18a5795f8d58c6ce1dcd161aa" data-recommend-id="image://522818f18a5795f8d58c6ce1dcd161aa" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Hero Profile page for Groot, shows his Team-Up Anchor Season Bonus in the bottom left." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There is a good chance that the first time you saw mention of a Season Bonus was while you were picking a hero to play. It might have even been after you remembered that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-tips-team-up-currency-battle-pass-heroes-1851715661&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-tips-team-up-currency-battle-pass-heroes-1851715661"><em>Kotaku</em>’s <em>Marvel Rivals</em> intro tips</a></span> recommended reading your hero profiles before heading into a match. Considering the Season Bonus is only for Anchor heroes and is listed underneath their Team-Up information, you likely assumed this bonus will only activate when the Team-Up ability does. However, these two things aren’t related in that way. <strong>A character’s Season Bonus is active at all times, no matter who is on their team.</strong></p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-tips-team-up-currency-battle-pass-heroes-1851715661&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-tips-team-up-currency-battle-pass-heroes-1851715661">11 Things To Know Before Starting <em>Marvel Rivals</em></a></span></p><p>I cross-referenced this with the official base stats for heroes provided on the game’s website. For example, Groot’s base health is listed as 700 on the website. His health during actual gameplay is 850. It remains at this value no matter if Rocket Raccoon and/or Jeff the Land Shark are on his team. Naturally, checking out his season bonus will show that he is receiving an extra 150 bonus health.</p><h2 id="h8378"><a id="season0"></a>List of Season Bonuses in Season 0<br></h2><figure id="" data-id="42b1220044f5b4f1d500583a473262eb" data-recommend-id="image://42b1220044f5b4f1d500583a473262eb" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Team-Up Ability page, with Adam Warlock’s Guardian Revival ability and his 15% healing bonus highlighted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Team-Up Ability page, with Adam Warlock’s Guardian Revival ability and his 15% healing bonus highlighted." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="42b1220044f5b4f1d500583a473262eb" data-recommend-id="image://42b1220044f5b4f1d500583a473262eb" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Team-Up Ability page, with Adam Warlock’s Guardian Revival ability and his 15% healing bonus highlighted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are 14 characters with Season Bonuses in “Season 0: Doom’s Rise.” As mentioned above, the buff they receive is dependent on what class they’re in. However, there is a bit of variance in the values of these buffs. Here is the list of current season bonuses:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Thor – +100 Max Health</li><li>Groot – +150 Max Health</li><li>Hulk – +150 Max Health</li><li>Venom – +150 Max Health</li><li>Rocket Raccoon – +5% Healing Bonus</li><li>Adam Warlock – +15% Healing Bonus</li><li>Cloak &amp; Dagger – +15% Healing Bonus</li><li>Luna Snow – +15% Healing Bonus</li><li>Scarlet Witch – +10 Damage Bonus</li><li>Spider-Man – +10 Damage Bonus</li><li>Iron Fist – +15 Damage Bonus</li><li>Magik – +15 Damage Bonus</li><li>Hawkeye – +20 Damage Bonus</li></ul><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Hela – +20 Damage Bonus</li></ul><p>Season Bonus is a confusing mechanic in <em>Marvel Rivals</em> that a lot of players aren’t fans of given how cryptic it is.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/unsettling-cult-classic-rpg-off-gets-surprise-steam-and-switch-release-in-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">In a piece of news I certainly didn't see coming in the waning hours of 2024, today it was announced that indie cult classic game OFF is getting released on Steam and Nintendo Switch next year in a new and "improved" version, including a physical edition.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For those unfamiliar, OFF is an RPG that first released in 2008 from Belgian studio Unproductive Fun Time. It was made in RPG Maker, originally released in French, and has never received an official English translation, though multiple fan translations have sprung up over the years. It's also never been available on typical, popular PC storefronts such as Steam or itch.io, but instead has circulated over the years as a direct download, gaining a cult following due to how utterly weird, unsettling, and at times inscrutable it can be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">OFF puts the player in control of a mysterious baseball player-looking figure known as the Batter, who is instructed by a talking cat calling itself the Judge to travel through four Zones and kill ghostly creatures known as Spectres. The Zones themselves are haunting, upsetting places run by cruel leaders, composed of strange elements such as smoke, metal, plastic, meat, and sugar, and populated by confused and often suffering individuals who seem to be tormented by the Spectres. However, as the game progresses, the player is encouraged to question the actions of the Batter and themselves as a player, with multiple endings possible depending on the player's decisions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite never hitting the mainstream, OFF has served as an inspiration for a number of other hit RPGs, most notably Undertale (and most notably Undertale's absolute creepiest, freakiest stuff). The game is coming to Steam and Nintendo Switch in 2025 both digitally and as a physical edition via Fangamer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

<strong>Giorno</strong>: Godly Level DPS, only 1 can be placed globally, big range, Slow passive, passive which chips enemies HP by 0.95% per hit and has an ability which sends all enemies to spawn, takes 10% of their HP, and slows all affected enemies down by 90%<br>
<strong>Rudeus</strong>: Terrible DPS, but a support ability to buff all units in range of his same element’s damage<br>
<strong>Makima</strong>: Very good DPS, passive to summon enemies that she killed equal to their original HP, no special status effect, no ability<br>
<strong>Denji</strong>: Meta DPS when girl in range, Best bleed unit in game, no ability"</p><p>With all of these changes, it will be interesting to see how players adapt. Alongside the new Boss Rush mode, these changes could make players have to rethink their team composition. While none of the buffs and nerfs were catastrophic, there are rumblings that the development team behind Anime Last Stand may be working on even more buffs and nerfs to change things even further. I'm intrigued to see what we could expect to see next time around. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Shaun Cichacki is a Freelance Contributor with IGN, covering features, guides, and news.

If you want all the Killzone items you’ll have to hand over Super Credits to the value of nearly twice the cost of a premium Warbond, and nearly half the price of Helldivers 2 itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Helldivers 2 Steam page</a>, Arrowhead said it had talked to Killzone developer Guerrilla Games and is now gifting the items that were meant to be sold as part of the crossover’s second wave next week.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“As this was our first crossover offering, we’ve been listening to the response, and the feedback we’ve received from our community surveys is that crossover content is really high up on your wishlists,” Arrowhead said in its statement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“At the same time, some of you are not happy with the prices of the items and we will revisit this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Many of you were also concerned that items wouldn’t be in rotation for long enough, and there was a bit of concern around how these items exist outside of our usual Warbond releases, which are always themed in our own universe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Because of all this, in partnership with our friends at Guerrilla (and as we’re in the season of holiday cheer), we’ve decided to offer a gift to all players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Firstly, we are gifting to everyone the planned second wave of the Helldivers x Killzone collaboration items today, free of charge.

CCO Johan Pilestedt confirmed that the Killzone crossover was initially meant to be released as part of a Warbond, but Arrowhead decided against it in the hopes of avoiding a backlash.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

They also say that the dock is rated for 60W and the Switch 2 itself is rated for 45W, both much higher than the model that launched back in 2017. And finally, the dock has two USB-A ports and one for USB-C, presumably the one that powers it, which is the same as the current model. </p><p>“I spoke with [NextHandheld], and I’ve now heard and seen enough to think they might be legit,” wrote<em> The Verge</em>’s Seaon Hollister. </p><p>Whether it ends up being 100 percent accurate or not, everything shared by the latest alleged Reddit leaker continues to line up with the rest of what we’ve been hearing, as well as with alleged <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-specs-leaks-nintendo-screen-release-date-price-1851651185&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-specs-leaks-nintendo-screen-release-date-price-1851651185">CAD mockups of what the Switch 2 looks like</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/alleged-images-of-nintendos-new-switch-have-appeared-online/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/alleged-images-of-nintendos-new-switch-have-appeared-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which circulated back in the fall</a></span>. Basically, the Switch 2 will look a lot like the current Switch, just slightly bigger, with a more rounded profile and a number of spec upgrades and design tweaks to improve handling and quality of life. </p><p>That’s not surprising in the context of the rest of the gaming hardware market. The Xbox Series X/S were not a major departure from the Xbox One. The PlayStation 5 is basically just a much more powerful PS4 with two ugly white fins. No one expects the Steam Deck 2 to look dramatically different than the existing one, and most PC gaming handhelds at this point all basically look the same: like a thick tablet with controllers on the sides. </p><p>But it is surprising given Nintendo’s own history of constantly trying to innovate in spaces where no one else is working. The company clung to cartridges longer than anyone and now uses SD cards. The Wii chased motion controls instead of HD graphics. The Wii U prioritized a second screen instead of beefier specs. And the Switch used smartphone specs to take gaming on the go. The notion of the company just iterating on the existing Switch, already the second most popular gaming console ever and fast closing in on the number one PS2, both made a ton of sense and seemed like it might still be too un-Nintendo to be real. </p><p>As we approach an eventual reveal of the Switch 2, every new potential leak points to Nintendo surprising fans by <em>not</em> doing the unexpected and instead doubling down on what already works. The only official thing we know about the upcoming hardware—that it will be backwards compatible with existing Switch games—only reinforces that seeming inevitability. </p><p>I’m sure the company might still have a few tricks and surprises up its sleeve. We’ll find out for sure whenever Nintendo actually announces the dang thing. It’s promised to do so before April 2025. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Counter-Strike is already the biggest multiplayer game in the world, and a mobile version would be a total game changer. As big as the PC gaming industry is, the mobile gaming industry is that much bigger with the amount of phones out there.</p>

<p>There is no official version of Counter-Strike available on mobile. Other first person shooters have stepped into the mobile space though. Call of Duty Mobile is one of the most popular and highest grossing mobile shooters ever. Riot plans to eventually launch their tactical shooter <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-mobile-china-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VALORANT on mobile</a>, and Ubisoft is also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-china/">working on a mobile version of Rainbow Six Siege</a>.</p>



<p>Counter-Strike is technically playable on phones through apps that can stream Steam to mobile devices, but if it does work, it won’t be well optimized. The closest thing to CS2 on mobile is playing it on Steam Deck, but the game is not Steam Deck Verified. While it’s not impossible for Counter-Strike to eventually reach phones, it’s extremely unlikely, as Valve has never prioritized mobile game development.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for a mobile game like Counter-Strike though, there’s plenty to choose from.</p>



<h2 id="h-mobile-games-like-counter-strike">Mobile Games Like Counter-Strike</h2>



<p>Just by searching “Counter-Strike” on the iOS or Apple app store, you’ll see tons of games clearly trying to emulate the iconic first person shooter. Even the names of the games are trying to capitalize on the popularity of CS: Critical Strike, Modern Strike Online, Critical Ops, Counter Attack. All of these games advertise CS-like tactical gameplay and weapon skins, and many of these games have just ported over nearly exact copies of iconic maps.</p>



<p>Top-down camera versions like Bullet Echo are also similar to Counter-Strike, but offer a different perspective. Both Call of Duty Mobile and Arena Breakout are also really good, popular mobile shooter games. However they’re more similar to arcade-like action shooters than tactical shooters. As mentioned above, both VALORANT and Siege are eventually making their way to mobile, but not for some time.</p>



<p>Do any of these mobile copies of Counter-Strike interest you?&nbsp;Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>



<p><em>If you’ve got spare CSGO or CS2 skins and you’re feeling lucky,&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">check out Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;(18+ only)</em></p>

But one detail did catch some viewers off guard: The silver-haired witcher featured in the new trailer wasn't the iconic Geralt of Rivia, it was his adoptive, Ciri.</p><p dir="ltr">Naturally, players took to the internet to share their thoughts. Although CDPR doesn't care much for the opinions of players who are simply upset about the fact that the upcoming game's main character is both female and fully clothed, the devs do have a message for genuine fans of the franchise who say they're going to miss playing as Geralt.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="223348889" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

Witcher games Geralt was the protagonist, and I think everyone really loved playing as Geralt," Narrative director Phillip Weber said in <a

"I really loved playing as Geralt, so I think we're aware that if some people think right now that they would still prefer to be Geralt, I do think that’s a legitimate concern, so if this is where that concern [about Ciri] is coming from, that's valid."</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, The Witcher 4 won't be the first time players step into Ciri's boots--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/">The Witcher 3</a> saw players alternate between playing as Geralt and playing as Ciri, though Geralt was still the main focus of the game. This time around, it seems the story will be told primarily through Ciri's eyes.</p><p dir="ltr">"Ciri was already being set up as a second protagonist in the Andrzej Sapkowski novels and as the second playable character in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, so for us, it really was the natural evolution of what we've already been making for so long," Weber continued. "Also, for people who really love Geralt, it lets us honour the ending that Geralt had in The Witcher 3 and in Blood and Wine."</p><p dir="ltr">Weber also added that the choice to make Ciri the game's main playable protagonist wasn't one that was made lightly, nor was it made recently.</p><p dir="ltr">"The best thing that we can do--and I think this is really our goal--is to prove that with Ciri, we can do a lot of interesting things so we can really make it worth it, because this decision to have Ciri as a protagonist wasn't made yesterday, we started making this [choice] a very long time ago," Weber explained.</p><p>CDPR hasn't announced an official release date for The Witcher 4, and has yet to reveal which platforms the game will launch on, though the studio has, dating back to The Witcher 3, launched games on both console and PC.

The movie once again stars Ben Schwartz as Sonic, Colleen  O’Shaughnessey and Idris Elba as his friends Tails and Knuckles, with Jim Carey returning as their nemesis Dr. Ivo Robotnik. <em>Sonic 3</em> will also feature the arrival of Keanu Reeves playing Sonic’s on-again off-again enemy-turned-friend Shadow The Hedgehog.</p><p>With <em>Sonic 3</em> anticipating tidy profits as North America prepares for the Christmas / New Year’s moviegoing season, developing a fourth movie makes sense. There are several <em>rogue </em>characters from the <em>Sonic</em> universe <em>aiming</em> for their <em>silver</em> screen debut. (See what I did there?) Neither<em> Variety</em> nor Paramount Pictures have confirmed any plot details or who might get their <em>Sonic </em>movie debut. We’ll probably get a hint though, in the post-credits for <em>Sonic 3</em>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We’re expecting it to be the Steam button equipped Legion Go S that leaker Evan Blass <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320477/lenovo-legion-go-s-steamos-handheld-gaming-pc-rumors">revealed last week</a>.</p><p>Why do I say that? The January 7th event, titled “Lenovo Legion x AMD: The Future of Gaming Handhelds,” will feature a special guest: Valve SteamOS and Steam Deck co-designer Pierre-Loup Griffais. Lenovo and AMD are calling him Valve’s “Chief Design Architect” for purposes of this event. </p><p>(Most Valve employees are simply considered designers internally, since they fluidly switch between teams and tasks; I believe Griffais once told me he prefers the same, but it’s true he’s also been one of the few public faces of SteamOS and the Steam Deck. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/21/2964991/valves-handbook-for-new-employees-leak">It’s a fascinating company</a>.)</p><p>Griffais won’t be the only intriguing choice of panelist on stage: Jason Ronald, Microsoft VP of Xbox Gaming Devices and Ecosystem will also be in attendance. He's now being introduced as Microsoft’s “VP of Next Generation."</p><div><p>We exclusively shared with you last week that<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320607/lenovo-legion-go-8-leak-gamepad"> Lenovo will revamp its larger, seemingly Windows-based Legion Go with detachable controllers</a>, too. And we’re also expecting Lenovo to hedge its bets with a Windows version of the smaller Legion Go S based on those same leaks. It's a reasonable bet some, if not all of these devices will come <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/6/24237735/amd-z2-extreme-gaming-handheld-pc-chip">with AMD’s yet-to-be-detailed Z2 Extreme chips.</a></p></div><div><figcaption>A leaked image of Lenovo’s bigger Legion Go, now with seemingly more ergonomic grips and possibly an OLED panel.</figcaption> <p><cite>Image via <a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks">Evan Blass</a></cite></p></div><p>Here’s the full description of the event: </p><div><blockquote><p>Join us for a cocktail reception hosted by Lenovo Legion and AMD gaming leaders, with special guests Valve and other gaming industry giants. We’ll be sharing our thoughts on what lies ahead in the gaming handheld space and showcasing our latest Lenovo Legion Go innovations advanced by AMD. Come to hear how Lenovo Legion and AMD Ryzen are making gaming more immersive for all and stay to experience the future of handheld gaming firsthand!</p></blockquote></div><p>We’re <em>not</em> currently expecting Microsoft to surprise with an Xbox handheld at the event, as gaming boss Phil Spencer has suggested that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/13/24295461/dont-expect-an-xbox-handheld-any-time-soon">might be a few years away</a>. But it’s possible that Microsoft and Lenovo will try to suggest that all handhelds are Xbox handhelds, like Microsoft does in its new “This is an Xbox” marketing campaign:</p><p>I’ll be attending, and I’ll let you know!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Star Wars: Battlefront II's best and most complete version is currently free to keep on Xbox, but only for a limited time and only for EA Play members. Now through December 20, EA Play members can grab the 2017 game for the nice price of $0.00. EA Play is included with Game Pass Ultimate, so those subscribers get the game free as well.</p><p>The version of Battlefront II that's free is the Celebration Edition, which includes the base game and all past free updates. It has almost all of the content that was previously sold as DLC and microtransactions, so you're getting pretty much the complete package.</p><p>The Celebration Edition originally launched in December 2019 priced at $40, following on from the standard edition's debut in 2017. If you're not an EA Play or Game Pass Ultimate member, you can still get the Celebration Edition for a great price, as it's currently marked down to only $4.</p><p>Battlefront II had a challenging launch in 2017, as the game's early-access debut was criticized for its use of loot boxes. EA removed these in time for the game's public launch, though, and the game steadily grew and improved with new maps and modes over the years.</p><p>The new Battlefront games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/despite-the-loot-box-controversy-eas-star-wars-bat/1100-6471006/" data-ref-id="1100-6471006">combined to sell more than 35 million copies</a>, but EA was said to have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-rejected-star-wars-battlefront-3-pitch-report/1100-6498250/" data-ref-id="1100-6498250">rejected a pitch from DICE for a third game</a> due to licensing costs. While the modern Battlefront series didn't continue, the classic Battlefront games were re-released earlier this year <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-wars-battlefront-classic-collection-review-fire-away/1900-6418207/" data-ref-id="1900-6418207">to a poor critical reception.</a></p><p>After Battlefront II, DICE would go on to release Battlefield V in 2018 and Battlefield 2042 in 2021. DICE is now working with a network of other studios on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">the next Battlefield</a>, which returns to a modern-day setting and is reportedly on tap to launch in October 2025.</p><p>As for the Star Wars video game series, some of the upcoming games include Star Wars Eclipse from Quantic Dream and the next Star Wars Jedi game from Respawn, among others.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/19/24324936/xbox-elite-series-2-series-x-s-wireless-controller-astro-bot-ps5-deal-sale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>With the holiday season in full effect, you can expect a fresh stream of Christmas noobs entering your multiplayer lobbies. If you’re on an Xbox or PC and looking to keep the pressure on during ruthless initiation rites, the <strong>Xbox Elite Series 2 Wireless Gaming Controller</strong> can help maximize your effectiveness. It’s usually a pricey spend at $179.99, but you can get the full kit with its extra back buttons, analog stick toppers, D-pads, and wireless charging dock for just $124 ($56 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SFKTLZM?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F5PX3XU5SUY6H">Walmart</a> right now, which is a new record low price. </p><p>For comparison’s sake, the Elite Series 2 Core includes none of those extras, save for the tool that lets you adjust the analog stick’s tension. The Core is appropriately cheaper as a result and starts around $94.99 ($45 off) at <a href="https://howl.link/8li1q4bsmj1v4">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-elite-core-wireless-controller-red%2F-%2FA-88533778">Target</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Elite-Wireless-Controller-Core-Controllers/dp/B0B789CGGQ?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> right now. While you can <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Faccessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fcomplete-component-pack">buy the components separately for $59.99</a>, the two combined turn out to be more expensive than buying the full Elite Series 2 package. That said, it’s a viable way to get the full experience with the Core’s exclusive red, blue, and white color options.</p><p>The Elite Series 2 — usable on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows — offers the most customizability of any first-party pro-style controller and is still one of the most configurable options from any brand. In addition to hot-swappable D-pads and four removable back buttons, you can swap the analog stick tops and adjust their tension. The triggers support three different stop levels. You’ll also get extensive software-based button remapping through Xbox and Windows, but you can’t make changes on the controller itself. And the controller doesn’t use removable batteries like the official standard controllers, meaning you can’t swap in a fresh set if their capacity shrinks over time. But Microsoft says it’ll last up to 40 hours before you need to recharge, and you have convenient charging options between its USB-C cable and the included dock.</p><p><h5><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20926499/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-review-price-specs-features">Read our Xbox Elite Series 2 review</a>.</h5></p><div><p>The Xbox Elite Series 2 is easily one of our favorite controllers at&nbsp;<em>The Verge</em>. It’s an improvement on the already excellent Elite controller, with deep customization, optional rear paddle buttons, a swappable D-pad, and analog sticks that allow you to tailor its layout to suit your play style.</p></div><p><h3>A few more deals</h3></p><div><ul><li>If the price of the Xbox Elite Series 2 is more than you want to pay for a fresh gamepad, the standard <strong>Xbox Series X/S Wireless Controller</strong> is also on sale at <a href="https://howl.link/2idmxf1dyvd5a">Best Buy</a> and <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-series-x-s-wireless-controller-robot-white%2F-%2FA-80744785">Target</a> in white for $34.99 ($25 off), which is an all-time low price. It has no customization options outside of the remappable buttons that you can set up in Xbox and Windows, but it still offers Microsoft’s beloved ergonomics and the advantage of user-replaceable batteries — whether you go for a pair of AAs or an endless sea of rechargeable options.</li><li>If you’re partial to Roku’s incredibly easy user experience, the <strong>Roku Streaming Stick 4K</strong> can be a nice alternative to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23435393/apple-tv-4k-2022-third-gen-review-price-details">Apple TV 4K</a> or the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/20/23882154/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-soundbar-announced">Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K</a> — and the $29.99 sale price ($20 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Roku-Streaming-Device-Vision-Controls/dp/B09BKCDXZC?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.link/fj8phdsqxie9l">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Froku-streaming-stick-4k-streaming-device-4k-hdr-dolby-vision-with-voice-remote-with-tv-controls%2F-%2FA-52709600">Target</a> is a good value. Compared to the older <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/1/16587340/roku-streaming-stick-plus-2017-4k-hdr-review-price-relase">Streaming Stick Plus</a>, the 4K model offers a bit more speed for zipping around apps and now supports Dolby Vision to go along with HDR10 Plus. It doesn’t have Wi-Fi 6 or Dolby Atmos like the pricier <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/24/24252484/roku-ultra-2024-features-specs-price">Roku Ultra</a>, but it still supports basic surround sound codecs. It also comes with a great voice remote that has a headphone jack and shortcuts to popular streaming apps. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22727963/roku-streaming-stick-4k-review">Read our review</a>.</li><li><em><strong>Astro Bot</strong></em> for PlayStation 5 recently won game of the year at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24319637/the-game-awards-2024-trailers-annoucements">The Video Game Awards</a>, so we understand any sudden thirst you may have to play it. Thankfully, the physical copy is still discounted to its record low of $49.97 (about $10 off) at <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAstro-Bot-PlayStation-5%2F6261168812">Walmart</a>, <a href="https://howl.link/xoocciv9xc6uh">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fproducts%2Fastro-bot---playstation-5%2F409781.html">GameStop</a> right now. We thought the platforming puzzle game had system-selling, game-of-the-year-worthy appeal well before the votes were tallied. That’s because of its charming new mascot and supporting cast, imaginative gameplay and aesthetic, and an increasingly rare and intangible sense of magic and joy that got so many of us hooked on gaming in the hobby’s earliest years. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24237778/astro-bot-review-ps5-game-of-the-year">Read our review</a>.</li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Open that bottle of space champagne, the aliens have been wiped out. At least that's what the interstellar pilots of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elite-dangerous">Elite Dangerous</a> are celebrating in the galaxy-sized multiplayer space sim. Earlier this month, the Thargoid menace finally <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/359320/view/4476110736154691200">landed in the Sol system</a>, putting earth itself under threat for the first time, not to mention other human homeworlds and colonies. This meant players were invited to drop everything and head for home - to embark on one last great stand against the final, desperate, and dangerous alien attacker: a Thargoid Titan called "Cocijo". Don't worry, they got him.</p>

<p>"The war is over," say Frontier. "We vanquished the enemy at our doorstep and now is the time to rebuild." Here's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_OZXIEcq9Q">a recording of the Titan finally being blown to bits</a>, courtesy of player Ricardo, who recorded the final event while sitting in his ship watching the ET's last moments. Titans are the biggest alien vessel in the game, massive capital ships certainly capable of eating a planet or two. When they were first discovered, hiding in the maelstrom clouds after a game update, they were found to be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/youre-not-going-to-like-whats-inside-elite-dangerous-thargoid-maelstrom-clouds">scary and noisy</a>. "Like an orchestra of alien tubas gargling mouthwash," said Katharine. </p>
<p>The asplosion comes just two weeks after the ships <a href="https://www.elitedangerous.com/news/galnet/titan-cocijo-devastates-sol-system">showed up in Sol</a>, on December 5th. Titans are fought by bombing them to kingdom come. This means earth defenders had to load out their ships with some swish sci-fi gear. They needed "caustic sinks" to negate the hull-eating effects of a cloud of horrible space gas the alien exudes. They had to fit a "pulse neutraliser" to nullify the angry waves of painful gravity the aliens pump out. And they required rack after rack of missiles to rain down upon the monster when they finally did manage to get close, aiming (like all good trench runs) for the thermal vents on the alien's hull. All this while avoiding Thargoid interceptor ships, dodging the mines laid in the hideous caustic cloud, and escaping from a burst of blue energy the Titan unleashes when it feels most vulnerable.</p><p>Say what you like about the dry space trucking of the sim, this is excellent sci-fi craic. Few video games can result in video guides as <a href="https://youtu.be/h0U5PTVMlGA?feature=shared&amp;t=490">satisfyingly dambusters as this</a>. Veteran players may also notice in that linked video that the pilot is sitting there with his engine idling at a low heat. That's because Commanders <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/359320/discussions/0/595135660380133228/">were advised</a> to keep their thermal levels low if they wanted to watch the fireworks - so they wouldn't be noticed by any of the Titan's last protective fighter vessels. A successful bombing run netted players millions of credits in payment for an alien well-whacked. And now that the Titan lies in pieces, even pilots who avoid combat can go and scavenge the wreckage for Thargoid components worth a few hundred thousand credits. </p>
<p>Developers Frontier have also celebrated the victory with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/359320/view/508441373248061525">a post on Steam</a>, calling it an "epilogue" to the Thargoid saga. But they haven't said what's next for the aliens. Does this mean we won't see any more Titans appearing in the galaxy? Or does it just mean the threat to Earth is over? Smaller Thargoid vessels are still around to mop up, it seems, and we're not told yet if they're planning to remove those or leave them around. </p>
<p>The Thargoids have had a fun history in the game when you pile it all up. The possibility of alien life beyond bacteria was first teased in early 2016 when players found <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elite-dangerous-aliens-barnacles">strange barnacles</a> on the surface of planets. Players soon started to discover <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alien-threat-teased-in-elite-dangerous-distress-calls">spooky distress signals</a> hinting at further dangers from beyond known space. "Oh my gods, it can't be," read one of the ill-fated messages. "These things are a myth... That noise..." Soon enough players found <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elite-pilots-finally-find-a-crashed-alien-spaceship">crashed remains</a> of extraterrestrials. Then pilots started getting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elite-dangerous-thargoid-encounter">pulled out of warp</a> by huge Thargoid scout ships, who would disable their vessel, scan them with sinister intent, and warp away. </p>
<p>Eventually, the aliens attacked. Almost two years after the first signs of aggressive alien life appeared, an update <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elite-dangerous-alien-swarm-thargoids">brought combat encounters</a> with the Thargoids to the sim. They've been around in some form or another ever since, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elite-dangerous-just-got-invaded-by-thargoids">amping up their attacks on human space</a> significantly in 2022. Now, this seems to be putting a bookend on the aliens as the big bad guy.</p><p>Elite Dangerous itself is ten years old this year, which does make me curious about what's next on the agenda. Other games might have seen a sequel by now, but I'm not sure what a sequel would achieve that more expansions and continued support could not. I guess we'll see!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
