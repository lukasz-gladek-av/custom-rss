			<p>Today, Techland has outlined its eleven-week roadmap of updates coming to Dying Light: The Beast. The game launched a month ago and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-sells-over-1-million-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was immediately successful among fans</a>; now, the developers are ready to make it even better in the coming three months.</p>



<p>Confirmed additions include the New Game+ mode, Legend Levels, Nightmare Difficulty, new weapon executions, and Ray Tracing support on PC, which was suddenly removed just ahead of the launch, much to the detriment of the game's visual quality. There's also going to be a collaboration with PUBG Mobile.</p>



<p>Moreover, Techland announced a global community initiative titled Call of the Beast. The event started today and runs until January 7, 2026. New challenges and exclusive rewards will be introduced every week on Thursday.</p>



<p>Throughout this campaign, players worldwide will work together to achieve weekly goals that celebrate teamwork, persistence, and the strength of the Dying Light: The Beast community. Each challenge offers exclusive rewards that appear in participants’ in-game stash once the objectives are met. Every week, from new weapons to unique car skins, brings fresh surprises and reasons to celebrate the collective success. Players must contribute to that week's goal to receive the weekly rewards.</p>



<p>Sticking together with the community to complete at least 17 of the 22 goals will unlock a secret Legendary Reward, which players will receive at the end of the event. Additionally, if the community completes 20 goals, everyone who participated in at least one challenge will receive all the rewards, regardless of when they started playing Call of the Beast.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The first community challenge is called Season to Dismember and asks players to cut off 30 million limbs for a Lumberjack Car Skin and 60 million limbs for a Woodchopper Axe. This challenge will last until Thursday, October 23 at 4 PM CEST.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-expansion-cheap-sale-bundle-star-wars-2000636124</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/get-every-destiny-2-expansion-including-the-new-star-wars-one-for-just-35-right-now.1326835/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The<em> Destiny 2</em> 2025 Charity Bundle is almost too good to pass up. I say almost because the actual state of the sci-fi MMO right now is so rough that this might be the <a href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-free-final-shape-edge-fate-expansion-ps5-1851785927">worst time to hop into Bungie’s loot shooter in years</a>. At the same time, the bundle includes every paid piece of content for the game, including the upcoming <em>Star Wars Renegades</em> expansion, for half the price of a new game.</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.greenmangamingbundles.com/bundles/destiny-2-expansion-bundle-2025/">charity bundle</a> is being sold in partnership with Green Man Gaming and is only for the PC version of the game, but the majority of the $35 price tag all goes to the Bungie Foundation which uses gaming to help children in need. Here’s everything included in the bundle:</p>

 <ul> <li><em>Destiny 2 </em>base game</li> <li><em>Forsaken Pack</em></li> <li><em>Bungie 30th Anniversary Pack</em></li> <li><em>Beyond Light</em></li> <li><em>Shadowkeep</em></li> <li><em>Witch Queen</em></li> <li><em>Lightfall</em></li> <li><em>The Final Shape</em></li> <li><em>The Edge of Fate</em></li> <li><em>Renegades</em></li> </ul> <p>That’s everything there is to play currently (the original story campaign and other content was sunset years ago). It’s a great deal and the only thing stopping me from recommending it to everyone I know is that Destiny 2 tends to live and die by the most recent expansion and 2025’s <em>The Edge of Fate</em> is one of its worst. That’s infected the rest of the loot shooter with changes to the grind, gear, and progression that make the entire game <a href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-renegades-star-wars-power-reset-2000632488">a drag right now</a>. Bungie’s responded with a series of fixes, including&nbsp; promises to roll back some of the most controversial changes, but that requires placing a bet on Destiny 2’s future rather than investing in its present.</p> <p>The addition of Renegades is the one big silver lining for this bundles. The <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-destiny-2-renegades-trailer-release-date-1851779376"><em>Star Wars</em>-themed expansion</a> is teasing some interesting ideas and new modes. At the very least there will be a a light saber sword everyone can obtain and mess around with. And if Renegades doesn’t help right the ship, well, I’m not sure anything will. So if nothing else, consider the charity bundle a super cheap ticket to witness the rebirth of <em>Destiny 2</em>. Or, if things don’t turn around, its eventual end.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Owlcat Games announced that its next cRPG, Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy, will launch in Open Alpha on PC in Q4 2025. Thus, aspiring Inquisitors will soon be able to command a diverse warband, shaping the fate of the Imperium one decision at a time.</p>



<p>In Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy, a narrative-driven tactical RPG set in the grimdark universe created by Games Workshop, players lead a warband of diverse companions in a desperate battle against heresy and corruption against the backdrop of Noctis Aeterna and the mystery of the Tyrant Star. These companions range from loyal Imperial subjects, such as a veteran Guardsman from the death world of Catachan, to nefarious xenos, including a bird-like Kroot mercenary.</p>



<p>Featuring intricate investigations, a turn-based combat system, and choices with grave consequences, Dark Heresy promises to greatly expand on the ideas previously seen in Rogue Trader. Unlike that game, it will also feature fully voiced dialogue. You can find <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-dark-heresy-gamescom-preview-inquisitors-are-always-right/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our Gamescom 2025 preview here</a>.</p>



<p>Speaking about Rogue Trader, Owlcat also announced that the cRPG will soon be released for the Nintendo Switch 2. It will be the first game made by the developer to launch on the new platform. Previously, Owlcat had released a cloud-only version of Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous for the first Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>Rogue Trader earned an 8 out of 10 score on Wccftech from Francesco De Meo:</p>



<p><em>With the great amount of love for the setting that was poured into the game evident from every line of dialogue and every little detail, Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader is one of the best games based on the universe created by Games Workshop, and a solid tactical turn-based role-playing game that can provide hundreds of hours of fun.</em></p>



<p>The game has also been greatly refined over the past two years and has received two DLCs: <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-rogue-trader-void-shadows-q-launch-had-way-too-many-bugs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Void Shadows</a> and Lex Imperialis. Two more upcoming expansions have been announced. In the third expansion, players will enter a Necron vault curated by the iconic Trazyn the Infinite. There, they will challenge ancient guardians and uncover relics tied to the Von Valancius legacy. In the fourth DLC, players will explore the Processional of the Damned, a surreal graveyard of voidships where they will descend into madness and mystery.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/quantic-dream-competitive-multiplayer-game-spellcasters-chronicles/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/spellcasters-chronicles-is-quantic-dream%E2%80%99s-new-f2p-3v3-competitive-multiplayer-game.1326817/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Shortly after Quantic Dream <a href="https://wccftech.com/quantic-dream-announces-multiplayer-game-star-wars-eclipse-work-continues/">announced that it would be making a competitive multiplayer game</a>, the studio went ahead and revealed the game to be <a href="https://www.spellcasterschronicles.com/en-US">Spellcasters Chronicles</a>, a free-to-play, 3v3 action-strategy game with third-person combat, where players clash in "<em>vertical arenas</em>."</p>



<p>You play as a 'Spellcaster,' and face off against other players in squads of three, in 25-minute battles where players have to capture altars, gain territory, and destroy the opposing squad's 'Lifestones' to achieve victory.</p>



<p>Spellcasters have their own spells they cast, though the more significant element of their gameplay seems to be summoning creatures to fight for you in these battles. Each Spellcaster has its own archetype though, so players can jump between them to find ones that suit their playstyle. Beyond those archetypes, you'll also be deck-building by selecting various spells and creatures to summon as part of our character's loadout.</p>



<p>Quantic Dream debuted a gameplay trailer for Spellcasters Chronicles, which you can check out below.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="SPELLCASTERS CHRONICLES | REVEAL TEASER" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sEXC2rMYWTY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>"<em>We are honoured and excited to introduce Spellcasters Chronicles to players today, developed in our Paris and Montreal studios</em>," Quantic Dream co-founder and president David Cage says in a press release. "<em>Stepping into a new genre with a fresh artistic approach has been both a challenge and a source of growth, allowing us to evolve as a team. We now look forward to shaping the game further with players' feedback and to perfecting this journey together. This project reflects the creative spirit and technical ambitions guiding Quantic Dream for nearly three decades. With Spellcasters Chronicles, we sought to bring a new form of gaming experience blending action and strategy to life, while exploring community-driven narrative.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>It has been an exploration of bold ideas, a chance to expand into social and multiplayer experiences, and an adventure shared by a new talented team of experts within our studios in Paris and Montreal who brought this original universe to life and are continuing to develop new experiences including Star Wars: Eclipse</em>."</p>



<p>Quantic Dream will host a closed beta for the game at the end of 2025, which you can currently sign up for if you're keen to try Spellcasters Chronicles yourself. The closed beta is invite-only, so signing up doesn't ensure you a spot; it just puts you in the running for one.</p>



<p>While the gameplay trailer does its job of making the matches look interesting, even potentially exciting, how the game plays will be what decides its fate. It'll be interesting to see how players react when they get their hands on the game for the first time, which is happening much sooner than the closed beta.</p>



<p>Tomorrow, on October 17, at TwitchCon in San Diego, on the LAN stage, people will get to play Spellcasters Chronicles for the first time. We'll also get a gameplay deep dive of the game, and there will be a community Q&amp;A session for curious players to learn more about Spellcasters Chronicles.</p>



<p>Hopefully, for Quantic Dream's sake, it goes well. We'll see how the world reacts when we get a proper look at Spellcasters Chronicles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Star Wars: Eclipse&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Detroit: Become Human&nbsp;</em>developer Quantic Dream has teased another project in the works, and according to studio head David Cage, it's a departure from what the company is known for.</p>

<p>That's according to a new blog post on Quantic Dream's official website, titled "Writing a New Chapter". In the post, Cage says his studio has "decided to take a new step" after "years as a single-project studio", and that new step is a "competitive multiplayer experience".</p>

<p>Cage acknowledges Quantic Dream's lack of experience in the area, but he says that together with the community's "support and feedback", he believes the studio can create "something truly unique".</p>

<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Eclipse</em>, Cage provides a rather disappointingly brief update on that game's development. He says&nbsp;<em>Eclipse</em>'s development "continues", and that he and Quantic Dream are "eager to share more" at some point in the future.</p>

<p>Just as a quick reminder,&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Eclipse&nbsp;</em>was first revealed during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-announcement-from-game-awards-2021" rel="nofollow">2021's Game Awards ceremony</a>, and since then, Quantic Dream has been rather quiet about the game, although reports from early 2022 suggested that the announcement had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-eclipse-failed-to-attract-new-talent-at-quantic-dream-report-says" rel="nofollow">failed to attract new talent</a> to the French developer.</p>

<p>Quantic Dream itself was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/quantic-dream-acquired-by-netease" rel="nofollow">subsequently acquired</a> by Chinese gaming giant NetEase, but the developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/quantic-dream-unaffected-netease-layoffs" rel="nofollow">remained "unaffected"</a> by the layoffs and cancellations that have recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">swept</a> many of that company's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rich-vogel-t-minus-zero-entertainment-netease-shut-down" rel="nofollow">subsidiaries</a>.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Too many <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-weapons-list">Battlefield 6</a> rounds of Conquest have been ending in a dissatisfying time-out, Uncle EA have found, with rival teams failing to completely devour each other's supply of spawning tickets. We've all known engagements like that - tit-for-tat exchanges between mostly AFK recon players. Irresolutions that might yawn forever were it not for everybody's <em>real</em> enemy, the clock. The gutsy response would have been to retitle Conquest "Bathos", or "War on Terror" if they wanted to sadden George Bush, or "Waiting for Bravo" if they wanted to amuse the Beckett fans, or "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deadlock">Deadlock</a>" if they wanted to tweak Valve's whiskers. Instead, EA have taken the coward's way out and chopped the allowance of tickets on a per map basis.
</p><!--more-->
<p>"We've reduced the starting ticket count across all Conquest maps so matches finish at a more natural pace," the devs explain on <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1978462075488817479">MechaHitler.com</a>. "Previously, many rounds were hitting the time limit instead of ending when one team ran out of tickets. We'll keep monitoring feedback and data to make sure the flow of each match feels right." 
</p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of the cuts, from which you might be able to deduce map sizes, if you've yet to play Battlefield 6. Operation Firestorm is a whopper with much open/burning desert between capture points, hence the dramatically lower new ticket total. Empire State is relatively tiddly and crowded, and has accordingly received a smaller haircut. There are probably more nuanced observations to make of each map's layout. Hey, don't look at me - I spend most of my Operation Firestorm matches pretending to be a cactus.
</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Siege of Cairo from 1000 to 900</li>
<li>Empire State from 1000 to 900</li>
<li>Iberian Offensive from 1000 to 900</li>
<li>Liberation Peak from 1000 to 800</li>
<li>Manhattan Bridge from 1000 to 800 </li>
<li>Operation Firestorm from 1000 to 700 </li>
<li>New Sobek City from 1000 to 900 </li>
<li>Mirak Valley from 1000 to 700 </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The chops follow a number of Battlefield 6 updates and hotfixes to, amongst other things, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-gets-a-hotfix-targeting-bugged-hit-damage-and-ea-are-busy-inspecting-bouncy-ladders">get rid of ladders that behave like trebuchets</a>,  and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-backend-tweaks-tune-down-some-sniper-rifles-and-shotguns-as-ea-keep-fiddling-with-little-knobs">defang certain sniper rifles and shotguns</a>. How are you getting on with it, if you're playing?</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/space-marine-2-warhammer-40k-review-how-long-review-ps5-1851639029"><i>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</i></a> is getting a free demo for anyone who hasn’t already played one of the best shooters of 2025. It’ll give players access to a couple of story missions and almost the full suite of multiplayer activities before they decide if they want to buy it or not.</p> <p>The free demo will be available from October 16-20 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S and until October 23 on PC via Steam. It’ll include the intro and first mission of the story campaign as well as unlimited multiplayer for the Inferno, Decapitation and Vox Liberatis Operations (online co-op missions) as well as all Eternal War modes except for the recently added Helbrute Onslaught which is basically the game’s horde mode.</p>

 <p><em>Space Marine 2</em> is a sequel to the cult-favorite Xbox 360-era third-person shooter that delivers an old-school emphasis on meat and potatoes gunplay but with the impressive visuals of a modern blockbuster. It takes place during the Fourth Tyrannic War and is steeped in the lore and politics of the Warhammer 40K universe but doesn’t require you to have any working knowledge of the tabletop source material to enjoy the great art direction and <a href="https://kotaku.com/space-marine-2-saber-ceo-asmongold-youtube-comment-1851650858">old-school, AA charm</a>.</p> <p>If you choose to take the plunge, <em>Space Marine 2</em> is currently half-off on console ($35) and 55 percent off on PC ($30). The DLC is all discounted as well. But don’t forget, you’ll need a Game Pass or PS Plus subscription to play multiplayer on Xbox and PlayStation, even with the free demo, unfortunately.</p>

              <p>Quantic Dream, responsible for just&nbsp;<em>so</em> many over-hyped, anticlimactic, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-super-fans-of-detroit-become-human-hate-most-of-th-1828260985">faintly</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/heavy-rains-most-gruesome-scene-is-still-gut-wrenching-1796855768">racist</a> games, is back with some big news! Not only is it still, allegedly, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-biggest-gaming-disappointments-of-2021-1848249172">developing a&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em> game</a>, but the studio known for single-player story-focused games is now also working on a competitive multiplayer game called <em>Spellcasters</em>.</p> <p>David Cage’s Quantic Dream is world-renowned for its cinematic story-driven games that promise extraordinary levels of interaction and choice and sometimes instead deliver <a href="https://www.endlessmode.com/video-games/quantic-dream/david-cages-writing-has-a-message-but-its-not-what">badly written nonsense</a> about ninjas or something. So who better than the developers of&nbsp;<em>Indigo Prophesy</em> and&nbsp;<em>Detroit: Become Human</em> to pick up the endlessly dropped baton of the next great <em>Overwatch</em>-like? That’s the plan according to Cage who, in <a href="https://blog.quanticdream.com/writing-a-new-chapter/">a blog post on the company’s site</a>, explained the much-expanded studio is working on a “competitive multiplayer experience, born from the same spirit of curiosity and creativity that has always defined us.”</p>

 <p>“This new title may surprise our fans as it is very different from what we have done so far,” Cage continues. “But taking risks, challenging ourselves, exploring new ways of playing and telling stories, and attempting what seems impossible, has always been part of our DNA.”</p>

  <p>It’s honestly hard to see any of this innovative originality in the trailer that dropped as I was writing this.&nbsp;<em>Spellcasters</em> might end up being completely brilliant for all I know, but the 3×3 hero shooter looks astonishingly generic to my eyes, indistinguishable from a dozen other wannabes.</p>

 <p>Quantic Dream has had quite the odd last few years, perhaps driving its desire for radical change. <a href="https://kotaku.com/david-cages-quantic-dreams-accused-of-being-a-toxic-wor-1822068440#_ga=2.116815942.1198361688.1524304403-255961593.1515548411">The studio was accused by multiple former and current staff of being a “toxic workplace”</a> that featured homophobia, racism and punishing crunch; claims which were furiously refuted by the two bosses, Cage and Guillaume de Fondaumière. So angered were the pair that in 2018 <a href="https://kotaku.com/detroit-developer-quantic-dream-sues-french-media-over-1825453518">they sued the French media outlets that published the claims</a>, which led to <a href="https://kotaku.com/report-quantic-dream-executives-cry-ask-if-they-can-l-1847036252">astonishing scenes in a 2021 court case</a> where de Fondaumière asked if they were allowed to lie because they weren’t under oath, while Cage was reported to have cried, stamped, screamed and eventually stormed out of the court room. Then, for one final surreal twist, <a href="https://kotaku.com/detroit-dev-quantic-dreams-wins-lawsuit-without-actuall-1847716375">Quantic Dream won part of this case but without ever disproving the allegations</a>. (It’s even weirder, because despite&nbsp;<em>Le Monde</em> and&nbsp;<em>Mediapart</em> collaborating on its reporting about the studio, QD somehow won against one and lost against the other. Meanwhile, the third outlet involved,&nbsp;<em>Canard PC</em>, wasn’t sued at all.) However, given it lost another part, it means much of the reporting was upheld by the courts.</p>

 <h2>But what about&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Eclipse</em>?</h2> <p>So anyway, it’s that lot making the next hopeful to enter the live-service multiplayer arena. And that’s also, we are led to believe, still making <em>Star Wars: Eclipse.</em> The game was&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/your-first-look-at-quantic-dreams-dramatic-new-star-war-1848176894"> announced in 2021</a> (following <a href="https://kotaku.com/what-we-ve-heard-about-a-quantic-dream-star-wars-game-1847708431">widespread rumors</a>), before going extremely quiet for a couple of years. Then in 2023 <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-eclipse-quantic-dream-game-delayed-anyone-die-1850865409">we learned it would not feature any “game overs” and that any character could die</a>. But then, another two years of silence. So is it dead? Apparently not. Cage makes a&nbsp;<em>very</em> brief reference to the game in his post, stating, “Of course, development of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Eclipse</em> continues, and we are eager to share more with you in the future.”</p>

  <p>But literally nothing else. It doesn’t bode well, honestly, given it’s been four years and you have to think Disney would like something to show off. It has in fact been over seven years since the developer released a game, with its focus seemingly shifted toward publishing in the interim. It published last year’s&nbsp;<em>Dustborn</em>&nbsp;alongside&nbsp;<em>Under the Waves</em>, in addition to helping out with motion capture for <em>Elden Ring</em>.</p> <p>Now the company is splitting its focus, clearly hoping to do what Sony and so many others couldn’t, and release a hit hero shooter.</p>

              <p>If you’ve ever tried transferring a batch of 4K videos to an external hard drive and ended up waiting forever, you know how crucial a good SSD can be. <strong>Speed, reliability, and toughness</strong>: that’s what really matters when you’re juggling files between your laptop or camera. The SanDisk 2TB <em>Extreme</em> portable SSD checks all those boxes while hitting its lowest price ever on Amazon. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4826/">it’s down to $149 from $209 which is the cheapest it’s ever been for this storage powerhouse</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4826/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Portable Power, Tough Build, And Lightning Speed</h2>
<p>Let’s begin with speed, since that’s where this SSD really boasts its strongest performance: The SanDisk Extreme SSD employs <strong>NVMe technology and up to 1050 MB/s read and 1000 MB/s write speeds are possible with it</strong>. That’s about ten times the speed of the run-of-the-mill external hard drive (HDD) so you can transfer massive video projects or backup your laptop in minutes, not hours.</p>



<p>Apart from its ruggedness and light weight, the reason for the popularity of this drive is consistency: You plug it in a Mac, PC, or tablet and the performance is rock steady. It <strong>plugs in via USB‑C and comes with USB 3.2 Gen 2 for full bandwidth</strong> and also operates with older USB‑A with the cable included.</p>
<p>On top of the existing 29% discount, it’s probably the lowest price-to-performance ratio available from SanDisk in years.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s going to be a huge moment when we get to drop into Battlefield 6’s battle royale mode. The spiritual successor to Firestorm and Hazard Zone will be a historic occasion, and we’re checking to see if it’s free-to-play, plus anything else cost-related, or what you need to hop in.</p>



<p>Battle royale is an interesting one in 2025. The genre’s peak days feel behind us more than they are ahead, but millions of players are still dropping into huge maps slowly being engulfed by electricity, storms, and gas. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-biggest-launch-series-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> launched with a decent campaign and a brilliant multiplayer mode, but we’ve always known a battle royale extra was lurking in the background.</p>



<p>It’s fascinating to see how destruction is factored into the fray. Before we get there, however, let’s see if you’ve got to pay to take the ride.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-battlefield-6-battle-royale-free-to-play">Is Battlefield 6 Battle Royale Free To Play?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>An all-out war approaches. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>According to Insider Gaming sources, yes, the Battle Royale game mode will be completely free-to-play under the Battlefield 6 umbrella.</strong></p>



<p>We exclusively reported on Feb. 27, 2024, that EA was working on a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">battle royale mode</a> for the (then) upcoming Battlefield 6. Pretty much everything in that story came to fruition. But the story also added:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Ripple Effect, the studio that is working on a ‘new experience’ for the Battlefield franchise is working on a new Battle Royale title that’s currently aimed to be <strong>free-to-play</strong> and follow a similar strategy to the highly successful Call of Duty: Warzone that will see the free-to-play experience tie-in with its premium release.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Officially, all we know in this moment is that BF 6’s battle royale is happening. EA hasn’t confirmed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date-pois-circle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date</a>, nor officially confirmed our report that it will be free. Stay tuned for further updates, but we’ll be shocked if you have to pay an extra penny for BF 6’s battle royale—perhaps with one slight caveat.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-battlefield-6-battle-royale-be-a-standalone-game-like-warzone">Will Battlefield 6 Battle Royale Be A Standalone Game Like Warzone?</h2>



<p><strong>There has been no news or leaks to say if Battlefield 6’s battle royale game is included in the overall BF 6 package, or if it’ll be a free-to-play download like Call of Duty: Warzone.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s that caveat we mentioned. We haven’t heard anything regarding EA’s final decision on the battle royale being completely free, or only free to paying Battlefield 6 customers.</p>



<p>Warzone is a Call of Duty game, but it’s a separate (free) download. We’ll have to see if the new battle royale component follows its path.</p>



<p>If we can and do learn more about the battle royale mode, you’ll hear it from us. We haven’t steered you far wrong when it comes to BF 6 news and leaks, so we’ll keep our eyes open on more battle royale news. Are you looking forward to seeing how different a BF 6 BR looks in 2025?

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> GTA 6 (Grand Theft Auto VI) - Official Release Date Reveal | Trailer 2</p>
      </div>
<p>"Our research suggests that GTA 6 will generate more revenue at a standard $69.99 price point than the much discussed $100," MIDiA Research's Head of Data and study co-author, Perry Gresham, told IGN. "A $100 price point would actually leave money on the table.”</p><p>The firm's games analyst, Brandon Sutton, echoed Gresham's sentiment, saying that GTA 6's price--whatever it ends up being--should "serve as a caution" to other publishers looking to raise game prices.</p><p>"Our research shows that 59% of consumers have some interest in purchasing GTA 6, highlighting the immense appeal and commercial potential of the game," Sutton said. "This notoriety also makes GTA 6 the perfect test case to understand consumer expectations around video games pricing."</p><p>IGN pointed to some other findings within the study, too. MIDiA Research found that 60% of consumers said they'd "definitely" or "probably" buy GTA 6 at $70, while just 35% said the same thing if the game were $100. Of course, that number jumped to 79% if Rockstar dropped its crime sim at an improbable $50, and a whopping 16% would scoop the game up at an eye-watering $150 tag.</p><p>This suggests that, according to MIDiA Research, the "optimal" $70 price would equate to nearly 9% of US adults buying the game, which could total to about 22.9 million copies sold and roughly $1.6 billion in revenue.</p><p>That means that, unlike former Saints Row developer Chris Stockman, who said in an October 2025 Esports Insider interview that he "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/at-least-one-dev-hopes-gta-6-is-100/1100-6535457/" data-ref-id="1100-6535457">really hope[s]</a>"GTA 6 launches at $100, most others in MIDiA Research's study completely disagree with this feeling.</p><p>However, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-addresses-rumored-price-hike-for-grand-theft-auto-6/1100-6533788/" data-ref-id="1100-6533788">dodged questions around raising game prices</a>, so we just have no clue how much GTA 6 will cost when it launches on May 26, 2026 for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

                <p>Game developer Hideo Kojima is famous for his unconventional approach to, well, everything he does--but even one of his sillier marketing moves for PS5 title Death Stranding 2: On the Beach didn't immediately hit as intended.</p><p>Speaking to Japanese magazine <a href="https://ananweb.jp/categories/entertainment/62013" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">An-An</a> (translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/no-one-was-accepting-hideo-kojimas-free-death-stranding-2-tissues-on-the-streets-of-tokyo-until-he-tweeted-about-it-online/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automation</a>), Kojima recalled an on-the-ground marketing stunt that he and other Kojima Productions team members carried out in the streets of Tokyo, passing out Death Stranding 2-branded tissue packs that included a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/secret-death-stranding-2-video-has-been-revealed-but-dont-get-too-excited/1100-6531775/" data-ref-id="1100-6531775">QR code for a rather cryptic trailer</a> of the game.</p><p>It's a campaign that might sound unusual to some, but passing out tissue packs was once a common advertising tactic in Japan, akin to advertising businesses on matchboxes. The idea here is that passersby are being handed something with functionality instead of simple flyers, which are promptly discarded afterward.</p><p>Kojima himself admitted that the practice was outdated, but the act of physically handing objects to people was in line with the themes of his game. Unfortunately for Kojima and his compatriots, no one was biting.</p><p>"Hardly anyone was willing to take one. Even when I reached out, they wouldn’t take it. They’d walk away without even making eye contact. Some even went out of their way to avoid us, as if they were walking around something dangerous," Kojima said.</p><p>It's fair to attribute that aversion to human interaction to the shifting cultural norms after the COVID-19 pandemic, along with the prevalence of digital advertising. Perhaps pedestrians simply had no interest in a video game, let alone a rather esoteric one like Death Stranding.</p><p>But we can't rule out the possibility that any of these folks fully knew who Kojima is and simply chose not to engage. Back in 2013, Kojima publicly chastised critics of his character Quiet from Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, who wore little more than a bikini and some tactical gear. The developer famously declared that when those who raised ire over her design realized the story reason for her attire, they would be "ashamed of [their] words &amp; deeds."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/376424398023962624?lang=en" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">(Cont) But once you recognize the secret reason for her exposure, you will feel ashamed of your words &amp; deeds.</p>  — HIDEO_KOJIMA (@HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/376424398023962624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 7, 2013</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Regardless of whether this initial failure was due to changing social habits post-COVID, a lack of interest in a video game, or genuine shame from one's words and deeds, Kojima turned the tide by simply <a href="https://x.com/Kojima_Hideo/status/1925836446360854998" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posting on X</a> about the stunt, leading to Kojima Productions fully exhausting its supply of tissues.</p><p>"It was an analog stunt going against the tide of the times, but by fusing it with digital power, we created an even stronger connection," Kojima said, tying this story to the themes of Death Stranding 2 in a roundabout manner.</p><p>Looking ahead, Kojima has a lot on his plate, with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojimas-od-gives-us-p-t-vibes-in-new-preview/1100-6534933/" data-ref-id="1100-6534933">Xbox horror game OD</a> and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/physint-first-look-at-hideo-kojima-new-project-teases-stealth-and-feelings/1100-6534932/" data-ref-id="1100-6534932">PlayStation stealth title Physint</a> in development.

            <p>EA and Battlefield Studios have confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> has sold over 7m copies since launch, breaking records for the series.</p>
<p>In an official press release from EA, interesting stats are featured prominantly. In addition to sales, over 172m online matches have been played across all platforms. On top of that, the game was watched for over 15m hours on streaming services like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> and YouTube during its launch weekend.</p>
<p>This official statement <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-has-sold-over-seven-million-copies-in-five-days-data-analyst-company-claims">confirms estimates laid out by an industry analyst earlier in the week</a>. These analysts from Alinea Analytics also believed that roughly 55 percent of players came from Steam alone.</p>

<p>Alongside the celebratory press release, quotes from senior Battlefield 6 leads were included that offer a peek into the sentiment at EA and from Battlefield's developers.</p>
<p>Battlefield general manager Byron Beede wrote: "First and foremost we want to thank our players. Battlefield 6 was built with our fans. From the initial concept through to the implementation of Battlefield Labs and into the record-shattering Open Beta we have been obsessed with player feedback. Together, with our players we've had a singular goal: to craft the best Battlefield ever. And this is just the beginning - our first season of new content is just 12 days away."</p><p>Executive vice president Vince Zampella added his own thoughts, writing: "We never take moments like this for granted, so I want to express our sincere gratitude to our global Battlefield Studios and passionate community that has helped get us to this point. We appreciate you joining us for Battlefield 6's momentous launch. We have so much more to come in the weeks ahead."</p>
<p>It's a milestone moment for EA, especially given the history of Battlefield and its lesser presence over recent years. If you've not played it yet, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-review">why not read Eurogamer's Battlefield 6 review</a>! In it, Rick Lane writes: "Battlefield 6 delivers a thrilling multiplayer reset and a decent, if derivative single-player. But it still displays nagging doubts about what makes Battlefield special."</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how Call of Duty compares this year, especially given the feud between both Battlefield 6 and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> that has been continuously bubbling away this year. Who knows? Maybe the tide is turning on the king of mass-market FPS games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Following Alinea Analytics' report that Battlefield 6 <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-smash-hit-more-6-5-million-units-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had sold more than six and a half million units</a>, publisher Electronic Arts has now confirmed that the game has indeed sold more than seven million copies just in the first three days.</p>



<p>This means Battlefield 6 is officially the biggest franchise launch ever. Over 172 million matches were played online during the first weekend, and players accumulated over 15 million hours of streaming. As previously reported, the game also <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-servers-hit-capacity-at-launch-steam-charts-747k-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">registered the most concurrent players in Battlefield history</a>. </p>



<p>Byron Beede, General Manager of Battlefield, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>First and foremost we want to thank our players. Battlefield 6 was built with our fans. From the initial concept through to the implementation of Battlefield Labs and into the record-shattering Open Beta we have been obsessed with player feedback. Together, with our players we've had a singular goal: to craft the best Battlefield ever. And this is just the beginning - our first season of new content is just 12 days away.</em></p>



<p>Vince Zampella, Executive Vice President, added:</p>



<p><em>We never take moments like this for granted, so I want to express our sincere gratitude to our global Battlefield Studios and passionate community that has helped get us to this point. We appreciate you joining us for Battlefield 6’s momentous launch. We have so much more to come in the weeks ahead.</em></p>



<p>The game earned an 8.5 score in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wccftech's review by David Carcasole</a>, who pointed out that while the single player campaign is lackluster, the multiplayer modes are rock solid, marking the franchise's comeback after Battlefield V and 2042.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the developers are <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-naval-warfare-reportedly-in-development-ea-battlefield-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">allegedly already working to add naval warfare</a>. On the live servers, they have also <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-gets-reduced-ticket-count-conquest-mode-players-arent-happy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reduced the starting ticket count on Conquest maps</a>, although that change didn't go over too well with the community.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/iracing">iRacing</a>'s always scared me a bit.

<p>"Funlop", reads the parody-centric text scrawled across a bridge over the game's version of the Japanese Tsukuba Circuit. To be honest, the simple fact developers Original Fire Games and iRacing have opted for a classic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gran-turismo">Gran Turismo</a> track as the venue for the single Porsche one-make race which makes up the Next Fest demo had me 90% sold before I'd even turned a wheel.</p><p>First up was a two-lap qualifying session, with each 911 out on track at the same time, but separated by intervals. As I quickly found out, getting close to another car in one of these sessions just sees it turn into a ghost to prevent collisions, so even if you race up to those in front, there's no danger of being blocked. However, you can very much get a track limits penalty which slaps you with a temporary forced slowdown period as punishment for your corner cutting. It's a reminder in case you needed one that this is still iRacing, so you'd better locate the brake pedal rather than trying to bounce at full speed off of walls, sonny Jim.</p>
<p>Provided you keep it between the lines, driving the licensed GT racer with a controller is brilliant. The model's a cute mini-me of a full-size 911, but packs the same punchy soundtrack of straight-six screaming. It feels great to fling into one of Tsukuba's tight hairpins, and tricky to balance on the edge of adhesion as you try to maximise velocity through the flowing chicane midway through the lap or hang on for dear life through the sweeping right of the final corner.</p>
<p>Once the grid's decided, it's on into a six lap race, which sadly doesn't allow you to test out the cartoon pit crews standing vigilant watch along the pit lane. To be fair, Tsukuba's a less than 30 second tour in a iRacing Arcade's Porsches, so there's hardly enough tyre wear in this length of sprint to warrant fresh rubber. Things get nice and chaotic right away if you're running mid-pack, with the AI drivers glomming together like swarms of hornets to try and dice your way through.</p>
<p>Shhh. Come here so I can whisper this without big iRacing hearing. You can drive into people. You won't get penalised. Each minor hit will only cost you a single one of your car's very generous hundred health points. These bumps and scraps are nowhere near as satisfying or played up as they are in more anarchic arcade racers, only offering a dull thunk resulting in little to no visible damage on contact, but this is progress. Who knows, in ten years time we might get iRacing's take on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wreckfest">Wreckfest</a>.</p><p>Admittedly having not double checked the assigned handbrake button, I also couldn't manage to get the rear-wheel-drive racer drifting all that much. Please keep that quiet too, I don't want to get a letter in the post which reads 'LOOK AFTER YOUR TYRES. GRAINING, MARBLES, CONTACT PATCHES, SIDEWALLS. DO THESE HOLY TERMS MEAN NOTHING TO YOU, HEATHEN?'. I apologise, o racers of the lowercase i. </p>
<p>iRacing Arcade's due to release on December 2nd this year, and you can grab the keys to its Next Fest demo from its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3226450/iRacing_Arcade/">Steam page</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning, folks! I’m back after my week-long vacation. A big thanks to Ethan for handling Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of news and other stuff you might care about, for the last week. But the vacation is over, and I bring you news about Nintendo getting hacked, another Sony franchise leaping to PC, 2K not giving up on that extraction shooter it announced last year, Sakurai’s manga, and a report that Jim Carrey might star in an upcoming <em>Jetsons</em> movie.</p> <h2><strong>Nintendo Claims Nothing Was Leaked Following Recent Hack Attempt</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/cyber-security/nintendo-allegedly-hacked-by-crimson-collective-hacking-group-screenshot-shows-leaked-folders-production-assets-developer-files-and-backups">Earlier this month,</a> hacker group Crimson Collective claimed to have gained access to private, unreleased Nintendo information and data. However, the company behind Mario has pushed back against these claims, <a href="https://www.sankei.com/article/20251015-6H66THKNKJKJLCI2BKXWZYB72Y/">sharing in a statement</a> that no “personal” or dev-related info was leaked, though the company did confirm some external servers that display Nintendo’s website were affected.</p>

 <p>“We have not confirmed any leak of personal information, and there has been no leak of development or business information,” claimed Nintendo.</p> <h2><strong><em>MLB The Show</em> Might Be Getting A PC Port In The Future</strong></h2> <p>Sony’s San Diego Studio, the company behind the long-running and popular baseball sim <em>MLB The Show</em>, is currently looking to hire a “Senior PC Graphics Programmer” for a “AAA PC” game. Hmmmm. What could that game possibly be? Oh, it’s probably <em>MLB The Show</em>. The franchise has become the de facto MLB game over the last few years and even made the leap to Xbox and Switch due to a lack of other baseball sims and pressure from the MLB. So it would make sense that Sony’s baseball series would land on PC, too.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">PlayStation Studios – San Diego Studio (MLB The Show) is seeking a Senior PC Graphics Programmer for a "AAA PC title" <a href="https://t.co/arat0yL1W2">https://t.co/arat0yL1W2</a> <a href="https://t.co/WsMRDaFKD9">pic.twitter.com/WsMRDaFKD9</a></p> <p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1978574996575490486?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 15, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <h2><strong>2K Isn’t Giving Up On That Extraction Shooter You Already Forgot About</strong></h2> <p>Remember colorful, <a href="https://kotaku.com/project-ethos-2k-games-twitch-f2p-fortnite-overwatch-1851675279"><em>Fortnite</em>-like extraction hero shooter <em>Project Ethos</em></a>? Probably not. I write about games for a living, and I forgot about this thing until just now. <em>Project Ethos</em> is from 2K-owned 31st Union and was announced last year to a resounding “meh” from folks online. <a href="https://kotaku.com/michael-condrey-projet-ethos-31st-union-2k-games-1851756173">We’ve not heard much about the game since then</a>, but as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2k-reaffirms-support-for-project-ethos-names-apex-legends-executive-producer-as-head-of-31st-union">reported by <em>IGN</em></a>, an internal memo indicates the game isn’t dead. In fact, 2K has brought on Ben Brinkman, a longtime executive producer on<em> Apex Legends</em>, to help develop the game. I’ll be curious the next time we get a look at <em>Project Ethos</em> and see what’s changed since its big reveal in 2024.</p>

 <h2><strong>A New Manga Based On The Life Of Masahiro Sakurai Is Out Soon</strong></h2> <p>Masahiro Sakurai, the creator behind <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> and Kirby, is getting a manga adaptation of his life. <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/images/202510/55235/506460">As reported by <em>Famitsu</em>,</a> the 160-page book will be released in Japan on November 18. There are currently no plans to release the manga in the United States. Sakurai supervised the creation of the book, which will launch two days before <a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-switch-2-release-date-nintendo-direct-trailer-2000618410"><em>Kirby Air Riders</em></a>, directed by Sakurai, arrives on Nintendo Switch 2. Here are the six chapters, according to <em>Famitsu</em>.</p> <ol> <li>Young Sakurai and Games</li> <li>The Birth of Kirby</li> <li>The Beginning of Super Smash Bros</li> <li>The Founding of Sora, Inc</li> <li>The Legacy</li> <li>A Beacon for the Future</li> </ol> <h2><strong>Jim Carrey Reportedly In Talks To Star In Colin Trevorrow’s <em>Jetsons</em> Movie</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://www.thewrap.com/jim-carrey-jetsons-movie-colin-trevorrow-live-action/"><em>The Wrap</em> is reporting</a> that <a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-review-shadow-keanu-reeves-jim-carrey-1851726797">Jim Carrey</a> and director Colin Trevorrow (<em>Jurassic World</em>) are teaming up to make a live-action<em> Jetsons</em> movie. Sure! I guess. I mean, why not? They made a <em>Flintstones</em> live-action movie (and it got a sequel), so I guess it’s only fair that <em>The Jetsons</em> get their own Hollywood movie. I’m not sure how many people are chomping at the bit for this reported adaptation, which might explain why the studio is going after Jim Carrey for the starring role. As someone who doesn’t care at all about <em>The Jetsons</em>, I’m mildly interested in seeing this movie simply because it might have Jim Carrey in it, and I’m always down to see him be a cinematic buffoon.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-singalong-theater-return-halloween-2000635744"><em>KPOP Demon Hunters</em> Is Coming Back To Theaters&nbsp;</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/rog-xbox-ally-x-review-performance-issues-steam-deck-switch-2-2000635652">Xbox’s new handheld device is fine, but expensive</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/new-plants-vs-zombies-remastered-replanted-trailer-cringe-fake-twitch-stream-2000635689">This new trailer for the remastered PvZ game is hard to watch</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Like other games, Pokémon Legends: Z-A has Shinies. These are extremely rare and differently color-paletted versions of their regular counterparts. If you’re worried about the game’s auto-save ability making it so that you miss out on rare Shiny encounters, then you can breathe easy and use Sleep Power on yourself.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/are-starters-shiny-locked-in-pokemon-legends-z-a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shinies</a> are the holy grail of Pokémon. Legendaries are great, but the feeling of finding a Shiny version of a Pokémon is like pulling a Charizard from a Pokémon pack—wilder than anything that inhabits Viridian Forest. Shinies are usually liable to disappear if you don’t reach them in Pokémon games, but this isn’t the case in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-pre-order-bonus-redeem-code/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>.</p>

<p>Players are learning that if you hear or see a Shiny Pokémon in Legends: Z-A and it’s in your game world, you have infinite time to catch it—providing you don’t go over the Shiny limit.</p>



<p>YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AustinJohnPlays" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Austin John Plays</a> does a great job of explaining how Z-A approaches Shinies. Despite the game’s auto-save system, once a Shiny appears in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, it will remain until you interact with it: Fighting it or trying to catch it.</p>



<p>Austin John Plays explains that “Up to 10 Pokémon, who are Shiny, will be preserved in the game’s memory.” This means you have ample time to catch or reach a Shiny Pokémon,</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The mechanics and theory have been tested by other Pokémon Legends: Z-A players, too. A subreddit thread explained how the OP encountered a Shiny Magikarp, went away, changed the time of day, came back, and it was still there.</p>



<p>They did several other actions—also involving the passage of time and/or traveling—and the Shiny Magikarp didn’t budge.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>This is what we call a good quality of life feature. You don’t have to worry about games or loss of connection ruining your chances of capturing a rare Shiny.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Quantic Dream, the developer of narrative-based single-player games such as Heavy Rain, Beyond: Two Souls and Detroit: Become Human, has announced its first ever multiplayer project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Spellcasters Chronicles will be a drastic departure for the studio, as a free-to-play competitive team-based 3v3 action strategy game set to launch in closed beta via Steam before the end of this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today, Quantic Dream boss David Cage confirmed the studio would still work on single-player projects, including its long-gestating <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-eclipse">Star Wars Eclipse</a>. But the company will now operate as a multi-project studio, Cage said, with Spellcasters Chronicles its first attempt at a multiplayer title. An official reveal trailer lies just below:</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Stepping into a new genre with a fresh artistic approach has been both a challenge and a source of growth, allowing us to evolve as a team," Cage explained in a statement today. "We now look forward to shaping the game further with players' feedback and to perfecting this journey together."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Spellcasters Chronicles might be unlike anything Quantic Dream has made before, Cage suggested the project actually reflected both the "creative spirit and technical ambitions guiding Quantic Dream for nearly three decades."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Describing the game as a blend of action and strategy genres depicted with an animated fantasy aesthetic, Cage said Spellcasters Chronicles would allow the famously story-led Quantic Dream a chance at "exploring community-driven narrative." A more in-depth look at gameplay follows:</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Spellcasters Chronicles matches will see two teams of three players compete in "fast paced 25-minutes" matches, the developer said, as "teams must capture altars to gain territory and destroy their opponents' Lifestones to claim their victory."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You'll play as Spellcasters, described as "archetype-driven mages with distinct identities" that fight with spells and summoned creatures. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"After years of development, we can't wait to finally share the world of Spellcasters Chronicles with players," said game director Gregorie Diaconu. "We are starting our closed beta phase with our core-loop focused on arena battles and will introduce community narrative and other elements of our macro-loop in the following months."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier today, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heavy-rain-and-detroit-become-human-developer-quantic-dream-insists-star-wars-eclipse-development-continues-despite-competitive-multiplayer-game-plans">Cage offered the briefest of updates on Quantic Dream's highly-anticipated Star Wars Eclipse</a>, confirming the game remained in development. "Of course, development of Star Wars Eclipse continues," Cage confirmed, "and we are eager to share more with you in the future."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

He also played a key role in reviving Ninja Gaiden, with 2004’s Xbox-exclusive Ninja Gaiden reboot and subsequent games. However, he made a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/06/03/itagaki-resigns"><u>dramatic exit from Tecmo in 2008</u></a>, suing the company for damages in Tokyo District Court, a matter that was eventually settled.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He subsequently went on to found Valhalla Studios with former members of Team Ninja and directed Devil’s Third, which released in 2015. In 2021, he established Itagaki Games, with the aim of producing a new work, but unfortunately this never happened.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tributes poured in from fellow game developers. On the Facebook post, Tekken series producer Katsuhiro Harada commented: “No way Itagaki-san- You said to me we’d go out for a drink next time” — which apparently was their last exchange. Harada followed this up with a <a href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1978773188034109651" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>lengthy post</u></a> on Twitter / X in English, describing the full history of his sometimes rivalry-fuelled relationship with Itagaki.

                <p>Windows 11 has been out in its current form since 2021, but Microsoft has grand visions of transforming its operating system into an even more AI-friendly system. Starting today, Microsoft is adding AI features to Windows 11 PCs that encourage users to utilize Copilot by speaking to their computers and allowing AI to perform some basic functions for them. These updates are being rolled out alongside an ad campaign that invites people to "meet the computer you can talk to."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgQMcwhq334" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KgQMcwhq334" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"We think we're on the cusp of the next evolution, where AI happens not just in that chatbot and gets naturally integrated into the hundreds of millions of experiences that people use every day," Microsoft consumer chief marketing officer Yusuf Mehdi told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/799768/microsoft-windows-ai-copilot-voice-vision-launch" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>. "The vision that we have is: Let's rewrite the entire operating system around AI, and build essentially what becomes truly the AI PC."</p><p>The new features sound similar to the Cortana voice options on Windows 10. For example, users will be able to bring their PC out of standby by saying "Hey, Copilot!" as a command. Mehdi also shared his belief that users will embrace voice controls on a greater level than they have in the past.</p><p>Windows 11 users will have to give AI permission to take actions on their behalf before it can do so. As part of its rollout strategy, Microsoft is using Copilot Vision to scan everything on-screen and provide users with help or prompts about documents, photos, and programs. However, Copilot Actions--the AI assistant that can perform actions for a local PC--is still in the testing phase, and not ready for a full release at this time. In the meantime, Copilot is being integrated into the Windows taskbar for easier access to the voice commands.</p><p>Earlier this week, prominent game developers Hideo Kojima and Glen Schofield argued that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-should-be-embraced-not-feared-two-prominent-game-developers-say/1100-6535479/" data-ref-id="1100-6535479">AI tools should be embraced</a>.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Star Wars: Eclipse Reveal Trailer | Game Awards 2021</p>
      </div>
<p>The game takes place during the High Republic era. That period, set before any of the Star Wars films, finds the Republic at its peak, but there are threats to the galaxy that players have to deal with.</p><p>"See the galaxy through the eyes of an ensemble cast of multiple, charismatic playable characters, each with their own morality, personality, motivations, and impact upon each other and the story at large," reads a line from the game's description. The game will take players to an uncharted region of the galaxy in the Outer Rim. The game also will include new characters, and like other Quantic Dream games, will include a branching narrative that's heavy on dialogue and moral choices.</p><p>Quantic Dream is making Star Wars: Eclipse in partnership with Lucasfilm and Disney. Not all of the upcoming Disney game projects are going forward, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-closes-its-developer-and-lays-off-additional-staff/1100-6531883/" data-ref-id="1100-6531883">EA's Black Panther game has been canceled</a> on the Marvel side.</p><p>Quantic Dream is also making its first multiplayer game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/quantic-dream-announces-its-first-multiplayer-game/1100-6535455/" data-ref-id="1100-6535455">Spellcasters Chronicles</a>, with a closed beta test lined up for later this year.</p><p>To support the multiple projects, Quantic Dream has doubled the size of its development team since 2018 and opened a new studio in Montreal. NetEase acquired Quantic Dream in 2022.</p><p>Since Quantic Dream's formation in 1997, the studio has released five games: The Nomad Soul, Fahrenheit, Heavy Rain, Beyond: Two Souls, and Detroit: Become Human.</p>
