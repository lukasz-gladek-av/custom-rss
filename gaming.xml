                <p dir="ltr">Love and Deepspace is a worldwide phenomenon. Earlier this year--and less than a year after its global release--the mobile dating game hit <a href="https://x.com/Love_Deepspace/status/1881915061557764228" rel="nofollow ">50 million users</a>. A few weeks later, it was reported that, after earning a record-breaking $61 million in December 2024 alone, Love and Deepspace had raked in <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/love-and-deepspace-celebrates-first-anniversary-and-over-400m-after-record-breaking-month/" rel="nofollow ">$400 million in 2024</a>. And yet I'd still argue that, in a sense, Infold's hit title remains somewhat of a hidden gem.</p><p dir="ltr">It's no secret that mobile games, dating sims, and games designed with a female audience in mind are often dismissed, and Love and Deepspace is no exception. As such, across my year of playing the game on and off, I've shocked multiple friends simply by showing them what it actually is. With its fast-paced combat, stunning visuals, deep sci-fi setting, and focus on delivering stories that delve into "seemingly negative emotions," trauma, and uncomfortable subjects, Love and Deepspace shatters a lot of preconceived notions.</p><p dir="ltr">Love and Deepspace has challenged the preconceived notions of some of the developers, too. Following the release of Love and Deepspace's wedding-themed July 3 update, Witnessed by Deepspace, I exchanged emails with the Infold team in which we discussed what it's like designing a game with a female audience and mind. It turns out that working on the game has helped its male developers gain "progressively deeper insights into female player psychology." It also sounds like Infold might also be willing to challenge players' notions about what love is, and whether there are some lines--like killing off a love interest--the game won't cross.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4544951-f3424f82a0cc3bad.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544951" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4544951-f3424f82a0cc3bad.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544951"></a><figcaption>Love and Deepspace's five main love interests.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4544951-f3424f82a0cc3bad.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: Romance games usually do not include combat, but the combat system is an inseparable part of Love and Deepspace. How does the combat system fit into this romance story, and enhance players' love experience? How does the game's new roguelike mode fit into this?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">"Fighting side by side" was a crucial element in our game's initial concept because we felt this encapsulates the essence of romantic relationships: two people facing life's challenges together, growing together, and moving toward the future together.</p><p dir="ltr">Therefore, when designing the game, we built our gameplay mechanics and lore around this central idea. In this futuristic setting, players and their love interest face monsters called Wanderers that are from Deepspace. By battling these creatures, they gradually discover the mysteries of the world and unravel its challenges. During this process, their relationship grows through mutual support, which is a naturally occurring experience. In the game's stories, combat and romance are indispensable. The bond built from fighting together and growing together will be stronger and more touching.</p><p dir="ltr">This update's UNICORNS Operation is the third roguelike combat mode in our game. It follows up on the previous two iterations: Abyssal Chaos--Find Tobias and Abyssal Chaos--Final Farewell. Our players enjoyed these as well.</p><p dir="ltr">Each of our roguelike modes features unique progression and team composition mechanics that are designed to give players an entirely new, satisfying combat experience. In addition, UNICORNS Operation introduces exploration gameplay. Players can explore Tanakahli and speak to the island's three factions. As they delve deeper into the investigation and approach the truth, they'll discover new facets of his personality and create more memories with him. Whether it's the cooperation during combat or joint exploration, both allow players to understand him better and gain special emotional experiences beyond the sweetness of daily interactions.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>How does the team go about crafting emotional, high-stakes, and sometimes devastating stories while still ensuring that players feel comforted and happy while playing? Are there certain boundaries, such as killing off a love interest, that the team will not cross?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">We center our creative work around the timeless themes of "characters" and "love," but avoiding tragedies--through methods such as never letting a love interest die--isn't a limit we set for ourselves.</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">In reality, love is an incredibly rich, multi-faceted, complex emotion. Sweetness and romance make up one aspect of what it could be. Seemingly negative emotions like pain, anger, sadness, and reluctance are integral to love. In certain moments, the tears and heartache make us fully aware of love's presence.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">During the creation process, we don't shy away from depicting lovers' quarrels, emotional conflicts, or even the loss of a loved one. These are challenges that everyone faces. When these stories appear, we prefer to seek out their deep connection with love, explore how love helps us face pain and conflict, gives us strength, and makes our hearts more resilient.</p><p dir="ltr">Aside from the expression of love, our approach to every detail, story, and line of dialogue is centered around the characters themselves. The game unveils the world of Love and Deepspace in a comprehensive manner. It conveys the events that unfold in Linkon City at one point in time. This means players will see a broader, more integrated picture of each character. While individual stories may contain tragic elements, these moments ultimately deepen the players' connection to the characters. If players feel healed or satisfied after experiencing a story with tragic elements, then perhaps it's because they embraced [their love interest's] soul in that tale.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4544953-loveanddeepspace_witnessedbydeepspace1-10screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4544953" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4544953-loveanddeepspace_witnessedbydeepspace1-10screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4544953"></a><figcaption>The protagonist embraces Zayne</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4544953-loveanddeepspace_witnessedbydeepspace1-10screenshot.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>What inspired the team to launch a wedding-themed event? What is the inspiration behind each of the different wedding gowns and rings?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">It's been almost a year and a half since the game's official release. We believe players have reached a certain stage in their emotional journey with their love interest. They've also created many wonderful memories in the game. For this milestone, we wanted to provide players with a grand ceremonial vow--a promise about love, an answer about happiness--which is why we chose the theme of "Witnessed by Deepspace."</p><p dir="ltr">The formal wear for all five love interests, along with the matching dresses and rings, was designed around each character's unique demeanor and emotional connections. These outfits feature thoughtful details:</p><p dir="ltr">Xavier's design incorporates Wavyleaf Sea Lavender, star trails woven into galactic patterns, and other decorative elements. The overall aesthetic is dreamlike and dignified, reflecting his noble, refined elegance.</p><p dir="ltr">Rafayel's outfit uses flame lilies, starfish, ocean waves, and fire-and-water motifs to represent a romance that's tied to the ocean.</p><p dir="ltr">Zayne's look features white jasmines, snowflake-cut diamonds, and frost-like embroidery to create a reserved, graceful temperament that's rich in detail.</p><p dir="ltr">Sylus's design draws inspiration from datura and fluttering feathers, creating a free-spirited aesthetic that expresses his mature, distinctive temperament.</p><p dir="ltr">Caleb's ensemble takes black holes and paper cranes as its main sources of inspiration to emphasize destiny. For instance, the chain from his bow tie to his chest symbolizes the intertwining bonds of fate.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>This update comes with a lot of new features, such as an upgraded AR companionship system, a journal module, cat adoption, and a new roguelike mode. What feature are you most excited for players to experience?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Picking one is very difficult. We believe all these features are important. For Love and Deepspace, excellent combat, companionship, and widgets crafted alongside our narrative are all part of enhancing the overall experience, so it's hard for us to say which one is the best. What we can say for certain is that providing players with the best, most unique gaming experience has always been our cornerstone and goal. Because of this, we've put in a tremendous amount of effort and refinement into every feature.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4544952-863fa8432a63afdab27808383f54b8a1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544952" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4544952-863fa8432a63afdab27808383f54b8a1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544952"></a><figcaption>The protagonist touches Sylus.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4544952-863fa8432a63afdab27808383f54b8a1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Despite women being just as likely to play games as men, our demographic continues to be underserved or ignored by many studios. As such, Love and Deepspace serves a truly special and vital role in the industry. What is it like designing a game for a predominantly female player base?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Our objective has always remained the same: to create more immersive, visual experiences at a higher quality for players.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Your team seems to have a fantastic grasp on how to create stories and gameplay that appeal to young women so I am curious: What percentage of your team are women? Do the men who work on the game find they understand women better through their work on it?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">We have quite a few female employees on our team. They're involved in very important decision-making, and the male employees on the team have gained progressively deeper insights into female player psychology throughout the development process. The shared goal that all members have been working toward is to provide our players with a better game experience that's full of respect and attention to detail.</p><hr><p dir="ltr">In addition to the above questions, I asked the team about Love and Deepspace's age rating in North America, storage-optimization issues, how they ensure each love interest gets equal treatment, the game's gacha mechanics, and if the studio plans on bringing Love and Deepspace to PC. As of right now, the studio is not ready to publicly discuss these topics.</p><p dir="ltr">Interested players can download Love and Deepspace via Apple's App Store and the Google Play Store. The hit otome game is currently a month into its 4.0 update, Witnessed by Deepspace.</p>

            <p>
After celebrating the launch of its digital library earlier this year, the preservation-focused Video Game History Foundation has expanded its publicly available collection with the full run of Computer Entertainer, described as "one of the first American video game magazines".
</p>
<p>
Computer Entertainer might not be an immediately recognisable name this side of the pond, especially 35 years after its final issue was published, but the Video Game History Foundation's <a href="https://gamehistory.org/computerentertainer/">announcement</a> details the magazine's history, highlighted exactly why it's something of a unique - and valuable - record of home console video gaming in the mid-1980s.
</p>
<p>
"Most console game magazines in the US went out of business during the 1983–84 industry crash," it explains, "except this one. As a result, Computer Entertainer is one of the only sources for American reviews of classic games like The Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, and Super Mario Bros. And because it was run by a game retailer, this magazine is one of the only reliable sources of American game release dates during this period."

<p>
Computer Entertainer started life as The Video Game Update, a newsletter for US mail-order retailer Video Take-Out, and would run from 1982 to 1990. It was co-edited by sisters Marylou Badeaux and Celeste Dolan, which, the Video Game History Foundation notes, means it's also the "earliest console video game magazine run by women".

The foundation - which <a href="https://gamehistory.org/">describes itself</a> as a "non-profit organisation dedicated to preserving, celebrating, and teaching the history of video games" - acquired a complete run of Computer Entertainer from Marylou Badeaux last year, and began digitising the bound copies using a book scanner, resulting it what it admits were "poor quality" scans. However, following the death of Celeste Dolan, Badeaux also donated her sister's copies, after which the organisation made the decision to disassemble one set in order to scan it at the "highest possible quality".
</p>
<p>
Amid all this, the foundation sourced a number of missing copies from game historian Leonard Herman in order to complete its collection and acquired the intellectual property rights to Computer Entertainer, so the magazine could be made available to everyone for free.
</p>
<p>
As such, the <a href="https://archive.gamehistory.org/folder/519c0dbd-0f5d-45fe-83c2-355a756391a9?_gl=1*1f9exmf*_ga*MTQyMDc5NzgyMS4xNzU0NDk2NzMy*_ga_4ZPZBFRVR6*czE3NTQ0OTY3MzEkbzEkZzEkdDE3NTQ0OTY3ODMkajgkbDAkaDA.">complete run of Computer Entertainer is now available to read, search, and download</a> via the Video Game History Foundation's digital archive, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-history-foundations-long-awaited-digital-library-will-be-available-next-week">launched earlier this year</a>, providing access to a magazines, art books and more spanning the history of the gaming. Computer Entertainer has been released under a Creative Commons Attribution license, meaning it can be used for any purpose provided appropriate credit is given. 
</p>
<p>
The Video Game History Foundation was established in 2017 and joins <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-preservation-took-steps-forward-in-2024-but-still-has-a-long-way-to-go">other historians and preservationists working to ensure the medium's rich legacy isn't forgotten</a>. The organisation had previously been attempting to secure excemptions under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) that would permit libraries and archives to remotely share digital access to out-of-print games in their collections. Unfortunately, those efforts - which US video games industry lobby group the ESA refused to support - were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-copyright-office-rejects-video-game-preservationists-request-for-dmca-exceptions">rejected in 2024 by the US Copyright Office</a>.
</p>
<p>
Game preservation work continues, however. Last year, for instance, online retailer GOG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-announces-preservation-program-aims-to-maintain-game-compatibility-with-modern-and-future-systems">announced the launch of its Preservation Program</a>, intended to maintain the compatibility of games with modern and future systems, and more recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-joins-europes-largest-organisation-dedicated-to-game-preservation">joined the European Federation of Game Archives, Museums and Preservation Projects</a>.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, talk of games preservation has overlapped with the Stop Killing Games campaign, which aims to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stop-killing-games-aims-to-mount-political-and-legal-challenges-to-games-going-offline">mount political and legal challenges to games going offline</a>. A related EU petition <a href="https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/initiatives/details/2024/000007_en">recently closed with over 1m signatures</a>, meaning it can now be submitted to the EU for verification and then, potentially, either progress to a public hearing or full debate session at the European Parliament. Publishers, however, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stop-killing-games-proposals-for-game-preservation-prohibitively-expensive-major-publishers-insist">seem to object</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wooden-cup-and-ball-toy-a-review.1263678/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’ve spent the past handful of days with my friends in a house near the beach in Maine, communing with nature not in the sense that we’re at all removed from civilization, but certainly in that, when compared to the oppressive grays of New York, there are more trees around. In line with this slower-paced, foliage-rich approach to life, the house we’re staying in contains one of those wooden toys where you try to swing a ball into a cup. This one, Wikipedia just informed me, is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendama" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Kendama</a> and is actually of Japanese origin. I have some thoughts.&nbsp;</p><p>There is a pleasant physicality to the Kendama that makes it appealing in a gently social setting where, say, a few people might be talking while a couple others are scrolling on their phones. I could, in such a moment, also send my brain hurtling back to a realm of stress and obligation via the obsidian portal that’s always weighing down my pocket and my life, or I could swing a wooden ball attached to a string until it lands in a cup.&nbsp;</p><p>Nothing beats the sheer elation of finally pulling it off – except managing to do so two times in a row. Three times in a row feels at least as good as beating one of the less-acclaimed <em>Souls </em>games. Four times, my current Everest, is probably akin to meeting Gabe Newell if you’re <a href="https://aftermath.site/gabe-newell-oceano-yacht-steam-valve" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">really into big boats</a>. But even that does not compare to a feat I pulled off last night: spinning the handle and propelling the ball from one cup to another. In that moment, I saw the face of God, and He said, “Hey man, that was pretty cool.”&nbsp;</p><p>You can pick up the Kendama anytime, anywhere, which greatly adds to its appeal. In that regard, it’s not unlike the Lenovo Legion Go S SteamOS edition, the other handheld gaming console I’ve been spending time with during my trip. The Go S differentiates itself from the rest of the pack in that it’s the first Steam Deck-alike to come with native SteamOS support, meaning that it’s as intuitive out of the box as Valve’s ultra-portable PC – and with beefier specs to boot. As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/games-run-faster-on-steamos-than-windows-11-ars-testing-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ars Technica</a> has observed, SteamOS also seems to give games a minor performance boost compared to Windows 11, so the Go S SteamOS edition also outpaces its own closest relatives in Lenovo’s Legion Go line.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve spent many an idle evening hour playing <em>Warframe </em>– which has barged back into my life after <a href="https://aftermath.site/warframe-old-peace-world-war-one-interview-tennocon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TennoCon last month</a> – on the Go S, and the odd frame drop here or there aside, it runs pretty much perfectly, popping off a screen which is both bigger and higher-resolution than the Steam Deck’s at 1200p (compared to the Deck’s 800p). When it’s running a game like <em>Warframe</em>, which is not super hardware-intensive but still has a flair for the dramatic in terms of scale and aesthetic, the Go S really shines. Despite owning a Deck since the machine first came out, the Go S has still given me a couple “I can’t believe I’m playing this on a handheld” moments.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, its fans sometimes get really, really loud, threatening to overwhelm its speakers, which to my ear are of vastly lower quality than the Steam Deck’s. Also, while the Go S often meaningfully outperforms the Steam Deck (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lenovo-legion-go-s-steamos-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RPS</a> put together some nice comparison graphs with exact framerate differences), it’s not in an entirely different league. <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, for example, still requires a handful of graphical settings to be turned down just to reach an acceptable 30 frames-per-second range, and compared to a proper PC or console experience, it doesn’t look great. It’s playable, but there are so many more optimal alternatives.</p><p>At $600, the Lenovo Legion Go S SteamOS Edition is also pricier than the Steam Deck, which makes it challenging to recommend: Speaking personally, as someone who also owns a Steam Deck, I like it a lot and will probably default to it in lieu of the Steam Deck from now on. But if you aren’t a power user or someone with money to burn, the Steam Deck’s combination of acceptable performance and relative affordability is better. Put simply, the Deck is the more practical option.</p><p>However, both pale in comparison to the humble Kendama, which retails for just $20-$50 and <a href="https://meccha-japan.com/it/giocattolo/112576-japanese-toy-kendama-kirby.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comes in fun Kirby colors</a>, among numerous other options. It, too, is loud, but in a way that satisfies the user and delights onlookers. Sometimes the ball lands on your finger, but even then, it hurts less than you’d expect. It cannot run <em>Warframe</em>, a bummer but not a deal breaker. All in all, if you’re about to go on a trip to an old but nice home near the sea, I unreservedly recommend stumbling upon a Kendama and fidgeting with it constantly because you have undiagnosed ADHD. 9.97/10</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/eddington-ari-aster-covid-movie-pedro-pascal-joaquin-phoenix"><h3>Eddington Is A Compelling COVID Drama Until It Isn’t</h3></a><p>The film is neither good nor bad, but a secret third thing.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/akane-banashi-shonen-jump-manga-anime"><h3>The Best Shonen Manga Right Now Is About A Niche Performance Artist’s Fall From Grace</h3></a><p>Akane-banashi getting an anime isn't shocking because it's the best ongoing Shonen Jump manga</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ign-layoffs-ziff-davis"><h3>IGN Lays Off 8 Staff, 12% Of Union</h3></a><p>The layoffs follow wider cuts at Ziff Davis, buyouts, and layoffs and departures at acquired sites</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/cup-and-ball-toy-kendama-review]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[EA Sports NHL 26 Revealed, Arrives on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S this September with the Tkachuk Family on the Cover]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-nhl-26-release-date-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-matthew-tkachuk/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-sports-nhl-26-revealed-arrives-on-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s-this-september-with-the-tkachuk-family-on-the-cover.1263660/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>EA has revealed EA Sports NHL 26, which will once again not be coming to PC, and will only arrive on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S when it launches on September 12, 2025. </p>



<p>This year's cover athletes also follows suit from last year's family focus, though instead of the Hughes brothers, it's the Tkachuk family who are being featured this year, with Matthew Tkachuk sharing the cover with brother Brady Tkachuk and their father Keith Tkachuk, who in his 18-year-long NHL career played for the St. Louis Blues, Winnipeg Jets, Atlanta Thrashers and the Phoenix Coyotes.</p>



<p>Unlike the reveal trailer for <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-26-release-date-gameplay-reveal/">EA Sports FC 26</a>, the reveal for NHL 26 features no direct gameplay, and makes no promising boasts that this year's entry will <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-26-gameplay-deep-dive/">"<em>make gameplay better</em>."</a> It's instead more of what you'd expect from an annualized sports series, a flashy trailer that is chalk-full of sparks and sizzle but little substance as to what this year's entry will look like.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="NHL 26 Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TI79ySF0N0g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>As far as what is supposedly different in this year's entry, the 'Be A Pro' mode has been "<em>revamped</em>" according to a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250806397524/en/Think-Move-and-Play-Like-a-Superstar-in-EA-SPORTS-NHL-26-Powered-by-Official-NHL-Edge-Data">press release</a>, and is getting its "<em>biggest</em>" update since NHL 21, according to EA Sports creative director, Mike Inglehart. Inglehart also claims that EA Sports NHL 26 "<em>is the most true-to-life experience we've ever built</em>."</p>



<p>A new Goalie Crease Control System is also being introduced this year, aiming to make goalies "<em>more responsive, with smarter positioning and quicker, more natural saves</em>."</p>



<p>Regarding this year's new cover athletes, now back-to-back Stanley Cup champion and Florida Panther forward, Matthew Tkachuk, adds "<em>My dad, Brady and I are all unique and play the way we want to. Sharing the cover of NHL 26 is an extension of that. I've always tried to bring my own style to the ice, and seeing that captured in NHL 26 makes it feel like it is really me out there</em>."</p>



<p>Keith Tkachuk, who is gracing the cover of an NHL game more than a decade after he retired from the league, said that he is "<em>proud to be sharing the cover</em>" with his sons. Brady Tkachuk, brother to Matthew and captain of the Ottawa Senators,<em> </em>said "<em>it's an honor to be featured on the cover, and having him standing alongside us makes the whole thing even better</em>."</p>



<p>While it's nice for the Tkachuk brothers to share the milestone of making the cover of an NHL game with their father, fans of the series (myself included) can't help but feel a bit underwhelmed by this reveal. The Be A Pro mode has been the exact same since NHL 21, and even the changes brought in that year's edition of the annualized series didn't exactly shake the hockey world to its core. </p>



<p>EA can talk about how it's been updated and "<em>revamped</em>" all it wants, but we'll need to see the changes before they can be believed. </p>

At least for this season, it won’t be “enforcing against or requiring the use of either setting.” EA has <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/articles/battlefield/battlefield-6/pc-requirements/">also said</a> that <em>Battlefield 6</em> PC players will need to have Secure Boot and TPM 2.0 enabled to play the <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-6-open-beta">upcoming open beta</a>.</p><p>While anti-cheat systems and other security measures can go a long way toward blocking cheaters in games, the tools have come under scrutiny for potentially slowing down gamers’ systems or for requiring users to turn on features they don’t want to use.

While two-factor authentication isn’t required to play the game right now, it “may become a requirement for all users in the future.”</p><p><em><strong>Update, August 6th</strong>: </em>Battlefield 6’s<em> open beta will also require Secure Boot and TPM 2.0 to be turned on.</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/720007/call-of-duty-pc-anti-cheat-secure-boot-windows-black-ops-7]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><span>One thing rich people love to do is miss the point. Entire multimedia franchises are built as critiques of powerful people using their money and influence to put the average Joe through some hellish trial for their own amusement, and then rich folks are like, “What if I remade that?” Jimmy Donaldson, better known as MrBeast, who has made a lot of YouTube content out of putting people in viral simulations of outlandish competitions or even dangerous situations with the promise of a cash prize, has already made a recreation of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mrbeasts-irl-squid-game-sees-contestants-just-running-t-1848134062"><i><span>Squid Game</span></i></a><span>, the hugely popular Netflix series which was intended to be a commentary on the power the wealthy wield over the impoverished. Now, he’s apparently considering doing the same for </span><i><span>The Hunger Games</span></i><span>, a dystopian franchise about a society where the wealthy and powerful who reside in the Capitol treat the common citizen like cattle and make them kill each other for sport.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><i><span>The Today Show</span></i><span>, Donaldson was seemingly caught off-guard when the interviewer asked him about his plans for a </span><i><span>Hunger Games</span></i><span> recreation. He did say that the idea would “obviously” not pit people against one another in a fight to the death, with the concept instead being to put “potentially 26 random people” on an island and have them use something like laser tag guns instead of real weapons to eliminate each other, with the last person standing winning a million dollars.</span></p>    <p><span>“I think that would absolutely crush because yes, we recreated </span><i><span>Squid Game</span></i><span>, but we also rebuilt Willy Wonka’s Chocolate Factory,” Donaldson said on </span><i><span>The Today Show</span></i><span>. “I have a chocolate company, and we gave golden tickets and brought people out, and people loved it. A lot of times, we just bring these fictional ideas to life, and people love seeing it.”</span></p> <p><span>Donaldson isn’t wrong that people love to experience a facsimile of their favorite fictional worlds. It’s why theme parks are so popular, and you can find an escape room based on all your favorite horror franchises. I’m sure his team will have no shortage of people volunteering as tribute, but I still think that recreating these stories, even if they aren’t actually putting people in deadly situations, involves taking advantage of those in need in order to profit from the theater and spectacle of it all. MrBeast has </span><a href="https://www.beastphilanthropy.org/"><span>used his position to do a lot of good</span></a><span>, but I can’t help feeling like using </span><i><span>The Hunger Games</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Squid Game</span></i><span> as reference points for your real-world game shows just makes everyone involved look like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mrbeast-slur-n-word-clip-2017-controversy-explained-1851612313"><span>caricatures of the sadistic game makers</span></a><span> these dystopian stories are meant to critique.</span></p>

Amon's unique Vault Hunter trait is Forgeskill, which allows him to use abilities like Molten Slam, Firewall, or Double-Edge, depending on the equipped Action Skill when its assigned button is held

equipped)</strong></p><p>Press and hold the Action Skill button to slam a Molten Forgehammer into the ground, dealing incendiary melee damage to enemies in a large area.</p><p><strong>Firewall (Scourge Action Skill equipped)</strong></p><p>Press and hold Action Skill to deploy a Firewall that absorbs enemy projectiles, and grants friendly projectiles that pass through it increased damage and speed. Absorbed damage is converted into Vengeance if Scourge is active. Enemies near Firewall take incendiary status effect damage over time.</p><p><strong>Double-Edge (Crucible Action Skill equipped)</strong></p><p>Press and hold Action Skill to throw a twinned Forgeaxe, dealing cryo melee damage to enemies it passes through and returning to Amon, dealing incendiary melee damage on the way back.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4544946-amon-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544946" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4544946-amon-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544946"></a><figcaption>Amon looks like he can easily shift between defensive and offensive roles.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4544946-amon-2.jpg"></figure><p>Tapping the Action Skill button will result in the following actions, depending on the ability you've chosen for Amon:</p><p><strong>Onslaughter (Calamity skill tree)</strong></p><p>Amon overloads his Forgefist, gaining constant shield regeneration, bonus incendiary damage with guns, and increased movement speed. Pressing the button results in a rocket-punch to an enemy dealing incendiary melee attack damage in a short-ranged cone, and causing enemies--except for bosses--to be staggered if it connects.</p><p><strong>Scourge (Vengeance skill tree)</strong></p><p>Amon equips a Forgeshield that absorbs all frontal damage as Vengeance. Whenever the Vengeance Meter is filled, Forgeshield provides a reduction to damage. Vengeance drains rapidly if it has not been gained recently. Pressing the Action Skill button launches a Forgewave, dealing cryo ordnance damage to enemies it passes through and consuming Vengeance to increase damage dealt.</p><p><strong>Crucible (Cybernetics skill tree)</strong></p><p>This skill has three charges, and it lets Amon ready Forge-axes that can be thrown and picked up off the ground to refund cooldown time. Amon can throw a Flame Axe, dealing incendiary melee damage, or a Frost Axe to deal cryo damage. Enemies damaged by Forge-axes are then primed and will detonate when they die or are damaged by a Forge-Skill, dealing damage to nearby enemies.</p><p>Borderlands 4 launches on September 12 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, and it'll be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-switch-2-release-date-announced-and-its-not-long-after-other-versions/1100-6533344/">coming to Switch 2 a little later on October 3</a>.

The publisher also confirmed legal action taken against several cheat makers.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 5 of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Black Ops 6</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Warzone</a> arrives on August 7, and the update will include the rollout of two PC-based security features: TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot. TPM 2.0 (Trusted Platform Module) is a hardware-based security feature built onto CPUs or motherboards to verify that the PC's boot process has not been tampered with, while Secure Boot makes sure a PC can only load trusted software when Windows starts.</p>

			<p>Developer Oxide Games and publisher Stardock Entertainment have announced Ashes of the Singularity II, a sequel to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-9-7900x3d-3d-v-cache-cpu-appears-in-ashes-of-the-singularity-benchmark/">2016 original</a> that is set to arrive sometime in 2026.</p>



<p>The news came along with an announcement trailer that showed off a cinematic look at the game, but unfortunately did not show off any gameplay. Ashes of the Singularity II continues the story of the first game, with humanity coming together to fight back against a highly sophisticated AI that has overrun most of the Earth.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>Ten years ago, we set a new, literal benchmark for RTS games with massive battles and groundbreaking technology,</em>" says Stardock Entertainment's chief executive officer, Brad Wardell, in a press release. "<em>With Ashes of the Singularity II, we're raising the bar even higher, delivering strategic gameplay depth that RTS fans have always dreamed of.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Obviously, in the first game the number one request was to have a human faction</em>," Wardell continued. "<em>Back then, we just couldn't support having thousands of organic, walking, squishy people in the world and thus had to design in favor of machines. We're really excited to bring the humans into the war and watch how they fare against the massive mechanical armies of the Substrate and the PHC.</em>"</p>

            <p>
Former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a> executive producer Mark Darrah has posted a sprawling video about the development of Anthem, EA and BioWare's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/biowares-anthem-will-finally-shut-down-in-early-2026-just-shy-of-its-seventh-birthday">ill-fated</a> mech <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> shoot-me-do.

<p>
There's a bit of gossip and speculation from Darrah, but it's an engrossing listen, assuming you're not absolutely sick of the tale of how EA's GaaSy ambitions screwed up BioWare. Here are some highlights based on a quick skimplay.</p>
<p>Darrah begins with the completion of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect-3">Mass Effect 3</a>, at which point EA were apparently really hammering home the "single player games are dead" angle, and trying to get BioWare onto live service gaming. It was at this point that Mass Effect 3 game director Casey Hudson pitched Dylan, the early codename for Anthem. EA higher-ups apparently loved the talk of a new approach to multiplayer storytelling, but the Dragon Age and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> teams were, Darrah continues, less than thrilled by the Dylan team's suggestion that BioWare had to move with the times.
</p>
<p>
Darrah himself is ambivalent about Dylan's initial pitch, calling it vague. This vagueness created problems in 2014 when Hudson left the studio, with nobody else quite sure what the game was supposed to be. According to Darrah, too much time was spent at this stage defining the game against the likes of Borderlands and Destiny.
</p>
<p>
In 2016, there were arguments that Dragon Age 4's development team should be reassigned to the Dylan project. Other spats include a fiery response to a particular demo from Patrick Soderlund, CEO of Battlefield developers DICE, and negative feedback from EA to a perceived reduction in the number of Anthem exosuits, or Javelins, based on some WIP figures.
</p>
<p>
As for the name, there was a push to call it Javelins, but EA preferred "Beyond", only to discover that Sony already had a trademark for this. Darrah notes humorously in passing that the original Dragon Age didn't even have dragons when it was given that name.
</p>
<p>
The video brings us up to approximately late 2017, when Darrah himself became involved with Anthem. Look out for the second part down the line. Thanks to <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/mark-darrah-talks-about-the-early-development-of-anthem.1263345/">Resetera</a> for passing this on.

<p>Fortnite’s Chapter 6 Season 4, Shock ‘N Awesome, goes live tomorrow and ahead of that, the developers have revealed all the new additions of this season. </p>



<p>Fortnite’s Power Rangers collaboration was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-power-rangers-collaboration-confirmed-in-new-teaser/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed yesterday</a> through a brand new teaser by Epic Games. The same teaser also revealed that Chapter 6, Season 4 is called Shock ‘N Awesome and will have players dealing with hordes of bugs. The latest blog post provides all the details of the new season, including new POIs, weapons, enemies and more. </p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-chapter-6-season-4-shock-n-awesome-update-details">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 4: Shock ‘N Awesome Update Details </h2>



<p>Bugs have infested Fortnite in the new season, and players will have to stomp and smash this swarm with the O.X.R., the Island’s anti-bug military defence force.</p>



<h3 id="h-new-fortnite-pois">New Fortnite POIs</h3>



<p>Four new POIs have been introduced in the latest Fortnite Season, including The Hive, Swarmy Stash, O.X.R. HQ. and Rangers Ruin. The Hive exhibits signs of high insect activity, and players are bound to encounter a swarm in this area. O.X.R. HQ is where players will find troops stationed in barracks, commanders at battle operations, an OXR Armoury, and more. The Rangers Ruin is a former weapons lab, formerly an O.X.R. base, that was overrun by an infestation. No specific details about Swarmy Stash were revealed. </p>

<h3 id="h-new-fortnite-bug-enemies">New Fortnite Bug Enemies</h3>



<p>There are three types of new bugs Fortnite will introduce in Chapter 6 Season 4, Shock ‘N Awesome, including the Swarmer, Bomber and the Queen. The Swarmer is a bottom-feeder, but it can take you down if not dealt with quickly. Bombers are bugs that are guarding nests. They can burrow and pop up behind the player and also attack with a goop lob from afar. Last, but not least, is the Queen, a massive bug that is taller than most buildings. She can body slam you or even summon more bugs to make your life difficult. </p>

<h3 id="h-new-fortnite-shock-n-awesome-weapons-boons-and-medallions">New Fortnite Shock ‘N Awesome Weapons, Boons and Medallions</h3>



<p>When dealing with hordes of massive bugs, players will need appropriate equipment to take them down, and that’s where O.X.R. comes in. The game now features O.X.R. ranks, and all players start with a C rank and can progress up to S+ rank with their party. Each rank up will provide players with an O.X.R. Drop Pod, which brings a lot of loot and a Super Soldier Boon. </p>



<figure></figure>



<h4 id="h-weapons">Weapons</h4>



<p>There’s a special weapon, the Bug Blaster, which can shoot loose explosive plasma projectiles and deal a heavier attack when charged. The other new item is called Roly Poly, which allows players to roll and bounce around the map or charge it up and unleash a big burst of speed. There are some O.X.R. issued weapons too, including Leadspitter 3000&nbsp;minigun,&nbsp;Sweeper Shotgun,&nbsp;O.X.R. Rifle,&nbsp;Wrecker Revolver, and the laser-guided&nbsp;Swarmstrike&nbsp;rocket launcher. </p>



<p>With this season introducing Power Rangers to Fortnite, we also receive a special themed sidearm, the Blade Blaster. It is a sci-fi energy pistol that can fire in quick-tap mode or charged bursts. The other exotic weapons and items include Eradicator O.X.R. Rifle, Double Trouble, Shock N’ Slow Shockwave Launcher, Marksman Wrecker Revolver and Exotic Slap Berry Fizz. </p>

<h4 id="h-boons">Boons</h4>



<p>Coming to Boons, players will find new sets in O.X.R. chests and Hive Sacs, they can also be purchased from the Armory. There are three standard boons: Agile Aiming, Extended Magazine, and Storm Forecast. Then there are 4 Super Soldier-Ranked Boons, which are exclusive to O.X.R. drop pods. The Super Soldier Boon Rank B provides reduced energy consumption during sprint, Rank A boon provides Rank B abilities with increased reload speed. Rank S provides A and B abilities with reduced weapon recoil and spread, Rank S+ provides A, B and S abilities with increased sprint speed and unlimited energy.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h4 id="h-medallions">Medallions</h4>



<p>When clearing out swarms in certain POIs, players will be able to battle one of three Queen Bugs. Each bug provides a unique mythic weapon and medallion. Check out what each Queen provides at the three POIs below: </p>



<ul>
<li>The Hive’s Queen delivers players with Mythic Enhanced Wrecker Revolver and&nbsp;Surge Medallion, which increases movement speed and gives a burst of speed when sliding. </li>



<li>Ranger’s Ruin Queen provides players with a Mythic Tactical Shotgun and&nbsp;Springleg Medallion, which gives you the ability to double jump, with fall damage immunity. </li>



<li>Demon’s Domain Queen pgives Mythic O.X.R. Assault Rifle and&nbsp;Carapace Medallion&nbsp;which gives 50 Health when you eliminate an opponent, and passively gives 3 Shield per second up to 50 Shield.</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-whirlybird">Whirlybird </h3>



<p>Fortnite’s Shock N’ Awesome season will also introduce the Hammerhead Choppa later in the season. It functions like a helicopter and can briefly hover mid-air when players switch seats to lay down suppressing fire on the other side. </p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-new-blitz-royale-poi">New Blitz Royale POI</h3>



<p>Last but not least is the new Fortnite Blitz Royale POI, which comes with new medallions and mythics. On August 12, players will be able to take flight with Kinetic Ore as the new Oathbound Citadel POI arrives on the map. On August 19, new Medallions, Boons, and select Mythics &amp; Exotics from Shock ‘N Awesome will be added.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2023, a video game called <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dredge-review">Dredge</a> hit a collective nerve with its story of trawling the seas for an increasingly horrible and disturbing catch of fish. One of the people it inspired was horror fan and board game designer <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/114290/judson-cowan" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Judson Cowan</a>, and he set about riffing on its inspiration to deliver a cardboard equivalent, a marriage of theme and delivery as yet untapped on tabletop. </p><div catalogid="38514f7c-d341-458a-a4e6-6515bd2c8acb" id="226461"><div id="226461" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Deep Regrets</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The result is Deep Regrets, and we’ve climbed aboard and sailed it out so we can check whether all’s shipshape and Bristol fashion. We also wanted to see how it compares to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-horror-board-games"><u>top horror board games</u></a> on the market. </p></div><p id="whats-in-the-box"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="What's in the box">What’s in the Box</h2></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/06/pxl-20250729-192418469-1754491160356.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Deep Regrets comes in a small box but it’s heavy with contents. Lifting the lid reveals a number of small player boards. There’s a main one to track the fish swimming in the three different depth levels available to dredge, a port board for when you sail back to dry land to sell your catch and equip your boat, the ocean madness board that tracks each player’s state of mind, and a number of double-sided player boards for tracking the status of your game. The sides are functionally identical, it’s just that one side has a sinister-looking old sea dog and the other side has... an even more sinister-looking old sea dog. That tells you a lot about what kind of game this is going to be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Much of the weight comes from various decks of cards. There are three decks of fish, one for each depth, plus a deck of “dinks,” tiny fish you can gain if your main catch gets away. There are also decks of rods, reels and “supply” that you can buy at port. The biggest deck of all is the deck of regrets which you pick up for undertaking regrettable actions at sea. There’s also a cloth bag of custom dice shaped like fishing floats, various chunky wooden tokens and a metal “fish coin” used to flip and resolve some card effects. Finally there’s a paper pad for tracking your catches in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo</a> variant.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The biggest deck of all is the deck of regrets which you pick up for undertaking regrettable actions at sea.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s hard to overstate just how evocative the visual design of the game is. Everything is decorated with art by the game’s designer, even the inside of the box lid. He’s a talented artist, creating detailed, imaginative visuals that strike a pitch-perfect stylistic balance between fun and creepy. Once you start flipping the fish cards, the chance to see new ones, or re-examining familiar ones for details that you missed becomes a major draw to replay the game alongside the fun of dice-rolling and decision-making.</p><p id="rules-and-how-it-plays"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Rules and how it plays">Rules and How it Plays</h2></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/06/pxl-20250725-101709531-1754491251318.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The game is normally played over six days from Monday to Saturday. Each day starts out with you rolling your clutch of dice and placing them in your fresh pool: you start with three but can gain more, which have higher numbers than your starting dice. You then make one of the game’s key decisions, whether you’ll spend the day at sea or head to port. Everyone starts at sea, so we’ll go through the possible actions as you plough the waves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of your turns at sea involve trying to catch fish. Each depth has three card piles, called shoals, and the card backs indicate whether the card represents a small, medium, or large fish, with bigger fish generally taking larger dice values to catch. You pick which shoal you want to fish in and flip the top card. Some fish have effects when revealed, such as the whiptail stingray, which allows you to reroll one die. All fish have a value in “fishbucks” in one corner and a difficulty value in the other. To catch a fish, you’ve got to spend dice equal to the difficulty. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/06/pxl-20250729-192131139-1754491385922.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">This makes flipping fish a calculated gamble, as it’s possible you won’t have enough dice to reel in whatever horror you’ve hooked. If you can’t, you get to take a dink card as a consolation prize, which generally gives you a small bonus like the shrimp, which reduces the difficulty of a fish by one. In addition, not all fish are created equal. Some have values that are significantly different from their difficulty, while others can have both good or bad effects on you or other players when caught. They also come in two flavors: fair, which are normal, real-world fish, and foul, which are body parts, repulsive mutants, occult creations and worse.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>They come in two flavors: fair, which are normal, real-world fish, and foul, which are body parts, repulsive mutants, occult creations and worse.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">However you fare in the fish lottery, the process is almost always enormously fun. For starters, there’s the big reveal, not only with the anticipation of matching the difficulty against your dice but of seeing what kind of freakish thing you’re up against and enjoying the art. There may be a reveal effect to resolve, many of which affect all players or otherwise mix up the expected catching process. Then, you may have an awkward decision about whether you want to spend multiple dice on it, whether you even want it at all, or whether it’s better to sacrifice a die and take the relative safety of a dink draw instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Spending days at port allows you to sell fish for their value and buy equipment. Rods, reels and supply cards all help your fishing efforts in various ways, and you can also buy additional one-use dice to roll, meaning you can land more and more difficult fish. But be careful with what you sell, because the value of your unsold fish is your score at the end of the game. You can also mount fish into one of three slots while in port, which multiplies their value by two or, in the top “prize catch” slot, three. Choosing which days to spend in port rather than at sea is a key strategic decision in which you’re torn between wanting better fish to sell or mount, and wanting to spend as much time on the waves for a bigger catch.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/06/pxl-20250729-192035419-1754491715291.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Landing foul fish generally leads to you drawing regret cards. Each of these has a numeric value between zero and three as well as a narrative tagline which varies from bleakly funny – “got a bad tattoo” – to seriously sinister – “partook of human flesh.” Depending on the number of regret cards you’ve accumulated, you may go increasingly mad, slowly reducing the value of fair fish, boosting that of foul fish and raising the maximum number of dice you’re allowed to use in a day’s fishing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there’s a major catch. While the number of cards you have is public knowledge, the values on them are not, and the player with the highest total value at the end of the game must discard one of those precious mounted specimens and the multiplier that goes with it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dice aren’t just spent on catching fish but can also be discarded to allow you to fish in deeper waters, which have more difficult targets and a higher proportion of foul fish. This allows you to manipulate an overall strategic curve. You can save dice, stay in safe waters, maximizing the value of your fair fish and resting safe in the knowledge you won’t be the one discarding when the game ends. Or you can dredge the depths, catching more and more appalling abominations, revelling in the horror and crossing your fingers that you’ll have fewer bleak regrets than your fellow fishermen when the game ends. Or try to chart a course between the two extremes, adjusting carefully depending on other player’s decisions.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/06/pxl-20250729-192659428-1754492137500.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">On a tactical level, the game gathers momentum towards the finale. Initial fishing trips are fairly bland but as you begin to gain dinks, equipment, and a collection of fish, some of which can be eaten for an immediate ability, you can start to look for combo effects between the different cards. This snowballs as you get more and more of each, meaning you can pull off some pretty spectacular fishing turns late in the game, once you’ve learned to spot them. But each of these is laden with various risk vs reward decisions, most obviously that eating a fish means you no longer benefit from its value. In particular, once the regret deck runs out, additional regrets must be taken from other players, making for some very swingy turns. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While there are definite strategic and tactical choices of this kind in the game, it’d be overselling things to make too much of them. Fundamentally, this is a push-your-luck game where you’re eternally hoping for the highest dice rolls, the best fish card reveals, and for the fish-coin flips to always go your way. Experience and planning help, but anyone around the table can win, with that hidden regret value being particularly punishing. This cuts both ways, as it can make the game feel over-long at high player counts, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games"><u>hardcore strategy hounds</u></a> may find the game too lightweight to satisfy, but newer players will enjoy rolling with the punches in the knowledge that they’re in with a chance to win right up until the bitter end.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/06/pxl-20250606-212534925-1754492525443.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p id="where-to-buy"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Where to buy">Where to Buy</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/92x8de?object_uuid=8372a7e5-a6bd-4935-b2a4-c3482f52e613&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QxAyKm?object_uuid=8372a7e5-a6bd-4935-b2a4-c3482f52e613&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Game Nerdz</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/9wRypK?object_uuid=8372a7e5-a6bd-4935-b2a4-c3482f52e613&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Tettix</a></li></ul></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Aug 6, 2025 4:12 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Given that our real-world deep ocean trenches are full of nightmarish life forms, horror fishing isn’t an especially new idea in games. However, rarely has it been delivered with such a delightful balance of horror and humor, nor strategy and randomness. The result is a game that’s simply fun, thanks to its engaging artwork and push-your-luck mechanics, and what it fails to deliver in demanding strategy, it makes up for in thrilling moments and entertaining discoveries. Your sinister fisherman alter-ego might be piling up the regrets from time spent on the waves, but you’ll sail home to port with little buyer’s remorse at all.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/deep-regrets-board-game-review-like-bringing-dredge-to-the-tabletop]]></content:encoded>

In fact, there are a total of four precons available for fans of Magic’s most popular format. Even better yet, Amazon has finally dropped the price of three of the decks and a bundle that includes all four.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Amazon Finally Discounts Final Fantasy MTG Commander Decks</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Naturally, each of the decks focuses on a different entry in the series, and while I personally would’ve loved an Eikon-focused deck inspired by Final Fantasy 16, the ones we get are focused on the sixth, seventh, tenth, and fourteenth entries instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As has been the case,<a href="https://zdcs.link/z7OxDL?object_uuid=40216374-35ea-4248-a13a-293b662e6f95&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u> Final Fantasy 6’s Revival Trance is under MSRP</u></a>, and it’s now down to a new low of $50.36 (according to price tracker CamelCamelCamel).</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Final Fantasy x Magic: The Gathering - Commander Decks Reveal</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Also at all-time lows are <a href="https://zdcs.link/QmnyE6?object_uuid=40216374-35ea-4248-a13a-293b662e6f95&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Final Fantasy 10’s Counter Blitz</u></a> (now $64.18), and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QObkWD?object_uuid=40216374-35ea-4248-a13a-293b662e6f95&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Final Fantasy 14’s Scions and Spellcraft</u></a> at $60.51.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sadly, <a href="https://zdcs.link/Q47KZD?object_uuid=40216374-35ea-4248-a13a-293b662e6f95&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Final Fantasy 7’s Limit Break deck is still sitting at $89.84</u></a>, which is more than MSRP.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> MARVEL Tokon: Fighting Souls  - PS5 Closed Playable Beta Announcement Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>That's an ambitious goal for the Marvel fighting game, but not entirely impossible. For comparison, Capcom has supported its last three mainline Street Fighter games for several years after launch with gameplay overhauls and new characters, and Arc's Guilty Gear Strive has regularly been updated with new characters since it launched in 2021--including Lucy from Cyberpunk: Edgerunners,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/guilty-gear-strive-official-lucy-character-gameplay-reveal-trailer-season-pass-4/2300-6466227/" data-ref-id="2300-6466227"> who joins the game later this month</a>.</p><p>The challenge here lies in keeping interest in the game alive, as it'll take more than just an influx of new characters on a regular basis to keep fans interested, no matter how good the gameplay is. Marvel's parent company, Disney, likely won't pass up the opportunity to license the IP out to another studio for a different fighting game, if the pitch is solid enough. A lot can also change in the span of a decade, but you have to admire just how confident Sony is about this upcoming game.</p><p>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls doesn't have a set release date yet, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-closed-beta-how-to-sign-up/1100-6533659/">but you can sign up for the upcoming closed beta right now</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-marvel-fighting-game-is-coming-from-arc-system-works/1100-6532114/">First revealed in June</a>, the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-every-character/2900-6640/">current roster includes iconic characters</a>--Captain America, Doctor Doom, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Ms. Marvel, Star Lord, and Storm--and with enough time, that roster could grow into a pantheon of costumed brawlers. The goal to support the game for years to come could also allow for several surprise characters to be added to the game, like Taskmaster, Nova, or Uncle Ben--if he's given a one-hit health bar.</p>

The new studio debuted today, with a stated focus on "advancing the rhythm game genre."</p><p>If RedOctane conjures memories of plastic guitars for you, it should; RedOctane was the moniker for brothers Charles and Kai Huang's rhythm game studio, one half of the partnership (alongside Harmonix Music Systems) that brought Guitar Hero to the world. According to the studio's press release, the new RedOctane Games will have Charles and Kai Huang on a special advisory board. Simon Ebejer, the production director on several Guitar Hero games at Neversoft, is also at the helm as studio head.</p><p>"Rhythm games are about more than just gameplay they’re about feel, flow, and connection to the music and to each other," said Ebejer in a statement. "RedOctane Games is our way of giving back to a genre that means so much to us, while pushing it forward in new and exciting directions."</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SMpdAXrO3tk"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SMpdAXrO3tk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>RedOctane Games is apparently already underway with its rhythm-focused goals, as the team has already gone through pre-production and entered production on its debut rhythm-based game, which will be announced later this year.</p><p>The new RedOctane Games exists within Freemode, one of the Embracer Group's subsidiaries, alongside the likes of Limited Run Games and Middle-Earth Enterprises.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/06/redoctane-games-is-a-new-rhythm-game-studio-founded-by-guitar-hero-veterans]]></content:encoded>

Xbox Insiders can start testing a preview of the Gaming Copilot integration in the Game Bar today, and Microsoft is planning “further optimizations” for this new feature on the upcoming Xbox Ally handhelds.</p><p>“Gaming Copilot knows what you’re playing and understands your Xbox activity to provide an experience centered around you,” <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/06/gaming-copilot-beta-begins-rolling-out-to-xbox-insiders-on-game-bar-today/">says Taylor O’Malley, principal program manager at Xbox</a>. You’ll be able to ask the Copilot for help with the game you’re playing, as well as access achievements and play history. The Gaming Copilot will be available as a widget inside the Game Bar, and it includes a voice mode so you can talk to the AI assistant without having to alt + tab out of a game.</p><p>The Gaming Copilot will even use screenshots of your game to help answer questions about it, without you having to describe things in detail. That could be as simple as asking “what am I looking at?” while facing a boss in a game, and Copilot should respond with details about the boss and perhaps even methods to take it down.</p><p>This is the first step in Microsoft’s vision to turn its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/628666/microsoft-xbox-copilot-for-gaming">Xbox Copilot into an AI gaming coach</a>. Microsoft is positioning the Gaming Copilot as a sidekick, one that will accompany you through games and offer tips and information about game worlds. Microsoft has previously demonstrated using the Gaming Copilot with <em>Overwatch 2</em>, letting it recommend good hero picks to complement the rest of the team.</p><p>This early preview is only available in English and limited to the US, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Singapore, and a few other regions. Microsoft isn’t making it available in the UK or any other European markets yet. It’s planning to release the Gaming Copilot in additional regions at a later date, but it’s not clear yet when exactly that will happen.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/719668/microsoft-xbox-gaming-copilot-windows-game-bar-beta-test]]></content:encoded>

Amon can attack or defend as needed, ready to pulverize enemies with a Forgehammer, slice them in twain with Forgeaxes, soak up damage with a Forgeshield, and much, much more.</p></blockquote><p><em>Borderlands 4</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,047 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,640 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [23,843 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/borderlands-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a> on September 12, followed by <a title="Platforms > Switch 2 [299 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch-2">Switch 2</a> on October 3.</p><p>Watch the trailer below.</p><!-- AD: content -->

The expansion will once again have three different versions--Base, Heroic, and Epic--and each one will grant housing early access.</p><p dir="ltr">As for when that early-access period will start, the bundles don't say, but Blizzard is also continuing the controversial practice of selling a three-day head start to the expansion itself for those who purchase the $90 Epic Edition of the expansion. Blizzard first offered a three-day early-access period with The War Within, WoW's current expansion.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4544921-1233557.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544921" data-ratio="0.98605577689243" data-width="1004" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4544921-1233557.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544921"></a><figcaption>A look at WoW: Midnight's leaked preorder bundles (via Wowhead).</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4544921-1233557.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Epic Edition additionally includes beta access and a number of exclusive cosmetics, including a Midnight Housing Bundle with light- and void-themed housing decorations. It's unclear if players will be able to earn these decorations or variations of them through gameplay, or if purchasing them is the only way to earn them.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard has not yet commented on the leaked preorder bundles and we still don't know exactly when Midnight will release. At BlizzCon 2023, Warcraft executive producer Chris Metzen said Blizzard is looking to release new WoW expansions on a faster schedule than the MMORPG's usual two-year cycle. Midnight seems to be lining up with that approach, and could possibly release early next year, though that is still speculation. We will know more at Gamescom, where Blizzard is set to reveal the expansion in full.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/anthem/">Anthem</a> infamously flopped upon its arrival way back in 2019, and at the start of next year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/eas-anthem-shutting-down-entirely-will-be-unplayable-starting-next-year/1100-6532956/">it will no longer be playable</a>. Now, in a lengthy YouTube video, former BioWare executive producer Mark Darrah has spoken about how the game came to be, and how it got its shaky start. He explained that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mass-effect/" data-ref-id="5000-25502">Mass Effect</a> director Casey Hudson was not only pitching a new game, but a fresh vision for BioWare.</p><p>"What Casey is pitching to EA is BioWare as a new thing," Darrah said. "It’s BioWare as a new thing. It's BioWare doing storytelling but doing it in a live service, always online, brand-new business model, brand-new way of thinking about the way we tell storytelling."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_QY8F8z_4c" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9_QY8F8z_4c" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">According to Darrah, a lot of what Hudson initially conceived didn't really make it into the end result, but it's "why Anthem was able to generate this much momentum within the organization, because what Casey was essentially pitching was, 'What if it's a BioWare game but it could do FIFA numbers?'"</p><p dir="ltr">The former executive producer even went as far as saying that Hudson and his team weren't just pitching a game, but a new BioWare. He spoke of a video he believes was "intended to be shown to executives," that was "very much presented in, if you imagine the typical early vision video from a slick tech company, it’s very much like that video."</p><p dir="ltr">Darrah continued, "In this video, however, it talks about how a lot of what BioWare has done in the past is old-fashioned and its time has come and gone and that BioWare needs to change and BioWare needs to be something different for what I believe to be the originally intended audience. This is exactly what they want to hear. Executives want to hear that BioWare believes that it needs to change, that BioWare needs to be something different. This is what they wanted to hear in this time period."</p><p dir="ltr">Anthem was being pitched as a game that could continuously bring in revenue at a time when live-service games were gaining steam, but ultimately, it struggled to come together. Hudson himself left BioWare during development, something Darrah noted as a big reason why the game struggled to find an identity.</p><p dir="ltr">Hudson pitched it as "the future of storytelling", but no one still at the studio when he left really understood what that meant. "It’s not even clear if Casey knew what that means," Darrah said. "But even if he did, he’s not around to clarify that statement, to be involved in the process of discovering what that actually means."</p><p dir="ltr">Darrah also said that he would often argue in favour of delaying Anthem to give it more time, even suggesting that Dragon Age 4 should be released first. This obviously didn't happen, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard/" data-ref-id="5000-490222">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> only releasing last year.</p><p dir="ltr">Darrah's video doesn't answer every question about why Anthem went wrong, and his perspective is only one side of it, but he did share his intention to make more videos detailing the game's production in the future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Developer Reikon Games and publisher Deep Silver have announced that upcoming sci-fi action FPS Metal Eden has a new release date, and will arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on September 2, 2025.</p>



<p>Metal Eden was initially set to arrive earlier this year on <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-eden-new-fps-from-reikon-games-launches-on-may-6/">May 6, 2025</a>, with a demo even being made available a little less than a month ahead of that May release date. A little more than a week after the demo went live, however, the game was delayed, with a new release window set for <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-eden-has-been-delayed-now-launching-sometime-in-summer-2025/">sometime during summer 2025</a>. </p>



<p>According to Reikon Games, the delay was meant to give the studio time to respond to feedback it had received from players who checked out the demo, as it said at the time that it "<em>saw some clear areas where we can improve</em>."</p>



<p>Now, it seems like Reikon is confident that it has fixed many of the issues players were noting with the demo, and that Metal Eden is ready for prime-time in less than a month from the time of this writing.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>I checked out the Metal Eden demo as part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-next-fest-june-2025-the-demos-i-loved-that-you-should-spend-the-weekend-playing/">June's Steam Next Fest</a>, and at a time where there are hundreds of demos made available for players to try, recommended it as one of the demos to play before the Next Fest has ended due to the fast-paced action that reminded me of Ghostrunner but with more of a ranged-combat focus compared to Ghostrunner's melee combat.</p>

            <p>Stardock and Oxide Games have announced Ashes Of The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/singularity">Singularity</a> II - or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ashes-of-the-singularity-2">Ashes Of The Singularity 2</a>, as people who hate unnecessary extra keyboard presses may prefer - sequel to the sci-fi real-time strategy game Brendy called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ashes-of-the-singularity-review">"gorgeous, but plain"</a>, adding "there's nothing here that hasn't been done before and done better". The new RTS aims to improve that verdict by introducing: humans. It's a bold strategy, Cotton, but perhaps it'll work out for them.</p><!--more-->
<p>"Obviously, in the first game, the number one request was to have a human faction," observes Stardock CEO and sometime <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Wardell">Gamergator</a> Brad Wardell in the announcement release. "Back then, we just couldn't support having thousands of organic, walking, squishy people in the world and thus had to design in favor of machines." The battling bipeds will join the returning robot and bionic post-human factions in continent-sized scrums encompassing thousands of units. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>The game will release in 2026, a decade after the first game, and in a show of pure commercial poetry, its story also takes place a decade after the events of the first. Remember to cite this next time somebody tells you that games can't be art.</p>
<p>The new chapter puts you in charge of the United Earth Forces, "a powerful human alliance forged between NATO, China, and Russia, determined to reclaim Earth's territories - including Australia and Africa - as well as vital outposts on planets and moons across the solar system, all previously overtaken by relentless AI and formidable Post-Humans." We'll prise the Sydney Opera House from their stinking cyborg fingers, and paint the surface of Pluto with those quarrelsome brains-in-jars.</p>
<p>Ashes Of The Singularity 2 is the work of a "significantly expanded" dev team, and will feature co-operative and competitive multiplayer together with a skirmish mode. There's a lot more backstory on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/intense%20skirmishes%20against%20intelligent%20computer%20opponents">Steam page</a>, together with the announcement that "this is a game that celebrates your strategic skills and rewards you for understanding that logistics, planning and terrain matter." Total Annihilation diehards rejoice, possibly. "We're determined to make the BIG both simple and fun," adds <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3499790/view/547868787733430463?l=english">a dev diary</a> that delves just a little deeper into the base-building aspect.</p>
<p>After being kicked around by Brendy, the original Ashes fell afoul of Fraser Brown (RPS in PCGamer). In a feature about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/learning-to-love-imbalance-in-strategy-games">learning to love imbalance in strategy games</a>, he noted that "its bland campaign reveals its focus: it serves only to get people into the multiplayer component." Did you play the multiplayer? I have to confess, this game passed me by.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-humans-are-revolting-in-ashes-of-the-singularity-2-the-latest-planet-scale-rts-from-oxide-games]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><i><span>Spider-Man: Brand New Day </span></i><span>just started filming this month in Glasgow. Marvel’s team turned the Scottish city </span><a href="https://x.com/Clyde1News/status/1951237551877996843"><span>into a stand-in for NYC</span></a><span> so Tom Holland could swing around and do sick flips while wearing a new red-and-blue suit. Over the weekend, Marvel and Sony released a teaser video of Holland in the new suit, and it’s giving “back to basics.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="SPIDER-MAN: BRAND NEW DAY - Tom Holland New Suit Reveal" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vsn7sVxCq1M?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>At a glance, that probably doesn’t seem like a big deal. He’s wearing a Spider-Man suit that looks like plenty of others. If you’ve been around Marvel fans long enough, however, you’ll find that people have very strong opinions on costuming, especially as the MCU movies have become so reliant on CG that some actors </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BhkdYGJF4k0/"><span>will play out scenes in motion-tracking tech suits</span></a><span> instead of what you’ll eventually see them wearing on screen. Spider-Man has </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/spiderman-2-peter-parker-best-suits-playstation-5-1850950369"><span>so many different looks</span></a><span> across comics, movies, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-spider-man-2-review-ps5-venom-miles-morales-1850929271"><span>video games</span></a><span>, and television shows that fans of the web slinger love to argue about the most minute details in each appearance. Now, there are a lot of set pictures and videos being taken by passersby in Glasgow that show Holland and his stunt doubles swinging around in the full suit, and they’re making even those who doubted the suit believers.</span></p> <p><span>As some viewers have pointed out in the trailer’s comments section, Holland’s suit looks like an homage to those worn by Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, the previous Spider-Man actors who both appear in </span><i><span>No Way Home</span></i><span> back in 2021. The raised webbing is a big part of what made those suits distinctive, but that’s not the only element of the design that seems to draw from the outfits of prior Peters. The spider symbol is much larger than it was on the Tony Stark-developed suits Holland’s Peter has worn throughout his movies, but also looks more practically made rather than leaning into the high-tech maximalism of some of the later suits in </span><i><span>Infinity War</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>No Way Home</span></i><span>. Since </span><i><span>No Way Home </span></i><span>ended with Peter losing his connection to the rest of the MCU via Doctor Strange making the world forget him, he has to go back to making his own suits rather than relying on Stark tech. His making something that pays tribute to the Spider-Men who helped him save the world, while also going to something homemade, is a nice touch.</span></p>

 <p><span>All of that is cool from a character design standpoint, but it’s also really nice to see Peter wearing something vibrant and comic-accurate. That has caught a lot of fans’ attention, as the set photos and videos that are sprouting up online show that the suit looks great in motion as Holland swings through Fake New York.
