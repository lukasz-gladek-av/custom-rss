			<p>Sometimes a game doesn’t need an engrossing story or compelling main characters. Sometimes, you just want to go from virtual arena to virtual arena and take out enemies with an assortment of weapons, tools and abilities. This is what Deadlink offers. It is a roguelike first-person shooter set in a cyberpunk world where corporations are more powerful than governments, and have the violent means to hold onto that power. You are a brain in a jar that can be transferred to different combat shells, using their skills in a VR setting to test their capabilities against those corpo assets.</p>
<p><iframe title="Deadlink - Console Launch Trailer (PS5/Xbox Series)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bZd4WHh0VAs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>From the off, you can see Deadlink has a lot of depth to it. You’ll be repeating runs to earn experience and points, allowing you to unlock new skills and abilities while making progress across levels to unlock the other three ‘shells’ to shove your brain into. The default Soldier shell is not all it’s cracked up to be, and while it suits the first area it is the least fun to use. It comes equipped with a shotgun and rocket launcher, while the abilities include a rappel that can hook onto surfaces and enemies, and a Scrambler that marks and staggers foes. The Hunter shell is more entertaining to use, coming equipped with a Hand Cannon and Arc Cannon, as well as the translocator ability, which swaps your position with a normal enemy as well as marking and stunning them. The next shell is the Decoy which leaves behind a hologram that enemies target while you stay invisible for a bit, but it’s far from being the most fun to use.</p>


<p>That title goes to the Engineer, which comes equipped with a Gauss automatic rifle and a grenade launcher. The Engineer’s deeply enjoyable abilities include being able to deploy a turret, and use a wormlink that can link to enemies marking and incapacitating them. Finally, there’s the Juggernaut, armed with a sawed-off shotgun and a flak cannon, with a Graviton Punch ability which can destroy some enemies in one hit, and Stray Redirector which makes the shell invulnerable for a bit, but sacrifices movement speed. While I did experiment with all the shells, it was Engineer I kept going back to, though Hunter, Juggernaut, and Soldier all offered something different to enjoy.</p>


<p>The combat shells are just one small part of what Deadlink offers. Once you’ve selected your shell, you’ll eventually have three modes open up. The Campaign challenges you to move through four stages, each made up of rooms and with a boss waiting at the end. Time Attack offers courses that will test your reactions, and there’s the Extant Existence mode which is an unlimited wave mode, where you try to survive against enemies for as long as possible. Unlike many Roguelikes, the rooms themselves are set so you can learn enemy spawn patterns, but the challenge will always be different due to your implants. Implants and room transitions is where the Roguelike elements of Deadlink come in.</p>
<p>Deadlink’s implant system is the anchor of the Roguelike, making &nbsp;you consider their strategies on every run. As you progress through each arena you may get the chance to equip an implant, or make adjustments to weapons and the shell. These can be anything from adding fire or toxic damage to your gun, making your abilities more powerful, or improving the amount of health and shield you have. You won’t know what implant will be offered so you really are coming up with your approach on the fly. The implants themselves have different tiers, and need different amounts of power, which you can see in the equip screen. Legendary implants require the most power as they offer the best advantages, for example, providing a combat drone to assist.</p>
<p>The power management is easy to figure out, as rows on menu show how much battery power is needed for a slot to be used. Furthermore, implants are split into active and passive. Active implants demand action being taken by you, like activating an ability, or breaking the C-balls that are floating around the arena, while passive implants are always on in the background. There are dozens of implants to find and unlock, with more being made available as you level up. I have to say, my best run came from having a majority of passive implants, as then I could just focus more on running and gunning.</p>

<p>The levelling up system has its own depth with upgrades available for individual shells, as well as general upgrades that improve health, shields, unlock new tiers of weapon mods, upgrades, and more permanent buffs or abilities, such as the defibrillator which will revive you once on a run. Some upgrades require experience points to unlock, while others require Turing Tokens, with the better ones requiring both. Experience is earned through playing the levels, while Turing Tokens can be found as one of the offers at the end of an arena, or through defeating bosses.</p>
<p>All of these in-depth systems of implants and levelling feed into the main experience. Deadlink only has four overall stages, split into combat arenas, but with the challenge you will not get past the first two, Tora and Watts, without significant experience and upgrades. The action is very fast paced, and you are almost always moving to avoid incoming attacks while firing off your own, but it does start to feel a bit repetitive as you go through the same levels trying to move further. There are no surprises waiting for you in the initial runs most of the time, though occasionally you will need to survive for 45 seconds, which isn’t a huge challenge, or break corrupt C-Balls. To unlock the higher difficulties you also need to complete runs on the lower difficulty, which does give something to aim for but also risks you burning out.</p>

Arrowead Game Studios has detailed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-review">Helldivers 2</a>'s latest Premium Warbond. It's called Freedom's Flame and promises new fire-themed armaments and other treats when it launches alongside the bug-splattering, bot-bothering live-service shooter's previously announced "biggest ever update" next Tuesday, 6th August.
</p>
<p>
"Incinerate everything standing in your path with new weaponry almost too hot to handle," Arrowhead exclaims <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/30/new-helldivers-2-freedoms-flame-warbond-burns-bright-on-august-8/">on the PlayStation Blog</a>. "Survive the heat of battle with lifesaving armour; and burn brightly across the cosmos with fresh emotes, capes, and skins."
</p>
<p>
If it's <em>specifics</em> you want though, Freedom's Flame includes the SG-451 Cookout as a new primary weapon capable of unleashing a "burst of incendiary phosphorus pellets" at enemies. It also features the FLAM-66 Torcher lightweight flamethrower as a second primary.

<p>
As for secondary weapons, there's the P-72 Crisper pocket flamethrower - essentially a handgun that can spew fire over short distances - and it's joined by the Fiery Drop – Firebomb Hellpods on the booster front. "Scorch the earth (and anything else) below," Arrowhead explains, "as you touch down with attitude and ignite the dropsite."
</p>
<p>
Freedom's Flame also brings two more armour sets - the blood-red I-09 Heatseeker and the silica fibre foam I-102 Draconaught - while the new Inflammable! armour passive grants 75 percent damage resistance to fire. Other new Warbond unlocks include the Fire Safety Officer title, and the Safety Orange skin for the Shuttle, Hellpod, and Exosuit.
</p>
<p>
Emote-wise, there's the Big Stretch, Deep Reflection, and Thoracic Collision Exultation Manoeuvre Co-emote, and cape fans get the Purifying Eclipse to swish about in. And finally, there's The Breach card, commemorating the final mission of the 361st Freedom's Flame, which saw the squad deployed into the heart of a Supervolcano - for freedom!
</p>
<p>
All the above is available to anyone that coughs up the Super Credits required to purchase the Freedom’s Flame Warbond when it releases on 6th August - which also happens to be the day Helldivers 2's hotly anticipated free <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-biggest-update-yet-announced-with-higher-difficulty-new-bugs-and-more">Escalation of Freedom update</a> arrives.
</p>
<p>
Described as the game's "biggest update yet", it introduces the likes of new mission objectives and bigger enemy outposts, a new Combat Rating 10 difficulty, plus new enemies including the Impaler, Spore Charger, Terminid Alpha Commander, and Rocket Tank. Players can also expect a makeover for swamp worlds, and, finally, changes intended to deal with grief kicking. You can <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/23/helldivers-2s-biggest-update-yet-escalation-of-freedom-drops-august-6/?sf274009068=1">read a bit more about all that on the PlayStation Blog</a>.

Aren’t they exactly the same?</p><p>Well, yes. But technically no.</p><p>Both of these versions of <em>FF14 </em>function almost identically by default. But perhaps most importantly, <strong>the Steam version of </strong><em><strong>FF14 </strong></em><strong>will only recognize expansions that are purchased through Steam</strong>.

For many people, this may be nothing more than a novelty. However, <strong>depending on the country you live in, you may wind up paying less for a <em>FF14 </em>subscription through the Steam Wallet due to how Steam calculates regional pricing</strong>. For example, players in Brazil can typically save a significant chunk of money per month by purchasing subscriptions via the Steam Wallet.</p><p>Additionally, while both the Windows and Steam versions of the game will run on Steam Deck, the Steam version will naturally require a bit less setup to launch by default.</p><p>For players in North America and Europe, you’ll typically find the base game and its expansions on sale more often if you purchase the general Windows version. Just keep in mind that <strong>the Steam and Windows versions of the game are mutually exclusive, so buying one will lock you out of the other</strong>. Neither option is wholesale better than the other, so weigh the pros and cons and decide which version is right for you.</p><h2 id="h3092"><a id="expansions"></a>What if you purchase the expansions on one platform but only the base game on the other?</h2><p>In the event that you don’t want to totally invest in purchasing <em>FF14 </em>and its expansions on a secondary platform, you <em>can </em>still play the game in this state with your current account. However, you naturally can’t warp to zones that you don’t “own” on that platform, even if they still show up as fast travel destinations. Additionally, you’ll lack the ability to earn EXP on jobs that have exceeded the level cap available to you.</p><figure id="" data-id="f0f6d7c10c1210280e2f670dd4b22fcd" data-recommend-id="image://f0f6d7c10c1210280e2f670dd4b22fcd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1484" data-height="317" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A warning sign in FF14 tells the player they don't have access to certain expansions." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A warning sign in FF14 tells the player they don't have access to certain expansions." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f0f6d7c10c1210280e2f670dd4b22fcd" data-recommend-id="image://f0f6d7c10c1210280e2f670dd4b22fcd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1484" data-height="317" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A warning sign in FF14 tells the player they don't have access to certain expansions." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>That said, you can somewhat circumvent the limitations you’d typically find by not owning the game’s expansions.

Fartbuckle appears to be an NPC the dungeon master suddenly introduced at a climactic moment, where the party was in life-threatening danger, so they could prove their worth. Boy, did they do it.</p><p>Tumbleweed2319’s post is, in a word, epic. It’s composed of a bunch of illustrations, beginning with the <em>D&amp;D </em>party despairing at being on the verge of getting wiped by an encounter with a magic crystal. Just as everything seems lost, the DM brings up a goblin companion named Fartbuckle, and just as the realization of what’s about to happen hits the players, the goblin jumps in the way of a fatal attack. The final moments of the video show Fartbuckle being blasted to bits, and with his last breath he says, “I…save…friends…Fartbuckle…is…happy.” Cut, end of scene, cue the waterworks.</p><p>As dramatic as the events of the video are, I think what’s really made it take off is its triumphant score. The post, which is set to a new Childish Gambino song named “Lithonia,” feels like a heroic climax. Though the song begins on very airy synths, it eventually picks up the pace with a backing piano before erupting into a guitar-heavy anthemic riff.</p><p>As Fartbuckle makes his sacrifice to save his friends, Gambino growls the line, “I feel liberated,” and the lyrics could not feel more intrinsically tied to the actions on screen, which is of course completely accidental.

Sometimes, I’ll like one cat video and get on what I affectionately call CatTok, where TikTok believes I’m part of a cat-loving community of users that needs to see every cat video ever made. Every now and then, I’ll wind up on BookTok, and then quickly try to escape it. My absolute favorite is FoodTok, because then the algorithm serves me up local New York eateries with incredible-looking food.</p><p>This time around though, I had informally been inducted into FartbuckleTok, which was filled with similar animatics reinterpreting the brave goblin’s last moments, and all set to “Lithonia.” And just like that, a meme was born. Other videos I saw featured some animation about Fartbuckle, or a video of someone pretending to cry and mourn the loss of Fartbuckle, a character nobody knew existed a week prior.</p><p>The Fartbuckle trend has become a celebration of the trope of the noble sacrifice from the most unexpected and meager characters. Fartbuckle <em>was </em>kind of no one until he took one for the team, and because nobody expected it, they didn’t expect to grieve him. The beat draws an uncanny parallel to how grief manages to come from unexpected places, and how it makes one appreciate things and people they might’ve taken for granted. Evidently, it’s striking an especially resonant chord with folks who are now grafting the Fartbuckle archetype and meme onto other properties and characters, such as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tag/elden-ring&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tag/elden-ring"><em>Elden Ring</em></a></span><em> </em>and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://v&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://v/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Final Fantasy XIV Online</em></a></span><em>.</em></p><p>To make things even better, Glover, who’s terminally online despite his repeated ire for the internet and all things relating to social media, has even shared his own post about Fartbuckle. Clearly, he’s aware his song has now become synonymous with the goblin, and though he may not understand exactly why, it doesn’t seem to have stopped him from endorsing it. Long live, Fartbuckle.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The patch notes include weapon balancing for both games, and one of Season 5's new weapon attachments has been restricted in multiplayer's Ranked Play mode.</p><p dir="ltr">For Modern Warfare 3, the update includes a major buff for the COR-45 pistol. The COR-45 now has an 88% increase to the base gun's fire rate. Two of the weapon's popular triggers have been adjusted as well. The XRK TR9 trigger action attachment now has a decreased rate-of-fire penalty from -25% to -15%, and the XRK Lightning Fire trigger action has a decreased rate-of-fire benefit from 25% to 22%.</p>

<p dir="ltr">A small change is made to how players can customize the attachments on the RAM-9 submachine gun. The Bruen Heavy Support Grip underbarrel attachment is no longer able to be equipped on the gun without a compatible barrel attachment.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 5's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-unlock-new-season-5-weapon-attachments-in-cod-modern-warfare-3-and-warzone/1100-6525298/" data-ref-id="1100-6525298">new Quartermaster Suppressor</a> has quickly become a popular attachment for reducing a weapon's recoil, but this option is now restricted in Modern Warfare 3's Ranked Play mode.</p><p dir="ltr">The patch notes also address a stability issue in Zombies mode, which previously caused some players to encounter an inventory timeout error.</p><p dir="ltr">The Warzone side of the update is much smaller, with one of the most-notable changes being a nerf to the popular Superi 46 submachine gun. The maximum damage range is decreased from 13.97 to 12.7 meters. The developer also says the gun's mid-damage range has been removed, and the weapon's minimum damage of 25 now starts at 25.4 meters instead of 34.3 meters.</p><p dir="ltr">Other battle royale weapon changes include the same changes to the COR-46 and RAM-9 as mentioned above for multiplayer.</p><p dir="ltr">Warzone's in-game scoreboard was broken at the start of Season 5, but the patch notes confirm the issue is fixed and players should once again be able to see the scoreboard or stats tab when opening the Tac-Map.</p><p dir="ltr">The full patch notes for <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/07/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-season-5-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Modern Warfare 3</a> and <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/07/call-of-duty-mwiii-warzone-season-5-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Warzone</a> can be seen below, as shared by Activision.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 5 launched on July 24 with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/see-call-of-duty-season-5s-new-weapons-wwe-skins-blackcell-items-and-more-from-the-battle-pass/2900-5628/">new battle pass and WWE crossover</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/30/bo-path-of-the-teal-lotus-console-updates-in-flux-due-to-humble-games-layoffs<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus launched to generally solid reviews on July 18, but those playing the hand-drawn action platformer on consoles will have to wait longer for any post-launch updates. Developer Squid Shock Studios revealed that last week's sudden&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/humble-games-devs-told-company-is-shutting-down">closure of publisher Humble Games</a> has adversely affected its ability to provide timely support to those versions of the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5u5ptgu1PRU" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>In a statement posted to <a href="https://x.com/squidshock/status/1817973044826226968?s=46">Twitter</a>, Squid Shock Studios states that Humble Games' apparent closure last week, which saw its entire 36-person staff laid off by owner Ziff Davis in what it calls a “restructuring,” has adversely affected its ability to provide post-launch support for the console versions of Bō. The studio states that this is due to the game’s porting and QA support being tied to its deal with Humble. The PC version doesn't appear to be affected, with the studio currently working on updates for that version. Here’s Squid Shock Studios’ full statement:</p>



<p>We want to give you an update on Bo: Path of the Teal Lotus. We’re really proud of how the launch went and it has been great hearing all of your feedback on our game.</p>

<p>That being said, our launch hasn’t been without its challenges. Most of you will know that our publisher, Humble Games, has effectively shut down, laying off all 35 team members. This took us completely by surprise and, for a small development team like us, it was a critical blow to our post-launch support.</p>

<p>We are now in a difficult situation when it comes to updating the console ports, as both Porting and QA Support was tied into our deal with Humble. We are actively pursuing all available avenues to allow us to roll out updates to console versions, but we regret to say this may take some time to put in place.</p>

<p>We just want to reassure players that we will get this resolved. We are working on updates for the PC version and we want to assure you that these updates and fixes will come to consoles in the future.</p>

<p>Thank you for your understanding and support.</p>

<p>Given the number of games Humble published, both released and upcoming, this likely isn’t the only game or studio to have this kind of wrench thrown into the works due to the sudden layoffs. If you're planning on picking up&nbsp;Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus, PC seems like the best way to go for the foreseeable future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus is inspired by Japanese folklore, with players controlling a warrior named&nbsp;Bō who descends from Heaven to fulfill an ancient prophecy. Armed with his shapeshifting Bō staff, players traverse a dreamlike, Metroidvania-inspired world battling monsters.&nbsp;Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus is available now for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Revenant has released a previously unseen cinematic of Phoenix Labs’ canceled Game ‘Project Dragon’, which was set to be called ‘Everhaven’.</p>



<p>The game was canceled earlier this year after three years of development and internal struggles to save the game. But as a part of the game’s cancelation, Pheonix Lab’s lifted the projects NDA’s, meaning that footage and images of the project can be shared. Revenant has decided to release a cinematic cutscene from the game.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Everhaven / Phoenix Labs" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/972939497?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="1200" height="675" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write"></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In addition to the cinematic, Revenant has also released some previously unseen images of the project on <a href="https://revenant.tv/work/everhaven/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">its website here</a>.</p>



<p>In a press release, Luke Angus, Head of Animation at Revenant, said, “As an animator, this was one of those dream projects that doesn’t come along very often. It’s full of fantastical creatures, a gorgeous art style, and lore as deep and realised as it was beautiful. Getting to work on seven different films in this world provided an opportunity to explore a range of animation styles, each one inspired by the rich narrative of the character at its core.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/olympics-go<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The summer Olympics are here. During the last summer Olympics, I had just quit working at Kotaku and had a lot of free time, so I got a trial cable subscription and woke up at 4am to tweet about the climbing while pretending I was hanging out with <a href="https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2015/12/rock-climbing-changed-my-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mark Serrels</a>, which was clearly a healthy and normal way to be. This time around, I’ve only been able to watch it by peering through the windows of neighborhood bars that are playing the events on television, and this missing out has made me wonder if I can get my Olympics fix through video games.&nbsp;</p><p>But these Olympics are apparently the first summer Olympics <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/paris-2024-is-the-first-summer-olympics-in-30-years-to-have-no-console-video-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not to have a console game tie-in</a>. This includes there being no <em>Sonic &amp; Mario</em> game, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/olympics-ditched-mario-sonic-series-to-explore-nfts-and-esports" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eurogamer</a> reports is due to the International Olympic Committee not renewing its license with Nintendo and Sega in 2020, according to a long-time veteran of the series:</p><blockquote><p>"[The IOC] wanted to look at other partners and NFTs and esports," Lee Cocker, who worked on almost every entry in the series, told Eurogamer. "Basically the IOC wanted to bring [it] back to themselves internally and look at other partners so they would get more money."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>That partner is developer nWay, who created the mobile game <a href="https://olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-launches-innovative-paris-2024-mobile-game-ahead-of-olympic-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Olympics Go! Paris 2024</em></a>, which you can also play on PC on the Epic store. (As part of this, nWay has also created an Olympics <a href="https://olympicsgo.nway.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NFT</a>, which in 2024 is a simply embarrassing choice.) I checked out <em>Olympics Go</em> on PC last night, looking to get my Olympics game fix. There are 12 sports with unlockable difficulty levels; the shooting, archery, rowing, and cycling felt the most tolerable to me, with click-based controls that translated the best from touch to mouse. But all the sports are pretty simple mechanically, mostly clicking and swiping until your avatar crosses a line. Nothing in the game is particularly exciting, though it might feel a little more engaging on your phone while riding the bus than sitting at your desk.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the trappings of Olympic competition like medals and leaderboards, the game feels mostly focused on the kinds of microtransactions and incentives to spend you’d expect from a free-to-play mobile game. There’s a city management layer, where you upgrade and add outbuildings to various Olympic stadiums. It’s an interesting idea, or would be if its whole purpose wasn’t to generate the in-game currency of “fan points.” You spend these points on more buildings, as well as “training” your athlete to level them up. There are other currencies as well: energy, which you spend to compete in events and which regenerates over time, or gems that can be used to buy outfits or more energy. I spent a lot of my time in the game clicking on my buildings to harvest their points, while the game occasionally reminded me that its paid store existed. <em>Olympics Go</em> feels more like a mobile game attempting to cash in on Olympics hype than a celebration of the Games themselves.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Olympics™ GO!

I don’t remember why I owned the game–that might have been the year young me was obsessed with Olympic speed skating and used to pretend-skate along with the TV–but I played the hell out of it for years. In my memory, my runs through its slate of events were epic journeys, full of all the highs and lows I imagined real athletes experienced. The game’s feeling of competition and achievement (as well as its visuals, like the trees in the biathlon level and the moguls in the skiing events) are still the first things that come to my mind when I think of the word “Olympics” 30 years later.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Olympic Winter Games - Lillehammer' 94 (Mega Drive/Genesis) - Longplay" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BtmY8rd7uh8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Played so intensely at a young age, my positive associations with <em>Lillehammer 94 </em>are surely what an official Olympic video game intended me to feel about the Olympics themselves. Video games play a role as a marketing arm of what <a href="https://defector.com/the-lies-the-olympics-tells-about-itself-have-never-rung-more-false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Defector</a> called “the illusion of the Olympics as an apolitical gesture of peace and unity.” The Olympics are notoriously <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/07/29/olympics-is-disaster-people-who-live-host-cities/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bad for their host cities</a>, as well as for the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-021-00696-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">environment</a>. They’re our highest profile example of <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/society/israel-olympics-soccer-paris-palestine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sportswashing</a>– this will soon include <a href="https://olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-enters-a-new-era-with-the-creation-of-olympic-esports-games-first-games-in-2025-in-saudi-arabia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">esportswashing</a> too, in the form of the Olympic Esports Games to be held in 2025 in Saudi Arabia. There’s a history of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/sports/Olympic-Games/Corruption" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bribery and politicking</a>, and this is to say nothing of the weirdness of nationalism generally. And training and competing<a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/07/9935785/weight-of-gold-hbo-olympics-documentary-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> take a toll</a> on athletes’ physical and mental health, with <a href="https://www.today.com/health/coronavirus/covid-olympics-2024-rcna164070" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">covid</a> adding a whole new level of risk.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s a way in which the disappointment of <em>Olympics Go</em>, with its microtransactions and NFT, captures my relationship to the Olympics themselves as an adult. I need to embrace a certain <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2021/08/ending-the-olympics-tokyo/619666/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">naivete</a> to enjoy the Games these days, and I wrestle with the individual human achievement of the Games against their context. Maybe the crassness of <em>Olympics Go</em> is good, actually, in that it’s a more accurate rendition of some of the truth of the Olympics. Maybe my rosy childhood memories of <em>Lillehammer 94</em> are just propaganda for an event that is itself already propaganda.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m not here to be a downer who demands you not enjoy the Olympics; like everything these days and also throughout history, they have good aspects and bad aspects. Maybe video games are the perfect place for the Olympics fantasy, where I can see the Games as I wish they were, removed from the cost of that fantasy in real life. Or maybe the shabby reality of <em>Olympics Go</em>, and the dearth of Olympics games to take its place this year, is the kind of wakeup call I need.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Star Wars Outlaws certainly has the weight of expectation behind it. The first truly open-world single player Star Wars game, it’s been shorn of the Skywalkers and Palpatines, and instead aims to give us a story that focuses on the criminal underworld of the galaxy far far away. I didn’t even see one lightsaber during my four hours with Outlaws, and it’s much more interesting to discover what this game is, rather than what it isn’t.</p>
<p><iframe title="Oulaws" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5OP8kx00hmY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws is set after Empire Strikes Back, which, as anyone knows, is peak Star Wars. The Empire still has a Force stranglehold on the galaxy, but inbetween the cracks, criminal syndicates are rising to power. Our hero Kay Vess, and her adorable companion Nix, dream of a life of freedom, and they’re convinced into taking part in a heist. It does not go well.</p>


<p>We hopped in early to Kay’s story, where she’s just crashed a very important and rare spaceship that she has… acquired. You’re now stuck on the planet of Toshara, an all-new creation designed collaboratively by Massive and Lucasfilm, adding to the Star Wars canon. Mirogana City is the capital of this attractive, Mediterranean-esque landscape, and it’s where you’ll run into plenty of new characters to run jobs for and stab in the back.</p>


<p>At the start of our demo we meet Waka, a worryingly helpful Rodeon who offers to fix up your newly trashed ship, sending us out to get parts from in and around Mirogana City, which just so happens to be the hub for the three major crime syndicates who’ve set up shop here. There’s the Empire knocking around too, and given that this is when they’re at the height of their power, it’s probably best to avoid them.</p>
<p>Mirogana City is a classic Star Wars dive of a place, a city built beneath, and within a mountain, leaving only the mountain’s peak and a core to hold it up. Beneath it is a grimy, deeply insalubrious place, filled with unsavoury characters, and just as George Lucas intended, it feels realistic and lived in. You’ll believe that you could turn a corner and run into Han Solo – and perhaps you will, as you can take on tasks from Jabba the Hutt – and that’s about as good as it could get.</p>
<p>Your first task is to make your way into Pyke underboss Gorak’s antechamber, and while there appear to be different ways you could do this in the main game, from buying your way in with a broker to bribing a technician to let you through an access hatch, here we snuck out way in utilising your Data Spike. Once there, it’s a short stay, as it turns out crime bosses don’t really like you sneaking into their back rooms…</p>

<p>The Data Spike, like every good unlocking device, utilises a mini game, with you having to listen to the rhythmic audio pattern and pressing the trigger in sync with it. If your rhythm sucks there’s a visual overlay you can add to help you out. It isn’t the cleanest of mechanisms, and four hours in I was still struggling to nail the timing. Still, it made it all the sweeter when I did. Kay also boasts a grappling hook for, well, grappling to things and a blaster for shooting stuff. The blaster has multiple mode types, with our demo allowing you access to both a destructive blaster or one that’s capable of stunning enemies. Nix, your constant companion, also offers some useful skills that every slightly shady bounty hunter will find useful, being capable of distracting or attacking guards, or accessing switches and devices that are out of Kay’s reach.</p>
<p>That’s far from Kay’s only skill, as she’s a pretty dab hand at slicing data from computers,&nbsp;with another mini game letting you feel fairly clever about yourself, by choosing from the correct combination of glyphs – or numbers if you prefer.</p>
<p>With a focus on lawlessness, reputation looks to be everything. Whether it’s the Pykes, Crimson Dawn, The Ashiga Clan or the Hutt Cartel you choose to work for, you’re going to have to balance out the jobs you do, and the way you do them. It’s fair to say that Outlaws will see you regularly switching sides, or angering another, and Kay has the Han Solo-esque moxy to get away with it. Or end up in carbonite. It’s hard to tell right now.</p>

<p>It’s not just the syndicates either, your reputation plays into how everyone else perceives you, including the different merchants you’ll find in the world. Depending on their affiliation you might get a better price if you’re on the up with their chosen group, or they might fleece you if you’re on the wrong side of things. If you sell them the right things, you just might improve how they think about you either way.</p>
<p>There’s so much to get involved in here, from the steadily growing number of places you can visit, areas to explore on the map, and then a host of different systems and bits of equipment to upgrade, including your ship.</p>
<p>Once you’ve repaired the Trailblazer – the opening of our demo saw it stuck firmly in the ground – you can shoot off into space, leaving the atmosphere and engaging in some space combat. The Trailblazer is certainly nippy enough, but there’s a lock-on here that makes shooting Tie Fighters out of the sky feel a little too easy. Hopefully, it’s something that can be tweaked before release, or that there’s difficulty levels let you customise the challenge.</p>

<p>The close of our time with Outlaws saw us hop a little way forward in the story, and a little further into that far, far away galaxy to arrive at Kijimi, in search of a safecracker. For anyone that’s seen The Last Jedi and Rise of Skywalker, some of this may be sounding mildly familiar, but this is safecracking not codebreaking, so it’s absolutely different. Similarities aside, visiting a location we’ve seen in feature films just cements Outlaws’ place in the Star Wars universe, but ties it to the criminal underworld and shady dealings we’ve seen in The Mandalorian and Andor. Arguably, they’ve been the most interesting things out of Disney’s fairly scattershot approach to Star Wars, so, it’s a good thing.</p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws pulls together a host of different inspirations when it comes to gameplay, with aspects of Ubisoft’s own Assassin’s Creed series nuzzling up to some Uncharted-style exploration and gunplay. These don’t feel disparate elements though, and I’m totally sold on Kay Vess as a central character, her array of rogueish skills, and the way the Star Wars universe is being brought to our screens by the teams at Massive and across Ubisoft. If you’re a Star Wars fan, Outlaws feels like the perfect video game representation of the seedier world we’ve found in Andor and The Mandalorian, and it continues to sow the idea that maybe, just maybe, we don’t need lightsabers to have a fun time.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/chivalry-2-wont-get-any-more-content.940476/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chivalry-2-content-complete<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Chivalry 2&nbsp;</em>developer Torn Banner has announced that the game's latest update marks a point at which the game is "content and feature complete", meaning it will receive no more meaningful updates.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1824220/view/6572523942439765823" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on Steam</a>, Torn Banner says it feels like the three years of support it's given&nbsp;<em>Chivalry 2</em>, which has included numerous <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/beat-someone-with-stick-in-chivalry-2s-winter-war-update">updates</a>, content drops, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chivalry-2-update-brings-brand-new-map-and-more">quality-of-life improvements</a>, means the studio has "more than accomplished [its] goal", which was to double the size of&nbsp;<em>Chivalry 2&nbsp;</em>over the course of its lifespan.</p>
<p>Since&nbsp;<em>Chivalry 2&nbsp;</em>launched, updates have increased the number of Team Objective maps from five to thirteen, introduced mounted combat to the game, and added tons of new equipment, plus lots more. The game's Regicide update, which launched in May, marks the end of&nbsp;<em>Chivalry 2</em>'s story and of regular content drops as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/chivalry-2-content-complete-charge.jpg?itok=tJVIusTz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/chivalry-2-content-complete-charge.jpg?itok=81_oW99_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Chivalry 2&nbsp;</em>has received a number of updates since its launch, but it looks like those updates are about to dry up.</figcaption></figure><p>Although&nbsp;<em>Chivalry 2&nbsp;</em>might be feature complete now, that doesn't mean the franchise is ending, as Torn Banner is quick to remind fans in the Steam post.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right now, the team is hard at work on another multiplayer-focused game in the&nbsp;<em>Chivalry&nbsp;</em>franchise, as well as the upcoming co-op action-horror sequel&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/292000/No_More_Room_in_Hell_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>No More Room in Hell 2</em></a>. Torn Banner says it's been building its team "in number and skillset" in order to "blow players away" when the next&nbsp;<em>Chivalry&nbsp;</em>game is released.</p>
<p>Additionally,&nbsp;<em>Chivalry 2&nbsp;</em>might not be getting any more content, but it will still be updated with maintenance fixes as and when they become necessary. Both official and unofficial servers will remain active, as will matchmaking, so you won't need to worry about your weekly&nbsp;<em>Chivalry 2&nbsp;</em>raids ending.</p>

<p><em>Chivalry 2&nbsp;</em>itself isn't going anywhere either. You can still grab the game right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1824220/Chivalry_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/chivalry-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/chivalry-2/9n7cjx93zgwn" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>. Perhaps unusually, it's not free-to-play, but it is available via Game Pass, so if you're a subscriber, you can check it out at no additional cost.</p>

If you miss Myst, but feel only vertigo and disgust for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/riven-sequel-to-myst">its recent 3D reinventions</a>, you might find yourself salivating over first-person point-and-clicker <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/neyyah">Neyyah</a> - a Mystalike or more precisely, Rivenalike from Defy Reality Entertainment and MicroProse, which has just been dated for early access release on 27th August. Real-time movement and exploration? Rotatable polygons? Pfff. These are firmly pre-rendered worlds, just like Grandpappy Atrus used to bake.

Indeed, Neyyah is comparable enough to Cyan's 90s pixel-hunters that it could almost be a fan remake. It takes place on a chain of weird, "almost abandoned" islands linked by obscure machines - in this case, plasma portals. Your character, Theo, has been sent to Neyyah by a boffin called Vamir, who needs you to help him with some matter of cosmic urgency, but only shares a dribble of information with you initially. 
</p>
<p>
Look forward to: puzzles involving rusty levers, and many traces of ancient civilisations. "Neyyah reflects similar situations depicted within our own society, such as what is real, what is false, and being able to question your own beliefs," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1289720/Neyyah/">the Steam page</a> hints, a bit hammily. "Through environmental storytelling, the player will enjoy hours of non-linear gameplay, solving puzzles through the use of close observation, visual links, writing down your own notes, using inventory items ... while immersing yourself in a rich story and environment driven game."
</p>
<p>
Just because it's a game of static landscapes doesn't mean it ain't got graphics settings. You can expect a range of scene transition options, and a couple of storytelling modes. "Journey Mode" gives you FMV sequences for stuff like climbing ladders, while "Faster Travel" mode lets you skip certain scenes because after all, animation is overrated. It's all of a piece with MicroProse's old-is-new ethos. I like to think of their games as a bunch of alternate futures branching off from 1982 (yes, I'm aware that MicroProse today is essentially a different company, following innumerable departures and acquisitions).
</p>
<p>
You can read more about Neyyah’s origins in this <a href="https://80.lv/articles/neyyah-game-development-in-blender-visionaire/">80.lv interview from 2019</a> – Defy Reality founder and lead dev Aaron Gwynaire has been kicking aroumd ideas for it since 2011. As for how the game will change in early access, there will be new areas, puzzles and enhancements for the graphics, sound and music. "Our goal throughout Early Access is to continuously refine and expand Neyyah, making it a place you'll want to return to again and again," the Steam page notes. Any takers?

Now that I have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/star-wars-outlaws-preview-finally-lets-us-see-galaxy-of-scum-and-villainy">collectively played</a> about five hours of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, I am beyond excited to see more mostly because I can’t stop comparing it to <em>Andor</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Outlaws Makes the Right Choices for its Scoundrel Game Design&nbsp;</h2>
<p>When it comes to a <em>Star Wars </em>game about a Jedi, we can all make some accurate guesses on what fun gameplay will look like. You’re going to have a lightsaber, or two, and some cool force powers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, not all games featuring a Jedi are the same, but they’re all in the same ballpark. Let me slice up some dudes while throwing them around with the force, and I’ll be pretty happy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But how do you make a compelling <em>Star Wars</em> game when you don’t heavily feature its most iconic archetype in the Jedi? Further, how do you do it when you also don’t feature other nearly-as-iconic characters in clone troopers or stormtroopers heavily either?</p>
<p>Enter the scoundrel archetype. Throughout <em>Star Wars</em> media we get some glimpses on what a scoundrel is. They’re often portrayed as smugglers, thieves, and other ne’er-do-wells.</p>

<p>However, we don't really get to see much of them aside from the one to start it all: Han Solo. He’s fine working in grey areas outside the law, relies heavily on his ability to talk his way into or out of a situation, and has built up enough skills and confidence to get himself out of a scrap if he needs to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That description more or less fits Kay Vess to a tee, the protagonist of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>. She is a smooth talker, good with a blaster, great pilot, and lacking scruples when it comes to getting what she needs and wants from her colleagues working in the morally grey. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But how do you make scoundrel gameplay compelling? This is far and away the biggest question I had going into the game. Is it enough to just make it another fun shooter, giving us an arsenal of a bunch of sci-fi weaponry?&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is not the direction developer Massive Entertainment went.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Outlaws Takes the Same Approach as Andor</h2>
<p>I’ll get into the combat more later, but the most compelling part of <em>Outlaws </em>is how it crafts a world around Kay interacting with both criminal syndicates and just the general people that inhabit the worlds we get to visit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For me, one of the best parts of <em>Andor </em>was just how much it was a look into the innerworkings of the <em>Star Wars</em> universe, particularly giving us a glimpse at the sinister bureaucracy of the Empire.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the same way, <em>Outlaws </em>lets us dive into the criminal underworld of the Outer Rim and learn more about its inhabitants. As far as visual media goes for <em>Star Wars</em>, I think <em>Outlaws </em>is going to be the best look we have had yet on what its like to be your average person in the <em>Star Wars</em> universe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s what has me incredibly excited.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-outlaws-stormtroopers-people-interaction.jpg?itok=SP8MiaNS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-outlaws-stormtroopers-people-interaction.jpg?itok=6_61BOv- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can even run across interactions like this and intervene if you wish.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Where so many <em>Star Wars</em> stories are about the relatively impersonal glories of war, of politics, or focused on the Empire in some way, <em>Outlaws </em>is more grounded in its scale. So many Star Wars stories are high-level and grandiose, hardly focusing on what actually happens in the universe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine if someone’s sole understanding of where you live comes from hearing about your politicians or actions of your government. That’s kind of what we’ve had so far with <em>Star Wars</em>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I think that’s partly why <em>Andor </em>resonated with so many people, aside from just how well-crafted and well-written it is. We got to see how average folks, like us, would live in the world, including those that have decided to stomach (or embrace) the Empire.</p>
<p>From what I’ve seen so far, I can’t say <em>Outlaws </em>is going to reach the same heights of Andor, but it’s certainly trying to tell a similar type of story.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Outlaws </em>ties this exploration into the people of the<em> Star Wars</em> universe with the scoundrel gameplay wonderfully.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>In Outlaws, Information is the Name of the Game&nbsp;</h2>
<p>So much of being a scoundrel is having information and using it correctly. There are some moments in <em>Outlaws </em>you have the option to use, or not use, some information you just learned. Maybe you’re wanting to court, or screw over, one of the syndicates so you want to use save it for the right person.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While this is nothing new, you’ll obviously learn some information and get things like side quests just by talking to people in whatever area you’re in. What’s cooler, though, is the sometimes more hidden information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are obviously places that will be harder to get to, with things like puzzles of how to open doors blocking your way, but sometimes you just run across a datapad with something someone would want to know or you may overhear something in a conversation.</p>
<p>Part of the gameplay is just paying attention to what people are saying around you. Some of those are casual conversations you can just pick up on as you go by, but there are obviously some <em>Outlaws </em>sets aside for you to listen to.</p>

<p>In some sort of cantina, two guys were having a loud conversation about some job they just did. Well, I had the option to just sit around the corner and eavesdrop, learning where they just stashed their latest score. I of course ran off to nab that for myself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The emphasis on immersing yourself among the people is what has me most excited for <em>Outlaws</em>. Getting answers to all these anthropological questions is interesting. Things like how do people entertain themselves, what are their basic needs and how do they meet them, how do they organize their cities and societies, and a whole bunch more. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Kay gets some help with learning a bit more of how the criminal underworld works with a character I can’t wait to see more of, Danka, a Mon Calamari information broker. She sees Kay is a little green, at least to this part of the galaxy, and gets her some help with some information and a job or two.</p>
<p>Danka is written really well with some smart dialogue. Honestly, what has me the most excited to see more of her is that she reminded me of Margo from<em> The Americans</em>. The lines are great and so is her delivery. Plus, I can’t wait for her inevitable betrayal of Kay (or at least taking advantage of her in some way). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Obviously, <em>Outlaws </em>focuses on one part of the galaxy, the Outer Rim. The Outer Rim is where criminals thrive, so the daily lives of people that live there is going to be different. We won’t see what society or life is like for your average joe on a “typical” planet of beings just living their lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just as there is a whole order and hierarchy among the Jedi, we’ll get to see how the criminal world has itself set up. <em>Outlaws </em>focuses on four syndicates: The Hutt Cartel, the Pykes, the Ashiga, and the Crimson Dawn.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Your Syndicate Reputation Will See A lot of Ups and Downs&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The core part of <em>Outlaws </em>revolves around Kay’s interactions with the various criminal syndicates. All sorts of interactions, quests, choices, and more will either gain or lose you reputation with one syndicate or another.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Outlaws </em>tells you that your reputation is fluid. Maybe at one point in the game it makes sense to have the Pykes on your side to make things easier. Later they may not be as useful, so it’s not a big deal to go against them if you need to. Then again, maybe even later their usefulness may crop up again.</p>
<p>The ever-changing nature of Kay’s reputation with the syndicates is a great example great design for <em>Outlaws</em>' scoundrel gameplay.</p>

<p>With a character who is all about getting what’s theirs, it doesn’t make sense to have them see a singular loyalty with any one faction. Certain situations have different necessities, so one syndicate or another may be more useful to be friendly with at a given time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even more, I think it gives some insight and character into how the criminal world in<em> Star Wars </em>works. This selfish individualism is an understood reality and an assumed part of everyone’s identity you encounter. Everyone’s loyalty has a price.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, it makes sense that any one person or group's feelings towards Kay will change over5 time. Everyone knows they are using each other for their own gains, so sometimes you win and sometimes you get burned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plus, and this goes back to information being so important, you can almost always pull yourself back into someone’s good graces if you give them a key piece of information or heisted some object they greatly desire.</p>
<p>Bygones will be bygones in a world run on “what have you done for me lately?” &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Outlaws is Truly Open World&nbsp;</h2>
<p><em>Outlaws </em>gives you a lot of freedom to do what you want, racking up reputation (or losing some) with the syndicates as you go. &nbsp;Featuring five worlds – Toshara, Akiva, Cantonica, Tatooine, and Kijimi – <em>Outlaws </em>has huge sprawling maps to both fly and run around in. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I only got to experience Toshara and Kijimi in my time with the game so far, but both were incredibly impressive. Toshara in particular, where I spent most of my time, was awesome to explore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Toshara has a huge city to explore in Mirogana. It has plenty of shops to visit, gambling, streets to explore, a cantina, and a whole bunch more. It felt like a breathing city with all sorts of interesting aliens going about their business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s not on the scale of something you may see in a Rockstar game or Night City in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, but it’s a great hub to interact with and learn more about the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Outside of the city, Toshara was full of little settlements, buildings of all types, caves, and a lot more I didn’t have time to check out in my time with the game. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In one area, I stumbled upon a camp full of loot and a hidden cache to only be met with the occupants when I stepped out of the cave all of their stuff was hidden in. They weren't happy and a gunfight ensued.\</p>
<p>Another saw me going about an elaborate series of parkour jumps, a la <em>Uncharted</em>, that led me to a little animal sanctuary and a rare resource.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also had a ton of points of interest and quest markers that I had accumulated during my time in Mirogana. Quests I had accepted and conversations I overheard were marked on the map, so there was quite a bit I just didn’t have the time to get to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of my time was spent on hanging around the cities and doing parts of the main quest, so I didn’t get to check out a lot of the open world to see just how much is going on. A lot of open worlds have a lot of filler or are just too bloated, but I couldn’t tell you where <em>Outlaws </em>is on that spectrum based on my time with the game yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond just the cities and the worlds, there’s the orbits around the planets to explore as well. Going to and from a planet is relatively seamless, with hidden loading screens, but it’s not like <em>No Man’s Sky</em> where you can fly onto and out from a planet as you wish. You'll use a menu to go to and from with a cutscene in-between.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even so, moving to space in your ship is natural and works quite well. Out in orbit there are quite a few things to check out as well, like debris to salvage, other ships maybe fighting off pirates, and quite a bit more I didn’t get to see.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From there its easy to engage the hyperdrive and head off to another planet. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The open world design looks great and it all gels together pretty well, but it’s definitely my biggest worry for <em>Outlaws</em>. Too often great games can get bogged down by all the fluff and just being too big. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m not sure if that’s going to be the route with <em>Outlaws</em>, but its the most common place to trip up with these types of games. Thankfully, so much of what I saw was integrated with other aspects of the gameplay, like syndicate reputation or finding interesting things to check out by eavesdropping, that I think most of it will be satisfying and feel worth your time.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Outlaws Combat and Stealth is Fine&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The combat in Outlaws is probably best describe as just fine. It’s not the flashy part of the game, as I imagine a lot of your time will be spent running around and interacting with a lot of the different characters in the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Outlaws </em>gunplay and moment-to-moment combat is closest to something like <em>Uncharted</em>. You’ll be dodging to cover, picking up guns dropped by enemies, and stealthing about to move around the battlefield.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My one caveat is that I didn’t engage with the too much in my time with <em>Outlaws</em>. What I did play was fun, though I didn’t get to experience a ton of variety. Read <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/star-wars-outlaws-preview-finally-lets-us-see-galaxy-of-scum-and-villainy">more about the combat</a> in my previous hands-on preview.</p>
<p>I do know that there is an upgrade system for your blaster and Kay will get access to certain abilities, so there’s a good chance I didn’t see a whole lot. For example, she has access to a classic deadeye ability, slowing down time and marking people to shoot, like in <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>.</p>

<p>Instead of shooting in combat, most of my time was spent stealthing. It makes sense in the context of being a scoundrel, as a shoot first ask questions later reputation isn’t going to get you far most likely. At least, good luck getting people to work with you.</p>
<p>Stealthing is where you’ll likely use Kay’s trusty partner Nix the most, aside from some puzzle elements out in the world. Nix can distract people, interact with objects in the world, and even set off grenades on someone's belt.</p>
<p>Like the gunplay, stealthing is pretty standard fare. If you’ve played one of these big budget character action games in the last decade or so, it will be familiar. It’s more or less the same as <em>Uncharted</em>, <em>Horizon</em>, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other words, based on what I’ve seen so far, the combat and the stealth is not going to be the reason you’ll remember <em>Outlaws</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Star Wars Outlaws Hands-on Preview | Final Thoughts&nbsp;</h2>
<p>My time with <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> left me wanting more, genuinely excited for what I am going to see in the final game. Excitement for something new with <em>Star Wars</em> has been few and far between, so that alone is a huge win for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The worldbuilding is great and the characters you interact with are smartly written. That is more than likely what we’ll remember moreso than any one particular gameplay element in <em>Outlaws</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There’s all the makings of a great game here that will be more than satisfying for Star Wars fans. Hopefully the constant <em>Andor </em>reminders are a good sign.</p>
