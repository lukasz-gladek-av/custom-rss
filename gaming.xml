			<p>Avalanche Studio's founder Christofer Sundberg has taken to X to express his discontent about recent quotes from Mad Max director George Miller.</p>
<p>Yesterday, PC Gamer published an article about Miller and the director wanting Hideo Kojima to make a proper Mad Max game. In addition, the director revealed that he wasn't that happy with 2015's Mad Max game from developer Avalanche. "We've been asked many many times to do one", Miller said. "It wasn't as good as I wanted it to be, it wasn't in our hands, we gave all our material to a company to do it… but I'm one of those people that I'd rather not do something unless you can do it at the highest level, or at least try to make it at the highest level."</p>
<p>After the publication of this article, Sundberg was quick to respond on X, saying that Miller's words show "complete arrogance". "This is complete nonsense and just shows complete arrogance", the Avalanche founder wrote on X. "They did everything they could to make this a complete linear game after having signed up with a developer of open-world games. I'm sure Hideo Kojima would make an awesome Mad Max game, but it would be a completely different experience."</p>
<p>He <a href="https://x.com/CHSundberg/status/1793612777648689221" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continued</a>, "After the first year of development they realized that they had forced us to make a linear experience rather than the open world game we pitched. We threw away a year of work and got to hear that "players wants autonomy in this day and age". Well, no shit..."</p>
<p>Sundberg is referring to publisher Warner Bros., which, apparently, insisted that Mad Max was released alongside Kojima's Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. In addition, Sundberg revealed that the team had "awesome DLC" sitting to be released, but following bad sales of the game, these DLCs were canceled.</p>
<p>He said, "As we were forced to release Mad Max on the same day as MGS, they blamed us for the bad sales and cancelled a bunch of awesome DLC that was just sitting there waiting to be released."</p>
<p>In all honesty, the 2015 Mad Max game is a highly underrated title that deserves praise. For those interested, it can be picked up pretty cheap on PC and consoles right now. Here's what we wrote about the 2015 title in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mad-max-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch review</a> back then:</p>
<p><em>It’s still a game I really, truly enjoy. The open world may not be the most interesting, the characters may not be all that memorable, and the quests might not exactly be inspired, but this is a very competent game made by an obviously talented team of developers (Avalanche Studios; you know them for Just Cause) and they honestly blew my expectations for a Mad Max game out of the water. My gripes ultimately feel minor, because the game as a whole is very satisfying and fun to play, save for a few of those more menial challenges.</em></p>

        <p>The Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill would also enable sideloading third-party apps on mobile platforms</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>The Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill has been passed by UK Parliament, which could force platform holders such as Apple and Google to allow the Epic Games Store on its devices.</p>
<p>The DMCC Bill was put through on Thursday following the announcement of a general election set for July 4.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/uk-passes-bill-which-could-force-apple-to-allow-fortnite-and-an-epic-games-store-app-on-ios/">VGC</a>, parts of the DMCC Bill contain sections established in the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/apple-google-under-pressure-as-eu-approves-digital-markets-act">EU's Digital Markets Act</a> passed in November 2022, which would force platform holders to allow users to sideload third-party apps and software onto devices. This also opens up the possibility of alternative marketplaces on these platforms.</p>
<p>Back in January, Apple announced changes that <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/apple-to-allow-alternative-app-stores-in-europe">would allow alternative app stores and payments on iOS</a> in compliance with the DMA.</p>
<p>By March, Apple, Google and Meta were already<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/eu-commission-investigates-google-meta-and-apple-for-possible-digital-markets-act-violations"> under investigation by the EU for potential violations of the DMA</a>.</p>
<p>Epic Games is in the process of developing a mobile version of its storefront for Apple's App Store, as reported by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-secures-ios-developer-account-europe-mobile-store-and-fortnite-launch-this-year?utm_source=feed&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feed">Eurogamer</a>, which will launch on iOS sometime this year and will be operated by Epic Games Sweden.</p>

			<p>During the full-year financial report for 2023-24, the Embracer Group confirmed several games that will be released in the next fiscal year (by March 2025), including the Gothic remake, Killing Floor 3 and Titan Quest II. That's in addition to <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-is-out-this-year-and-its-looking-great-not-to-mention-twice-as-large/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</a>, which we know will be released in 2024, and three major unannounced games.</p>
<p><em>The announcement of Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, an internal IP developed by Warhorse Studios, a PLAION studio based in Prague has been received by players with great enthusiasm. It is an epic open-world medieval RPG set in Bohemia releasing on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox later this year. The title is expected to be one of the key releases in the PC/Console segment in FY 2024/25.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Apart from Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, important new releases in FY 2024/25 include Killing Floor 3, Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed, Hyperlight Breaker, Gothic Remake, and Titan Quest 2, alongside at least three other important, unannounced releases. In total, more than 70 game projects are currently expected to be released during the financial year.</em></p>
<p>The Gothic remake was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-gothic-remake-is-happening-after-all-and-itll-be-grittier-than-the-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> to be in development in February 2020, following a demo released on Steam. THQ Nordic founded a brand new studio, the Barcelona-based Alkimia Interactive, to work on the project. Last month, the Collector's Edition became available for pre-order while the developers showcased some new Unreal Engine 5 screenshots of the Gothic remake.</p>
<p>Killing Floor 3 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/killing-floor-3-pc-ps5-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> at Gamescom 2023. It's also being made with Unreal Engine 5 at Tripwire Games.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Titan Quest II was <a href="https://wccftech.com/titan-quest-ii-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-as-an-open-world-game-powered-by-ue5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in early August 2023. It will be an open world action RPG made in Unreal Engine 5. It is in development at Grimlore Games, which revealed that players will have to face off against Nemesis, Goddess of Retribution, now out of control. She is corrupting the Threads of Fate and is punishing all those who oppose her. Needless to say, it's up to the player to stop Nemesis.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/alone-in-the-dark-and-outcast-a-new-beginning-sales-were-underwhelming-says-embracer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In the <a href="https://embracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Embracer-Group-publishes-Interim-Report-Q4-January-March-2024-Adjusted-EBIT-increased-by-56-to-SEK-1426-million-240523.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full year financial report for 2023-2024</a>, the Embracer Group revealed that Alone in the Dark sales were underwhelming. The same was said about Outcast: A New Beginning.</p>
<p>Net sales in the last quarter were down 10% year-over-year, largely due to the lower than expected performance of these two games:</p>
<p><em>In Q4, results were also impacted by a softer-than-expected performance for the two titles Alone in the Dark and Outcast: A New Beginning, developed and published by THQ Nordic.</em></p>
<p><em>Alone in the Dark and Outcast: A New Beginning both saw a positive reception from users, but a mixed reception from critics and ultimately performed below management expectations.</em></p>
<p>On Wccftech, the Alone in the Dark reboot starring Jodie Comer and David Harbour <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alone-in-the-dark/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned a 7 out of 10 from Nate Birch</a>:</p>
<p><em>Despite my complaints, I have to admit, I still enjoyed this new Alone in the Dark overall. Maybe I’m just a sucker for that old-school survival horror feel, or maybe Alone in the Dark’s faults just didn’t sink in too deeply as no one section of the game sticks around all that long. Your first time through the game will take around 7 or 8 hours, although multiple playthroughs are encouraged in a number of ways. As mentioned, Edward and Emily’s stories aren’t&nbsp;that&nbsp;different, but a variety of collectibles, secrets, and unlockable endings will keep some happily in the dark for a while, although others may feel the urge to flick on the light switch before they collect everything.</em></p>
<p>Outcast: A New Beginning fared far worse (5.5) <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/outcast-a-new-beginning-review-a-mediocre-comeback/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Francesco De Meo's review</a>, though:</p>
<p><em>Outcast - A New Beginning is a missed opportunity, abandoning the unique elements of its predecessor for a conventional open-world design that doesn't work well. With uninspired open-world exploration, clunky movement, lackluster combat, and mediocre quest design, it's a hard sell for everyone but Cutter Slade's biggest fans who wish to know how the character's story continues, as there are far superior titles on the market that have executed similar concepts much more effectively.</em></p>
<p>Did you play Alone in the Dark and Outcast: A New Beginning? If so, what did you think of them?</p>

Following a sandstorm, a new biome was created in the south called wasteland and "Wasteland Warriors" have claimed the area for their own.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Fortnite Battle Royale Chapter 5 Season 3: Wrecked (Fallout, Wasteland Magneto, and More)</h3></div></output><p>You obviously can't have a wasteland without Fallout, and the Wrecked Battle Pass will let you don some T-60 Power Armor after doing a bit of grinding.</p><p>When you purchase the Battle Pass, you will unlock an Outfit called The Machinist. By leveling it up, you will be able to unlock Rust, Peabody, Ringmaster Scarr, and then, finally, the T-60 Power Armor. That's not all, as the Brite Raider and Megalo Don Outfits will become available two levels after that.</p><p>The Fallout fun doesn't end there either, as ice-cold Nuka-Cola bottles will be littered around the map that will restore Health and, over time, a bit of Shield.</p><p>Beyond Fallout, Marvel fans will be delighted to know that they will be able to unlock the Wastelander Magneto Outfit from Battle Pass Quests in July. </p><h2>A Wasteland Waiting to be Conquered</h2><p>Whether you have the T-60 Power Armor or not, the wasteland will have a ton of things to do in it and challenges to conquer. There will also be a few new POIs, including the Redline Rig, Nitrodome, and Brutal Beachhead.

Oh, and you can steal their vehicles as well.</p><p>Speaking of Nitro, the island will now be home to Nitro Splash and Nitro Barrels that are being shipped right from Redline Rig. Nitro Splash is a portable container that you can throw to infuse your car or yourself with Nitro while Nitro Barrels will fly off when you hit them and explode on whatever it lands on.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>As for what Nitro is, it will increase the speed of cars, give "explosive ramming power that deals damage and knockback," decrease fuel consumption, and buff attached attack mods. For the player, it will increase their movement speed, give them the ability to "bust through builds," sprint for longer periods, reload guns faster, and take no fall damage.</p><p>Additionally, there are now Nitro Fists that lets players perform a 3x punch combo, uppercut, or aerial punch. These fists have four charges and each one recharges every eight seconds.</p><p>There is so much more to look forward to in this new season, including a War Bus that you can hijack that comes complete with two cannons and an EMP pulse, new and returning vehicle mods, the ability to create roadblocks with a Boom Bolt, and much more.</p><p>If this isn't enough Fallout for you, be sure to check out <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-season-1-review-amazon-prime-video">our review of Season 1 of the Fallout TV show,</a> <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-tv-series-ending-explained-prime-video">our explainer of its ending,</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-game-you-need-to-play-while-you-wait-for-season-2-new-vegas">the Fallout game you need to play while you wait for Season 2.</a></p><p><em>Have a tip for us?

It’s called “Wrecked,” and it introduces a new wasteland region, a larger focus on vehicular combat, and, for some reason, Magneto.</p><p>First up, let’s talk about the island itself. In the game’s fiction, a massive sandstorm rolled in, completely changing the southern section of the map. There are three new locations: a refinery called Redline Rig, a vehicle arena called Nitrodrome, and a beach area called Brutal Beachhead. To go along with them are “Wasteland Warriors,” which are basically this season’s boss characters, with names like The Machinist and<strong> </strong>Ringmaster Scarr. Also: there are now two War Buses patrolling the island, which players can hijack and take over.</p><p>Here’s the new map:</p><p>It appears there are two main gameplay updates. One is a substance called Nitro, which you can either drink or use on your vehicle: it’ll make players faster, stronger, and reload quicker, while cars will go faster, consume less gas, and be able to ram with increased power. To go along with this, vehicle mods are back, so you can outfit your car with gun turrets, bulletproof tires, and more. And since <em>Fallout</em> is now part of the <em>Fortnite</em> universe, Nuka-Cola is being added to the game.

                <p>After three months of godly gameplay, Fortnite's Myths &amp; Mortals season has come to a close, and the new season, Chapter 5 Season 3: Wrecked, is imminent. But, for the moment, we're stuck in limbo with Fortnite offline while Epic Games deploys the season update. This is standard procedure--we get at least a few hours of downtime before each new season. It's just a matter of time now.</p><h2>Fortnite servers down - When does Chapter 5 Season 3 start?</h2><p>When Fortnite's servers come back up, it'll usher in this year's massive summer season, complete with a major collaboration with Fallout right off the bat, a new desert wasteland-type biome, some kind of new vehicular combat mechanics, and an all-new battle pass full of fresh cosmetics--such as Brotherhood of Steel power armor, which Epic has been teasing all week.</p><p>That Fallout collab is a big one that's got everybody full of hype, but all we can do now is wait until Epic brings Fortnite back online. But when will that be? Unfortunately, it's not a question with an easy answer, because there's no scheduled time for this maintenance window to end. Typically, you can expect to see a new Fortnite season to kick off between 7 AM and 10 AM ET on launch day--in this case, May 24--though there have been major exceptions. When this past season began, for example, there was some sort of technical issue that kept the game offline until late in the evening, with Fortnite staying offline for nearly a day. But that was a very unusual situation.</p><p>Once the game does return, Season 3 will introduce a whole host of changes to the battle royale island, thanks to the massive sandstorm that's been coming in from the south. The biggest immediate change will be the introduction of a desert wasteland with several new major locations like the Nitro Drome combat arena, and of course that Fallout collaboration is going to be a big draw for a lot of players, especially after the success of this spring's TV adaptation.</p><p>Once the servers do come back up, we'll give you a massive roundup of everything new in Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 3 right here.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-guide-how-to-unlock-2-new-bosses/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The much-anticipated remake of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> is here, and much like the Gamecube original, the game is bursting with puzzles, secrets, and some quirky mechanics that new players may find slightly perplexing. Don’t worry though, we’re here to cut The Thousand-Year Door’s more confusing aspects down to size.</p>
<p>The Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door doesn’t off up a ton of all-new content, but it does add a pair of tough post-game bosses for you to challenge yourself against. So, here’s how to face off against these bosses and a few tips on how to beat them.</p>
<p><em>Note: This guide contains Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door post-game SPOILERS.</em></p>
<p>Have the spoiler-phobic left the room? Okay, without further ado…</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd38.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2><strong>Prince Mush</strong></h2>
<p>That’s right, the original champion of the Glitz Pit before being replaced by Rawk Hawk can now be taken on for the ultimate title of champion.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd39.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><strong>How to Fight Prince Mush</strong></p>
<p>While Prince Mush may send you a message challenging you earlier in the game, you have to finish up the main story and roll credits in order to fight him. He’ll be hanging out in the hallway near the save block and locker rooms in the Glitz Pit. Talk to him and accept his challenge. Then go to one of the GBA-shaped terminals to fight him as an exhibition match.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd40.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><strong>Strategy Tips</strong></p>
<p>Despite his unintimidating appearance, Prince Mush is definitely a tough customer, rocking 96 HP, 6 Attack, and 6 Defense. The Prince has a couple stances -- one where he’s kind of hopping up and down, and one where’s shimmying back and forth – you can only damage when he’s doing the former, as he’ll always dodge when he’s in the latter stance. So, when he’s moving back and forth, use your time to heal and use attack-boosting items like Power Lift or the Charge ability. If you pull off a successful Superguard, he will be essentially stunned for a turn, giving you more opportunity to attack.</p>
<p>Once you knock off about half of Prince Mush’s HP, he’ll repeatedly go Super Saiyan and boost his attack power. Prince Mush will gain a new combo during this phase, where he flies at you from all directions doing heavy damage with each hit. This combo sucks, but if you can pull off a Superguard during one of the strikes, he will be stunned again. He also has a move where he splits into three – hit the “real” Mush to return him to normal. This second phase is tough, but if you stock up on lots of Life Shrooms and hit a few Superguards, you’ll come out on top.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd41.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2><strong>Whacka</strong></h2>
<p>And the other secret boss is… Whacka. He’s tougher than he looks!</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd42.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><strong>How to fight Whacka</strong></p>
<p>Whacka is down at the bottom of the Pit of 100 Trials, which is located to the west of the underground room containing the Thousand-Year Door. Slip through the gate on the east side of the Thousand-Year Door room, bounce up to the paper airplane platform, then glide to the platform on the east side of the room to access the door to the Pit of 100 Trials.</p>
<p>In order to fight Whacka, you’ll need to play through the entirety of the Pit of 100 Trials and defeat Bonetail. Once you’ve done that… do it all again! You can pay 300 coins to skip to floor 50, but otherwise, you’re going to have to repeat the pit. Once you reach floor 100, Bonetail will be replaced by Whacka. Talk to him to fight him.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd43.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><strong>Strategy Tips</strong></p>
<p>Whacka is pretty straightforward, but he’s tough, rocking 108 HP, 10 Attack, and 1 Defense. Every time you attack Whacka, he’ll drop a “Whacka Bump” – basically, a little bun – which he can eat to regain HP or throw at you as an attack. These Bumps come in yellow and red variants, with red being more powerful. Basically, use attacks that don’t inflict a lot of individual hits so Whacka won’t generate too many Bumps. Other than that, just work on Superguarding Whacka’s attacks and load up on Life Shrooms. This fight will be long due to Whacka’s high HP and healing ability, but stick to it, and you’ll come out on top.</p>
<p>And there you go – that’s how you take out two of the toughest customers in the game!</p>

One day, a heavy tariff was imposed by the king who ruled a neighboring country, making overland trade impossible. In order to save her country from its predicament, Rota begins a new trade by sea in the port town of Portamare. Let’s greatly develop Portamare through trade using ships and aim for the revival of Rosecania!</p><p>There are three types of residents in the town of Portamare: farmers, merchants, and sailors. Each resident has their own skills, and in the case of merchants, they play an active role in business negotiation battles. Build various facilities around the city and produce export goods. The cute residents drawn with pixel art move around the map while muttering to themselves. Sometimes tourists visit our town!</p><p>Business negotiations with other countries can be conducted by Rota himself or by hired merchants. The biggest challenge is how cheap imports can be bought and how high exports can be sold.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Trade is carried out by sea using ships. There are different types of ships, and the larger they are, the more export goods they can carry. Also, when it becomes possible to trade with new countries, the types of facilities will increase, and people from other countries will appear as residents of Portamare.</p><p>There is also a ranking event held once a year to evaluate the degree of development of the city. Let’s do our best to further develop Portamare!</p></blockquote><p>View the first screenshots <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/gallery/rotas-nautical-chronicles-of-trade/may-23-2024/">at the gallery</a>.</p><h2><span>Screenshots</span></h2><div id="carousel_884588"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He noted its development would allow for more personalized experiences in games, which is of particular importance to Gen Z (those born from 1997 to 2011) and Gen Alpha (those born from 2010 to 2024).</p><p>"Advancements in AI will create more personalized experiences and meaningful stories for consumers," Qizilbash said. "For instance, non player characters in games could interact with players based on their actions, making it feel more personal.</p><p>"This is important for the younger Gen Z and Gen Alpha audiences, who are the first generations that grew up digitally and are looking for personalization across everything, as well as looking for experiences to have more meaning."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This is important for the younger Gen Z and Gen Alpha audiences, who are the first generations that grew up digitally.</p></div><p>Video games have endured a particularly complicated relationship with AI since its re-emergence in the last couple of years, and the debate will likely only grow larger and more complex in the coming years and as companies like Sony look even further ahead.</p><p>Embark Studios, the developer of smash hit shooter The Finals, was criticized for using AI voiceovers <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-finals-criticised-by-actors-and-devs-for-using-ai-generated-voice-overs">by myriad actors and even other developers</a>, for example, but Embark told IGN that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/embark-responds-to-the-finals-ai-criticism-making-games-without-actors-isnt-an-end-goal">"making games without actors isn't an end goal"</a> and claimed it used a mix of both recorded audio voices and audio generated via AI text to speech tools for its games.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/voice-actors-speak-out-on-nsfw-skyrim-mods-nexus-mods">Video game voice actors have also called out AI-generated explicit Skyrim mods</a>, and Assassin's Creed Syndicate voice actress <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-voice-actor-calls-ai-generated-mods-the-invisible-enemy-were-fighting-right-now">Victoria Atkin called AI-generated mods the “invisible enemy</a><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-voice-actor-calls-ai-generated-mods-the-invisible-enemy-were-fighting-right-now"> we're fighting right now”</a> after discovering her voice was used by cloning software.

            <p>
If you're a fan of Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun's retro-inspired first-person shooting action - and you might well be given how positively it was received - you've got a fresh chunk of the stuff to look forward to in a few short weeks now that developer Auroch Digital and publisher Focus Entertainment have announced an expansion is coming on 18th June.
</p>
<p>
Forges of Corruption, as Boltgun's first expansion is officially known, includes a brand-new campaign spanning five new environments. Three of those have been revealed so far - the Graia Battlefields, Manufactorum, and the heretic-infested Daemonic Forge - and there's also promise of new enemies inhabiting these dangerous locales.
</p>
<p>
Ultramarines stepping forth into Forges of Corruption can expect to encounter the vicious Black Havok Legion, the Helbrute, and the Terminator with its Lighting Claw. Luckily, there's a bit of (literal) extra bang for your expansion bucks in the form of two new weapons: the Multi-Melta and Missile Launcher.

<p>
Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun's Forges of Corruption expansion launches for PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on 18th June. It arrives alongside a new Forges of Corruption Edition - combining the base game and DLC for a "reduced" price - as well as a free update for all players.
</p>
<p>
This introduces a new Horde mode, featuring four difficulty levels and its own achievements, plus a navigation guide, bug fixes and quality of life improvements. Oh and if you haven't yet played Boltgun, it's currently on sale across all platforms, with discounts ranging from 25-40 percent.
</p>
<p>
And is it worth it? Eurogamer contributor Rick Lane was largely positive about the whole thing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40k-boltgun-review-a-signature-weapon-so-good-it-breaks-the-game">in his three star review</a>. "If you want to make a big ol' mess with one excellent gun and several other decent ones," he wrote, "Boltgun satisfies this desire. A few design tweaks and a little more attention to detail would elevate it from a good shooter into a great one, but as a throwback starter course to the hotly anticipated main that is Space Marine 2, Boltgun does an acceptable job of stimulating the tastebuds."

<p data-characters="306" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Embark on a thrilling<em>&nbsp;</em>treasure hunt in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/roblox-the-classic-event-start-and-end-dates-items-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Roblox The Classic</em>&nbsp;event</a>, where you can earn an exclusive Token. The challenge lies in locating all books, a task that can be daunting due to the vastness of the map. So, let’s dive into all book locations in the&nbsp;<em>Roblox The Classic&nbsp;</em>Buried Treasure quest.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-where-to-find-all-books-in-roblox-the-classic-buried-treasure-quest" data-injectable="false">Where to find all books in Roblox The Classic Buried Treasure quest</h2> <p data-characters="256" data-current-count="256" data-injectable="false">Before we delve into the specifics, let’s give you a quick overview of what to expect. The Buried Treasure book and treasure locations can only be found in the following areas of the <em>Roblox The Classic </em>hub (we’ll break down each one afterward):</p> <ul data-found-items="10" data-current-count="656" data-injectable="true"> <li>Main hub near the fountain</li> <li>Your House</li> <li>Castle</li> <li>Food area</li> <li><em>Roblox </em>HQ building</li> <li>Volcano area</li> <li><em>Roblox The Hunt </em>portal</li> <li>Sphere structure</li> <li>Race car destination</li> <li>The ship (treasure location)</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="146" data-current-count="146" data-injectable="false">Unfortunately,&nbsp;<em>The Classic</em>&nbsp;event doesn’t have a map for an exact location. So, here’s where you can&nbsp;find each one more efficiently:</p> <h3 id="h-buried-treasure-stage-1-location" data-injectable="false">Buried Treasure Stage 1 location</h3> <figure data-current-count="446" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="182" data-current-count="182" data-injectable="false">When loading into&nbsp;<em>Roblox The Classic</em>, go straight to the Rubber Ducky Fountain area to claim your first book.

 <p data-characters="275" data-current-count="275" data-injectable="false">Another book will be located on the right side of the map. It’ll be in the same area as the ‘Your House’ location, where you can change into Classic clothing. On the left side of the home, you’ll spot the second book near the trampoline and teapots.&nbsp;</p> <h3 id="h-buried-treasure-stage-3-location" data-injectable="false">Buried Treasure Stage 3 location</h3> <figure data-current-count="575" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>

            <p>
With another week of 2024 now crossed off the calendar, Epic has delved deep into its big bag of treats to reveal the Epic Games Store's latest freebie - and this time it's Farming Simulator 22.
</p>
<p>
This not-quite-latest instalment in developer Giants Software's long-running agricultural sim (and I'm about to paraphrase the official blurb here seeing as I'm not much of an expert on this one) gives wannabe farmers the tools to establish their own vineyard or olive orchard in the south of France; to grow wheat, corn, potatoes, and cotton in the US Midwest, or even establish an animal farm in alpine climes. Presumably you can grow a potato in France too if you want to mix things up, but don't hold me to that.
</p>
<p>
Farming Simulator 22 squeezes in 400 machines and tools from over 100 real agricultural brands, alongside a "multitude of new gameplay features" - including a new character creator, an expanded build mode, and new ground working options including mulching and stone picking. Best of all, Farming Simulator 22 features cross-platform multiplayer support so you can build your agricultural empire with friends.
</p>

</a>

<p>
If, after all that, you're ready to straddle a tractor and trundle off into the great unknown, Farming Simulator 22 can be <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/farming-simulator-22">permanently added to your Epic Games Store library</a> right now - and the offers remains available until next Thursday, 30th May.
</p>
<p>
As for what comes after, that's currently under wraps. Expect next week's "mystery game" (as Epic is referring to it at present) to be revealed just as soon as Farming Simulator 22 steps aside.
</p>

In the 40K lore, these seals are affixed to the armor of space marines and other members of the Imperium forces who have proven their "purity of faith in the Emperor" through victory in battle.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4306737-evowh40k.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4306737" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4306737-evowh40k.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4306737"></a><figcaption>Secretlab Titan Evo - Warhammer 40K Edition</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4306737-evowh40k.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4306738-%5Bsubimage%5Dsecretlabxwarhammer40%2C000_backrest.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4306739-%5Bsubimage%5Dsecretlabxwarhammer40%2C000_back.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4306740-%5Bsubimage2_gaming%5Dsecretlabxwarhammer40%2C000.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4306741-%5Bsubimage1_gaming%5Dsecretlabxwarhammer40%2C000.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4306742-%5Bmainimage_painting%5Dsecretlabxwarhammer40%2C000.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4306738,1300-4306739,1300-4306740,1300-4306741,1300-4306742" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1701/17013431/4306738-%5Bsubimage%5Dsecretlabxwarhammer40%2C000_backrest.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1701/17013431/4306739-%5Bsubimage%5Dsecretlabxwarhammer40%2C000_back.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1701/17013431/4306740-%5Bsubimage2_gaming%5Dsecretlabxwarhammer40%2C000.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1701/17013431/4306741-%5Bsubimage1_gaming%5Dsecretlabxwarhammer40%2C000.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1701/17013431/4306742-%5Bmainimage_painting%5Dsecretlabxwarhammer40%2C000.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4306738-%5Bsubimage%5Dsecretlabxwarhammer40%2C000_backrest.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4306739-%5Bsubimage%5Dsecretlabxwarhammer40%2C000_back.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4306740-%5Bsubimage2_gaming%5Dsecretlabxwarhammer40%2C000.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4306741-%5Bsubimage1_gaming%5Dsecretlabxwarhammer40%2C000.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4306742-%5Bmainimage_painting%5Dsecretlabxwarhammer40%2C000.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Aside from the aesthetic differences, the Warhammer 40K edition Titan Evo sports all the same features as the standard Titan Evo line, including the four-directional armrests and dynamic four-way lumbar support built directly into the back.</p><p dir="ltr">The Warhammer 40K edition Titan Evo gaming chair is available now for $624 at <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%2F%3Fid%3D225336X1707200%26xs%3D1%26xcust%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fsecretlab.co%2Fpages%2Fwarhammer40000&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsecretlab-announces-a-warhammer-40k-space-marine-editon-titan-evo-gaming-chair%2F1100-6523650%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Secretlab's online store</a>.

<p data-characters="280" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">After selecting play in <em>XDefiant</em>, there should be the option to either player Unranked, Ranked, or the Practice Zone. However, Practice Zone is mysteriously unavailable at launch, and <em>XDefiant</em> executive producer Mark Rubin shed some light on when the game mode will be available. </p> <p data-characters="502" data-current-count="502" data-injectable="true">Before jumping right into a match in <em>XDefiant</em>, players could start in the Practice Zone and learn the controls in an obstacle course of test weapons in a firing range. The firing range was an especially useful tool, as it allowed players to test out different attachments, and the firing range dummies had exact damage values from different ranges. This made it easy to tell which weapons did more damage than others and provided a testing ground for users to get more comfortable with their loadouts. </p>
 <p data-characters="327" data-current-count="327" data-injectable="false">After being available during the public test sessions, players assumed the Practice Zone would be available at launch. However, the game mode is currently unavailable and was listed in the year one roadmap <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/xdefiant/news/sPz4QJDRBDgOJIYUnflBf/xdefiant-launch-date" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog</a> as a feature to be added later. Fortunately, Rubin stepped in and reassured players before frustrations boiled over.</p> <h2 id="h-when-is-practice-zone-coming-to-xdefiant" data-injectable="false">When is Practice Zone coming to <em>XDefiant </em>?</h2> <figure data-current-count="627" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="223" data-current-count="223" data-injectable="false">XDefiant YouTuber NerosCinema <a href="https://x.com/NerosCinema/status/1793695364366671909" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a>, “It’s a bit odd that the <em>XDefiant</em> Practice Zone still isn’t available. It was in previous play tests and was fantastic for testing everything in the game out.” </p> <p data-characters="274" data-current-count="497" data-injectable="true">Rubin <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1793718989144965475" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">responded</a>, “It’s coming with the first patch or soon (hour or so) after the patch goes live to be specific. Next question, when is the first patch? Glad you asked, but I can’t tell you yet but it should be before the weekend if all goes well.” </p>
 <p data-characters="175" data-current-count="175" data-injectable="false">The <em>XDefiant</em> dev wouldn’t provide a specific date, but players should keep an eye on the official <a href="https://x.com/PlayXDefiant" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter account</a> for any information on the title’s first update. </p>

<p data-characters="238" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Less than 24 hours after <em>Wuthering Waves</em> officially launched, developer Kuro Game Studio has announced an upcoming patch to fix some of the technical issues currently plaguing players as well as <strong>a compensation reward of 10 Lustrous Tides</strong>.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dear Rovers,<br>Wuthering Waves has officially launched worldwide, and we are immensely grateful for the support of our players. We have identified some issues that have impacted your gaming experience and are now actively working on solutions. We are committed to constant…</p>— Wuthering Waves (@Wuthering_Waves) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wuthering_Waves/status/1793738245575967207?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 23, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <h2 id="h-the-waves-are-a-wuthering" data-injectable="false">The Waves are a Wuthering</h2> <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="619" data-injectable="true">It’s been a somewhat rocky start for <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, with players suffering from all sorts of tedious issues including problems downloading and installing, crashes in-game, and even some players who have still not been able to get in and play. Hopefully, these upcoming solutions will fix some of those problems.</p>
 <p data-characters="387" data-current-count="387" data-injectable="false">As for the compensation…honestly, a free 10 Lustrous Tides is no paltry gift. It amounts to a full 10-pull on the current Beginner’s Choice Convene banner which after 80 pulls gives you a guaranteed Resonator of your choice. You can also use it on the standard default Character Permanent Convene banner that has no added bonuses. Has <em>Genshin Impact</em> ever done this? Recently?</p> <p data-characters="296" data-current-count="683" data-injectable="true"> Monetarily it would require 1,600 Astrite—which would require 1,600 Lunite to convert because you know, gacha—that would set you back $29.99 to acquire through the Store. While you can’t directly buy 1,600 Lunite, you can buy 1,980 for $29.99 which would be the cheapest way to get it.</p>
 <p data-characters="467" data-current-count="467" data-injectable="true">Ironically, in the time it took for me to type this up, you may have already received your free 10 Lustrous Tides. If you don’t see it in your mailbox, try logging out and back in. According to the tweet, the gift should have been sent out to all players who have achieved Union Level 2 or above at 6 pm EST on May 23, 2024. If you haven’t started <em>Wuthering Waves</em> yet, you have until July 2, 2024 at 4 pm EST to reach Union Level 2 and receive the reward.</p>
 <p data-characters="80" data-current-count="80" data-injectable="false">Oh in case you’re wondering, I got nothing good with my 10 Lustrous Tides.</p>

  <p id="U5Hl9C">You’ll find <strong>hidden stone faces</strong> scattered throughout <em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</em>. Finding these collectibles — and focusing on them — will open a new path leading to a tree containing a bit of lore. </p>
<p id="YHN8jO">Our <em>Hellblade 2</em> guide will show you <strong>where to find all 17 hidden faces</strong> in <em>Senua’s Saga</em>. We’ll break them down by chapter below. When you open the Chapters screen, you’ll be able to select a subsection of each chapter. We’ll also note which subsection the hidden stone faces appear in if you want to go back and find any you missed.</p>

<h2 id="GKnaC8"><strong>Hidden faces rewards in Hellblade 2</strong></h2>
<p id="lcTLnr">Each hidden face you find will reveal a secret path when you <strong>focus</strong> on it. Down that path, you’ll find a small tree — a version of Yggdrasil. Focusing on the tree will give you a snippet of lore.</p>

<p data-characters="261" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It turns out the real <em>Stellar Blade </em>was all the bosses we met along the way. If you fancy yourself a fan of the action game’s bolder battles, you’ll soon be able to hone in on them when the new Boss Challenge mode arrives in a free update on May 24.</p> <p data-characters="247" data-current-count="247" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/05/23/stellar-blade-adds-new-boss-challenge-mode-on-may-24/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The patch</a> will add new Nano Suits, updated convenience features, and the aforementioned Boss Challenge.

The more basic the preset, the more challenging the boss fights will be. On the other hand, choosing the maximum preset with all the necessary skills and buffed stats will give you a chance to thrash bosses in style.&nbsp;</p>

If you’ve already seen everything <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-stellar-blade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Stellar Blade</em></a> has to offer, this sounds like a good reason to take Eve back out on the battlefield.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24163569/steam-games-when-you-die-will-estate-planning<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="MA8zvO">You’re going to die one day. We all will. But what happens to your library of digital games when you do? It might not be the first order of business for your family or friends, but digital assets <em>do</em> have value — some people spend thousands of dollars over the course of their lifetime on video games, plenty of which are likely digital, through a storefront like Valve Corp.’s Steam.</p>
<p id="YUdpZA">A ResetEra forum user, <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/to-anyone-who-is-curious-no-you-cannot-transfer-your-steam-account-via-a-will-you-can-only-take-your-games-to-your-graves.875634/">delete12345</a>, reached out to Steam customer support in May to ask: <em>Can I put my Steam library in my will?</em> You can, technically, if you pass along your login information — don’t forget two-factor authentication! — but the games you’ve purchased aren’t actually transferable to another person. The answer delete12345 got was effectively, <em>We’re sorry</em>, <em>but no</em>. (Polygon has reached out to Valve for clarification.)</p>

<p id="K55QHe">It seems pretty preposterous that you can’t pass down something that you own, but the thing is, you <em>don’t</em> own the games in your Steam library. The same goes for games purchased from other digital stores, like Microsoft’s and Sony’s online storefronts. Digital games are merely licensed digital assets. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/#:~:text=The%20Content%20and%20Services%20are%20licensed%2C%20not%20sold.">Valve states this clearly in the Steam user agreement</a>: “The Content and Services are licensed, not sold.” You can argue that physical discs are glorified license keys, but the important detail there is that those licenses are transferable: You can legally lend your game to a friend for them to play, or sell it off entirely.</p>
<p id="QMIHZH">It’s an issue that’s not unique to video games, according to Texas Tech University School of Law professor Gerry W. Beyer and fiduciary officer Kerri G. Nipp. Beyer and Nipp <a href="https://epj.us/article/94177-estate-planning-for-cyber-property-electronic-communications-cryptocurrency-non-fungible-tokens-and-the-metaverse">wrote in Estate Planning Journal</a> about an <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2012/09/03/tech/web/bruce-willis-itunes/index.html">ultimately erroneous report</a> that actor <a href="https://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/chtlj/vol29/iss4/5/">Bruce Willis wanted to sue Apple</a> over his iTunes music library, which he wanted to leave to his children. Regardless of the veracity of the original claim, it brought the issue to the mainstream: The user agreement you click through when purchasing digital assets, like games, means you’ve agreed to the platform’s licensing deal. Some digital storefronts have rules, too, regarding account ownership and password sharing, which puts another wrinkle into the transaction. <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/1662-E814-CA77-240E">Steam’s terms of service</a>, for instance, forbid account sharing. <a href="https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2023/11/california-becomes-latest-state-to-regulate-digital-assets">Some states have laws regarding digital assets</a>, but they largely apply to virtual currency — and, again, the licensing thing complicates the matter. </p>
<p id="2urvbE">Lawyer Claudine Wong <a href="https://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1573&amp;context=chtlj">wrote in the Santa Clara High Technology Law Journal</a> in 2013 that “digital content is transferable to a deceased user’s survivors if legal copies of that content are located on physical devices, such as iPods or Kindle e-readers.” That presumably extends to your laptop, meaning that a laptop loaded with games could be added to a will and passed on. “So far there is no dispute that the devices, and the works fixed to them, can be passed on,” Wong wrote. But it’s less clear when it comes to the digital content itself being accessed elsewhere. Regardless of the legality of it all, Wong suggested that you put your full wishes into your will anyway. “[An] estate plan is an expression of what he desires should happen after his death, and knowing what he wanted provides his family with compelling arguments against the service providers,” Wong said.</p>
<p id="1WoJBV">What’s clear is that video game preservation in our increasingly digital world continues to present issues for users. As more games go online or digital-only, access is largely controlled by a publisher. This has been a challenge, historically, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/fate-future-video-game-preservation-you/">for video game preservationists</a>, but it seems to be a looming issue as we all age, too.</p>
<p id="VhVrSC"><strong>Update: </strong>This story has been updated to clarify that Polygon has reached out to Valve for comment.</p>

Luisa, the heroine of this adventure, is actually anything but. She’s a hard-working junior at a law firm who hits the books all day and rots all weekend. By the time she’s en route to the Austrian Alps to vacation, Luisa’s feeling pretty empty inside and hoping that a quick trip to the mountains will rekindle the magic in her life, and she does mean that quite literally.</p><div data-video-id="195281" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="11 Minutes With Baldur’s Gate 3’s Character Creator" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="684" data-playlist="195281,195618,194600" data-current="195281"><div><p>11 Minutes With Baldur’s Gate 3’s Character Creator</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195281/195281_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195281/195281_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195281/195281_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195281/195281_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20744.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>You see, in <em>Dungeons of Hinterberg</em>, magic has quite literally invaded the Alps. Humanity has managed to corral (and even commodify) said magic, but it’s still there and it’s pretty wondrous. Luisa hasn’t booked a stay out there to just sit amongst the trees; instead she’s gone out there to become a part-time slayer. In Hinterberg, pharmacies sell healing potions and people from around the world become revelrous adventurers with a zeal for life that they might not otherwise be able to cultivate in their day-to-day. In Hinterberg, goo-like monsters assume the shape of creatures from local folklore and do battle with vacationing slayers who buy equipment with a made-up currency used expressly for magical items. In Hinterberg, 25 magical dungeons have appeared and Luisa believes that tackling them will fix her ills. And it’s here that our journey begins.</p><p>Recently, developer Microbird released a preview of the game, encompassing the first two days and dungeons of the game. Though I expected to like it, as I’ve enjoyed simply looking at the game for years, I was surprised by what a pleasant adventuring experience <em>Dungeons of Hinterberg </em>provided. </p><p>Everything about <em>Dungeons of Hinterberg </em>is comforting. It is the latest in a line of games whose visuals suggest the work of artist and cartoonist Moebius, like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sable-the-kotaku-review-1847762599&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sable-the-kotaku-review-1847762599"><em>Sable</em></a></span><em> </em>or <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/this-jet-set-radio-spiritual-successor-continues-to-blo-1848309992&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/this-jet-set-radio-spiritual-successor-continues-to-blo-1848309992"><em>Bomb Rush Cyberfunk</em></a></span>, and much like the former, <em>Dungeons of Hinterberg </em>feels floaty. Luisa runs, but her movement feels closer to a seamless glide. In combat, her dodge roll and swipes feel more elegant and less labored than something like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/what-dark-souls-is-really-all-about-5874599&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/what-dark-souls-is-really-all-about-5874599"><em>Dark Souls</em></a></span>. As she runs toward a chasm, Luisa jumps of her own accord and satisfyingly latches onto clingable surfaces. The score is as serene as the luscious, pop-filtered visuals of the alpine landscape, and the people you meet are all charming characters that feel freshly ripped from the pages of a children’s book. At just about every point in my demo, the NPCs I interacted with felt like they’d bandage me up if I got a boo-boo or regale me with the simplistic morals of the fables I was treated to in grade school. And though I’ve never been one for games that err towards coddling me, I couldn’t help but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/best-cozy-games-disney-dreamlight-valley-chill-relaxing-1848255535&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/best-cozy-games-disney-dreamlight-valley-chill-relaxing-1848255535"><em>want </em>to be swaddled</a></span> by <em>Dungeons of Hinterberg.</em></p><p>All the while, the titular dungeons present breezy environmental puzzles and encounters to work through. <em>Dungeons of Hinterberg </em>rarely felt challenging in these opening two hours, though glimpses at future dungeons do lead me to believe that matters will definitely escalate. For now, I actually relished seeing a puzzle, like a minecart and a series of switchable tracks in the second dungeon, and simply being able to piece it together with minimal friction. Sometimes, it is wonderful to just feel like you’re on the same page as a game, and less like it’s bumping up against you, and <em>Dungeons of Hinterberg </em>absolutely felt like the former in my brief time with it.</p><p>When Luisa isn’t cosplaying as a dungeoneer, she’s back in Hinterberg resting up and forging new bonds. I didn’t realize that <em>Dungeons of Hinterberg </em>also housed a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-persona-social-links-1851092540&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-persona-social-links-1851092540">social and calendar system</a></span> a la <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-remake-review-ps5-steam-pc-xbox-1851201927&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-remake-review-ps5-steam-pc-xbox-1851201927"><em>Persona</em></a></span>, which breaks up the action with moments of tenderness and reflection. After a tough first outing in which the tutorial dungeon uncharacteristically begins to collapse on Luisa, she befriends a more experienced slayer named Alex, who eventually unlocks a social menu for you. This allows players to see characters they have and haven’t met, and offers a preview of the rewards for interacting with them, such as a boost to your MP or an unlockable photo mode. Spending time with them will pass a certain chunk of the day, meaning that folks will have to ration their time wisely.</p><p>The blend of these systems with <em>Dungeons of Hinterberg</em>’s otherwise cozy visuals and tone make the game feel oddly healing. Luisa is desperately in need of this reprieve from work and the obligations of her real life in the big city, and something about that resonates with me. I too want to run away to the woods, find magic, and get back in touch with my inner child after all. But even outside of that resonating chord, <em>Dungeons of Hinterberg </em>just strikes me as a break from the cacophony of boisterous blockbuster games and off-kilter indie oddities. It is, instead, this comforting and soft middle ground that I feel so rarely comes along, and I want to jump into it and just drown out the noise of everything else. In Hinterberg, at least, that feels entirely feasible.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But today, the team's pledged to put more resources into the "core game experience."</p><p>The Sims released a statement on the matter earlier today, in which the team acknowledged that "technical issues with The Sims 4 have interrupted your gameplay over time and we recognize that this has caused you much frustration."</p><p>"Today," the statement continued, "we can share that we have assembled a team to invest in the core game experience, including tackling your reported concerns. This newly formed and focused team means we'll be able to increase both the number of fixes and the frequency with which we ship these batched updates."</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— The Sims (@TheSims) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheSims/status/1793661216319308202?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 23, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>The plan moving forward, according to the statement, is to release a patch roughly every two months, with the first coming later this month. EA published the details of this first patch in a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/laundry-list-may-23-2024?utm_campaign=sims4_hd_ww_ic_soco_twt_qol-ll-ig&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;cid=80373&amp;ts=1716492723293" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Laundry List" on its website</a>. And, true to the "Laundry List" title, it mostly is a litany of fixes for small (albeit frustrating) bugs, ranging in everything from a "trash can is required" message appearing on lots that already have one to traversal issues with puppies and kitties.</p><p>But, behind the bug fixes, the team promises to "continue making core improvements to the performance of The Sims 4." To that end, the statement says the next patch will include some optimizations across platforms so The Sims 4 uses less memory.</p><p>"As a result, you may experience fewer crashes, a better frame rate, and/or a more responsive simulation," it adds.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/23/image-71-1716494650678.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The Sims 4 is promising more bug fixes and performance improvements. (Image courtesy of EA)</figcaption></figure></output><p>As the devs acknowledge, bugs and performance have long been points of consternation among fans, so the community's reaction to today's news was largely positive on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Sims4/comments/1cyvdf6/the_sims_team_addressing_technical_issues_with/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the game's subreddit</a>, if a little cautious in their optimism. </p><p>"They did an in game survey about [DLC] for rent that seemed to ask a lot about how unplayable it was, I wonder if that had anything to do with this," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Sims4/comments/1cyvdf6/comment/l5c3uf3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote one user</a>.

It's been months, however, since we got <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-sims-devs-talk-about-animal-crossing-all-the-time-while-crafting-multiplayer-for-project-rene">any updates on that</a>, and EA said last September that it was still in the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-sims-5-will-be-free-to-download-ea-confirms">"early stages" of development</a>.</p><p>In the meantime, the team has vowed to continue supporting The Sims 4, both in today's statement and in prior ones.</p><p>"Our team is more dedicated than ever to developing great The Sims 4 gameplay experiences into the foreseeable future," the statement concludes, "and we appreciate your support as these critical improvements roll out." </p><p><em>Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/xdefiant-becomes-fastest-ubisoft-title-reach-one-million-unique-players/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=xdefiant-becomes-fastest-ubisoft-title-reach-one-million-unique-players<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="149" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>XDefiant’s</em> launch day experienced a rough series of server issues, but that didn’t get in the way of a landmark achievement for Ubisoft. </p> <p data-characters="606" data-current-count="606" data-injectable="true">Insider Gaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that <em>XDefiant </em>brought in one million unique players within two and a half hours of its launch, which is remarkable given the unfortunate server circumstances. When the new free-to-play title went live, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-fix-xdefiant-unable-to-find-match-playlist-not-found-error/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">matchmaking issues</a> prevented players from consistently finding matches for several hours. Even so, the the slip-up didn’t result in a loss of interest, and Ubisoft may have a hit on its hands. Insider Gaming added that after 48 hours, <em>XDefiant</em> has over three million unique players and around 300,000 concurrent players, including a peak concurrent player count of 500,000. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Ubisoft</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="354" data-current-count="654" data-injectable="true">For the cherry on top, the report claims that <em>XDefiant</em> became Ubisoft’s fastest title to reach one million unique players. It certainly helps that the arena shooter is free-to-play. However, it’s safe to say that this is still a resounding success story, given the project’s turbulent development period, which included several delays. </p>
 <p data-characters="397" data-current-count="397" data-injectable="false">As for what’s next, Ubisoft has plans to keep players invested long-term. After a six week preseason period, <em>XDefiant</em> will receive a new seasonal update every three months. Over the course of the title’s first year, there will be four factions, 12 weapons, and 12 new maps added. In addition, the devs plan on adding a Ranked Play game mode, private matches, and other new game modes. </p> <p data-characters="483" data-current-count="880" data-injectable="false">This is all in addition to the 14 maps, five maps, five factions, and 24 weapons <em>XDefiant</em> launched with. Players have raised issues with a few problems, such as the title’s <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xdefiants-weapon-progression-is-criminally-slow-and-fans-want-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“criminally slow”</a> weapon progression, but reception has overall been positive. In saying that, Ubisoft will have its hands full retaining interest, as Treyarch recently pushed to steal back the spotlight after releasing a series of teasers for the upcoming <em>Call of Duty </em>title<em>, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/call-of-dutys-black-ops-6-logo-has-been-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a>.</em> </p>

With fully voiced characters and a pitch-perfect smokey jazz soundtrack, <em>Duck Detective</em> has enough charm to keep you engaged throughout. Visually it’s a delight too; the two-dimensional characters move through 3D environments with satisfying waddling animations and excellent artwork. </p><p>Unraveling mysteries involves Mad Lib-like puzzles based on what you can discern from the environment, and from chatting with NPCs around the bus depot’s office, interviewing everyone from the manager, customer service agents, and the very jaded and over-it penguin janitor. You can visually inspect each character for notable details to discern elements of their personality, as well as ask them specific questions about evidence you’ll come across as you start to crack the case. </p><figure id="" data-id="bead541a9e744abb943db26bebd2097a" data-recommend-id="image://bead541a9e744abb943db26bebd2097a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot from Duck Detective shows a word puzzle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Duck Detective shows a word puzzle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Happy Broccoli Games / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bead541a9e744abb943db26bebd2097a" data-recommend-id="image://bead541a9e744abb943db26bebd2097a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot from Duck Detective shows a word puzzle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Duck Detective</em> can be a bit of a challenging experience. It’s definitely a game you can chill out to based on its vibes, but you’ll need to pay a bit more attention to it than you might expect. Each of the Mad Lib-style puzzles require you to talk to a number of NPCs before piecing together everything you learned. But this is no creative exercise. Though there are some alternate outcomes based on your decisions, cracking each part of the case requires guessing the right words in each puzzle’s sentence.</p><p>I’d be lying if I said I didn’t brute force my way through some of these puzzles by just cycling through the options for each sentence until I got it right. Inelegant, and definitely not in the spirit of the challenges, I know. But in my defense, <em>Duck Detective</em> was actually a reminder for me that I don’t do well with Mad Lib-style games. There is an optional “Story Mode” that highlights wrong answers for you, which I ended up using. Also, while the entire playspace of <em>Duck Detective</em> consists of a lobby, office, kitchen, parking lot, managerial office, and a server room, the loading screens in between each area wore on me. They weren’t necessarily long, but as I ran around getting clues from each character, I started to get a little tired of the few seconds of a loading screen each time. </p><p>It helps that there are some amusing lines during each cutscene, such as facts about how likely ducks are to pay their taxes, how many of them are in existence, and what their relationship is with skateboarding. </p><figure id="" data-id="ed4793f36f22c0daf9a65410896b64aa" data-recommend-id="image://ed4793f36f22c0daf9a65410896b64aa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a loading screen with the text: &quot;Did you know?

Yes, I struggled to figure out what was going on. Perhaps that just means I’m a bad detective. Or a bad duck. Either way, the charm and polish of this game makes for a breezy indie title you can move through in under three hours.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For instance, there’s a vault in Riley’s inner world where she hides her deepest darkest secrets, and inside, among other things, is a video game character named Lance Slashblade who Riley had a crush on at a young age. And Riley, I’ll tell you now: that shit might feel cringe to you as a teenager, but when you reach your 20s and 30s and become dangerously online, you will flaunt your thirst for fictional characters like the rest of us. Embrace it early.</p><p>Lance is described as a<em> Final Fantasy</em>-style swordsman who is prone to glitching, and was compared to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-shadow-keanu-reeves-reaction-1851414208&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-shadow-keanu-reeves-reaction-1851414208">Keanu Reeves’</a></span> Duke Caboom from <em>Toy Story 4</em> as offering a similar brand of comic relief.</p><figure id="" data-id="6eca36ba5b9c23b534e421530ddf8718" data-recommend-id="image://6eca36ba5b9c23b534e421530ddf8718" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Renders of Lance Slashblade." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Renders of Lance Slashblade." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney / Pixar</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6eca36ba5b9c23b534e421530ddf8718" data-recommend-id="image://6eca36ba5b9c23b534e421530ddf8718" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Renders of Lance Slashblade." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>“When you’re a teenager, when you’re not dating, you start to develop crushes. And sometimes they’re not just on people; they’re on cartoon characters,” director Kelsey Mann told <em>Total Film</em>. “That’s speaking from experience! Or videogame characters. We thought, ‘Oh, that would be so great. Riley could have a crush on a video game character. We could animate that character like he’s from a videogame, and have that kind of look – that kind of pixelated look.’ We were like, ‘That could be really fun to do, and hopefully something that’s really relatable to a lot of people.’”<br></p><p>The <em>Final Fantasy </em>comparison is enough to get my mind racing over how this character could appear in <em>Kingdom Hearts IV</em>. The Pixar levels were some of the best parts of <em>Kingdom Hearts III</em>, so it’s not out of the realm of possibility that Sora might visit an <em>Inside Out </em>world in his next adventure. Lance would make a pretty sensible party member if Heartless started showing up in Riley’s mind. You can imagine scenes in which they start affecting Riley’s emotions and actions in the real world, and it’s up to Sora, Donald, Goofy, and Lance to help balance things out. It writes itself, y’all. Even if Sora doesn’t go to an <em>Inside Out </em>world, Lance could easily be a summon that helps our hero in battle.</p><p>At this point, it’s still unclear when <em>Kingdom Hearts IV </em>is coming out.

"Most screens are fundamentally made up of a grid of pixels, and you have to do a lot of extra work to hide that fact. Pixel art embraces it instead. A lot of people think the main point of modern pixel art is to create nostalgia for older games, and Animal Well certainly has some of that. But I think there are also a lot of other good timeless qualities about it. In the same way people appreciate tile mosaics, it is satisfying seeing a form be abstracted, and more open to interpretation. I think limitations encourage creativity."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He noted that he created the particularly disturbing (or entrancing!) animations with "creative coding," with techniques developed alongside the game's engine.

I'm using normal maps for the background art along with a ton of dynamic lighting stuff.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/indie-live-expo-when-where-to-watch/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=indie-live-expo-when-where-to-watch<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="277" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Indie Live Expo is Japan’s premiere online digital showcase series that aims to connect fans with indie games worldwide. It’s also one of the most packed events you could ever watch, with this year’s boasting more than 150 indie games to sink your teeth into.</p> <p data-characters="424" data-current-count="424" data-injectable="true">Of course, Indie Live Expo is an event produced in Japan, so the timings don’t always match up with when you might be available. For example, I had to be up well into the early morning for last year’s event, but 2024 seems to have a slightly more approachable schedule. To make sure you don’t miss a single reveal, I’ve outlined where and when you can watch the event across every available platform.</p>
 <h2 id="h-when-and-where-to-watch-indie-live-expo-2024" data-injectable="false">When and where to watch Indie Live Expo 2024</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="INDIE Live Expo 2024.5.25 (English)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FMEflpy4t0g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="299" data-current-count="599" data-injectable="true">Indie Live Expo 2024 will start at <strong>5 p.m JST/1 a.m. PT/9 a.m. BST on May 25</strong>. Mercifully, it’s a Saturday, so whether you’ve got to stay up well into the night or get an early start if you want to catch it, you’ve got Sunday to recover from all the indie reveals and announcements. </p>
 <p data-characters="161" data-current-count="161" data-injectable="false">While there will likely be a host of co-streams for the event with dozens of creators, there are three official livestreams you can watch. These are as follows. </p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="281" data-injectable="false"> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMEflpy4t0g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>YouTube</strong></a></li> <li><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/indie_live_expo_jp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Twitch</strong></a></li> <li><a href="https://x.com/INDIELiveExpoEN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Twitter/X</strong></a></li> </ul> <p data-characters="343" data-current-count="624" data-injectable="true">I’ve included the official YouTube video for the livestream in this article above. If you can’t wait to talk about indies with everyone else who will be watching, you can head to the channel and sit in the chat. The Twitch and Twitter/X livestreams likely won’t go live until the event itself has begun or is about to start. </p>
 <p data-characters="345" data-current-count="345" data-injectable="false">Last year, I found that the YouTube livestream was the best way to watch the event because it seemed to be both the most stable and the most up-to-date. In some cases, Twitch is where a showcase is streamed to initially before being diverted to other platforms, but it seemed like YouTube was the priority in 2023, so it could be again in 2024. </p> <p data-characters="462" data-current-count="807" data-injectable="true">While Indie Live Expo isn’t giving much away when it comes to the games it has to show, it has revealed a few we can expect to see at some point during the showcase. These are <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzRzwSSRRjo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Piggy One Super Spark</a></em>, a hyperkinetic platformer by Hanabushi and Hako Life, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2403290/Boyhoods_End/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Boyhood’s End</em></a>, an adventure game following the boy with the lowest human score in the universe, and <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2525810/Witch_and_Lilies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Witch &amp; Lilies</a></em>, a 3D dungeon-crawler where you foster relationships between the characters. </p>
 <p data-characters="332" data-current-count="332" data-injectable="false">The concepts of these games are far more niche than what you might be used to, and the showcase is almost certainly going to bring more of them to the table. However, each title isn’t wacky or different for the sake of it. They’re titles real people cared about enough to make into games so others could enjoy them, too.</p>

<p>As long-time fans of the franchise, we can count on a brand-new Call of Duty launching annually, usually around the end of the year before the holiday break. But sometimes, keeping track of so many new and upcoming releases is tough. So, what’s the newest Call of Duty?</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-most-recent-call-of-duty">What is the Most Recent Call of Duty?</h2>



<p>If we’re talking about the most recent currently available Call of Duty, then it’s the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/modern-warfare-3-was-the-best-selling-game-for-january-2024-suicide-squad-was-3rd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best-selling Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</a>. It’s come a long way since launch. Despite the poor reception to the campaign, which is still as short as ever, the multiplayer aspect remains a ton of fun. I mean, seriously, you can <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-as-snoop-dogg-in-call-of-duty-warzone-and-mw3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">play as Snoop Dogg</a>!</p>



<p>Of course, you can find an active community on most Call of Duty games, including some old titles, such as Call of Duty: World at War. But if you don’t want to queue or hunt down an active server, then, without a doubt, the best place to play Call of Duty is Warzone!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-s-the-next-upcoming-call-of-duty-game">What’s the Next Upcoming Call of Duty Game?</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Following a mess of teasers and cryptic messages from the studio, we know that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is coming this year. We’ve received word that it’ll launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-to-release-october-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October 25</a>. </p>



<p>There’s a chance the first-person shooter will launch on last-gen systems—PlayStation 4 and Xbox One—but there’s no telling just yet. Many developers and publishers recently started foregoing these systems in favor of future tech.</p>



<p>Either way, we can’t wait to see more of the Black Ops 6 gameplay, including multiplayer and zombies modes!</p>
