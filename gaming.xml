		<p>I don’t think anyone would have had <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fortnite">Fortnite</a> turning into a 5v5 FPS on their 2024 bingo cards, but here we are, as Epic has revealed Fortnite’s new Ballistic mode, launching on 11th December across all platforms, but with an Early Access label on it.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fortnite Ballistic Cinematic Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZcbOAdIFmaE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Fortnite Ballistic is a 5v5 round-based competitive shooter, looking to take a bite out of Counter-Strike’s cake. The two teams will take turns attacking and defending, with the attackers aiming to plant a reality-tearing Rift Point Device at one of two sites on the map, while defenders try to prevent this or defuse it before it can go off. Of course, you’ll also be able to win a round by taking out the whole opposing team.</p>
<p>The game is first to win 7 rounds, with attackers and defenders set in their role for 6 rounds before switching. Players will start off with a Ranger Pistol and 800 credits to spend on weapons, shields and gear between rounds, earning credits from scoring eliminations and planting the RPD.</p>
<p>So yeah, it’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/counter-strike-2">Counter-Strike</a> or what <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty">Call of Duty</a> calls Search and Destroy, and a real staple of the FPS genre as a whole. Both unranked and ranked queues will be available.</p>

<p>To start off, there will be a single map, Skyline 10, and a starting set of weapons and items. This is a starting point that Epic will look to build on, taking feedback to adjust the current offering and shape what is developed next.</p>
<p>Ballistic is a huge shift away from the bread and butter of Fortnite Battle Royale, with its third person view and building, though Fortnite has morphed over the last couple years into a sprawl of multiple game modes, collaborative franchises and IP, and user generated content. Within that space, Epic and their partners are able to bring new game modes and themes as part of the company’s long-term goal of building out a metaverse of online gaming – since last December, there’s been Lego Fortnite, Rocket Racing, and Fortnite Festival.</p>
<p>We’ve seen a similar shift back toward more traditional competitive shooters from Fortnite’s rivals, as well. Having started off with some limited time modes, Respawn permanently added Team Deathmatch, Gun Run and Control game modes to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> in early 2023.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> players have hit out at "AI slop" they believe has been used within the game and its promotional materials.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, players noticed a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h850ur/black_ops_6_loading_screen_look_at_the_hand/">six-figured zombified Father Christmas</a> had popped up on the loading screen, and whilst some fans simply attributed this as a nod to the fact this is the sixth Black Ops game, others alleged it was evidence that the art was machine-generated, as <a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/future-technology/why-ai-generated-hands-are-the-stuff-of-nightmares-explained-by-a-scientist">AI typically struggles to generate realistic-looking hands</a>.</p>

<p>More generous fans suggested the rogue digit could be the curb of a pavement behind the spooky Santa, or indeed just loose skin from a degloved finger giving the <em>impression</em> of a sixth finger.</p>
<p>Santa's teeth and moustache have also come under scrutiny.</p>

<p>"It's very clear that the game is full of AI," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops6/comments/1h8m2qy/this_is_unacceptable_at_this_point/">said</a> one player in a thread entitled, "this is unacceptable at this point".</p>
<p>"This alone is fucked but the fact the the zombies crew is almost fully recasted because they want to use AI to replicate the actors' voices so they can STOP PAYING THEM.</p>
<p>"I don't care if this isn't read by many but it's needs to be know how fucked and inexcusable this shit is. They are feeding us slop because they want to pay their millionaire executives a little bit more. It's ridiculous."</p><p>Last week, Activision announced it'll be giving those few remaining Call of Duty fans who haven't already bought this year's Black Ops 6 or played it through Game Pass the chance to get stuck in for free next week, as part of a seven-day trial. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-is-having-a-7-day-free-trial-starting-next-week">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's Free Trial starts next Friday, 13th December</a>, on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. It'll continue into the following week, wrapping up on Friday, 20th December.</p>
<p>"For a series built on high-octane thrills and explosive gratification, its withdrawal to the well-trodden formula echoes the wider industry's continued allergy to risk," Chris Tapsell wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review">Eurogamer's Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warframe">Warframe</a> developer Digital Extremes has given us another peek at its upcoming free-to-play fantasy action-MMORPG, Soulframe.</p>
<p>In a new <a href="https://youtube.com/live/dvLYxzGtfNc">developer stream</a>, Digital Extremes offered an update on the pre-alpha - known as Preludes - both at it currently stands, as well as "a glimpse at Preludes to come".</p>
<p>Creative director Geoff Crookes also reflected on how important community feedback was to development, saying "feedback from the community will always remain our north star".</p>

<p>"Ever since we started letting players get their hands on Soulframe earlier this year in our pre-alpha playtests, things have ramped up in the best way possible," Crookes said. "We've always had a greater vision for what we aspire Soulframe to be, but feedback from the community will always remain our north star.</p><p>"That community feedback paves a tailored roadmap on changes to make and focus on in our current Pre-Alpha around nearly every aspect of the game as we ramp things up for full public access," Crookes added. "We hear the feedback around combat and lack of social features, which is why you've seen those elements become major focuses for us as we add new things like social hubs."</p>
<p>For more, you can check out the teaser above, which shows off the player social hub and some new quests, as well as introduce some new NPCs (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/soulframe-shows-off-a-new-teaser-trailer-and-a-cool-giant-wolf-to-hang-out-with/">PC Gamer</a>).</p>
<p>"Even as Ode'n shadow spreads across Alca, the future of Soulframe: Preludes is bright, Envoys! Enjoy a preview of what's to come to Preludes in 2025," DE teases in the description.</p>
<p>Back in July 2022, Digital Extremes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframe-dev-announces-free-to-play-fantasy-action-mmorpg-soulframe">unveiled its first new property since Warframe's release</a> back in 2013. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframe-devs-free-to-play-fantasy-mmorpg-soulframe-shows-off-30-minutes-of-gameplay">Besides a 30-minute gameplay teaser this time last year</a>, though, we've seen very little else. Back in July, however, at TennoCon 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/soulframe-will-open-up-to-a-lot-more-players-this-autumn-says-digital-extremes">we finally got our first extended look at it</a>.</p>
<p>Soulframe will be Digital Extremes' first new game in over five years, following on from 2017's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframe-dev-hits-pause-on-deck-building-shooter-the-amazing-eternals">short-lived team-based FPS The Amazing Eternals</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Under this rumored partnership, Apple would begin selling Sony’s controllers, which aren’t currently available on their own.</p><p>Sony has apparently been working on adding the support for months, while Apple has asked third-party developers if they would take advantage of Sony’s VR controllers. That’s potentially great news for Vision Pro owners who wish the headset had more gaming chops. (There are precious few good, native visionOS games — <em>Thrasher, </em>a mesmerizing game where you fling a giant worm / dragon thing around a psychadelic space using just hand movements, comes to mind.) </p><p>Gurman writes that Apple also wants to use the controllers for more than gaming — the controllers will be able to navigate visionOS, and would offer more precise controls in apps like Final Cut Pro and Adobe Photoshop. Right now, you can pair a standard Bluetooth controller and navigate visionOS — tapping buttons to select things, scrolling with the analog sticks, and so on. They also work for gaming, but you’re mostly limited to iPad and iPhone games with controller support or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24139004/apple-app-store-retro-game-emulators-ios-console-ports-storystream">made-for-iOS emulators</a> or that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/10/24217643/vision-pro-nintendo-virtual-boy-emulator-virtualfriend-impressions">native Virtual Boy one</a>.</p><p>Will this partnership bear fruit and help games actually flourish on the platform? I’m not immediately hopeful, given the Vision Pro’s sales and Apple’s track record of support from game publishers.</p><p>Still, the Vision Pro is fundamentally different from Apple’s other devices, and VR is its own landscape. And there are signs the community wants this, with at least one <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/surreal-interactive/surreal-touch-1-controllers-for-apple-vision-pro">fully-funded Kickstarter project</a> to develop Meta Quest 3-style controllers, called the Surreal Touch, for the Vision Pro. Maybe the Vision Pro will get some great VR games — whether anyone will be around to buy them is another question entirely.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Whilst no specific reason was given on the <a href="https://www.classification.gov.au/titles/hunterhunter-nenimpact">ratings website itself</a> - in "reason for refused classification", it simply invites people to contact the organisation for more information - a <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-za/entertainment/other/hunter-x-hunter-fighting-game-refused-classification-in-australia-for-implied-sexual-violence-against-minors/ar-AA1v8DFO">statement</a> from the Australian Classification Board said the game “contains a scene of a visual depiction of implied sexual violence, where an adult male exposes himself to persons under the age of 18 years".</p><p>Hunter x Hunter's first full-fledged fighting game is set to release in 2025, featuring 3v3 Nen ability team battles. It's unclear at this time if publisher Arc System Works will appeal the decision or censor its game accordingly to appease the board.</p>

<p>There’s something eerily exciting about a game set in the ‘post-apocalypse’. They’re typically morbid, darker adventures that see players tackle all the threats that come with surviving in a world devastated by a virus or a nuclear holocaust, but despite those bleak elements, they’re often highly enjoyable experiences. In this list, we’re taking a look at the best post-apocalyptic games ever.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-best-post-apocalyptic-games">What Are The Best Post-Apocalyptic Games?</h2>



<p>There’s a huge library to work with, as post-apocalyptic games are traditionally quite good sellers that are able to ultimately stitch together expansive universes that traverse as a series of unique releases. Some of them will even go on to spawn post-apocalyptic movies, books, or television shows.</p>



<p>So, what are the best post-apocalyptic games? Let’s find out.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-fallout-4">1. Fallout 4</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Fallout 4 is easily one of the best post-apocalyptic games you’ll ever play. It’s expansive and it embodies the ‘wasteland vibe’ perfectly. It wasn’t a favourite of the die-hard Fallout fans because it became more ‘mainstream’ and sold out a little, but it’s a solid choice and offers hundreds of hours of entertainment in one of the most engaging maps in the game’s history.</p>







<h3 id="h-2-the-last-of-us">2. The Last of Us</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Last of Us (and later, Part II) was a smash hit when it was released back in 2013 exclusively on PlayStation 3. It became an overnight sensation and birthed one of the most memorable and emotional post-apocalyptic stories in gaming history. With the player getting the opportunity to travel across the outbreak-ravaged United States, it’s easily one of the top titles on offer in the post-apocalyptic scene.</p>







<h3 id="h-3-metro-exodus">3. Metro Exodus</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Metro is a legendary series that was a novel before it became a best-selling video game. In Metro, the player embarks on a perilous journey through the subways of Moscow, with the above-ground environment having been turned into a post-apocalyptic nightmare. In Exodus specifically, an open-world formula was introduced, and the player went far beyond Moscow…</p>



<h3 id="h-4-half-life-alyx">4. Half-Life: Alyx</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Half-Life: Alyx is one of the best VR games ever made, and it’s set in a gritty, harrowing post-apocalyptic world that never fails to keep you on your toes. Following a cataclysmic event during an experiment at a research facility, portals are torn open to alien worlds that instantly threaten Earth.</p>



<p>As Alyx, you’ll take a journey through a world torn apart by alien oppressors and invaders. Every step is fraught with danger, and you’ll need to scavenge, fight, and hide to survive. </p>



<h3 id="h-5-horizon-zero-dawn">5. Horizon Zero Dawn</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Horizon Zero Dawn (and later, Forbidden West) boasts a unique story that lends itself perfectly to this post-apocalyptic games list. It’s a gorgeous game on the surface, making use of cutting-edge technology to deliver a visual display that amazes the player. It’s marvellously well-written, boasts a star cast, and has some of the most innovative combat we’ve seen for years. </p>



<h3 id="h-6-gears-of-war-3">6. Gears of War 3</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>There’s no list of the best post-apocalyptic games that doesn’t include Gears of War – and in this case, we’re looking at the third game in the series. This all-out action-packed saga sees enormous men in hefty suits of armour fight to defend their home planet from an uprising of subterranean mutants.</p>



<h3 id="h-7-dying-light">7. Dying Light</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Dying Light (and 2022’s Dying Light 2) emerged into the post-apocalyptic world of games as one of the most fast-paced and high-octane titles in years. It dropped in 2015, bringing a parkour-fuelled, zombie-slaying adventure to gamers the world over. In Dying Light, the stage was set, and in Dying Light 2, the world fell so much deeper into its apocalypse.</p>



<h3 id="h-8-fallout-3">8. Fallout 3</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>We’ve already named Fallout 4 on this list, but a special space must be reserved for Fallout 3. This is easily one of the best post-apocalyptic games ever made, and it was a turning point for the franchise itself when it was released. It introduced gamers to a massive, open-world bursting at the seams with danger and destruction, and even fifteen years later, it’s still a fan-favourite game.</p>



<h3 id="h-9-left-4-dead">9. Left 4 Dead</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Left 4 Dead was designed to be a cooperative slayer of sorts, but it fared well as a single-player game nonetheless. If you’re listing the best zombie games, you can’t help but mention Left 4 Dead, and even though it has some years today, it remains one of the best post-apocalyptic games ever. It’s littered with bloodthirsty zombies, one-liner quips, and pure, unbridled violence.</p>



<h3 id="h-10-dead-rising">10. Dead Rising</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Dead Rising is an iconic zombie series that only just makes this list by way of technicality. It’s one of the best post-apocalyptic games, but in this series, it’s usually just one area that’s impacted by a zombie outbreak – like a town or a shopping mall. Regardless, all the Dead Rising games boast large, open worlds, thousands of zombies to slay, and more weapon-crafting mechanics than you could shake a sharp stick at. </p>

<p>Battlefield is one of the most tumultuous first-person shooter franchises ever made. It has fallen from grace in recent years, but once upon a time, it was a legitimate Call of Duty killer – or at least, it could have been. In this list, I’m breaking down all Battlefield games, ranking them from worst to best and determining where things went wrong for the series.</p>



<p>There are high expectations for the future of the series with Battlefield 6, which is set to be the most ambitious game the team has ever cooked up, but the proof will be in the final delivery, of course.</p>



<p>Without further ado, here’s the list – all Battlefield games, ranked.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-battlefield-games-ranked">All Battlefield Games, Ranked</h2>



<p>If you think our organisation of all the Battlefield games is a little off, feel free to mention that in the comments and we might consider jiggling our list around a little!</p>



<p><strong>Update: Based on some valuable feedback, we’ve made adjustments to the list. It’s encouraging to see such a loyal fanbase still exists that is passionate about Battlefield games both new and old!</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-12-battlefield-hardline">12. Battlefield Hardline</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Hardline was a strange paradigm shift that didn’t hit too well with the Battlefield community. It was sort of Battlefield as knew it, but it was fused with a ‘Cops vs. Robbers’ foundation that at no point lent itself to the classic Battlefield formula. It had an entertaining enough campaign and it was visually pleasing, but it just never at any point felt as though you were playing a Battlefield game.</p>



<h3 id="h-11-battlefield-vietnam">11. Battlefield Vietnam</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Battlefield Vietnam was released in 2004, exclusively on PC. It was the second Battlefield game ever, and for some, it seemed odd jumping from World War II to the jungles of Vietnam, but it was their game to make, I guess. It was a little more visceral than its predecessor but it didn’t move mountains, and aside from a brief Bad Company expansion, this theatre of war hasn’t been revisited.</p>



<h3 id="h-10-battlefield-1942">10. Battlefield 1942</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Battlefield 1942 is where it all began – way back in 2002. It was a remarkable game for the era and boasted near-unparalleled realism, and it easily became one of the best-selling games of the day. It kickstarted the entire franchise, but that’s not enough to rank it at the top of all Battlefield games. </p>







<h3 id="h-9-battlefield-2042">9. Battlefield 2042</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Battlefield 2042 launched in a terrible, heartbreaking condition but has been on a road of redemption ever since. It’s a tough one to place on the list of all Battlefield games, as those who never went back to it following its disappointing release will <strong>not </strong>remember it fondly. However, hundreds of changes have been made and it’s now at least a <strong>good </strong>game if not a great game. </p>



<h3 id="h-8-battlefield-v">8. Battlefield V</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Battlefield V has a bad rap, but it wasn’t a terrible title. It boasted some of the best features we’ve ever seen out of all Battlefield games, including construction, a sorely missed and personal favourite attribute of mine. It had gorgeous maps, exhilarating combat mechanics, great customisation options, a brilliantly mixed campaign, and plenty of post-launch content – and battle royale!</p>



<p>Sadly, it was also seen as the beginning of the downfall of the Battlefield franchise, and it couldn’t ever live up to the greatness of Battlefield 1, which was this game’s predecessor.</p>







<h3 id="h-7-battlefield-2142">7. Battlefield 2142</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Battlefield 2142 was an outlier – a futuristic title set two centuries beyond the ‘oldest’ Battlefield game. It wasn’t a terrible game by any means and boasted some highly enjoyable combat sequences and solid multiplayer, but it was an almost unexpected injection of innovation (or so they thought) into a series that had, until then, focused on real-world conflicts. Do we ever want to see mechs again in Battlefield? Probably not – but they were fine in 2142.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-battlefield-bad-company">6. Battlefield: Bad Company</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Bad Company, good game. This 2008 release introduced us to the foursome that we’d follow for a total of two releases. This was a Battlefield packed with humour, one-liners, and pleasing action sequences that unfolded over semi-linear maps, and it was great. Even today, we mourn the loss of Bad Company, and the servers were recently taken offline, too.</p>



<h3 id="h-5-battlefield-2">5. Battlefield 2</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Battlefield 2 is, according to Metacritic, the highest-ranked title out of all Battlefield games. It was technically the third game in the series, and it was a great step up from the first title that was launched three years prior. It was one of the most collaborative shooters of its time, making it a brilliant multiplayer option and one of the best team-based first</p>







<h3 id="h-4-battlefield-4">4. Battlefield 4</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Battlefield 4 boasted one of the best campaigns we’ve ever seen in the series, so much so that certain characters made a return in 2042 almost ten years later. It also featured one of the most balanced and memorable multiplayer modes in franchise history, which went hand-in-hand with fantastic destruction mechanics, multi-faceted combat roles, and some of the greatest maps we’ve ever seen.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-battlefield-bad-company-2">3. Battlefield Bad Company 2</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Bad Company 2 was a send-off of sorts for the sub-franchise, but to this day, fans are still expecting a resurgence. It took everything the first game did and improved upon it, introducing a better story, more quips, larger maps, and a more immersive multiplayer experience. It was released in 2010, but the next game to be released in the franchise would be so mighty that it would completely overshadow Bad Company 2.</p>







<h3 id="h-2-battlefield-1">2. Battlefield 1</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Out of all Battlefield games, Battlefield 1 was the most emotional, heart-wrenching title of them all. It was a cutting-edge experience that remains the best-selling Battlefield game ever, and it was iconic for the story mode alone. In the multiplayer offering, players discovered a brutally realistic, immersive ecosystem that felt incredible to play every single time. It felt authentic, it looked flawless, and it was a gritty and honest portrayal of one of human history’s most devastating wars.</p>



<h2 id="h-1-battlefield-3">1. Battlefield 3</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Battlefield 3 is the best Battlefield game ever made, period. It is a masterpiece of a first-person shooter, and despite launching way back in 2011, it still holds up to scrutiny today. It effortlessly competed against the likes of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, Killzone 3, and Crysis 2, and even if it didn’t come out on top in some of those bouts, it was a game that never refused to quit. </p>



<p>With stacks of post-launch content, some of the most instantly recognisable maps in franchise history, jaw-dropping visuals, and mountains of destruction, this truly was the Battlefield game to end all Battlefield games. It had a fantastic and gripping story and cooperative missions, and the multiplayer just felt so good to play over and over again.</p>

In it, host Steve Burke says the company is still misleading customers, despite adjustments made in response to his previous video in which he <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/1/24310181/nzxt-pc-rental-program-gamers-nexus-investigation">called the program</a> “a scam.”</p><p>NZXT <a href="https://nzxt.com/news/nzxt-update-addressing-your-concerns-about-the-flex-subscription-program">said in its response</a> this week that it would clarify details about its Flex program, which Gamers Nexus had criticized for having specs that would change sometimes “day-to-day.” The company has appeared to update specs and performance numbers for its purchase builds. But Gamers Nexus reports it still spotted issues like inconsistent FPS numbers and a FAQ that implied NZXT’s for-sale Player: Three Prime build uses an RTX 4090 graphics card, despite its specs saying otherwise. </p><p>The FAQ entry Burke mentions seems to be gone now, but as of this writing, there’s still an entry titled “What GPU is right for me?” that lists the RTX 4090 and its benefits. Such inconsistencies are a problem for potential customers, Burke says.</p><div><blockquote><p>The fact that NZXT misrepresented its product, even after its statement, as having a 4090 when it still had a 4080 Super ... seemingly indicates that even NZXT can’t keep up with its own specs changes. If NZXT can’t keep up with it ... how are they expecting the customer to keep up with it?</p></blockquote></div><p>Gamers Nexus offers other criticisms of the company’s rental program, from “improper packaging” damage fees with upper bounds that exceed the cost of equivalent non-rental versions of the PCs to the creator-based ad videos that continue to exist, despite the company saying it had “pulled all influencer-led Flex advertising.” NZXT did not immediately respond to our request for comment on the new video.</p><p>Gamers Nexus said Thursday that it’s working on a deeper investigation, and its video today ends with Burke saying he’s received “a number of very concerning tips” from former employees and customers. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>There's no perfect time to release a video game, but if I were deciding when to release one, do you know when I'd do it?

<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ballionaire">Ballionaire</a> apparently shares my thinking. The pachinko-inspired roguelike is launching on December 10th.

<p>"Pachinko-inspired" might conjure certain images, and recent pachinko roguelike <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peglin">Peglin</a> among them. Ballionaire takes a different tact, with no traditional goblin-based combat staredown at the top of the screen. Instead, players are charged with designing the pachinko bored itself, placing different kinds of pegs in advance of their ball's descent. Pegs include axes which cut you in half, so you continue tumbling in multiple directions, and teleporters, which shift you back to the top of the board. The aim is to collect as much cash as possible, with the gadgets helping to prolong and multiply your physicsy journey.
</p><p>There's then a roguelike wrapper around this bally good time: it's run-based, there are many different boards to encounter, there are between-board upgrades, and so on. There's also a sandbox mode if you just want some free balls, and best of all, mod support that allows folks to script their own pegs.
</p>
<p>Brendy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ballionaire-is-a-pachinko-roguelike-where-you-build-your-board-as-you-play">loved the demo</a> when he played it during Next Fest in October. That demo is no longer available, but I'm looking forward to giving the full game a go - whenever I manage to find the time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-rumored-to-launch-in-march-2025-following-tga-announcement/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Spanish leaker eXtas1s has heard that South of Midnight, the next game in development at Compulsion Games, might be featured at The Game Awards 2024 with a release window announcement for March 2025. The leaker revealed the rumor <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5xdIjl9pFg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in his latest YouTube video</a>, saying that Microsoft will have a lower key presence than previous TGA shows. Still, this announcement should tickle fans.</p>
<p>South of Midnight was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-is-a-new-ip-from-we-happy-few-studio-compulsion-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at Microsoft's Xbox and Bethesda Showcase in June 2023. Made by the same folks who released Contrast and We Happy Few, it is a third-person action adventure game set in a Gothic fantasy version of the Southern United States inspired by local folk tales. Protagonist Hazel is forced to become a Weaver, a magical mender of broken ties and spirits, after a hurricane strikes her hometown of Prospero. Armed with these new skills, Hazel must confront and subdue dangerous creatures to save her mother, untangle the webs of her own family's shared past, and possibly find her way to a place that feels like home.</p>
<p>Players will use an ancient power to restore creatures and uncover the traumas that consumed them. They can cast weaving magic to battle destructive Haints, explore the diverse regions of the south, and reweave the tears in the Great Tapestry. They'll explore the lush, decaying county of Prospero and its inhabitants while experiencing an artful, stop-motion-like visual style, not to mention haunting storytelling and music inspired by the complex and rich history of the South.</p>
<p>The developers recently said they're mainly focusing on storytelling rather than combat. Also, gamers can expect it to last around twelve hours, which is not a lot compared to most action adventure titles. However, the game will be available on Game Pass, which should make it more appealing for subscribers. South of Midnight is powered by Unreal Engine 4 and will be released on PC and Xbox Series S|X. The consoles will run the game at 60 frames per second.</p>

            <p>I had a few merry evenings playing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/escape-simulator">Escape Simulator</a> back in 2022. Of the co-op escape room games I've played, it was the best, both in terms of its relatively neutral framing (with little heavyhanded storytelling) and its pretty solid puzzle design. The game was expanded in the time since with a versus mode and several crossover DLC, and now there comes a sequel.
</p>
<p>Escape Simulator 2 will explore "darker escape room themes", looks visually more detailed, and comes with a new editor for those who wish to design their own escape rooms.

<p>Why a sequel, when the original was already being so regularly updated? "A sequel gives us a fresh start and lets us push the limits of the genre further," says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2879840/Escape_Simulator_2/">the Steam page</a>. "We were inspired to explore darker escape room themes and experiment with new gameplay and puzzle ideas. Splitting from the original game let us focus on improving key features like rendering, networking, physics, and animations."
</p><p>I'm not really sure what "darker" means in the context of solving silly pattern matching puzzles with my pals, but Pine Studio also clarify that although "darker and has a more mysterious vibe, it's not a horror game." It does not feature "any jump scares or gore." Good! That's not what I play these games for. I play them for the feeling of inferiority that comes from having my co-op mates solve all the puzzles faster than I can.
</p>
<p>The original Escape Simulator came with a toolkit with which community members made many, many escape rooms of their own. The sequel follows suit, but promises that Room Editor 2.0 will be "more powerful and intuitive", with fewer restrictions when compared the way they make the official rooms.
</p>
<p>There's no release date yet, but some of the locations at launch include Dracula's castle, a starship stranded after a collision, and a pirate ship. Until you can escape those you might like to try the original, and it's currently 50% reduced <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1435790/Escape_Simulator/">on Steam</a> - and it ain't exactly pricey to begin with.

Players will swap teams every six rounds and the game will end when a team wins seven rounds total. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All players will start a match with a Ranger Pistol and 800 Credits, and more credits can be earned by killing other players or planting the Rift Point Device. Credits can then be spent at the beginning of each round on weapons and items to help players and teams achieve victory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If players survive a round, they will get to keep their gear and shields. Items they use will not carry over, but they can drop weapons, smoke grenades, and flashbangs for their team or even pick them off of eliminated players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of items, players will be able to choose one of five Flex Gadgets that they alone will be able to purchase and use during a match. Each player can hold up to two of their Flex Gadgets in their inventory, and they can not be dropped or picked up by other players. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fortnite Ballistic Images: Weapons, Flex Gadgets, and Skyline 10 Map</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Flex Gadgets are as follows, via The Fortnite Team;</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Select the <strong>Proximity Mine </strong>to place a damaging mine down on the floor, wall, or ceiling to surprise an unsuspecting enemy.

Great for booby-trapping sites when defending!</li><li>The <strong>Bubble Shield</strong> allows for throwing down a temporary protective bubble that’s impervious to bullets and projectiles such as grenades. It’s great for providing a shield for your team as you storm onto a site. <br>The <strong>Recon Grenade</strong> gadget marks any enemies detected nearby where it’s thrown, even through walls. Throw a Recon gadget onto a site before entering to get a read on who might be waiting to get the drop on you.<br>Old faithful! A thrown <strong>Frag Grenade</strong> will bounce and explode, dealing damage to nearby enemies. Careful — you’ll take damage from your own grenades (though your allies will not). Great for flushing players out from behind cover.<br>The <strong>Impulse Grenade</strong> gadget is a disruptive tool that launches enemies and allies away. It has many creative uses, such as launching teammates onto a site from afar.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">When Fortnite Ballistic launches, it will do so with only one map - Skyline 10. There will also be a starting set of weapons and items, and adjustments will be made post-launch alongside new maps, weapons, and features.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What will be there at launch, however, will be Unranked and Ranked modes. In Unranked, spots will be filled if players drop from a game and players can remain on the same server after a match if they'd like.

            <p>This happened on Thursday, but we were busy with other, less interesting news. Late or not, I can't let it pass unremarked upon: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/caves-of-qud">Caves Of Qud</a>, the vast, weird roguelike which has been in development for 17 years, hit version 1.0. It brings multiple endings to the game, a revised UI, improved tutorials and much more.

<p>Caves Of Qud's 1.0 release has been polished up with some help from publisher Kitfox, known for - aside from their own games - working to bring <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dwarf-fortress">Dwarf Fortress</a> to Steam. Caves Of Qud has a complex, reactive, detailed world, but it's worth stating that it was never as obtuse in its menus or controls as its peer. To aid those who do want to jump onboard, Kitfox worked with YouTuber SBPlaysGames to produce <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtvzwK2jzY&amp;ab_channel=KitfoxGames">an official beginner's tutorial</a>.
</p>
<p>Over <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/333640/view/4440081939137824126">on Steam</a>, the developers answered the inevitable "what's next" question. After 17 years of work, they're going to take a break, they say. "After that, we plan to continue updating the game, with two big feature arcs already in mind. Whether those are free updates or paid DLC has yet to be determined."
</p><p>I'm glad that they're still excited to work on new ideas for Caves Of Qud, but I do hope Freehold Games also turn their attention to a new game one day. It seems unlikely that we'll ever get to see that from Dwarf Fortress's developers, but I want to know what comes next from a team willing to work on such large projects.
</p>
<p>We haven't had a proper appraisal of Caves Of Qud since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/caves-of-qud-review-early-access">Marsh skated across its mutant pond</a> upon its arrival in Steam Early Access nine years ago. Now that Brendy is done with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review-a-grand-adventure-that-keeps-faith-with-the-movies">Indy's tombs</a>, he's going to turn his attention to Qud's caves for a review before the end of the year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/path-of-exile-2-doubles-all-time-player-peak-of-original-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Path of Exile 2 is currently standing tallest during a stacked weekend of free game releases on Steam. Players have been patiently waiting in queue for early access to the hack-and-slash action RPG from Grinding Gear Games. But even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/path-of-exile-ii-queue-warning-issued/">foreseen server issues</a> have not stemmed the wave of excitement for the game.</p>



<p>The most impressive part to PoE2’s hot start? The numbers so far are just from players that paid $30 for early access to a game that will eventually release free-to-play. Now that’s dedication.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-path-of-exile-2-is-on-the-path-to-success">Path of Exile 2 is on the path to success</h2>



<p>As of the morning of December 7, Path of Exile 2 is at its highest player peak of 496,736 players, and that number is expected to climb. That places the game right behind the perpetual number one and two on the Steam player charts: Counter-Strike 2 and Dota 2. PoE2 is even outpacing another <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-launch-performance-numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massively popular recent release in Marvel Rivals</a>, which peaked at 444,286 players just a couple days prior.</p>



<p>The sequel to Path of Exile has more than doubled the original game’s all-time player peak of 229,337 players. Even <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2694490/Path_of_Exile_2/#app_reviews_hash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam reviews from players</a> that can’t even log in yet are positive, signaling exceptionally high anticipation for the game rivaling Blizzard’s ARPG giant Diablo. According to developers at GGG, over one million accounts redeemed early access for Path of Exile 2.</p>



<p>Looking at the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/path-of-exile-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">first batch of reviews</a>, it’s high praise for Path of Exile 2. The consensus is that the sequel has improved on many, if not all of the features of the original game. PoE2 has also kept the things that help it stand out from other games in the genre, like its terrifyingly expansive skill trees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/path-of-exile-2-early-access-delayed-due-to-database-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the early access bugs get resolved</a>, it shouldn’t come as a surprise when Path of Exile 2’s player peaks continue to climb. Typically, when games release alongside widespread login issues, the response can be quite negative online. But even while enduring these massive login issues, there’s an incredible amount of positivity excitement around this game.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft has revised its <a href="https://store.ubisoft.com/uk/units-discount">loyalty program</a>, allowing players to "exchange units on a wider selection of products".</p>
<p>In an email sent out to players subscribed to the loyalty scheme and seen by Eurogamer, Ubisoft announced that effective immediately, the units collected by players "will now also apply to pre-order and new release purchases made on the Ubisoft store", with 100 units equating to a 20 percent discount.</p>

<p>As well as 20 percent discount on games and DLC for every 100 units - you get one unit for every $/£1 spent - you can also get "exclusive" in-game content and rewards, like legendary weapons, character skins, emotes, and consumables.</p>
<p>If you're interested in signing up, don't forget that new Ubisoft accounts start with 100 units, which is enough for a 20% discount on your first Ubisoft Store purchase.</p>

However, the same report states that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> - Ubisoft's second-largest shareholder with ownership of nearly 10 percent of the company - is keen for a greater role and input on future board decisions.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Former Blizzard boss Mike Ybarra has slammed Marvel Rivals, intimating its an <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> clone.</p>
<p>In a now-deleted tweet posted yesterday, Ybarra called NetEase Games' free-to-play team-based PVP shooter "Overwatch Marvel Rivals", adding that much like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencents-horizon-clone-light-of-motiram-also-coming-to-ps5-of-all-platforms">Light of Motiram</a> is "a clear copy of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a>", Marvel Rivals clearly took inspiration from Blizzard's own team-based PVP shooter, Overwatch.</p>
