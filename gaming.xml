            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/jagex-ceo-addresses-recent-runescape-scandal/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Earlier this week, I reported <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/runescape-membership-charge-tiers-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the changes</a> that Jagex is proposing for RuneScape’s paid membership model. In a series of images shared on social media, it was revealed that a survey had been conducted by Jagex, and in that survey, players were asked to rate a series of proposed membership packages, some of which were audacious.</p>



<p>In a new post published on the RuneScape platform, Jagex’s CEO, Mod Pips, has laid bare the reasons why these changes have to happen. It’s a transparent move from the firm that players have welcomed with open arms, but it’s still not perfect.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-was-a-major-misjudgement">‘It Was a Major Misjudgement’</h2>



<p>In the post on the RuneScape blog, Mod Pips opened by explaining:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This was clumsy and inconsiderate, to say the least. We failed to think this through from your perspective as players. We got caught up in research mode and rushing a project with a research partner.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The ‘exploratory survey’ set the community ablaze, with some of the proposed membership tiers paywalling elements like better account security and enhanced player support. In some cases, users could pay for a RuneScape membership and still have to see ads in the game.</p>



<p>Pips went deeper:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It was a major misjudgement to include features that suggested we would consider degrading the game experience or impacting gameplay. Even the mere suggestion of ideas like in-game ads, shorter AFK timers, or making improved player support an additional cost undermined your trust in us.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Going forward, the Jagex team has pledged:</p>



<ul>
<li>To not include in-game advertisements in any regular paid membership</li>



<li>To ensure that any subscription ‘provides access to the full suite of core game content’</li>



<li>To not make plugins or features on the official client ‘paid options’</li>



<li>To not paywall player support</li>
</ul>



<p>The blog post was ended with a final statement from Mod Pips:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This kind of transparency and collaboration is at the heart of what makes our games so special. The game is shaped by its community, and your voices remain central to every decision we make. While we recognise that mistakes were made here, the fact that we’ve received such strong and clear feedback reinforces how deeply you care about this game.</p>



<p>Old School RuneScape thrives because of its community, and working closely with you keeps us moving forward, even when the discussions are difficult.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While the post has satisfied the community somewhat, it’s clear the road ahead is yet to be fully traversed and that changes <strong>are coming</strong>, whether players like it or not.</p>



<p>Do you think the statement from Mod Pips is a good one or has Jagex forever ruined your interpretation of RuneScape? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/treyarch-disabling-crossplay-ranked-console-black-ops-6/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a long-awaited update from Treyarch, it has been revealed that when season two arrives in Black Ops 6, it’ll come hand-in-hand with a feature <strong>many </strong>have been asking for. With the season two update, console players will finally be able to switch off crossplay mechanics, locking them into matchmaking against <strong>only </strong>other console players and <strong>not </strong>PC users.</p>



<p>This is a step to prevent console players from running into cheaters, which are <strong>always </strong>more commonplace on PC platforms. The feature is in testing now and will go live ‘during’ season two.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-finally">Finally.</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1880381003270848925" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a post</a> on social media and on the Call of Duty blog, Treyarch revealed the impending update:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In Season 02, we are enabling the ability to disable crossplay for console players who to compete only against other console players.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This will be deployed for both Warzone and Black Ops 6 Ranked Play, but it <strong>won’t </strong>roll out for general multiplayer playlists, which has been met with disappointment from fans on social media. Treyarch insisted it will ‘be closely monitoring’ and will consider ‘further changes to prioritise the integrity of the ecosystem’ going forward.</p>



<p>Since Ranked Play dropped in Black Ops 6, it has been a shambles of a scene. Even a cursory glance across social media will uncover countless pro players and content creators stressing their frustration about cheaters dominating Ranked Play.</p>



<p>It’s the same thing year after year, but in Black Ops 6, it just seems <strong>worse</strong> than ever before, for some reason.</p>



<p>It’s a similar story in Warzone.</p>



<p>Treyarch also highlighted that ‘Vote to Forfeit’ is coming midway through season two, allowing players to end matches without losing SR or facing any game suspensions. Later, disconnect protection will be added in the form of an ability to rejoin matches when you’ve dropped out.</p>



<p>Do you think this change is a W from Treyarch, or would you rather see it rolled out to cover all multiplayer playlists? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is - assuming it doesn't get delayed for a third time - almost upon us, and in the run-up to its March release, Ubisoft is continuing its series of deep dives highlighting some of the ways this latest series entry will be breaking from tradition. And this time around, it's the turn of exploration, which is promising to be a little more player-driven and a little less like an explosion in a map marker factory.
</p>
<p>
In its <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/4GKS1MvpHS3f7ebKWfxHmt/assassins-creed-shadows-deep-dive-into-exploration">latest blog post</a>, Ubisoft says Assassin's Creed Shadows makes "major changes and additions" to exploration in order to "foster a unique sense of discovery" as players roam the world. The aim, it explains, is to move away from an overabundance of 'hand-holding' map icons and markers toward an open world where information is "key [and] a form of reward". As such, rather than be immediately showered with points of interest, players will need to discover and earn information - either directly, through their spies, or via NPCs on their travels.
</p>
<p>
The world map, for instance, will initially only show region names and vague illustrative hints at potential key locations, with more details being revealed as players explore regions, sub-regions, and local landmarks. Notably, players will eventually earn scouts that can be sent ahead to reveal more precise location for quest objectives.
</p>

<figcaption>Synchronisation in Assassin's Creed Shadows.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp0v_S61cAY" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
One of Assassin's Creed's most iconic exploration features is also getting an overhaul, with viewpoints - AKA synchronisation points - now behaving a little differently. In Shadows, synchronisation no longer uncovers a clutter of map icons over a large area, instead revealing nearby key points of interest that can be manually tagged and added to the compass. Ubisoft says the goal is to give players a "more intentional and active way to find their next adventure."
</p><p>
In a similar fashion, the classic companion eagle has now been jettisoned, and players will instead need to find a good vantage point to observe the surrounding area and plan their approach, manually searching out and tagging valuable items, enemies, and so on.
</p>
<p>
Also new are safe houses - known as "kakurega" - that players can acquire. These provide "safe" fast travel points (discovered viewpoints also unlock fast travel, but these are frequently in dangerous enemy zones), as well as other useful functions. Players can, for instance, refill rations, tools, and ammunition; access their gear stash; manage and accept contracts; replenish scouts, and manage allies that can be summoned for help.
</p>

</p>
<figcaption>And here's a look at Shadows' objective board.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faWrGLgBBAc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Elsewhere in Ubisoft's update, there's mention of Assassin's Creed Shadows' Objective Board - a version of the visual quest log previously seen in Mirage, which expands to show new targets and objectives as more characters and challenges are encountered. Or rather, it reveals clues pointing to the location of new opportunities, which players must piece together for more specific directions - unless they want their scouts to do the hard work for them.
</p><p>
Ubisoft also highlights Shadows' Pathfinder tool, which - given the inclusion of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-adding-the-ability-to-go-prone-has-prompted-a-rethink-of-the-series-usual-controls">more unclimbable scenery</a> this time around - is intended to help players avoid false shortcuts that would increase their travel time. When a quest is tracked and its location is revealed (or when players manually place a marker on the map), Pathfinder can be deployed while on horseback to draw a white line overlay on the ground showing the shortest route to a player's destination.
</p>
<p>
A few more exploration details can be found in <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/4GKS1MvpHS3f7ebKWfxHmt/assassins-creed-shadows-deep-dive-into-exploration">Ubisoft's latest blog post</a> - and if that's left you sufficiently intrigued, Assassin's Creed Shadows is now due to launch for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC on 20th March. Ubisoft recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-as-ubisoft-explores-sale">delayed the game's release yet again</a> (it was previously scheduled for 14th February) as it explores potential sales options.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-elon-musk-asmongold-twitch-path-of-exile<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It has been another exceedingly stupid week on planet Earth, the culmination of several nearly-as-stupid weeks before it. One of the most eye-catching jewels in this trash crown: Elon Musk, the world’s richest man who you’d assume has something better to do, is <a href="https://gizmodo.com/why-is-elon-musk-beefing-with-a-twitch-streamer-2000551256" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beefing with Twitch streamer Asmongold</a> over apparent evidence that Musk – despite his high-level characters in games like <em>Diablo IV</em> and <em>Path of Exile</em> – <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/elon-musk-cheating-gaming-diablo-iv-1235234041/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cheats at video games</a>. Why does he insist on doing this? What is he trying to prove? On this week’s Aftermath Hours, we talk about that.</p><p>We begin the episode by breaking down <a href="https://aftermath.site/but-i-like-to-slide-the-joy-con" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo’s long-awaited reveal of the Switch 2</a> – although we use the term “reveal” loosely. After months of speculation, we now know… what it will look like. And it looks like a Nintendo Switch! Some people, Chris included, are disappointed by this. Nintendo used to swing for the fences with its hardware ideas, but now it’s navigating a world of its own creation – one filled with Steam Decks and Asus Rog Allies. Can Nintendo’s Apple-like iteration strategy keep it at the head of the handheld pack, or is it already ceding ground simply by conforming?&nbsp;</p><p>Then we discuss <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/17/tech/tiktok-getting-banned-trump-biden/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the impending TikTok ban</a>, which thanks to interventions from both outgoing president Joe Biden and incoming president Donald Trump, we don’t think is actually going to happen, but which has produced the funniest possible outcome in a bunch of people migrating to <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2025/01/tiktok-ban-rednote-chinese-social-media-app-good-alternative.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a comparable Chinese app</a>. After that, we turn Luke’s brain to mush by discussing Elon Musk’s gamer beef with Asmongold, but he endures it like a champ. Finally, we wrap up by designing our own Switch 2 (it’s got a foldable screen; it’s sick).&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can buy TikTok and replace all the videos with blogs.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> The funniest thing about all of it is, on some level it’s just “Lie until you make it,” but also if you say you’re good at something and then you’re really, really clearly not good at something, everyone is gonna say “Well, what else do you suck at?” There’s the degree to which [Musk] and Trump’s friendship makes a lot of sense, because they both love lying about stuff and fucking over labor. They love doing that shit – like Trump lying about his <a href="https://golf.com/lifestyle/celebrities/how-why-president-trump-cheats-golf-playing-tiger-woods/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">golf game</a>, hypothetically. The difference is, we’re not watching him play. He’s not livestreaming sucking ass at golf, although I’d love to see that. He just tells people he’s good at something, and you know he’s lying about it in some capacity.</p><p>The need for there to be proof [in Musk’s case] is somehow more damning and insecure. Just lie and don’t worry about it.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Trump is lying for others; Elon is lying for himself in that he’s also trying to convince himself he’s great even though he’s probably had his video game characters boosted. He’s still trying to contort his mind into believing “No, but I am good at this, though! I’m just this natural expert.” All these guys – but especially Elon – are trying to reify this idea of the genius, the person who’s just inherently superior to everyone. Same reason Elon Musk is like “I’ve gotta have a million kids; I’ve got to pass on my genius genes.” He needs to believe, for his own sake, that it’s possible for him to jump into the deep end of anything and excel immediately.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>The thing about all those guys who are like “My beautiful genes” is, your kids fucking hate you, man. At least <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/elon-musk-transgender-daughter-vivian-wilson-interview-rcna163665" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one</a> really fucking hates you [in Musk’s case]. You just created an opposition to your legacy. Your kid doesn’t have to like you. Having a child doesn’t mean your legacy is going to be continued, except in some freak weird genetic way. And that’s all they care about: “Oh, my genes are beautiful.”</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> And they’re not, but that’s another story.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> No, he’s got a weird head.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> He’s built like a Cybertruck.</p><p>But the full circle element of this is that his comebacks to Asmongold about Asmongold’s career have also been wrong. He’s trying to allege that Asmongold is lying to the world. Elon Musk <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1879798348993237046" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a> “Asmon behaves like a maverick 'independent' but&nbsp; in reality has to ask his boss for permission before he can do anything. He is not his own man." And as evidence of this, Elon linked DMs between the two of them, wherein Asmongold was talking about creating content, and he said “I’m going to see if my editor might want to make a second account for it even.”</p><p>So Elon is taking this to mean that Asmongold’s editor is his boss. That’s not true. Almost every Twitch streamer has YouTube editors who cut up their streams and make videos out of them for YouTube, because the streamers themselves do not have time to do that. They’re streaming all day long. [Streamers] pay these people. They employ these people [typically on a contractual basis]. Effectively, Asmongold is <em>their </em>boss.&nbsp;</p><p>But Elon once again doesn’t know how shit works and is making these audacious claims with no understanding. It’s so demonstrative of his entire little process, his whole cycle.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> This is messy in the same way <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/media/4536394-twitter-files-journalist-matt-taibbi-musk-disappointing-free-speech/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Matt Taibbi thing</a> was messy. You thought you were gonna be best friends with this guy, and it turns out he’s a messy bitch who loves leaking his DMs – and loves stabbing you in the back the second you become mildly annoying to him, in a way that makes you both look like shit.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>But the other thing is, content creators do this too. You’ll often have creators who become BFFs for a little bit, then drama occurs, then they leak DMs everywhere, and then they both make more content out of it. That gets them viewership. That’s why Asmongold is also down to engage with this. I’m sure he’s not heartbroken – far from it. I bet he’s ecstatic.

                <p>Assassin's Creed games usually include a large open world, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6523576/" data-ref-id="1100-6523576">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is no exception. While there are familiar elements to the travel and exploration abilities in this game, Shadows is also going to allow its two leading characters, Naoe and Yasuke, to take some time to appreciate the beauty of nature by creating art.</p><p>Ubisoft unveiled this feature during an <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/4GKS1MvpHS3f7ebKWfxHmt/assassins-creed-shadows-exploration-gameplay-overview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extended explanation</a> about how the game's exploration mechanics will work. Letting Naoe or Yasuke create art may not give them an edge in battle, but it's an activity that they find rewarding.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H1SNkcEU9Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8H1SNkcEU9Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Yasuke and Naoe will also have their own character-specific activities that they can do outside of quests and missions. For example, Yasuke can find experts who can teach him more about how to use his Kata, which gives his character special attack movies. On the other hand, Naoe's Kuji-kiri meditation will open up more of her backstory.</p><p>Ubisoft has placed a great deal of importance on scouts in this game, as the recruits can help Naoe and Yasuke find places of importance in the game's world without having to transverse every step on their own. Scouts can also raid enemy strongholds one-at-a-time, and so subtly that their marks may not realize what's happening until it's too late. With the resources from scout raids, Naoe or Yasuke can customize their safe houses. Additionally, scouts can help the players cancel provisional alerts if either character has been caught breaking the law.</p><p>Viewpoints are also making a return in Shadows, with some modifications. Player characters can now spot and discover distant locations by getting on a high building and using the 360-degree observe function, which will mark special locations on your map.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp0v_S61cAY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Zp0v_S61cAY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As before, viewpoints will open up fast-travel points as well. However, not every fast travel point is safe to go to. Some of them are in enemy-controlled land, and you'll have a major fight on your hands if the enemies discover that your characters have dropped by unannounced.</p><p>If players need a clearer idea about where they are going, the pathfinder feature can be used on horseback. It's not unlike the tools used in Grand Theft Auto games to keep your characters on the right track to their intended destination.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OXycOtXBNQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0OXycOtXBNQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>A recent rumor suggested that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-assassins-creed-games-may-come-to-switch-2-report/1100-6528782/" data-ref-id="1100-6528782">Assassin's Creed Shadows will come to Switch 2</a>, but it remains unconfirmed for now.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> maker HoYoverse has agreed to pay $20m to settle a complaint - filed by the US Department of Justice on behalf of the Federal Trade Commission - accusing it of violating children's privacy laws and deceiving users over the true cost of obtaining rare loot box prizes.
</p>
<p>
As per the FTC's <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/01/genshin-impact-game-developer-will-be-banned-selling-lootboxes-teens-under-16-without-parental">announcement</a>, the complaint accused Singapore-based Cognosphere - which does business under the name HoYoverse - of actively marketing Genshin Impact to children and of collecting their personal information in violation of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule (COPPA). The FTC claimed HoYoverse was aware children under 13 were using its service, but continued to collect their personal information - and share it with third-parties - without obtaining parental consent or complying with other COPPA requirements.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, the filing claimed HoYoverse deceived players regarding the odds of - and true cost of - winning particularly sought-after "five-star" loot box prizes. The complaint argued Genshin Impact's loot box system - said to require players to "exchange real dollars for bundles of virtual currency that then have to be re-exchanged multiple times to open loot boxes" - is "complicated", "challenging", and "confusing", particularly for children and teens.

<p>
Furthermore, the filing claimed Genshin Impact's purchasing process "misleads consumers about the amount of money [they] spend on loot boxes on an ongoing basis, and the amount of money [they] would likely need to spend to obtain certain prizes". HoYoverse's event banners and influencer campaigns were also alleged to give players the impression they would have better odds of obtaining five-star prizes than was the case in reality.
</p><p>
In response, HoYoverse has agreed to pay $20m to settle the complaint - meaning it neither admits or denies the allegations - and will make changes to prevent children under 16 from purchasing lootboxes without a parent's express consent. The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/Cognosphere-Attachment3-3.pdf">proposed settlement</a> - which must be approved by a federal judge - also prohibits HoYoverse from selling loot boxes using virtual currency without providing an option to purchase them with real money, and requires it to disclose loot box odds and exchange rates for multi-tiered virtual currency.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, HoYoverse is required to delete any personal information previously collected from children under 13 without parental consent, and to comply with COPPA going forward.

If you enjoy saving passages in books, the Colorsoft has the added benefit of letting you highlight text in color, making it easier than ever to organize important sentences you want to return to later.</p><p>Other notable features of the Colorsoft include support for wireless charging, no ads on the lock screen, and 32GB of storage. If you like reading by the pool or relaxing in the bath, the Colorsoft ereader is waterproof and carries an IPX8 water resistance rating, which means it can be fully submerged in water at a depth of 6.5 feet for up to 60 minutes.</p><p>The biggest reason to pick up the Colorsoft is if you’re interested in making the jump to digital comic books and graphic novels. Its color display is leagues better for the format than black and white ereaders like the standard Kindle--and at $230, it’s easier to recommend.</p></div>                      </div><p>As mentioned, you can save even more with an eligible trade-in item. You'll automatically save an additional 20%, even if you send Amazon a cheap device like a Fire Stick. The 20% is calculated from the sale price, so in this case, <strong>you'll save an extra $46 simply for trading in any eligible device</strong>. At the moment, that means the Colorsoft's price drops to $184.</p><p>The $184 price doesn't account for the value of the device you choose to send to Amazon.

The Roblox experience makes you face off against groups of fantasy-inspired enemies, which at first seem overpowered and tough to defeat. When you die, a FromSoftware-style "You Died" screen even appears! Like the Souls games, you can grind for EXP to level up your character and make them more powerful. But the best way to get stronger is via the game's loot mechanic, which lets you keep opening chests to try and find better gear to power up your character.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Dion has spent over five years doing games journalism for UK national newspaper websites and is now a writer for Gamer Network.

During the LVO 2025 Preview show, the tabletop publisher announced new army boxes for several big franchises: <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Warhammer 40,000</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-age-of-sigmar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Age of Sigmar</a></em>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/warhammer-old-world-core-boxes-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The Old World</em></a>. Here is everything they announced.</p>

<h2>The LVO 2025 Preview Show Reveals</h2>

<p>Games Workshop made several major announcements as part of the LVO 2025 Preview Show. Several of those announcements involved new army boxes coming to their games.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lvo-2025-preview-soulblight-gravelords.jpg?itok=cDEbzbx8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lvo-2025-preview-soulblight-gravelords.jpg?itok=-fsYQqG4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The first of these announcements is the return of the <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/yu1duwle/lvo-preview-2025-the-barrow-kingdoms-rise-to-serve-the-soulblight-gravelords/" rel="nofollow">Soulblight Gravelords</a> to <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em>. The vampiric nobles of this army have made a pact with the armies of the Barrow Kingdoms, adding new legions of undead to their ranks.</p>

<p>The aptly named Deathrattle army box will include these new skeletal miniatures, the latest Soulblight Gravelords Battletome, and 55 warscroll cards.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lvo-2025-preview-elves-of-ulthuan-army.jpg?itok=KvLxuOMw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lvo-2025-preview-elves-of-ulthuan-army.jpg?itok=HDK2WnO7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Going back to the time of <em>Warhammer The Old World</em>, Games Workshop previewed a new <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/q4oh518o/lvo-preview-2025-the-resplendent-host-of-ulthuan/" rel="nofollow">Elves of Ulthuan</a> army. The strong yet prideful army stands alongside named units like Ishaya Vess against the forces of Chaos. In addition, these miniatures will have both returning plastic and metal kits.</p>

<p>The High Elf Realms Battalion Box will include an updated Arcane Journal, dice, reference cards, and 66 miniatures. Those miniatures include 32 Elven Spearmen, 32 Elven Archers, and two Tiranoc Chariots.</p>

<p>Another army coming to <em>Warhammer The Old World</em> are the <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/jbz6zd6h/lvo-preview-2025-a-blind-bray-shaman-grants-a-glimpse-of-the-future-of-the-old-world/" rel="nofollow">Beastmen Brayherds</a>. This preview is more of a teaser, showing some artwork and a Bray-Shaman miniature. Hopefully, new details will come later.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lvo-2025-preview-necromunda-shadar-hunter-miniature.jpg?itok=kZasiCNs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lvo-2025-preview-necromunda-shadar-hunter-miniature.jpg?itok=Jc40NH-a 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>For those that like their Warhammer battles to be smaller and closer to Mad Max, the new content coming to <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/necromunda-hive-secundus-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Necromunda</em></a> may have your attention. The Ash Wastes Nomads are getting a new book, <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/zlyt0pyr/lvo-preview-2025-new-nomads-rule-the-dunes-of-the-ash-wastes/" rel="nofollow"><em>Tribes of the Wastelands</em></a>, which will give them new gang rules, hired guns, and new Dramatis Personae.</p>

<p>Those new hired guns include Sha'dar Hunters, sneaky close-quarters scouts, and Arthromite Spinewyrms, ferocious worm monsters tamed for their shear power.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lvo-2025-preview-noise-marine-artwork.jpg?itok=MmnXR6dc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lvo-2025-preview-noise-marine-artwork.jpg?itok=nZK638qy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Lastly, <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> will see the return of a Chaos Space Marine army. The <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/evne31tw/lvo-preview-2025-establish-exactly-how-much-is-too-much-with-the-emperors-children/" rel="nofollow">Champions of Slaanesh</a> army box brings back the Emperor's Children. That means loud Noise Marines, strategic Lords Exultant, and devastating Tormentors. The army box will contain the latest codex, two units of six Noise Marines, two units of 10 Infractors which can be built as Tormentors, and a Lord Exultant.</p>

<p>The second preview was for a new Nurgle. The <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/elxrte0d/lvo-preview-2025-nurgle-coughs-up-a-new-lord-of-poxes/" rel="nofollow">Lord of Pox</a> miniature is a unit that continues the Death Guard's whole motif of pestilence and disease. Aside from some preview images however, not much else was revealed.</p>

            <p>
Three-person Danish developer The Outer Zone and publishing partner <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/11-bit-studios">11 Bit Studios</a> (of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a> fame) have unveiled Death Howl, a gorgeously moody melding of turn-based tactical action, deck-building, and "Soulslike" exploration that's coming to PC later this year. 
</p>
<p>
Death Howl is described as a "poignant tale of grief, healing, and resilience", and follows the journey of hunter Ro as she departs her tribe and ventures into a disturbingly realised realm of the spirits in the hope of reuniting with her deceased son.
</p>
<p>It's journey through a land of horrors - of fearsome creatures and grotesque bosses - that combines grid-based, turn-based battles with a deck-building focus, plus open-world exploration across a series of strikingly atmospheric biomes.

<p>As players venture deeper, they'll uncover fragments of Ro's story, steeped in love and loss, alongside forgotten lore. Additionally, each discoverable realm promises unique cards and deck mechanics that'll gradually deepen Death Howl's strategy layer, as well as the likes of shamanic totems that can further enhance a deck.
</p><p>
"The loss of a loved one is universal - an inevitable part of the human experience," The Outer Zone explains. "We believe our narrative approach will resonate with players of all kinds. We've introduced a fresh take on the deck-builder genre, combining it with soulslike exploration and adding compelling lore to leave a lasting impact on anyone who joins Ro on her journey".
</p>
<p>
Death Howl is scheduled to release for Steam later this year, but players can familiarise themselves with its deck-building action and forlorn ambience - amply evident in its announcement trailer - when its demo <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2825880/Death_Howl/">launches on Steam</a> next Monday, 20th January.

                <p dir="ltr">Mob Entertainment--the development studio behind the jumpscare-heavy survival horror game known as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/poppy-playtime/">Poppy Playtime</a>--is suing Google over what it calls "scam" games that are ripping off the studio's intellectual property (via <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/510282/poppy-playtime-lawsuit-scam-games-google" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>).</p><p dir="ltr">The studio filed <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/816640114/Poppy-Playtime-lawsuit-via-Polygon" rel="nofollow ">the lawsuit</a> earlier this week, claiming that Google has allowed a number of illegal knockoff versions of Poppy Playtime into the Google Play store. Among the unofficial (and unauthorized) games are Poppy Playtime Chapter 3 and Poppy Playtime Chapter 4, neither of which were created by Mob Entertainment. Both games--developed by an entity known as Daigo--are still available for download on the Google Play store at the time of writing.</p><p dir="ltr">These two games are proving especially vexing for Poppy Playtime's creators due to the fact that the game is episodic in nature. Mob Entertainment argues that by allowing illegitimate games to use "Poppy Playtime" in their titles and (indicate that said games are new episodes), Google is allowing other entities to profit from the Poppy Playtime brand by fooling fans into thinking they're playing new chapters of the game.</p><p dir="ltr">These knockoff games aren't just capitalizing on the Poppy Playtime name, however. Mob Entertainment alleges that the developers of these games are illegally using screenshots from Poppy Playtime 2, presenting them as though they're screenshots of gameplay from the fake games instead.</p><p dir="ltr">The Poppy Playtime developer says that the fault lies with Google due to its failure to take action by removing the knockoff games from its digital app storefront. Mob Entertainment said it has issued multiple DMCA takedown requests and has contacted Google directly with regard to the fake versions of Chapter 3 and Chapter 4. The lawsuit says that although Google did remove both of the fake chapters from its app store sometime in December, both games reappeared on the Google Play store in a matter of days, and Google has allegedly taken no further action against the creators of the illegitimate titles.</p><p dir="ltr">The studio claims in the lawsuit that the knockoff games--which feature "many grammatical mistakes" and an unappealing color scheme, among other flaws--have "tarnished" Mob Entertainment's reputation, especially given the fact that Daigo's knockoff titles can fool some users--particularly children--into spending exorbitant amounts of money on a game that isn't genuine. On top of that, the lawsuit states that Google is profiting from the scam, too.</p><p dir="ltr">"Google and Daigo's unauthorized applications use Mob Entertainment's trademarks and copyrighted material to trick consumers into spending up to $95 for a game prior to its release on Google Play," Mob Entertainment asserts. "Google receives 15% or 30% of all sales made by the unauthorized Poppy Playtime Chapter 3 or unauthorized Poppy Playtime Chapter 4 applications."</p><p dir="ltr">Google has yet to publicly respond to the lawsuit.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-hit-all-the-right-notes-according-to-analyst/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-revealed-with-a-new-trailer-dedicated-direct-confirmed-for-february/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finally official</a>. After a couple of years of speculation, the Japanese company has unveiled its upcoming console, which will be released at some point in 2025.</p>
<p>The original Nintendo Switch launched nearly eight years ago. Its unique concept of a hybrid handheld/home console won over the gaming world, making it one of the best-selling consoles ever, with over 146 million units sold as of the last update. However, Nintendo is no stranger to missteps like the Wii U, the GameCube, or even the Nintendo 64 to an extent. Early reception for the Nintendo Switch 2 seems positive, but we reached out to <a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/analyst/rhys-elliott" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MIDiA Research Games Analyst Rhys Elliott</a> to get his perspective on the reveal.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Switch 2 – First-look trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WxLUf2kRQRE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><em><strong>Rhys, didn't Nintendo play it too safe?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>It was smart of Nintendo to just make a bigger, better Switch. It is shrewd of them to leverage the inertia of the original. While the Nintendo Switch 2 plays it safe, the announcement video shows a range of quality-of-life improvements fans have wanted for years, such as a bigger screen (with a seemingly smaller bezel), a sturdier kickstand, and a bigger form factor for the Joy-Con. Nintendo might surprise us with something a little more out of left field, though — like that <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-rumor-mill-joycons-as-pc-mice-no-mans-sky-on-the-way/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored mouse functionality</a>.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think of the naming specifically?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>The straightforward name of ‘’Switch 2’’ is the right choice. Nintendo learned its hard lesson from the Wii U’s confusing naming convention and the abject failure of that console. Many consumers – not just casual but core ones too – thought the Wii U was an add-on for the Wii, similar to the Wii Fit Balance Board or the Wii Motion Plus. This marketing fumble almost destroyed all the gains Nintendo made with the Wii. Things would have been dire if the Switch hadn’t become a cultural phenomenon. And Nintendo’s leadership – more conservative than ever before – understands that.</em></p>
<p><em>Now that Nintendo has all its console eggs in the Switch basket, it simply cannot risk confusing fans. After all, Nintendo’s cross-entertainment efforts across film, theme parks, toys, and even alarm clocks all lead back to its core console brand. If the beating heart of the brand fails, everything falls apart.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Will core gamers flock to the Nintendo Switch 2 or not?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Core gamers are harder to please than more casual gamers and the general public. Other portable companion devices like the Steam Deck and the ROG Ally likely have more processing power than the Switch 2, and core gamers will draw these comparisons. We expect that many of these vocal-minority gamers will buy the Switch 2 nonetheless. And they are not even Nintendo’s main target audience here – families and more casual players are.</em></p>
<p><em>Nintendo has been awfully quiet about the fan-favorite Metroid Prime 4, which is a niche series relative to Nintendo’s other properties but would attract some core gamers. And Pokémon fandom would find a faster-running version of Pokémon Legends: Z-A enticing, as framerate and performance issues seen in the Switch’s more recent Pokémon games have been a major pain point for that community.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think about the software outlook for the new console, both from first-party and third-party?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Nintendo confirmed that there will be Switch 2 exclusive games. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has sold over 64 million copies, so making Mario Kart 9 a Switch 2 exclusive would be very enticing to attract players to the new machine. Adding more characters and tracks based on Nintendo’s other franchises would appeal to the masses there. Based on the development timelines of their internal studios, it seems Nintendo has been sitting on a goldmine of titles to launch during the Nintendo Switch 2’s launch window. Alongside Mario Kart, I expect to see a new 3D Mario, an upgraded Pokemon, and likely some other surprises in year one. Nintendo will pull out all the stops.</em></p>
<p><em>It is worth noting that it’s been almost five years since Animal Crossing. The inevitable announcement of a sequel to 2020's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/animal-crossing-new-horizons-essential-social-sim/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>, which has sold over 45 million copies and became a cultural zeitgeist, will mobilize cozy gamers in full force, too. A new Animal Crossing and Mario Kart would reactivate some of the consumers who played during lockdowns.</em></p>
<p><em>I think backward compatibility is important, too. It is what gamers – and younger ones in particular – have come to expect from the market. It is also what the competition has done with the Series X and PS5 generation. Nintendo would not want to alienate fans here.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>What about third party studios?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Except for Ubisoft, many third-party publishers were late to the party with the original Switch, scared off by the Wii U’s underperformance. Things will be different for the Nintendo Switch 2, and third parties will get in on the ground floor. The Switch 2 offers up a springboard for third-party developers to extend the lifecycles of their game catalogs, promising engagement and revenue boosts for third-party developers big and small.</em></p>
<p><em>It will be an opportunity for EA, Ubisoft, and the like to extend the product life cycles of their older PS4- and Xbox One-era games. Speaking of which, Xbox and even PlayStation have been more to launching games on the Switch. I expect this will ramp up on the Switch 2 as these companies continue their off-platform strategies. I can already play Halo on my Steam Deck. I expect I’ll be able to play it on my Switch 2 one day, too.</em></p>

<p>Nine esports organizations have been announced for the Overwatch Champions Series partner program. While a small handful of teams will be familiar to long-time competitive Overwatch fans, many teams once synonymous with the scene are nowhere to be seen.</p>



<p>With the open Overwatch esports ecosystem entering a new era, and while the game itself is challenged by a new “rival”, it’s an important year for Blizzard’s iconic hero shooter.</p>



<h2 id="h-meet-the-owcs-partner-teams">Meet the OWCS Partner Teams</h2>



<p>Nine teams have been <a href="https://esports.overwatch.com/en-us/news/owcs-2025-stage-1#:~:text=Competition%20Memo.-,OWCS%20Partner%20Teams,-As%20announced%20in" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">invited</a> to participate in the OWCS partner program for 2025: four from Asia, three from EMEA (Europe and the Middle East), and two from North America. The regional distinction is based on the roster of players, not where the organization is based or headquartered. Partnered teams will receive a portion of proceeds from in-game team-themed items, as well as direct invites to their region’s stage one main event.</p>



<p>The list of partnered teams includes: </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Gen.G</strong> (EMEA)</li>



<li><strong>Twisted Minds</strong> (EMEA)</li>



<li><strong>Virtus.pro</strong> (EMEA)</li>



<li><strong>Spacestation</strong> (North America)</li>



<li><strong>Team Liquid</strong> (North America)</li>



<li><strong>Crazy Raccoon</strong> (Asia)</li>



<li><strong>T1</strong> (Asia)</li>



<li><strong>Team Falcons</strong> (Asia)</li>



<li><strong>ZETA DIVISION</strong> (Asia)</li>
</ul>



<p>Of the list of nine organizations, only two were active during the Overwatch League days: T1 was the academy team for the Seoul Infernal (formerly Philadelphia Fusion), and Gen.G owned the Seoul Dynasty. Several of the now partnered teams entered Overwatch last year in the first season of the open OWCS ecosystem, following the closure of the Overwatch League at the end of 2023.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Missing from this list are some organizations that were amongst the biggest names of the OWL era. Notably, NRG, the organization that owned and operated two-time OWL champion San Francisco Shock, did not receive a partner program invite. This shocked both <a href="https://x.com/amiller/status/1869534757488644122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NRG staff members</a> and long-time OWL fans, especially after NRG finished 4th in the OWCS 2024 World Finals as the NRG Shock. Fans are also somewhat surprised by there being only two NA slots, considering one is occupied by a Team Liquid organization that last competed in Overwatch in 2017.</p>



<p>There is some renewed excitement in Overwatch esports following the move from the franchised OWL to open OWCS. The 2024 OWCS Finals <a href="https://escharts.com/news/overwatch-champions-series-finals-2024-viewership" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached a slightly higher viewership peak</a> than the one reached at the 2023 OWL Finals. However the game itself is now facing arguably its greatest competitor ever in the recently released Marvel Rivals from NetEase. While the newer game is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-director-reveals-plans-for-esports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">very slowly embracing esports</a>, a number of former Overwatch pros have already made the jump.</p>



<p>What do you make of the OWCS partner program? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a> Season 7 arrives on January 21, and as is usually the case with patch notes for Blizzard's ARPG, the list of changes and bug fixes is very, very long.</p><p dir="ltr">The game's latest season, Season of Witchcraft, is all about players concocting new builds to take advantage of a plethora of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-of-witchcraft-will-give-players-diablo-3-inspired-powers/1100-6528778/" data-ref-id="1100-6528778">Witchcraft powers, many themed after Diablo 3's Witch Doctor</a>. But even for those who aren't planning on diving into the game's new seasonal mechanics, there are plenty of major updates to the game's base systems and classes that are worth paying attention to.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4Kc7LjVwa8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="2">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/R4Kc7LjVwa8?start=2" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">At the top of that list are Runewords. The powerful socketable items are exclusive to owners of Diablo 4's Vessel of Hatred expansion, and they are getting some major buffs going into update 2.1. The amount of Offering generated by many Ritual Runes is going up significantly, while the cost of activating Invocation Runes is going down. Invocation Runes that didn't previously have Overflow bonuses will now have one, overall making Runewords even better than before.</p><p dir="ltr">When it comes to class changes, many will want to know how the Spiritborn is being adjusted, given how it was by far the most popular (and powerful) class in Season 6 thanks to its arrival as part of Vessel of Hatred. A number of bugs granting the Spiritborn some unintended power, like Masterwork Resolve stacking and the Viscous Shield Paragon Board node granting more damage than it was supposed to, have been fixed.</p><p dir="ltr">That certainly brings down the power level of the Spiritborn a bit, but Blizzard is compensating players by buffing many of the class' underused skills. Centipede enjoyers will enjoy the buffs to the The Devourer (which now deals more damage based on a player's Healing Received bonus) and the Centipede primary Spirit Hall, where Centipede skills will now deal 70% poison damage over six seconds.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the other classes, they're all receiving some love. Barbarians will enjoy a massive buff to Hammer of the Ancients and a major change to their Walking Arsenal passive. Meanwhile, the Sorcerer is gaining some significant Paragon Board buffs alongside two new Ball Lightning Unique items to experiment with. Rogues will receive a few buffs to some underperforming Paragon nodes while also receiving buffs to Shadow Clones, and Druid will see big improvements to Shred and its Ultimate skills, like Cataclysm and Shred. Last but not least, Necromancer will benefit from a number of minion updates.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of minions, the season also brings an overhaul to summoned minions, with Blizzard looking to make the wording of summoning skills and how they interact more consistent across all classes. That means tagging all skills that summon creatures as Summoning skills, having damage done by summons attributed to the player character across the board (and thus allowing summoned units to properly interact with all of a player's damage modifiers, multipliers, and triggers), and updating the wording on various skills to be more uniform.</p><p dir="ltr">"Summoning skills have behaved inconsistently across the classes, making it hard to know how to scale their damage or what effects would interact with your summons," Blizzard writes in the <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24171214/diablo-iv-patch-notes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patch notes</a>. "This update aims to standardize their interactions across the board by attributing the damage they deal to the player, rather than the summoned unit."</p><p dir="ltr">For more on Diablo 4 Season 7, check out our interview with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-4s-armory-will-be-a-boon-for-eternal-players-and-the-chances-of-a-witch-class/1100-6528885/" data-ref-id="1100-6528885">Blizzard on the addition of the Armory</a> and whether or not the game may ever see the addition of a Witch class.

This will include 3 Infernal Compasses and 3 Nightmare Dungeon Sigils.</li></ul></li><li>The overall drop chance of Gem Fragments has been reduced.</li><li>The variance on the roll of a Unique Item's power has been reduced. Additionally, the variance for the strength of the power further reduces for each Greater Affix present.</li></ul><p>Developer’s Note: <em>It doesn’t feel good to get an item that has multiple Greater Affixes with poorly rolled power. This change will make it so that a 4 GA item will always have a good roll on the Unique power.</em></p><ul><li>The Greater Crafting Whisper Cache has been adjusted.  <ul><li>It’s now a normal cache, so it will appear more often.</li><li>Now contains 4 times as many crafting materials than other caches would drop.</li><li>No longer contains non-crafting items.</li></ul></li></ul><h2>Affix Updates</h2><ul><li>Inherent Affixes for Critical Strike Damage on base items has been increased to match the range of Inherent Vulnerable Damage Affixes.</li><li>Items that have affixes that are class specific are no longer class-restricted. Instead, the specific affix is now class-restricted.</li></ul><p>Developer’s Note: <em>Any affixes that are inactive due to being incompatible with your class will be explicitly called out as disabled on item tooltips.</em></p><ul><li><em>Items and affixes that are not usable by your current class will explicitly denote which classes can use them on the tooltip using class iconography.</em></li><li><em>The following list details what affixes are now class restricted or have had the class they are restricted to updated.</em></li></ul><p>Developer’s Note: <em>Most of these affixes are from class-specific Tempering recipes. To acquire them on other classes the item must be tempered by the class that has access, then transferred.</em></p><p>Restricted to Barbarians</p><ul><li>Damage to Injured</li><li>Damage with Dual-Wielded Weapons</li><li>Damage after Swapping Weapons</li></ul><p>Restricted to Necromancers</p><ul><li>Ultimate Cooldown Reduction</li><li>Damage While Fortified</li><li>Blood Orbs restore essence</li></ul><p>Restricted to Rogue</p><ul><li>Damage to Poisoned Enemies</li><li>Lucky Hit: Chance to Daze</li><li>Bonus Maximum Life while Dark Shroud is Active</li></ul><p>Restricted to Sorcerer</p><ul><li>Bonus Fire Damage</li><li>Bonus Cold Damage</li><li>Bonus Lightning Damage</li><li>Damage to Frozen enemies</li><li>Increased Freeze Duration</li><li>Damage to Immobilized Enemies</li><li>Lucky Hit: Chance to Heal</li></ul><p>Restricted to Barbarians and Necromancers</p><ul><li>Thorns while Fortified</li></ul><p>Restricted to Barbarians and Sorcerers</p><ul><li>Bonus Crowd Control Duration</li></ul><p>Restricted to Barbarians, Necromancers, Druids, and Sorcerers</p><ul><li>Casting Ultimate Restores Resource</li></ul><h2>Summons and Minions Update</h2><p>All skills that summon entities, such as Necromancer Minions, Druid Companions, Sorcerer Conjurations, are now all tagged as Summon skills for consistency across classes.</p><ul><li>Added the Summoning Skill Tag to Druid Companion Skills, Sorcerer Conjuration Skills, Rogue Shadow Clone, Barbarian Call of the Ancients, in addition to Necromancer Raise Skeleton, Golem, and Army of the Dead.</li><li>Units created by these Skills are now collectively referred to as Summons.</li><li>All damage from Summons is attributed to the player's character, rather than the Summoned unit.</li><li>Updated wording on various effects to use the new Summons terminology where appropriate. Many effects still interact only with the class specific version of these Summons.</li><li>Updated wording on various effects to remove "You and your Summons" where it is now redundant to specifically call out your Summons.</li></ul><p>Developer’s Note: <em>Summoning Skills have behaved inconsistently across the Classes, making it hard to know how to scale their damage or what effects would interact with your Summons. This update aims to standardize their interactions across the board by attributing the damage they deal to the player, rather than the Summoned unit. This means that damage from your Summons will be able to trigger all of your Lucky Hit effects, and interact with all of your damage modifiers, multipliers, and triggers. Note that effects such as Ring of Mendeln still properly increase their damage output based on the damage bonuses you have for the specific Minion type that triggered the effect. Additionally, specific changes for Necromancer have been implemented to reflect these changes, which can be seen above in the relevant section.</em></p><h2>Infernal Hordes</h2><ul><li>Infernal Compasses have been updated.</li><li>Compasses now stack, based on tier.
