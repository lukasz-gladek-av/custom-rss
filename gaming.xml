Team Jade and TiMi Studio Group have released a free downloadable co-op campaign for their 2024-launched multiplayer shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/delta-force">Delta Force</a> - the first new Delta Force game since 2004. Inspired by the Ridley Scott film Black Hawk Down, the add-on campaign is designed for a squad of four, but you can play solo if you're up for a challenge. As of right now, it only works with mouse and keyboard, but they're bringing controller support in a later update.

Released in 2001, the Black Hawk Down movie is an adaptation of Mark Bowden's book about the 1993 Battle of Mogadishu in Somalia - a clash between Somali National Alliance forces and United States troops, who had arrived in the country as part of a United Nations intervention during the Somali Civil War. </p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2507950/view/542224071645987075?l=english">The game's version of these events</a> is broken into seven chapters, beginning with an attempt to abduct SNA lieutenants and escalating into efforts to escort rescue convoys to downed helicopter crews. It builds on input from one the movie's production companies, Revolution Studio.
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time a Delta Force game has tried its hand at Black Hawk Down. 2003's Delta Force: Black Hawk Down largely cut Scott out of the equation, taking inspiration directly from Bowden's book. The battle remains legendary in the States - it's been memorialised and revisited from different angles in several books and films. In 2013, pieces of the crashed US helicopters were recovered and turned into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908082526/http://www.asomf.org/2014/11/06/task-force-ranger-and-the-battle-of-mogadishu/">a museum exhibit</a>. Now, the story is being adapted by a team from China.</p>
<p>The Somali Civil War, meanwhile, is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somali_Civil_War">still on-going</a>. In a recent <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gx0jw5v1lo">BBC article</a>, published ahead of a new Netflix documentary, several Somali people recount the storming and bombing of their homes by US troops. Many of the survivors continue to call for <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/03063968231155358">reparations</a>.

		<p><em>All games are built on the games before it, in ways big and small.</em></p><p><em>In some cases, it might mean being the latest in a long running franchise, like Civilization VII, where you're navigating conversations on leading a genre and being a sequel. Who to serve? In another, such as Avowed, it might be trying to navigate around the game people think of when they look at screen shots, aka Skyrim, to find your own identity.</em></p><p><em>Rob has spent time with one of these games, while Patrick has spent time with the other. But both are dealing with similar issues in different ways. </em></p><hr><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>In recent weeks, I’ve played a decent chunk of the new Obsidian RPG, <em>Avowed</em>. You know that I didn’t have a great impression of that game when I first played it, but upon revisiting, I’ve found the combat, exploration, and storytelling clicking into place. It’s the kind of game where you are compelled to describe it, both positively and negatively, as “scratching an itch.”&nbsp;</p><p>An “itch” suggests that a need that’s not being fulfilled. (It also might mean I fall off the game, because an itch can go away, as you realize the reason you were invested was to address the itch.) The reason <em>Starfield</em> was so anticipated was precisely because nobody makes games like Bethesda Game Studios. Putting aside how <em>Starfield</em> turned out (boring! safe!), it’s also because nobody <em>can</em> make games like Bethesda Game Studios, because not everyone has the seemingly infinite resources and time to toil away at a formula they helped pioneer ages ago.</p><p>It’s also a game whose faults stick out—and sting more—because we likely won’t Bethesda take another swing for…half a decade? It’s impossible to know, but Elder Scrolls isn’t coming “soon.”</p><p>What Obsidian, as a studio, has been trying the last few years is fascinating. <em>The Outer Worlds, Grounded, Pentiment,</em> and <em>Avowed</em> are different from one another, but in other ways, there’s fascinating overlap. These are games made with smaller teams, with lower stakes and smaller budgets. That’s no guarantee from the crushing and irrational pressures of the games industry, but it means Obsidian games are as interesting for what they <em>aren’t</em>, as for what they <em>are</em>.</p><p>I started thinking about this after Obsidian spoke at this year’s DICE event. Per <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/obsidian-plans-to-make-rpgs-for-100-years-by-not-trying-to-grow-aggressively-expand-our-team-size-or-make-super-profitable-games/?ref=remapradio.com"><em><u>PC Gamer</u></em></a>:</p><p><em>One of the pillars of the plan is staying "lean and invested," meaning small enough that none of Obsidian's employees feel like a cog in a machine. Morgan and Britch said that in recent years they'd been considering opening multiple international offices, but in the end decided to partner with existing studios rather than risk weakening Obsidian's culture by getting too big.</em></p><p><em>Leanness can also refer to Obsidian's games: It doesn't aim for unprecedented scale or the most advanced graphics, and before it greenlights a game, Britch says the studio spends a lot of time determining how much to invest in the project with the assumption that it will be a "mild success," not a smash hit.</em></p><p>In <em>Avowed’s</em> case, I’ve seen some grumbling about how you can’t steal money, objects, anything. <em>Avowed</em> carries the aesthetics of a <em>Skyrim</em>-like game, and inarguably has pitched itself as a game that would, in theory, appeal to players who liked <em>Skyrim</em>, aka games laughably big and open-ended worlds, but intentionally limits its possibility space. Would <em>Avowed</em> be better if it had…a badly implemented version of stealing? It’d be an option over no option at all, I suppose, but it feels like we’re headed, more generally, towards a world where video games are more like <em>Avowed</em>, gesturing at the sprawling games of the past but with more modest ambitions, while we’re graced, at best, once in a generation with a new audacious Bethesda or Rockstar game.</p><p>Whether it scratches <em>your</em> itch, then, depends on what you wanted scratched in the first place.</p><p>I ask you this, Rob, in the context of the latest <em>Civilization</em> and the swings that game took. We get <em>Civilization</em> games more often than Bethesda games, but it’s still a big moment in the genre.</p><figure><figcaption><i><em>Avowed</em></i><span> sure is pretty, both in screen shots and while playing the game.</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>Patrick that is a good question but first I want to get a quick rant off about stealing.</p><p>It is one of the most problematic mechanics in RPGs. I am wracking my brain to think of a game where I really like how it works. I feel like even as far back as the Ultima series it felt like it highlighted how odd RPG worlds are.</p><p>Think how games struggle to signal what even counts as stealing. You’ll come across an item and its description pops across the interface but with a tag: “steal”. Across the room, a similar item bears no such tag. So does that mean it’s fair game? In a lot of RPGs it does. You walk into people’s stores and houses and just start ransacking them right in front of them, and as long as you don’t grab a forbidden item you’re all good. But say you do grab a forbidden item? What happens? Well, that opens an entirely new can of worms: how do characters detect when you have stolen? Does the game just flag you as a thief whether you were seen or not? Do I have to be observed by the character I’m stealing from? By any character? If I am detected, what are the consequences? Do I just have to kill or run away from this one person, or am I marked as a thief in a way that will follow me to other locations, like you walk into a store in New York and you see a wanted poster of yourself for swiping a water bottle in Racine? Does that even make sense for the setting, given how frequently you’re in a low-tech fantasy world where information does not travel easily?&nbsp;</p><p>Even if an RPG figures out a way to communicate all this and create some consistent, sensible rules to handle theft and detection, the odds of it actually being <em>fun </em>to play as a thief are low. Most RPGs aren’t anything like stealth games and pass / fail skill checks don’t make for the most riveting stories, so stealing turns into yet another thing that drives constant quicksaving and probably even more boring inventory management.</p><p>Larceny feels like one of those things where you either need to really make it a major focus in a game, or you need to steer clear of it because it cannot help but highlight the barely held-together artifice of game worlds. Usually my flirtation with a life of crime in an RPG ends when a small theft leads to me depopulating an entire village with sword and spell, as I am swarmed to the death by every man, woman, and fantasy critter in the town because I grabbed “Soup [steal]” and not “carrot.”</p><p>In a funny way, I think the <em>Civilization </em>series is also one that has been transformed and maybe a bit tortured by a need to encompass activities and goals that don’t come naturally to it. If you go back to the early games, they involved a <em>lot </em>of combat. You could build a space ship and win the game that way but even then, you’d probably have to smack down a couple other civilizations along the way. The grand historical sweep of it was a theme draped over a game about acquiring resources to turn into more resources or into armies to go pulverize other people.</p><p>That kind of game would have gotten stale regardless, but also it kind of hit a point where you were making a game about colonizing as much of the world as possible and your primary interaction with other players was “so is it time for genocide?” So <em>Civilization </em>started giving players other goals and tried telling different stories about history from this foundation of “colonize land, build armies, crush enemies.”</p>

            <p>
Julian Gollop, creator of the original X-COM game - known as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ufo-enemy-unknown">UFO: Enemy Unknown</a> here in the UK, and followed up by Firaxis' <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/xcom-enemy-unknown">XCOM: Enemy Unknown</a> later on - has told Eurogamer that he would be quite happy to return to the series in some form. Also, that he's fine with still being known as just "the X-COM guy" - despite the few decades' worth of subsequent games he's made since.
</p>
<p>
Speaking with Gollop as part of an interview on his new action-RTS hybrid, Chip 'n Clawz vs. The Brainiods, where Eurogamer discussed the wider state of strategy and tactics games (on which he has some opinions), the conversation naturally ended up back at his original series. I wondered if he ever felt pigeon-holed by the X-COM label, given how many games he's made since.
</p>
<p>
"I am perfectly happy being known as the X-COM guy," he said when I asked. "I mean, it was a foundational game in my career, and probably also, in some ways, a foundational strategy game in strategy gaming at the time - even though not long after it game out, the RTS scene really took over."
</p>
<p>
But then, he added, "as we know, turn-based came back, X-COM came back and so you know, I'm quite proud of what we managed to do then. Can I ever beat that? Well probably not, no," he laughed. "You know, I'm still interested in making games, maybe not always in the turn-based genre. Chip n' Clawz is something a little bit different. So you know, I don't mind. It's fine!"
</p>
<p>
As for a hypothetical return - which I was particularly curious about after he made such a close spiritial successor, in 2019's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phoenix-point">Phoenix Point</a> - in whatever form that might take? "Yeah, sure," he said. "I'm still waiting for the call from Sid," he joked, referring to Firaxis' long-serving boss Sid Meier. "Let's see if he calls."
</p>
<p>
As for his current project, it's a smartly-made twist on the genre - a genre Gollop hopes it'll add at least a small dose of innovation to - but whether that smart twist can help a slightly more family-focused game take off in such an intensely competitive field these days is another question. You can read more about that in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/x-coms-creator-believes-the-strategy-genres-in-dire-need-of-innovation-and-his-new-game-is-his-attempt">Chip n' Clawz preview, and full interview with Gollop</a> himself.

			<p>Despite having debuted 11 months ago on the market, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth sold extremely well last month in the United States thanks to its PC release, further highlighting how damaging exclusivity can be.</p>
<p>According to new sales data shared today by Circana (NPD), the second entry in the Remake trilogy, which launched on PC late <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-to-launch-on-pc-on-january-23rd-with-improved-lighting-enhanced-textures-and-nvidia-dlss-support/">last month</a>, was the third best-selling premium game in the United States, right after two huge sellers like Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Madden NFL 25. The massive jump in rank of both the standalone game, going from rank 56 to 3, and of the Twin Pack also including Remake, from rank 265 to 16, strongly highlights how well the game sold on PC, despite a port that, while much better than that of the previous entry in the series, still leaves something to be desired, especially in terms of performance.</p>

<p>No matter the platform, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a game that any JRPG fan should definitely experience, as it features an amazing recreation of the remainder of the original's disc one that brings everything good that Remake did to new heights, as highlighted by Kai in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>If there’s one word to describe&nbsp;Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, it would be ambitious. Tetsuya Nomura, Kazushige Nojima, and the rest of Creative Business Unit I at Square-Enix have turned what is merely the remainder of Final Fantasy VII’s Disc One upon leaving Midgar into a 100-hour-long epic. Moments of distracted exploration throughout the massive wide-open environments are often bookended with more linear story segments that balance comedy and somber moments. Players will feel more intimately engrossed with the story of those chosen by the planet and routinely have their fond memories of playing the original tickled with delight. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is an absolute must-play for fans of the series.</em></p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/my-friend-pedro-creators-shotgun-cop-man-asks-you-to-arrest-satan.1115595/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shotgun-cop-man-my-friend-pedro-creator<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Devolver Digital (because of course) and developer DeadToast Entertainment have announced&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man</em>, the studio's next freewheeling shooter after its debut title&nbsp;<em>My Friend Pedro</em>.</p>

<p>Described by the two studios as a "devilishly fun ballistic platformer",&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man&nbsp;</em>sees the titular shotgun cop man descending into the depths of hell in order to arrest Satan. Yes, you read that right.</p>

<p>If you've played&nbsp;<em>My Friend Pedro</em>, then you can probably guess that this game likely won't be too heavy on the story. After all, in&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man</em>'s debut trailer, our hero yells at Satan to freeze, upon which he says "fuck you, Shotgun Cop Man" and flees. It's that sort of soiree.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shotgun-cop-man-gameplay.jpg?itok=xw9FIaSV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shotgun-cop-man-gameplay.jpg?itok=ga44pLn8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Shotgun Cop Man&nbsp;</em>eschews&nbsp;<em>My Friend Pedro</em>'s 2.5D look for a pure 2D aesthetic.</figcaption></figure><p>Gameplay-wise,&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man&nbsp;</em>promises to continue&nbsp;<em>My Friend Pedro</em>'s frenetic dual-wielding shooter gameplay, albeit with a much more pleasing to the eye (for me, at least) 2D visual style.</p>

<p>You'll go in armed with Shotgun Cop Man's signature boomstick and pistol, but you'll also be able to acquire other weapons on-site. You won't just be using the guns to shoot bad guys, either; you'll also be using them to traverse the world, propelling yourself through hell by the power of bullets.</p>

<p>Devolver and DeadToast are promising a "hand-crafted campaign" to enjoy, as well as extra No Damage and Speedrun modes if you really want to test your skills against the hordes of hell.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>




<p>As well as the aforementioned modes,&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man&nbsp;</em>will also let you create your own levels, and others can play them for "endless replayability". After all, Shotgun Cop Man is going to need a pretty convincing excuse to hang around hell after Satan has been arrested.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man&nbsp;</em>on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2966850/Shotgun_Cop_Man/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and Switch when it launches later this year, and a PC demo is available to try out right now.

                <p>NetEase is getting more aggressive when it comes to cracking down on the use of third-party plugins while playing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-rivals/" data-ref-id="5000-624043">Marvel Rivals</a>. It's now banning the use of an application called Blitz, although NetEase is being lenient in that it won't ban players who previously used the software.</p><p>A notice against using third-party plugins was put out on <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/announcements/20250220/40955_1213199.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Marvel Rivals' website</a> today, February 21. It specifically calls out Blitz, a third-party application that can be used while playing games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/league-of-legends/" data-ref-id="5000-40335">League of Legends</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> to gain insight into informative data about competitive games that players can't typically see. In Marvel Rivals' case, NetEase says players using Blitz could see damage and healing statistics, predict the use of Ultimate abilities, and use it to help decide which heroes to ban in competitive play.</p><p>While it's not as aggressive as cheating software that helps players see through walls or always have precise aim, NetEase explained that "we deem this program as cheating software and will no longer allow its use during gameplay." Thankfully for the Marvel Rivals players who use Blitz, this ban is not retroactive.</p><p>"Players who have previously used this software will not face any penalties, as long as you refrain from using it in future games," NetEase explained. "To uphold justice in our gaming universe and protect the integrity of your account, we strongly urge you to refrain from using any third-party plugins. Together, we can forge a vibrant and heroic gaming environment."</p><p>Marvel Rivals is available for free on PC, PS4, and Xbox Series X|S. The hero shooter recently <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/netease-financials-reveal-marvel-rivals-topped-40m-players-before-layoffs" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">surpassed 40 million players</a> and added The Thing and Human Torch as new playable heroes today.

			<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II has launched in a great technical state, bucking the trend of games launching in rather poor states in the 2020s, and feeling almost old-school in this, according to a new in-depth technical analysis shared online.</p>
<p>The tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> recently took a good look at the second entry in the series by Warhorse Studios, highlighting how going with CryEngine was a winning choice. Even in its DirectX 12 form, the game engine developed by Crytek delivers an essentially stutter-free experience even on mid and low-end hardware. On a fairly old Ryzen 5 3600 CPU and RTX 4060 GPU with a truncated PCIe bus, targeting 60 FPS at 1080p resolution at medium settings, which include demanding real-time software ray-traced global illumination, smoothness was impeccable even in areas with high NPC density, with no traversal or shader compilation stuttering, which is quite impressive considering the game doesn't feature visible shader pre-compilation, likely conducted instead during load times and during the game itself in an asynchronous manner that burdens the CPU less, thus allowing even an old CPU to handle the game smoothly. Put against other open-world RPGs running on different engines, like Dragon's Dogma 2 and Avowed, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is the definitive winner in terms not only of performance but of visual quality as well, as the two other games definitely don't deliver the same quality even at similar medium settings.</p>
<p>Besides going over Kingdom Come: Deliverance II's smooth performance, the Digital Foundry analysis goes over the game's excellent lighting and environments, how the Ultra settings are not really worth much, some optimization tips, and more. You can check out the analysis in full below.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-blitz-crackdown</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals-cracks-down-on-blitz-tool-but-promises-amnesty-for-users.1115559/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-blitz-crackdown<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>developer NetEase has announced a crackdown on popular third-party app Blitz, which players have been using to track damage statistics, ban certain heroes, and more.</p>

<p>In a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2767030/view/509572974349647985" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, NetEase says that Blitz "injects itself" into the game's process, allowing users to view "confidential information like damage and healing statistics". Not only that, but the tool also allows players to predict enemy ultimate cooldowns and "selectively ban heroes", which NetEase says "severely undermin[es]" fairness.</p>

<p>As such, NetEase says it's officially deemed Blitz to be "cheating software", and so using it in the game is no longer allowed. If you've got Blitz installed and you're using it for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>, it's probably best to uninstall it, and if you aren't using it yet, I wouldn't recommend starting.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-blitz-crackdown-magik-black-panther.jpg?itok=vFZbDV8M 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-blitz-crackdown-magik-black-panther.jpg?itok=sMYnfYxc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Using Blitz in&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>is now tantamount to cheating, NetEase says.</figcaption></figure><p>However, if you have used the tool in the past, NetEase says that you "will not face any penalties, as long as you refrain from using it in future games".</p>

<p>The developer closes by imploring players not to use any third-party plugins in order to "uphold justice in our gaming universe and protect the integrity of your account", so it sounds like you'll face a ban if you are caught using Blitz.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with Blitz, it's a tool that provides overlays for multiplayer games like <i>League of Legends</i>,&nbsp;<em>Valorant</em>, and indeed&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>&nbsp;until today.</p>

<p>Its use is tolerated by other game companies; in fact, according to Blitz itself, the tool is <a href="https://support.blitz.gg/hc/en-us/articles/4415398467737-Can-I-get-banned-for-using-Blitz" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">officially recognized by Riot</a>, so&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' stance is perhaps a little unusual among games for which players use the tool.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/league-of-legends-viktor-singed-blitz.jpg?itok=DqOueOYQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/league-of-legends-viktor-singed-blitz.jpg?itok=msI5W1sD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Blitz's use in&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>is all but endorsed by Riot.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>, it's a third-person hero shooter that's essentially&nbsp;<em>Overwatch&nbsp;</em>with Marvel characters. Heroes like Iron Man, Venom, and Storm do battle across a variety of maps, completing objectives like protecting certain areas or escorting moving objects to their destination.</p>

<p>The game recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-40m" rel="nofollow">hit 40 million registered players</a>, according to developer NetEase, but that didn't stop the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">closing down the Seattle studio</a> responsible for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em> and laying off all of its employees.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>right now for free on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2767030/Marvel_Rivals/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/marvel-rivals/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/marvel-rivals/9n8pmw7qmd3d" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is continuing its run as the best-selling game in the United States (US), taking the top spot for January 2025. It’s the fourth month in a row it has been at number one.</p>



<p>In the latest sales data from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lioxq6xkoc2w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Circana</a>, three of the top five spots remained the same with Madden 25 coming in second and EA Sports FC 25 being the fourth-best-selling title. Throughout the rest of the list comes a plethora of changes, including games like Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth having a resurgence after its release on Steam. For comparison, the game was ranked 56th in December 2024.</p>



<p>Rounding out the top five was Minecraft, which jumped up from ninth. </p>



<p>For those looking for new games, only one made the list in January as Donkey Kong Country Returns debuted at number eight. However, in addition to Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth, four games finished in the top 20 after being well outside in December</p>

Unlike PUBG, Prologue isn't a shooter or a battle royale. Instead, it's a survival game that pits players against bitterly cold elements and a treacherous environment.

		<p>The creator of My Friend Pedro has declared his next mission: to blast his way into Hell and arrest Satan. Yup, that’s the plot for the newly revealed ballistic platformer Shotgun Cop Man.</p>
<p>Published by Devolver Digital and by DeadToast Entertainment, Shotgun Cop Man is coming to PC and Switch later this year, but what would you know? It’s Steam Next Fest, so t<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2966870/Shotgun_Cop_Man_Demo/">here’s a demo now available for PC</a>!</p>
<p><iframe title="ARREST SATAN in SHOTGUN COP MAN | From the Creator of My Friend Pedro" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cWSNEN2mZH8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>After the balletic combat of My Friend Pedro, solo developer DeadToast has leant into the use of multiple firearms to get through levels. Shotgun Cop Man casts players as the titular lead-slinging cop, heading right down into Hell with the mission to arrest the dark lord armed with nothing bu a shotgun in one hand and a pistol in the other.</p>
<p>These ludicrously overpowered firearms are more than strong enough to propel Shotgun Cop Man through the levels, launching and bouncing him up and over obstacles, acting like Flappy Bird’s wings… but more murdery.</p>

<p>The game will feature feature a hand-crafted campaign, while hardcore fans will enjoy that each level has No Damage and Speedrun achievements to chase after. There will be support for user-generated levels as well.</p>
<p>The demo is out now on Steam featuring 17 levels from the full game.</p>
<p>We loved DeadToast’s last outing with My Friend Pedro. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/06/20/my-friend-pedro-review/">our review</a> of that sensationalist side-scrolling shooter, Nick said, “If you’ve seen John Wick before, you’ll see Keanu killing about ten villains in mere seconds without breaking a sweat and with insane precision. My Friend Pedro gives you a pretty good idea of what it’s like to be Mr Wick, with time slowing down to a crawl, giving you ample time to shoot everyone in the room. Even better, whenever you kill an enemy, the slow time bar replenishes, enabling you to pull off even more crazy stunts.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/january-2025-video-game-hardware-sales-fell-45-year-over-year-in-us/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Total video games sales in the United States (US) for January 2025 have fallen 15% year-over-year with hardware taking the biggest nose dive. This comes from the latest information for Circana and continues a trend of declining sales across the board.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lioxqlzmm42w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the data company</a>, January 2025 saw hardware sales fall by a massive 45% to $205 million while accessories fell 28% to $194M compared to January 2024. The $205 million in hardware spending represents the lowest January total for hardware since January 2020 saw just $131 million.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that January 2025’s data accounts for four weeks while January 2024 was five weeks. However, with drops that substantial, one more week likely isn’t something that would’ve made much of a difference.</p>



<p>Circana’s Mat Piscatella says that double-digit percentage drops happened across all of the major consoles. Nintendo Switch, which has its successor launching this year, fell 53% year-over-year while Xbox fell 50%. PlayStation 5 came in third, but still dropped 38% in total.</p>



<p>Despite the drop, PlayStation 5 remained the top-selling console in terms of both units and dollars. Xbox Series was second in dollars while Switch was second in units sold.</p>



<p>Moving on to accessories, the PlayStation Portal remained the top-selling accessory in terms of dollars. For units sold, the DualSense Wireless Midnight Black controller led the way.</p>



<p>Lastly, regarding the sales of the PlayStation 5 Pro, Piscatella says that its sales pace has fallen behind that of the PlayStation 4 Pro after three months.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/moroi-preview-macabre-weird-and-mysterious-in-all-the-right-ways<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">I think the first time I really understood what Moroi was, I mean the down-in-your-bones feeling you get when you’re playing something and the lighting bolt of understanding strikes you right on the noggin, was when my character fed himself to a talking meat-grinder because “something inside [him] screams let's do it!” Admittedly, it would have probably been funnier if Moroi had flashed a game over screen, and most games might’ve as a gag, but Moroi plays it straight. Into the meat-grinder you go, head-first. It chews for a bit and spits you out. You taste terrible, you see, and the grinder’s palate for manflesh is, for whatever reason, a bit more refined. Later on, you can offer it a severed hand (don’t ask) and it’s happy about that, and to grind up the bones and turn the leftover dust over to you so you can use it to help an old woman make “soup” (again, don’t ask), but eating the hand causes it to explode. “You are on fire,” your character remarks glibly as the machine spits binary. But you have your bone dust and it’s not your job to save sentient meat grinders who have developed a taste for longpig, so off you go to break some more stuff. And I said, out loud, “Ah, it’s a game like <em>that</em>.” And I was intrigued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The word moroi comes from Romanian folklore; it’s used to describe a vampire or ghost, or in some cases, a phantom that rises from the grave to draw energy from the living. I don’t know which part of the definition Moroi the game draws from. What I do know is this: your character, a bearded bear of a man, wakes up in a strange prison, in pain, with no memory of how he got there. Everyone else seems to know him, but he doesn’t recognize any of them. But maybe, as a very tall man in a very strange hat tells him, that’s for the best.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Screens  -  Moroi</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Your first order of business is to get out, and that means solving simple puzzles, many of which boil down to “acquire item, take it somewhere.” Go talk to the cannibal eating himself as performance art who asks that, if eating himself isn’t his magnum opus, lightning strikes him dead. When lightning strikes him dead, take his severed hand and bring it to the sentient meat grinder, who gives you bone dust before catching fire. Then you take that to the tall man in the funny hat, who tells you to take it to the old lady making soup (she needs some salt; you have bone dust. Same thing, right?) before reminding you that “Death will meet you soon enough” and weirdly offering up that his name is Edgar. So it’s off to the old woman, who gratefully accepts your “salt” and is pulled headfirst into the cauldron by the soup to see what’s on the other side. “I'm starting to think that wasn't soup,” your character says. Noticing a pattern here?</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s got Doom’s Glory Kills, which quite literally teleport you across the screen for very satisfying slow-motion execution that drops health.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">On and on it goes, whether it’s a toenail from an overfed corpse still being pumped full of… something, or taking the old woman’s spoon and using it to wake up the rat with the important job of running in his wheel and powering The Horrors (and the doors). But then something strange happens. Moroi gives you a sword, and throws a bunch of enemies at you, and that’s where the magic happens. Combat is simple — the top-down, twin-stick perspective seems a little weird when you’re solving puzzles, but then you get to a combat section and it’s like “<em>Oh</em>” — but it’s fast and hits feel weighty and satisfying and it’s got Doom’s Glory Kills, which quite literally teleport you across the screen for very satisfying slow-motion executions that drops health. And then you get a minigun that shoots harpoons. And that’s rad.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When Moroi is flipping between the two — quick, simple puzzles like using the number of corpses in a freezer to work out a door code, and combat sections against multiple enemies howling for blood like it’s Black Friday and you’ve just snatched the last George Foreman grill — it’s pretty grand. But there’s also plenty of weird stuff beyond that, too. At one point, you save a duck with human teeth from being turned into a wide variety of duck-based cuisine and he rewards you with his teeth so you can reinforce your weapon, and then explains the way out through bloody gums. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sometimes messages pop up on-screen offering cryptic hints at something more. Other times, story details are left to collectibles scattered around the environment. I particularly liked the one that listed Duck of Eternal Torment as a type of potential meal prepared from our toothy friend, and the one where the cleaning lady resigns because the furniture is upside down every day and she’s convinced the place is cursed and/or haunted.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And it’s never afraid to be weird. One of my Moroi demo’s last segments thrust me into the role of a strange, winged doll tasked by his mother (another doll) with helping his brothers – an increasingly rude group of trees – survive some incoming horror that’s killing all of them by literally giving away pieces of himself to do it. It’s an odd segment, but a compelling one, and when the credits rolled shortly thereafter, I wasn’t quite sure what to make of it, but I am interested in seeing where it goes from here. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are some things about Moroi that concern me: my demo was buggy (It crashed once;I got stuck between a door and a bookcase a couple times; once I fell through the floor) and some of the writing is uneven. But those are things that can be ironed out. Moroi marries the macabre and the mysterious, and it often went to places I didn’t see coming in my half-hour demo. I’m still not sure what a moroi is in this context, but I would like to find out. After all, who can resist a game with a meat grinder that lusts for the flesh of men and a duck with human teeth?</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

With only one new game release cracking the top 20 and the predictable domination of Call of Duty, there's little to crow about from last month... except, perhaps, what may be a comeback story for one of last year's alleged sales disappointments: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth debuted February 2024 to No.2 on Circana's charts, which rank video games by dollar sales in the U.S. It dropped to No.7 the following month, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-is-the-best-selling-game-of-2024-in-the-us">finished out the year at No.17</a>. While those numbers are respectable, post-launch there were numerous questions about whether or not the game had done well enough for Square Enix's tastes, or even especially well in comparison to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-sales-are-fine-but-its-no-dragons-dogma-2">other major RPGs in the same year like Dragon's Dogma 2 or its predecessor Final Fantasy 7: Remake</a>. Square Enix ultimately came out saying the game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-admits-final-fantasy-16-and-7-rebirth-profits-did-not-meet-our-expectations">failed to meet its sales expectations</a>, and never even announced a sales figure, suggesting it hadn't done well enough to brag about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But notably, Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth launched as a platform-exclusive on PS5, and exclusives usually face an uphill battle compared to cross-platform releases when it comes to sales. As of January 2025, Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth is exclusive no more, finally debuting on Steam and shooting up to No.3 on the Circana charts for the month from No.56 in December. The Final Fantasy 7: Remake &amp; Rebirth Twin Pack similarly rose from No.265 in December to No.16 in January thanks to the Steam release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's not all. Circana analyst Mat Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lhc3xrqq7k2z" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pointed out on Bluesky earlier this month</a> that Rebirth had a "fantastic" Steam launch: "Across physical &amp; tracked digital, Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth was the best-selling game of the week ending Jan 25th in the US market ($ sales), while the FFVII Remake &amp; Rebirth Twin Pack ranked 3rd."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now that's just the U.S., but it's likely this is emblematic of similar sales abroad, which when combined could signal to Square Enix that change is needed. This success inevitably invites speculation that swelling sales thanks to a PC launch may shift the company's plans for future Final Fantasy releases to a cross-platform launch. I asked Piscatella for his opinion on the situation, and here's what he said:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I mean it's hard for me to say what impact the Steam release has on publisher perception of overall title success. That's subject to all kinds of internal planning and expectations I'm not privy to, of course. But purely looking at consumer response, it was a very good launch month on Steam. This launch does provide yet another benchmark that shows releasing on PC makes a ton of sense at this point regardless of genre or historical release strategies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For 3rd party publishers, it's looking harder and harder to release exclusively on a single platform without significant incentives provided by the platform holder."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We'll just have to wait and see what Square Enix's reaction is at its next relevant earnings call...in May. Stay tuned.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It's looking harder and harder to release exclusively on a single platform without significant incentives provided by the platform holder.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the rest of the charts, it will surprise no one that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 was the best-selling game of the month again, followed by Madden NFL 25. The only new release cracking the top 20 in January was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd">Donkey Kong Country: Returns</a> on Nintendo Switch, which reached No.8 purely on the basis of physical sales (Nintendo does not share digital sales data for its eshop).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also notable was the return of It Takes Two to the top 20, in spot No.20. There's no single reason for this, Piscatella told me. "There has been promotion happening during the month, including the last week of Jan on both the PlayStation store and eShop," he said. "But really, It Takes Two had pretty steady sales all month. But it was in December that It Takes Two really started its latest rally with both sales and engagement upticks that extended into January."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Notably, much of the promotion for It Takes Two comes ahead of the release of Hazelight Studios' next game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a>, releasing in March.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, games spending numbers actually look a bit sad in January compared to last January, but there's one potential reason for that. This year's tracking period for January was four weeks long, while 2024's January was five weeks long, so that's a whole extra week to make money. But as a result, overall spending was down 15% to $4.5 billion for the month this year (it was 0.3% ahead of January 2023's four-week period). Accessories spending was down 28% year-over-year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Content spending was down 12% compared to last year, with console content down 35%. Hardware spending was down 45%. PS5 hardware spending was down 38% year over year, Xbox Series was down 50%, and Switch was down 53%. PS5 was the best-selling hardware of the month in dollars and units, with the Xbox Series second in hardware spending, and Switch barely second in unit sales.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The top 20 best-selling games in the U.S. for the month of January 2025, based on dollar sales:</h2><ol data-cy="list"><li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</li><li>Madden NFL 25</li><li>Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth</li><li>EA Sports FC 25</li><li>Minecraft*</li><li>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</li><li>EA Sports College Football 25</li><li>Donkey Kong Country Returns*</li><li>Hogwarts Legacy</li><li>Sonic Generations</li><li>Helldivers II</li><li>Astro Bot</li><li>Dragon Ball: Sparking!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/21/what-we-played-roadcraft-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-avowed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Steam Next Fest has been bubbling up behind the scenes all week, with so many game demos and announcements coming that I’m not even really sure when it’s starting. Some demos are out now, others are being run over the weekend, more are only coming out on Monday… but it means that if you have a PC and want to see what’s coming soon, you’ve got plenty to see and play this weekend.</p>
<p>As part of that, Dom and I played some <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/19/roadcraft-preview-where-were-going-we-need-to-build-roads/">RoadCraft</a>, a disaster recovery spin-off to the MudRunner series that really makes you feel like a kid in a sandpit. Add to that a game that would be Indiana Jones’ favourite management sim, and that’s my week of games.</p>

<p><strong>Aran’s</strong> ramping up his gaming again, since his return from the other side of the planet. He enjoyed his time with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/18/stories-from-sol-the-gun-dog-review/">Stories From Sol: The Gun-Dog</a>, a sci-fi visual novel, but this weekend has Afterlove EP and Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii booked in for review.</p>
<p>The love hate relationship with Alan Wake 2 has continued for <strong>Jim</strong>, who hit a roadblock with The Lake House DLC – “It solidified my opinion that while great at piecing together weird and compelling stories, Remedy doesn’t know how to pair this with interesting gameplay. It’s a shame as the final DLC is arguably the creepiest, zaniest part of the AW2 package – I just felt burned out after already putting some twenty something hours into the base game. I’ve now moved onto A Plague Tale: Innocence, hoping to wedge in a playthrough before Monster Hunter Wilds launches.”</p>


<p>Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope would score highly on a password complexity checker, and it scores highly in <strong>Ade’s</strong> finely tuned “good game” checker as well – “It’s a brilliant TBS game, accessible, fun, and perfect for a quick half hour of gaming.” He’s also had some fun times blast giant bugs in the cities of Helldivers 2 this week.</p>
<p>Bemoaning the difficulty of trawling the PlayStation Store sales of full game gems – all the DLC listings just clutter up the joint, don’t they? – <strong>Gamoc’s</strong> had a broad spread of games to play this week, including the Tomb Raider 4-6 remakes, Phasmophobia, Orcs Must Die 3, and Palworld. But he also did the important thing and grabbed a month of Game Pass in order to play Avowed… and about 15 other games on there that he was curious about.</p>

<p><strong>Steve</strong> has played “the forbidden game” of trying to do his marking and being a dad taxi to his kids. In video games, he finished off Gears 5 and got through most of Hivebusters DLC, but found the game endings have sort of petered out and left too many threads dangling. So he moved on to play Eternal Strands, which has been enjoyable, and is checking out a bunch of demos from Steam Next Fest, with a good few write ups to come.</p>
<p>And finally, <strong>Tuffcub</strong> has, as always, been playing Destiny 2.</p>
<p><em>Now then, what have you played this week?</em></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-january-2025-circana-us-sales-data</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-is-january-2025s-top-selling-game-according-to-us-sales-data.1115469/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-january-2025-circana-us-sales-data<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Circana has released its US gaming industry sales data for January 2025, and given that it's a month without many significant releases, the number one seller for the month probably won't surprise you.</p>

<p>As noted in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lioxq6xkoc2w" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky thread</a> by Circana's Mat Piscatella,&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>is once again the month's biggest-selling game across all platforms. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/circana-us-sales-data-2024-top-selling-games" rel="nofollow">was also 2024's top-selling title</a>&nbsp;by Circana's reckoning.</p>

<p>In second place for the all-format chart is&nbsp;<em>Madden NFL 25</em>, which isn't surprising given the colossal commercial success of that franchise <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-sports-college-football-25-best-selling-sports-game" rel="nofollow">and&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football</em></a>, while&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth&nbsp;</em>is in third, bolstered by its January PC release. Perhaps now, it can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-16-rebirth-profits-square-enix" rel="nofollow">strive to meet Square Enix's expectations</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-january-2025-us-sales-data.jpg?itok=_9qjfds5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-january-2025-us-sales-data.jpg?itok=49ipegHv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</em>'s PC release helped it hit third place in Circana's January 2025 sales chart.</figcaption></figure><p>Rounding out the all-format top five are&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC 25</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed" rel="nofollow">underperformed compared to EA's expectations</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>, which probably <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/diablo-player-count-gta-5-sales" rel="nofollow">couldn't be said to have underperformed</a> by any expectations in the known universe.</p>

<p>When it comes to specific formats,&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>tops the PlayStation chart for January, while&nbsp;<em>Madden NFL 25&nbsp;</em>tops the Xbox chart. As always, the Switch is dancing to its own tune; Nintendo's chart is dominated by&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Country Returns</em>.</p>

<p>As for player engagement - that is, games on each platform ranked by monthly active users -&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>is top of the chart on PlayStation, while&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>tops Xbox's chart.&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-40m" rel="nofollow">recently hit 40 million players</a>, is number one on Steam.</p>

<p>Spending as a whole across the industry fell by 15% compared to the same period last year, although as Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lioxq42zqc2w" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">points out</a>, January 2025 consists of four weeks rather than last year's five-week tracking period.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-circana-us-sales-data-january-2025.jpg?itok=jbbUZD91 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-circana-us-sales-data-january-2025.jpg?itok=AE6L4Gpo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>topped Circana's Steam player engagement chart for January.</figcaption></figure><p>Hardware-wise, the PS5 <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lioxqlznlf2w" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">emerged victorious</a> once again in January, beating out the Xbox and Switch in units and dollar sales. Xbox was second in dollar sales, while Switch came second in units.</p>

<p>As ever, Piscatella's full thread is well worth a look if you want to see some other stats. You can <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lioxq23ems2w" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">check the thread out here</a>.</p>
