			<p>Today, Supermassive Games and Bandai Namco <a href="https://x.com/LittleNights/status/1796512039768097038" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Little Nightmares III has been delayed to 2025. The developer and publisher jointly shared this message on Twitter/X:</p>
<p><em>Ever since the announcement of Little Nightmares III at gamescom last year, we've been thrilled to see our community buzzing with excitement and anticipation. </em><br>
<em>The teams at Supermassive Games and Bandai Namco Europe have been working hard towards delivering the best experience possible for the next entry in the franchise. As much as we can't wait for you to return to the Nowhere, we also want to make sure we give the game the care and love it deserves. Quality is a top priority for us, and we know you feel the same way. </em><br>
<em>For this reason, we've made the decision to shift the release of the game to 2025. We'll be sharing more about Little Nightmares III later this summer, so please bear with us and look forward to further updates.</em></p>
<p>The game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/little-nightmares-3-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> last year during Geoff Keighley's Gamescom Opening Night Live. Here's what little we know about Little Nightmares III:</p>
<p><em>In Little Nightmares III, you follow the journey of Low &amp; Alone, as they search for a path that could lead them out of the Nowhere. Trapped within the Spiral, a cluster of disturbing places, the two friends will have to work together to survive in a dangerous world full of delusions and escape the grasp of an even greater threat lurking in the shadows.</em></p>
<p><em>For the first time in the franchise, face your childhood fears together with a friend in online co-op, or in solo with an AI companion.</em></p>
<p>Little Nightmares III will be released for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

Unofficially, we all know a PC version is likely in the works. Historically, Rockstar has done this many times: Announce a game for consoles, release it, then announce a PC version, and launch that later. But until a <em>GTA 6</em> PC port is officially confirmed and announced, it seems like everyone who works at Rockstar and its parent company Take-Two must be vague  about all of this. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/take-two-discusses-decision-not-to-announce-grand-theft-auto-6-for-pc/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/take-two-discusses-decision-not-to-announce-grand-theft-auto-6-for-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As spotted by <em>VGC </em>on May 31</a></span>, when recently asked about <em>GTA 6</em> coming to PC during an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://wsw.com/webcast/cowen162/ttwo/2064582&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://wsw.com/webcast/cowen162/ttwo/2064582" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview</a></span> at a  conference this week, we got this fun word salad from Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Well, the lack of an announcement is not something that could be set in stone as near as I could tell, because the only thing that happens after the lack of an announcement is an announcement, I suppose, or a continuing lack of an announcement. I guess that could happen, too. It doesn’t seem to me that either would be set in stone. But Rockstar has an approach to platforms which we’ve seen before. And they will make more announcements in due time. I do believe that the right strategy for our business is to be where the consumer is, and historically what this company has done is address consumers anywhere they are, on any platform that makes sense, over time. Okay?</p></blockquote><p>You can definitely read between the lines here and pull from this answer that, yeah, duh, <em>GTA 6</em> is going to get ported to PC. Rockstar always focuses on consoles first, then PC after that. It followed this playbook with <em>GTA V</em> and <em>GTA IV</em>. Zelnick alludes to that by saying “Rockstar has an approach to platforms which we’ve seen before.” </p><p>But again, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/some-reasons-why-the-games-industry-is-so-secretive-an-1825929139&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/some-reasons-why-the-games-industry-is-so-secretive-an-1825929139">because the industry is obsessed with secrecy</a></span> and holding back every announcement for future events and trailers, Zelnick has to dance around the obvious. You never know when you’ll need to use the announcement of <em>GTA 6</em> on PC as leverage!</p><p><em>Grand Theft Auto 6 </em>is set to arrive in Fall 2025 on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. And I bet in 2026 or sooner you’ll get a PC port, just don’t ask anyone at Rockstar or Take-Two about it right now.</p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It features robot versions of characters from every console generation, and used old console hardware and peripherals as props. It’s evident by just how many references are in its first trailer that <em>Astro Bot </em>is continuing the tradition with a mix of nods to huge PlayStation hits and deep cuts from the brand’s rich past. Here are the characters, consoles, and peripherals we saw in these few minutes of footage.<br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="616025e89eca6f8a9d5748d6981cdbed" data-recommend-id="image://616025e89eca6f8a9d5748d6981cdbed" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Astro hurries a crowd of robots." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Astro hurries a crowd of robots." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="616025e89eca6f8a9d5748d6981cdbed" data-recommend-id="image://616025e89eca6f8a9d5748d6981cdbed" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Astro hurries a crowd of robots." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Right off the bat, we get several references to PlayStation characters in the form of the PlayStation Studios logo screen. Astro leads a stampede of robots, some dressed as PlayStation characters. The menagerie includes <em>God of War</em>’s Kratos and Atreus, Aloy from <em>Horizon</em>, Spike and an ape from <em>Ape Escape</em>, <em>Uncharted</em>’s Nathan Drake, and Ratchet from <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank</em>. Most of these characters will show up again later in the trailer, but it’s not the full extent of the PlayStation heroes that will make an appearance in <em>Astro Bot</em>.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2e9544f6253927b245c870e2a839a29c" data-recommend-id="image://2e9544f6253927b245c870e2a839a29c" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Astro jumps on the DualSense ship." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Astro jumps on the DualSense ship." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2e9544f6253927b245c870e2a839a29c" data-recommend-id="image://2e9544f6253927b245c870e2a839a29c" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Astro jumps on the DualSense ship." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One of the very first things we see, after being reintroduced to Astro Bot, is a DualSense controller, the PlayStation 5’s next-gen version of the famous Dualshock.

<p data-characters="254" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">There are countless <em>LEGO </em>sets available to purchase and, if you’re trying to keep to a certain budget, things can get a little complicated. With sets costing hundreds of dollars, it’s not always easy to find an affordable <em>LEGO</em> set to gift or hoard.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="306" data-current-count="306" data-injectable="false">However, as a collector with a child who is also turning into something of a <em>LEGO </em>fan, I’ve had to get thrifty, and I’ve become pretty good at finding <em>LEGO </em>sets on the cheaper side. On this list, I’ve included something for all tastes and the best part? None of these sets sell for more than $50 USD.</p> <h2 id="h-bonsai-tree" data-injectable="false"><strong>Bonsai Tree</strong></h2> <p data-characters="17" data-current-count="323" data-injectable="false"><strong>Price: $49.99 USD</strong></p> <figure data-current-count="623" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via LEGO</figcaption></figure>

Well, almost. You can build one trunk and then have the choice between greenery or Cherry Blossoms to complete the look. I love this set and have it in my bedroom, changing the leaves depending on the season.</p> <h2 id="h-venomized-groot-marvel" data-injectable="false"><strong>Venomized Groot (</strong><strong><em>Marvel</em></strong><strong>)</strong></h2> <p data-characters="17" data-current-count="299" data-injectable="false"><strong>Price: $49.99 USD</strong></p> <figure data-current-count="599" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via LEGO</figcaption></figure>

You also get a <em>LEGO </em>version of Tom Riddle’s Diary from The Chamber of Secrets, complete with soggy sock, and the cake which results in bars being put on Harry’s window.

Designed by Matthew Aston, it’s a celebration of inclusivity, positivity and kindness. Even if it’s not designed to be played with, this one’s still a pretty cool set to have. Bonus points if you can avoid getting the song stuck in your head.</p> <h2 id="h-dinosaur-fossils-t-rex-skull-jurassic-world" data-injectable="false"><strong>Dinosaur Fossils: T.

 <p data-characters="345" data-current-count="345" data-injectable="false">Even if you’re not that much of a fan of the Jurassic World franchise (though I’m unsure how you couldn’t be, at least when it comes to the original movie), this set looks really nice sitting on a shelf.

It’s actually pretty big, standing at 15 inches tall, so it’s replaced the real plant on my dining table. I can attest that, as someone who is terrible at keeping houseplants alive, <em>LEGO </em>flowers are an excellent alternative!</p>

		<p>Nacon is set to take a shot at the sim racing world, announcing the development of its first steering wheel peripherals and the formation of a new department dedicated to racing.</p>
<p>The French publisher and game accessories maker is building the new racing department around KT Racing on the game development side – currently hard at work finishing development of Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown – and a new Revosim premium brand that will include Nacon’s first steering wheel.</p>


<p>Revosim will check all the boxes for a modern high-end racing wheel with a direct drive motor, a GT steering wheel design, and a set of pedals with a load cell for braking.</p>
<p>Details on pricing and availability have yet to be announced, but the Revosim will be going up against the best of Thrustmaster, Logitech, Fanatec and more boutique wheel manufacturers. It’s a potentially difficult market to crack, but new contenders are always welcome.</p>
<p>The racing department is being led by Sébastien Waxin, who has been in charge of Nacon’s racing game catalogue of over a decade. For the announcement he said, “We are proud to be presenting, for the first time, the prototype of our first premium racing wheel during Bigben Week. Its development represents a natural step in the evolution of NACON’s expertise, epitomised by the new brand Revosim, which combines the company’s many years of experience in racing simulations with the flagship Revolution accessories brand. We are looking forward to revealing the technical details of the steering wheel in the coming months.”</p>

<p>Nacon is a well established brand for third party gaming peripherals. The RIG gaming headsets have their distinctive industrial style combined with high quality audio, there’s an ever-evolving set of pro controllers for PlayStation and Xbox, keyboards and mice for PC, arcade sticks and more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/video-games-coming-out-june-2024/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Keeping track of all the latest video games coming out is an increasingly complex task, what with multiple PC storefronts, Xbox One, PS4, Switch, mobile, and more to keep track of, but don’t worry, I’m here to help. Every month I'll be running down the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/games-coming-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">games you need to be keeping an eye on</a>, from the big triple-A headliners, to the intriguing indies you might overlook.</p>
<p>June is sure to be a big month for video game news, but it isn’t that big in terms of actual releases. That said, there are still a few promising things coming, including Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD and Atlus' big revamp of Shin Megami Tensei V. Meanwhile, on the indie front, players can look forward to the atmospheric horror game Still Wakes the Deep, stylish dungeon crawler #BLUD, and more. Oh, and we don't cover DLC in these articles, but still, I feel like I should at least quickly mention <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</a> is coming out on June 21.</p>
<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> While I may have played demos or got early access to some of the games recommended in this article, in most cases I’m simply choosing games that look promising, and can’t vouch for the end product. Do wait for reviews before buying! </em></p>
<p>That said, here are the games you should be looking out for in June…</p>
<h2><strong>The Headliners</strong></h2>
<p><iframe title="Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance - Official 'The Ultimate Beginning' Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/edeihC8xHt0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance (PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, PS5 &amp; Switch, June 14)</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/shin-megami-tensei-v/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shin Megami Tensei V</a> originally came and went without too much fanfare as a Switch exclusive back in 2021, but now Atlus is giving the game another chance to shine. Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance not only totally revamps the game’s presentation for more powerful platforms, but adds an entire second story path, new areas, demons, and more. Atlus considers this the new standard version of SMTV, going so far as to remove the older Switch version from sale. You can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CWN2RMFT/?tag=wccftech0a9-20">pre-order Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Luigi's Mansion 2 HD (Switch, June 27)</strong></p>
<p>Continuing our theme of underappreciated games getting another shot, in between the original Luigi’s Mansion and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/luigis-mansion-3-bustin-good/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acclaimed Luigi’s Mansion 3</a>, Nintendo released the 3DS-exclusive Luigi’s Mansion: Dark Moon. It was a very ambitious game by 3DS standards, and now it’s getting a full Switch revival under the title <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/luigis-mansion-2-hd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD</a>. Rev up your Poltergust and check out the Luigi’s Mansion game you may have missed out on. You can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CYPPRX3N/?tag=wccftech0a9-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pre-order Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD here</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Promising Indies</strong></h2>
<p><iframe title="#BLUD - Official Trailer | IGN Fan Fest 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Eu6q2V3i5U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>#BLUD (PC, June 18)</strong></p>
<p>Looking for a Diablo-esque dungeon crawler without &nbsp;all the darkness and gloom? Well, then #BLUD might be for you. The game combines dungeon crawling with lively Nickelodeon-style animation (and some violence you wouldn’t see on Nick). Oh, yeah, and there’s vampires, too! Here’s the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1921480/BLUD/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page for #BLUD</a>.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Still Wakes the Deep - Official Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uGz5zvgCOEA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Still Wakes the Deep (PC, Xbox Series X/S &amp; PS5, June 18)</strong></p>
<p>A good setting can make or break a horror story, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/still-wakes-the-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Still Wakes the Deep</a>, set on a massive isolated deep sea oil rig off the coast of Scotland, has a great one. Developed by Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs and Dear Esther developer The Chinese Room, Still Wakes the Deep has some atmospheric walking-sim-style elements to it, but it also looks to serve up plenty of intense moments of survival and otherworldly horror. This is indie horror amped up. Here’s the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1622910/Still_Wakes_the_Deep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page for Still Wakes the Deep</a>.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Until Then - Official Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MDCwoJQrAOY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Until Then (PC &amp; PS5, June 25)</strong></p>
<p>Until Then is a gorgeously hand-crafted 2D narrative adventure that aims to immerse players in the dramatic world of high school kids living in the Philippines. You’ll be doing more than just chilling out though, as the game also weaves in magical and mystery elements to draw the story along. Video games can transport you like few other mediums, and this looks like a journey worth taking. Here’s the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1574820/Until_Then/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page for Until Then</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Times &amp; Galaxy (PC, Xbox Series X/S, PS5 &amp; Switch, June 21)</strong></p>
<p>As somebody who’s spent 15 years writing for a living, I can assure you it isn’t always that exciting, but I must admit, Times &amp; Galaxy looks to do a pretty good job of making journalism entertaining. For starters, the game takes place in a fun sci-fi setting and features a “build-a-story” mechanic that turns writing into a sort of fun puzzle (if only it was really like that!) Here’s the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/883230/Times_and_Galaxy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page for Times &amp; Galaxy</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/hellblade-2-patch/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-hellblade-2-patch-addresses-ghosting-issues-improves-fsr3-artifacts-alongside-numerous-other-fixes.886620/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/hellblade-2-patch/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ninja Theory has deployed a new Hellblade 2 patch, packing fixes for several issues, including frame generation ghosting issues, and more.</p>
<p>The new patch is a minor one for Ninja Theory's recently released Hellblade sequel, but one that will be welcomed by fans nonetheless. Aside from the aforementioned fixes for frame generation issues, this new update improves FSR3 artifacts, addresses some crashing issues, and fixes some encountered memory leaks. In addition, the update fixes missing captions as well as facial animations, and adds a warning prompt when selecting ‘New Story’ (this option resets the current save's story progress).&nbsp;You can find the full release notes for this new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2461850/view/4166471769756034428" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hellblade 2 patch here</a>.</p>
<p>Hellblade 2 is available worldwide now across PC and Xbox. The game is also available through Game Pass. Here's what we wrote about this great-looking sequel to 2017's Hellblade in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-the-perfect-game-pass-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch review</a> earlier this month:</p>
<p><em>"On that note, Ninja Theory will assuredly get their latest work in the hands of many more users, which is great for this type of experience. However, I'm not so sure Microsoft will be just as happy with the return on investment, especially since Senua's Saga: Hellblade II is otherwise sold at $49 (instead of the original's $29) and is unlikely to set sales charts on fire. I expect Microsoft&nbsp;will eventually release it on PlayStation consoles&nbsp;to maximize profits.</em></p>
<p><em>I still have to discuss the audiovisual department. There's not much to say here except that it is absolutely stellar. Unreal Engine 5 is used to its full extent, with Nanite making a particularly impressive showcase of its virtual geometry in the impressive rendering of Iceland's rocky environments. The atmosphere and lighting are fantastic, although I found certain scenes to be a bit too dark, to the point where you literally had to increase the gamma to see anything."</em></p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24168219/longlegs-director-preview-nicolas-cage-serial-killer-movie</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/longlegs%E2%80%99-director-on-what-the-horror-movie%E2%80%99s-viral-marketing-campaign-is-hiding.886617/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24168219/longlegs-director-preview-nicolas-cage-serial-killer-movie<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="m2X4Rj">If you’ve seen anything about <em>Longlegs</em>, from its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24055798/longlegs-horror-movie-trailer-teaser-release">cryptic teasers to its spooky trailer</a>, you probably know it’s an upcoming horror movie about a serial killer played by Nicolas Cage. You also probably don’t know much else. </p>
<p id="FHiSSP">The trailer has elements that certainly feel recognizable, like a young female FBI agent investigating a notorious serial killer, but there’s an overwhelming sense of unease and mystery that leaves the whole thing feeling just a little bit off, enhancing the creepiness and unfamiliarity. And according to director Oz Perkins, that’s very much by design. </p>
<p id="PqWxRL">Perkins describes <em>Longlegs </em>as a “pop-punk, nostalgic serial killer movie with a supernatural flavor,” but he didn’t want to throw all that at audiences right away. </p>
<p id="s17SK6">“[I] used things like <em>Silence of the Lambs</em>, <em>Se7en</em>, and <em>Zodiac </em>as kind of primers,” Perkins says. “So the audience sees those clues, or those cues, and says, <em>OK, I understand how this will work.</em>”<em> </em></p>

<p id="yCZ1cS">But these cinematic touchstones are more like starting points than destinations for Perkins, a veteran horror filmmaker whose past work, like <em>The Blackcoat’s Daughter</em> and <em>Gretel &amp; Hansel</em>, has proven popular in the world of arthouse horror but never quite broken into the mainstream. </p>
<p id="jxHTVM">“It’s meant to be easier on an audience to connect with it. So that when it gets funky, and it does get funky, we’ve kind of earned it,” Perkins explains. “It’s more playful at that point. I think in previous movies, I think I’ve gotten a little opaque. [...] Now I want to make something that more people will enjoy, and will give me more latitude to do what I want, so it starts with something more familiar.”</p>
<p id="rNXipH">Perkins’ work on the movie started with the character of Longlegs, who had been figuratively lurking in the background and at the edges of some of his previous stories and ideas. He said he knew certain things about the character, but compared it to seeing the back of someone who looks familiar as they leave a convenience store: You’re so positive you know them, but you can never be totally sure — a terrifying description for a character that would later become a serial killer. </p>
<p id="ZMk3CA">“I knew that he drove up to people’s houses, on their birthdays, or on their kids’ birthdays,” Perkins says. “And he brought with him sort of, maybe, stuffed animals? He was a clown or a singer or magician or performer or something.”</p>
<div id="YqjI2J"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OG7wOTE8NhE?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="rDcGgL">But turning that vague idea of a character into something to center a movie around proved to be more of a puzzle for Perkins. He says he worked it out like a crossword puzzle, understanding the shape and space he had allotted, then fitting in the details that would make the movie work and make it accessible for audiences, like turning Longlegs into a serial killer, or centering the movie on a young FBI agent to pull in a <em>Silence of the Lambs</em> homage — a movie he says made a huge impression on him as a kid. </p>
<p id="80GtH5">Another key piece of the puzzle for Perkins was adding Nicolas Cage to the project as the serial killer in question. Perkins says Cage read the script and loved it, and that he brings an undeniably unique energy to all his characters. It was Perkins’ job to find a way to channel that energy. </p>
<p id="cqXDzl">“There’s no version where I’m going to try to change him into something that he’s not, or try to diffuse what he’s going to bring,” Perkins explains. “You don’t get Nicolas Cage in your picture unless you want what he’s going to bring. You kind of just wait and see what it is. And you have faith and trust that it’s going to be right. And in this case, it really is.”</p>

<p id="dt3v65">As for where the story of <em>Longlegs </em>goes after the familiar setup, Perkins didn’t offer many details, preferring to save the surprises for when people can see the movie for themselves. However, he did offer up the tantalizing note that David Lynch is a particularly big inspiration for him. </p>
<p id="ZrOzQV">“<a href="https://www.polygon.com/23298759/twin-peaks-movie-fire-walk-with-me-anniversary-criterion"><em>Fire Walk with Me</em></a> was really important to me,” he says. “I feel like the tempo, the environment, the cadence of things, the world, those things are really deep in my psyche and I think they probably come in the wash a bit.” </p>
<p id="uvPY6t">One thing Perkins does make clear is that viewers are best off experiencing all of <em>Longlegs</em>’ twists and surprises in a theater if they can. </p>
<p id="mTrjWC">“We are hiding something under a veil,” Perkins teases. “We are hiding something under a curtain and it’s more fun to pull the sheet off when there’s a lot of people watching. It’s kind of like, <em>Gather around so we can reveal the Elephant Man.</em> And I think doing that in a room with people, in an immersive experience of the theater — I’m proud to have made a movie that works well that way.”</p>

Summer is here. Pride month is here. And we’re taking the time this weekend to cram in some more gaming with a few recent titles, a wonderful indie game from a couple of years ago, the return of a GameCube title from 2004, and more. </p><p>If you’re in search of something to play this weekend, we invite you to consider these fine gaming experiences. <br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0f99d61ec65307fbb2dc10a222605df7" data-recommend-id="image://0f99d61ec65307fbb2dc10a222605df7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The protagonist of Nine Sols fights a much taller enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist of Nine Sols fights a much taller enemy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->RedCandleGames</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0f99d61ec65307fbb2dc10a222605df7" data-recommend-id="image://0f99d61ec65307fbb2dc10a222605df7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The protagonist of Nine Sols fights a much taller enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>PS5, Switch, Windows (Steam Deck YMMV*)<br><strong>Current goal:</strong> Get lost in its gorgeous Taopunk world</p></div><p><em>Nine Sols </em>strikes me as an interesting follow-up to Red Candle Games’ previous work in the horror genre, with <em>Detention </em>and then <em>Devotion</em>, but I’m here for it. The studio’s been quiet about the game for a long time now, sparingly offering up updates over the last year, but it’s finally here and I’m relishing the chance to play it all weekend. Inspired by Taoism, but mechanically akin to a 2D <em>Sekiro</em>, I’ve been stoked on <em>Nine Sols</em>’ blending of faith, mythology and a grim sci-fi world since I first saw it. A demo from a year ago assured me of its mechanics, and now that it’s in my hand, I’m finally able to lose myself in <em>Nine Sols</em> and parry my way through its gorgeously rendered world. Just as soon as I finish <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em>, though. – Moises Taveras<br></p><p><em>*Your mileage may vary</em></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="76311a491685f548eb557c5467892d46" data-recommend-id="image://76311a491685f548eb557c5467892d46" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cloud and Aerith run through the town of Kalm as mountains loom in the distance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cloud and Aerith run through the town of Kalm as mountains loom in the distance." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="76311a491685f548eb557c5467892d46" data-recommend-id="image://76311a491685f548eb557c5467892d46" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cloud and Aerith run through the town of Kalm as mountains loom in the distance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This game burned me out bad, man. My most anticipated release of 2024,<em> Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> quickly exhausted my hype levels. I went hard the first weekend it came out, played several evenings afterwards, and then drifted to playing once or twice a week. I reached peak enjoyment while perfecting my timing during the Shinra parade in Junon, and quickly hit a wall upon arriving in Costa Del Sol. It’s not that I ever stopped enjoying the game—my momentum just kind of fizzled. Tons of other stuff came out. <em>Helldivers 2 </em>was much easier to drop in and out of during spare moments here and there. More recently, <em>Diablo IV</em>’s been serving as that end-of-evening brain-off respite. But I really want to finish <em>Rebirth</em>. I need to finish<em> Rebirth</em>. So this weekend I’m going to try to mainline the story as much as possible before the endless mini-games and open-world side activities once again grind things to a halt. I love that stuff, but I can’t wait 100 hours to see this ending everyone hates so much. At least nothing’s coming out next month to get in my way. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d1f66bf4b646c1a0535bb5c4f4a269b7" data-recommend-id="image://d1f66bf4b646c1a0535bb5c4f4a269b7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A character navigates an icey environment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A character navigates an icey environment." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Cicada Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d1f66bf4b646c1a0535bb5c4f4a269b7" data-recommend-id="image://d1f66bf4b646c1a0535bb5c4f4a269b7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A character navigates an icey environment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>Switch,<strong> </strong>Windows (Steam Deck YMMV)<br><strong>Current goal: </strong>Stars! MORE STARS!</p></div><p>If you asked me if I needed another block-pushing puzzle game in my life, I’d likely have just shaken my head and walked away. I don’t know what caused me to even load up <em>Isles of Sea &amp; Sky</em>, given its Sokobanish stylings, but I’m ever so glad I did.</p><p>This is far more than standard block-pushing. This is a vast, ever-expanding world of islands to explore, each packed with unique puzzles, often solvable in two or three different ways for different rewards. It has heavy <em>A Link to the Past</em> undertones, while never feeling like it’s leaning on <em>Zelda</em> as an inspiration, instead possessing its own unique character. Each island has a sort of deity-like being that needs you to find six of at least a dozen tokens, which will then unlock new blocks that allow you to re-approach the area’s puzzles using new skills. For instance, the second island you’ll likely explore has specific blue blocks that are eventually transformed into gorgeous little blue sprites, who will take on the properties of any block they’re shoved into. This obviously has enormous consequences on puzzles you couldn’t solve before, and offers new ways to approach those you could to reach a different prize.</p><p>I really, really thought I was done with this genre, usually finding the nature of sokoban puzzles—where you’re endlessly finding yourself in dead-ends—to be far too frustrating, but <em>Isles of Sea &amp; Sky</em> (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://islesofseaandsky.com/faq&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://islesofseaandsky.com/faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">once known as <em>Akurra</em></a></span>) removes all of this with single-button taps to take back any move, and another tap to reset a location.

I felt a bit of this concern before diving back into one of my all-time favorite games, <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em>, via its brand-new remake on the Switch. I needn’t have worried, though. If anything, what I’m finding is that it’s even better than I remembered.</p><p>Everywhere I go, the writing is so funny, so sparkling, so heartfelt, that I’m deliberately talking to every last minor NPC because I don’t want to miss a word. For me, that delightful writing and the wonderful cast of characters you meet remain the game’s biggest draws, but the game shines elsewhere, too. Navigating the world, and using Mario’s ever-increasing assortment of abilities—err, I mean terrible curses—to find secrets and access new areas, is a delight, and the combat hits that sweet spot of being accessible to genre newcomers and deep enough to keep you engaged. But yes, come for the writing, and the game’s endearing papercraft visuals, which look better than ever on the Switch. You won’t be disappointed. — Carolyn Petit</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="17bff8252dae454cd72f1f547a2b5fbe" data-recommend-id="image://17bff8252dae454cd72f1f547a2b5fbe" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The protagonist of Signalis takes aim at enemies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist of Signalis takes aim at enemies." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->rose-engine / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="17bff8252dae454cd72f1f547a2b5fbe" data-recommend-id="image://17bff8252dae454cd72f1f547a2b5fbe" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The protagonist of Signalis takes aim at enemies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>PS5,<strong> </strong>PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch, Windows (Steam Deck OK)<br><strong>Current goal: </strong>Just enjoy it</p></div><p>Ever since I reviewed the retro-inspired horror game<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/crow-country-indie-survival-horror-review-1851462202&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/crow-country-indie-survival-horror-review-1851462202"><em>Crow Country</em></a></span> at the beginning of May (and found it lacking), I’ve been itching to revisit 2022’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/signalis-survival-horror-impressions-review-pc-ps4-xbox-1849730503&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/signalis-survival-horror-impressions-review-pc-ps4-xbox-1849730503"><em>Signalis</em></a></span>. The first game from the two-person team Rose Engine was one of my favorite of the year, and it’s never quite left my mind since. Like <em>Crow Country</em>, <em>Signalis </em>is a survival horror game that visually and mechanically pulls heavily from the PlayStation 1 games that defined the genre (think <em>Silent Hill </em>and <em>Resident Evil</em>). Where the two differ, however, is in execution. </p><p><br><em>Signalis </em>is one of those rare retro-inspired games that so intrinsically understands what makes its inspirations tick, and is able to not only recreate their greatness but build on it. The game follows android LSTR as she seeks to find her partner in the abandoned halls of a mining facility, now overrun with zombie-like creatures. Through item scarcity, inventory management and puzzles, the player must go deeper into the facility as you learn what caused a mysterious disease now running rampant. On top of the excellent use of tension is a wonderfully twisting story about love, and it’s pretty excellent. <em>Signalis </em>is a game that constantly rewards revisiting its world and I can’t wait to see what new things I pick up on this time around. – Willa Rowe  </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5ea06bfb9c03a0942b75c3b21d69920e" data-recommend-id="image://5ea06bfb9c03a0942b75c3b21d69920e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Characters from Adventure Time stand next to a strange beast." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Characters from Adventure Time stand next to a strange beast." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Player First Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5ea06bfb9c03a0942b75c3b21d69920e" data-recommend-id="image://5ea06bfb9c03a0942b75c3b21d69920e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Characters from Adventure Time stand next to a strange beast." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Windows (Steam Deck YMMV)<br><strong>Current goal: </strong>Figure out if I actually like this game or not</p></div><p>I don’t like most platform fighters, and I don’t think WB’s crossover brawler <em>Multiversus </em>is going to be any different.

<p>PlayStation might have some announcements during Summer Games Fest 2024, it’s been claimed.</p>



<p>Renowned tipster, <a href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1796320512081354980">Midori</a>, known for their scoops related to SEGA and Nintendo, recently tweeted about PlayStation attending Summer Game Fest. The post informed players that more information regarding “Metaphor: ReFantazio and Sonic X Shadow Generations” will be relayed during the Summer Game Fest. Adding to this, Midori stated that we can expect announcements on “more titles from SIE studios too”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is hard to know what PlayStation will showcase at the event, as they have only revealed that they will be at the event in some capacity. However, we speculate that it could be the game that LEGO and PlayStation are collaborating to create, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-horizon-adventures/">LEGO Horizon Adventures</a>, which was exclusively reported by Insider Gaming earlier this month. The game should be similar to what we have seen in their Star Wars, Marvel, DC, and other Traveller’s Tale series of games. Sources previously revealed that the game would be “Horizon Forbidden West but LEGO.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other than that, players are hoping that we might receive something from Sucker Punch, maybe a reveal for Ghost of Tsushima 2. Geoff Keighley also has a close relationship with Kojima, so we might get another glimpse at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Death Stranding 2</a>. In addition, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-officially-announced-at-playstation-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Astrobot pre-orders</a> are set to go live on June 7, so another look at the game could be on hand during the main show.</p>



<div><p>Sony Interactive Entertainment recently hosted a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-may-2024-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">State of Play event</a>, which included a series of announcements and reveals such as Astro Boy, Concord, God of War: Ragnarok PC release date and a bunch more for PSVR 2 too. It seems this dedicated event was probably not long enough for them to provide us with updates on all of their projects. Which could be a reason enough to take the stage during Summer Game Fest 2024. </p><p>What do you think PlayStation could be cooking up for Summer Game Fest in 2024?</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/next-tarkov-wipe-confirmed-august/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Battlestate Games has just revealed that the next global wipe event in Escape from Tarkov will take place in August, making it one of the longest durations between wipes in the game’s history. This reveal took place today on the TarkovTV broadcast, during which Nikita Buyanov shared plenty of information about what’s coming next, ranging from new weapons to hideout expansions – and much more.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-tarkov-s-next-wipe-is-still-months-away">Tarkov’s Next Wipe is Still Months Away</h2>



<p>Escape from Tarkov has had a tough time of it of late. The game has been the subject of much controversy, particularly with Battlestate Games introducing a brand-new edition of the game that was deemed ‘pay-to-win’ and borderline disrespectful to existing players. In recent weeks, the team at Battlestate Games has tried to make amends, including leaning more actively into community feedback to make Escape from Tarkov ‘better’.</p>



<p>In the latest episode of TarkovTV, Nikita Buyanov revealed that the patch that’ll bring the next wipe is dropping in August 2024. He didn’t specify a date, but referenced that it would be ‘early August’. The last wipe was in December, so it’s a lengthy gap – one of the longest between wipes in Tarkov history.</p>



<p>Here are some other tidbits coming to Tarkov per the showcase:</p>



<ul>
<li>Bipods</li>



<li>New weapons (M60)</li>



<li>Hideout areas</li>



<li>Mannequins and more display mechanics in the Hideout</li>



<li>A new secure stash box</li>



<li>New apparel</li>



<li>Crossovers between Arena and Escape from Tarkov</li>



<li>‘Arena Boxes’ – loot boxes, essentially</li>



<li>Factory rework</li>



<li>Tripwires and landmines (both AI and players) on containers and dead bodies</li>



<li>PMC Karma</li>
</ul>



<p>There’s plenty more coming – so stay tuned.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/anger-foot-is-like-john-wick-with-some-extra-kick<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Hands-on with the frantic first-person shooter that brings new meaning to the term foot soldier.</h2></div><section><p>Fast-paced first-person shooters may be a dime a dozen these days, but Anger Foot has a unique gameplay hook that is literally kicking the door down for your attention. This colourful and completely chaotic shooter from the makers of Broforce is like a first-person take on the compelling, room-clearing carnage of Hotline Miami, with an emphasis on using your left foot of fury to violently smash a path through locked doors, obstacles, and gangs of anthropomorphic animal enemies. It’s a shoot and boot ‘em up that feels like John Wick with some extra kick, and I enjoyed the two hours I spent playing an early build of Anger Foot every skull-stomping step of the way.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>There are guns too, of course, but the pistol in your hand is merely a support act to the size 12 snuffer of life at the end of your left leg. There’s no ammunition to pick up and reload, instead once you’ve run out of rounds to chamber you just throw your empty gun at an enemy to stun them, jump-kick them into next week, and catch their freshly dropped uzi or shotgun before carrying on your merry, murderous way. Enemies can be booted directly into their friends behind them like dim-witted dominoes, and there’s never any shortage of explosive gas canisters or oil barrels to be found in each gang den you crash through, allowing for spectacular chain reaction kills – or your own instant death should you accidently shoot them at close quarters.  </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The pistol in your hand is merely a support act to the size 12 snuffer of life at the end of your left leg.</p></div><p>In fact, I’ve died a lot during the two-dozen levels I’ve played so far, since you’re every bit as vulnerable to one-shotted deaths as the enemies around you. A continually shuffling roster of enemy types and combinations meant that Anger Foot consistently kept me on my anger toes, forcing me to find new strategies to most efficiently deal with each new threat. When riot gear clad birds arrived I started firing off a round to make them reflexively raise their shields so that I could run in and boot their bulletproof barriers straight back into their beaks. Meanwhile I was delighted to find that the grenades thrown by puffer jacket-clad goons could be volleyed back at them with a well-timed kick, forcing them to watch their own bomb blow up in their faces like they were the producers of the Madame Web movie.      </p><p>Surviving all the way to each level exit earns you a star, but there are a further two stars to claim per level for optional challenges such as completing a level within a stricter time limit, or killing a certain number of enemies using only your foot. Some of these additional objectives seem seriously challenging, and although each level only takes a couple of minutes to complete I can see myself spending hours trying to earn all the stars in the finished game – although I don’t know how I’m supposed to beat a level in under 30 seconds when I keep getting distracted by the playable Broforce arcade machines found along the way. </p><p>The more stars you earn, the more special shoes you can unlock and lace up, with each pair of kicks granting you a unique gameplay buff not unlike the animal masks from Hotline Miami. You might strap on a pair of high tops that earns you a precious round of ammo for every bad guy you boot in the face, or slip into a pair of sneakers that activates a big head mode to make it easier to headshot enemies from long range. I also found footwear that could charge up kicks into room-clearing dash attacks, as well as another pair that let me come back from the dead once per level. Talk about a sole revival!</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Anger Foot Screens</h3></div></output><p>I also unlocked a slightly embarrassing pair of socks with sandals that allowed me to deal extra damage during boss fights, although this did mean that I was able to easily stomp out Anger Foot’s first major boss like it was a house spider under a work boot. Given how tricky the levels that preceded it were, including one against an unseen sniper that instantly snuffed out my sprints between cover, it seemed slightly disappointing to dispatch the leader of the Violence Gang with a mere handful of half-hearted highkicks. Hopefully there’ll be some heavier head honchos to contend with in the three other gangs to take down in Anger Foot – namely the Pollution Gang found in the sewers, the Business Gang found in the high rises, and the Debauchery Gang found in… I don’t know, one of P. Diddy’s mansions, probably.  </p><p>Basic boss fights aside, Anger Foot’s evolving combat and cartoonish charm kept a goofy grin on my face during my playtime, and its rousing, bass-heavy techno groove had me tapping my toes while I was capping my foes – from rooftop shootouts with heavily-armed gangbangers to subterranean stoushes with snakes and giant squid tentacles in the sewers below. It remains to be seen if the instantly gratifying action of Anger Foot will have the anger legs to go the distance in the finished game, but based on what I’ve played so far it seems like this is one frantic first-person shooter that’s truly putting its best foot forward.</p><p><em>Tristan Ogilvie is a Senior Video Editor in IGN's Sydney office.

"But the reality is no one has tried it. If you create an enormous role-playing game, for example, with 100 or 150 hours of gameplay, very polished, and a unique experience, would the consumer be willing to pay more? If they would, they would have more products potentially coming to market. But no one tried it.</p><p>"It's something we have been discussing, but we are currently sticking to the practice of the industry. Would it be that one [company] one day that tries to increase pricing? That remains to be seen."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/31/lars-wingefors-001-1713775735682-1717170527566.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption><strong>EMBRACER CEO LARS WINGEFORS. IMAGE CREDIT: EMBRACER GROUP.</strong></figcaption></figure></output><p>The triple-A video game industry collectively raised the price of its video games with the launch of the current console generation in 2020, but in recent months the $70 price point has become the topic of much discussion amid the industry’s ongoing struggles. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gamers-mostly-played-older-games-like-gta-5-and-fortnite-in-2023">Recent data points to gamers tending to favor older, live service games</a>, such as Fortnite, Roblox, and Call of Duty, leaving less room for new, full price games.</p><p>Indeed, Embracer has seen a number of high-profile flops, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alone-in-the-dark-reboot-flopped-embracer-says-after-laying-off-staff">including the recently released horror revival Alone in the Dark</a>, which Wingefors said was “a big investment” that “didn't catch enough consumers”.</p><p>"I think the industry is facing the same problem as all other industries, with inflation and rising costs of game development," Wingefors added. "And it's been hard to increase pricing [in] premium PC/console. The pricing of those products has been the same for many years, which means that the margin to succeed is less, and on top of that, there is a higher cost of capital. Ultimately when you make big investments or games, you need to play with teams you are very confident in, or with IPs you own or control, and have the full financial income.</p><p>"On top of that, the consumers have more content than ever to choose from. They love to engage in established IPs they've been playing before, which means it's harder to have them trying out new things or new IPs. It's just something we're all facing. It's a reality which we have been adapting to over the past year, and we will continue to adapt to that reality."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"The pricing of those products has been the same for many years...</p></div><p>Wingefors’ comments suggest Embracer is waiting for another video game company to go first, essentially, before it follows suit with a price hike. But what company could justify such a move, which would likely be met with a backlash from gamers?</p><p>Rockstar is currently the subject of debate around this topic, with the Take-Two-owned company preparing to release <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA 6</a> late 2025. Rockstar has yet to announce a price for GTA 6, or how the game will be sold, but there are few other games that would move the needle quite as much as this behemoth.</p><p>In November 2023, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said video game frontline prices “are still very, very low” compared to other forms of entertainment “because we offer many hours of engagement”.</p><p>“The value of the engagement is very high,” Zelnick added. “So, I think the industry, as a whole, offers a terrific price-to-value opportunity for consumers. That doesn't necessarily mean that the industry has pricing power or wants to have pricing power. However, there is a great deal of value offered.”</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Or is it?</h2></div><section><p>Chasing the End doesn’t hide its inspirations for even a second. In the opening scene, Rion, a young woman in Seoul, South Korea, rises from the bed in her apartment building, the TV in the corner showing nothing but static, and a not-so-subtle pixel-art poster of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/28/inside-review">Playdead’s 2016 masterpiece</a> Inside hanging on the wall behind her. </p><p>In fact, Inside is the only pristine thing you could possibly be reminded of as you explore Rion’s world. Everything has gone to hell: trash coats the floors of her building, rooms are boarded up, the walls are cracked and crumbling, and as an elderly neighbor stops Rion for a quick chat to plead for help cleaning her place up, it quickly becomes clear that this is not a prosperous world. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Chasing the End - Screenshots (plus a bonus gif)</h3></div></output><p>In fact, Rion tells her nosy neighbor that she’s given up and that she’s heading to the Han River, where we soon guide her and learn that she intends to jump off the bridge, as so many others have before her – all signified by the shoes left on the side of the railing. She has second thoughts though, fortunately, and is then startled by the sound of gunfire and a crash. She meets a wounded soldier whose quick trigger ensured that he was the only survivor of the scuffle. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Inside poster on Rion's wall is the only pristine thing you could possibly be reminded of as you explore her doomed world. </p></div><p>As he bleeds out, he entrusts her with a data key; it’s something that, if the soldier is to be believed, is so valuable that it could buy Rion a ticket to a life that will last longer than the week or so the Earth has left before it’s destroyed by guaranteeing her passage on an escape rocket for the rich and elite. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>And thus Rion has a reason to hope, and Chasing the End has its gameplay catalyst. The demo I played only contained the Prelude and part of Chapter 1, but after setting up its raison d'etre, it shows off the start of what to expect: plenty of physics-based puzzles. Like the Playdead games that inspired it, Chasing the End will have you manipulating objects in the environment in order to clear obstacles and open paths to the next area. The controls are simple – there’s just one interact button and a jump button – and so far it’s nothing complicated (at least, in this super early slice of the campaign), but it’s enough to get you thinking as you’re drawn towards the next part of Rion’s story. </p><p>I quite like Chasing the End’s simple but very bleak pixel-art visual style, and there’s already more dialogue here than in all Playdead games ever made combined, which doesn’t guarantee quality, but it does at least promise that developer Jino isn’t trying to make a shameless Inside clone. There is an original idea here – and a rather captivating one at that thanks to the asteroid-induced apocalypse that serves as the backdrop for the action – so let’s see if the team is able to fulfill its potential.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Additionally, your melee recharges faster, your weapons reload more quickly, and recovery is greatly increased. Mobility is pretty decent for an Exotic where you'll want to move quickly in and out of danger, recovery is pretty good, and intellect is high enough to allow for quicker cooldowns on your Super. Resilience and strength are very low, so this weak roll is hard to recommend this week.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Mobility: 15</li><li dir="ltr">Resilience: 2</li><li dir="ltr">Recovery: 18</li><li dir="ltr">Discipline: 10</li><li dir="ltr">Intellect: 22</li><li dir="ltr">Strength: 2</li><li dir="ltr">Total: 69</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr">Actium War Rig (Exotic Titan chest armor)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4311084-destiny22024-05-3119-07-15.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4311084" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4311084-destiny22024-05-3119-07-15.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4311084"></a><figcaption>Actium War Rig</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4311084-destiny22024-05-3119-07-15.jpg"></figure><p>If you're picking up a SUROS Regime this week and you're playing as a Titan, Actium War Rig is a great Exotic to pair it with. This chest piece steadily reloads a portion of your equipped auto rifle or machine gun, allowing you to fire for longer. Sweet Business is one of the best Exotics to use with it, as you'll be shooting for days with this armor. Mobility is unnecessarily high on this build, but with a high intellect stat, it could work nicely for a build focused on popping a Ward of Dawn Super as quickly as possible. Resilience and recovery aren't too bad, but the low strength stat will need to be increased with armor mods.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Mobility: 12</li><li dir="ltr">Resilience: 11</li><li dir="ltr">Recovery: 13</li><li dir="ltr">Discipline: 6</li><li dir="ltr">Intellect: 22</li><li dir="ltr">Strength: 6</li><li dir="ltr">Total: 70</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr">Karnstein Armlets (Exotic Warlock gauntlets)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4311085-destiny22024-05-3119-07-24.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4311085" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4311085-destiny22024-05-3119-07-24.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4311085"></a><figcaption>Karnstein Armlets</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4311085-destiny22024-05-3119-07-24.jpg"></figure><p>A vampiric Exotic, Karnstein Armlets grant cure and restoration instantly when you land a melee or finisher final blow.

Spinning Up increases the rate of fire the longer you hold down the trigger, or it can be swapped out for Dual Speed Receiver. This slows down the rate of fire while increasing damage.

The studio recently <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/02/29/crash-bandicoot-4-spyro-reignited-trilogy-dev-toys-for-bob-is-splitting-from">went independent</a> after splitting off from its former parent company, Activision Blizzard.</p>

<p>The studio states its new title is "very early in development" and that we won't see it for some time. Whatever this game is, Xbox will be its home, which isn't surprising since the studio teased it was exploring a relationship with the publisher a couple of months ago.</p>

<div>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">We're excited to announce that we'll be partnering with <a href="https://twitter.com/Xbox?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Xbox</a> to publish our next new game. We're still very early in development, so you might not hear from us for a bit - but know that we're working hard on an experience we're so sooo inspired about! Can't wait to share more 💜 <a href="https://t.co/6EqrQbabpv">pic.twitter.com/6EqrQbabpv</a></p>

</div>

<p>Toys For Bob went independent in February, a few months after <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/10/13/microsoft-has-officially-acquired-activision-blizzard-for-69-billion">Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard</a>. The studio is seemingly getting to have its cake and eat it too, since it still gets to work with Xbox while being an autonomous entity. Prior to leaving Activision, Toys For Bob worked on the recent Crash Bandicoot games such as Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time and Crash Team Rumble. It also developed the Spyro Reignited Trilogy and created the once-wildly popular Skylanders series.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="253" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you’ve been waiting impatiently for the updated <em>Final Fantasy XIV Dawntrail</em> Benchmark, I’ve got good news for you. The new version finally has a release date of June 3, and we’ve also got new information about what to expect when it’s here.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="308" data-current-count="308" data-injectable="false">While the release date for the updated <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/yoshida-acknowledges-ffxiv-dawntrail-benchmark-complaints-updated-version-on-the-way/">Benchmark</a> software has been up in the air for a while, we do at least have some evidence of the hard work put in to get <em>Dawntrail</em> looking as it should, and the June 3 release date means players still have plenty of time to make sure their setups can handle <em>Dawntrail</em>.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="345" data-current-count="653" data-injectable="true">The further delay can be at least partly attributed to the fact that routine building inspections at the development offices will result in ‘full power outages’ on June 1 and 2, meaning that any issues that arose during an earlier release would be left two days without attention. I wouldn’t want to be that building inspector.</p>

            <p>
Arkane Austin's ailing vampire shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/redfall">Redfall</a> has received its final update, as the developers themselves are purged by parent company Microsoft. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/redfall-will-receive-one-final-update-after-all-including-an-offline-mode">Announced a few weeks back</a>, Redfall game update 4 introduces a much-requested offline mode and single-player pausing, together with some new in-game progression features and activities: a Community Standing bar whereby Support currency can be spent on rewards from the Safehouse Skill tree, and Elder Nests, aka vampire nests with specially modified vampire bosses. That's in addition to new enemy encounters in Redfall Commons, improved AI and a new Unrivaled Weapon.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The new Elder Nests will appear around Redfall much like Heart Nests, and are distinguished by a purple glow. Slay the boss vampire lurking within, and you'll earn a temporary Heart Shard buff that scales to campaign difficulty.  As for the revamped Neighbourhood stuff, there are six ranks of Community Standing encompassing 39 permanent buffs, from cosmetics appearing on your map and compass to an Escape Plan buff that activates a salvaged Bellwether cloak for 10 seconds when your health is critical. 
</p>
<p>
"All the upgrades from the Community Standing Skill Tree are meant to provide you with a mixture of QoL and gameplay benefits," the developers note. "A few of the traits will even help collectors finish out their hunt for cosmetics and Grave Locks. You can read more about the patch on <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/57LBTGVNF2rYof6K3yMGLP/redfall-game-update-4-available-now?linkId=100000263752169">Bethesda's official site</a>.  
</p>
<p>
Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-shutting-down-the-studios-that-made-redfall-and-hi-fi-rush">announced</a> that Arkane Austin together with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tango-gameworks-deserves-to-be-remembered-for-more-than-shinji-mikami">Hi-Fi Rush developers Tango Gameworks</a> would close on May 7th, in what Xbox's Matt Booty termed a "consolidation of our Bethesda studio teams, so that we can invest more deeply in our portfolio of games and new IP." 
</p>
<p>
Arkane Austin's other works include <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remembering-prey-arkane-austins-masterpiece">the wonderful Prey</a>. Redfall isn't nearly as captivating, but I think even detractors would agree that it harboured the spark of something greater, with an engrossing setting and visual direction that were spoiled by bugs, a shortage of compelling activities and some rather scanty post-launch support during its first year.</p>
<p>
"The thing is, I actually quite like wandering around Redfall," Ed Thorn <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/redfall-review">wrote in our review</a>. "Discounting the pop-in and the MMO-esque warring factions that don't actually damage one another, it's got some impressive buildings and occasional hints of Arkane magic, and even the jank can't pull me out of enjoying the lazy port town controlled by vampires. There's a nice ratio of imposing museums to auburn flora, coupled with moments of wonder as you notice the sea's been parted by supernatural forces, or as you're whisked into the warped halls of a vampire's brain during a big set piece. Interiors are also on point, too. Arkane know how to make rooms seem lived in and there's plenty of it here."</p>
<p>
While it'll never be the game it could have been, Arkane Austin managing to add offline support in the face of layoffs means that Redfall won't vanish as and when Microsoft turns off its servers. "So many people worked so hard to make this patch a reality, even after they learned Arkane was closing," lead narrative designer Steve Powers <a href="https://x.com/stevepowers/status/1796225006763942191">wrote on Xitter</a> as the patch went live last night. "I am so immensely proud of the Arkane team and will treasure my time with them forever."
</p>
<p>Best of luck to all of Arkane Austin's survivors.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/does-until-dawn-require-a-psn-account-on-pc-answered/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Sony has a plan. It doesn’t involve Tahiti, though. Its goal is to launch a few exclusives on PC, then keep the sequels to said games on its console ecosystem. In turn, the company expects fans to buy a PlayStation 5 or, in the future, a PlayStation 6 to continue playing a franchise. Little do they know, we’re patient players. But those games that are coming to PC now have a few caveats to consider for many. Namely, does Until Dawn require a PSN account on PC?</p>



<h2 id="h-do-you-need-a-psn-account-to-play-until-dawn-on-pc">Do You Need a PSN Account to Play Until Dawn on PC?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, right alongside God of War Ragnarok, Until Dawn requires a PSN account to play on PC. Despite being a single-player cinematic experience, Until Dawn features PlayStation Trophies and the new PlayStation Overlay, similar to the Xbox Overlay, requiring a constant play connection.</p>



<p>Even worse, over 120 countries worldwide cannot purchase or play any game with PSN requirements. PSN isn’t supported worldwide, only in approximately 70 countries. </p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-until-dawn">What is Until Dawn?</h2>



<p>Did you play The Quarry? If not, I recommend scooping it up on Steam, especially with the upcoming Steam Summer Sale dropping prices to ridiculous lows. In any case, it’s a cinematic horror experience in which you control a group of characters as they attempt to survive the night from untold horrors in the darkness. It’s not a direct sequel to Until Dawn, but they share many similarities in style and gameplay.</p>



<p>Until Dawn follows a group of friends as they venture into the wilderness, hoping for a camping getaway at an isolated lodge. Unfortunately, they’re not alone. You’ll control individual group members, making life-or-death decisions along the way and changing the tale’s outcome with every choice.</p>

                <p>Final Fantasy 16 is on sale for only $35 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPMTJJ6D?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1825606123847527313%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Ffinal-fantasy-16-is-on-sale-for-cheap-at-amazon-and-best-buy%2F1100-6519089%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy</a>. This matches the best price yet for the latest (brand-new) mainline entry in the series.</p><p>While every Final Fantasy game is different, Final Fantasy 16 takes the RPG roots of the series and injects a healthy dose of action into its design. The result feels like a mix between the action-packed spectacle of Devil May Cry and the RPG elements of older Final Fantasy games as you use a combination of swords and sorcery to defeat powerful foes.</p><p>This is also one of the darkest Final Fantasy entries, a game that wastes no time in setting up its stale of warring kingdoms, bustling slave trades, and cutthroat politics. All of this is seen through the eyes of Clive Rosfield, the protagonist who players will guide across a story that spans decades and charts his quest to bring balance back to a world that is in disarray. Don't worry if that sounds too much like Game of Thrones, because unlike that HBO series, Final Fantasy 16 has stunning boss fights between the Godzilla-sized Eikons that you'll encounter.</p><p>"Having seen Final Fantasy 16 all the way through, I'm happy to include it alongside some of my all-time favorites in the series," Michael Higham wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-16-review-on-its-own-terms/1900-6418081/" data-ref-id="1900-6418081">Final Fantasy 16 review</a>. "It's heartening to see that this bold approach to both story and gameplay is now part of that legacy, expanding the definition of what a mainline entry could be. It may fall short in some respects, but it should be celebrated for its most stunning moments and the characters who embody them. FFXVI succeeds and earns its place within the Final Fantasy pantheon as one of the great entries, and does so on its own terms."</p><p>Final Fantasy 16 is just one of many PlayStation exclusives on sale right now during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-days-of-play-2024-ps5-deals/1100-6523751/" data-ref-id="1100-6523751">Days of Play</a>.

<p data-characters="209" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Toys for Bob has announced <a href="https://x.com/ToysForBob/status/1796556809660207498" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Twitter</a> that they’ve teamed up with Microsoft for their next new game. There’s no word on what that next new game will be, but their choice of partner is… quite the choice.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We're excited to announce that we'll be partnering with <a href="https://twitter.com/Xbox?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Xbox</a> to publish our next new game. We're still very early in development, so you might not hear from us for a bit – but know that we're working hard on an experience we're so sooo inspired about! Can't wait to share more 💜 <a href="https://t.co/6EqrQbabpv">pic.twitter.com/6EqrQbabpv</a></p>— Toys For Bob (@ToysForBob) <a href="https://twitter.com/ToysForBob/status/1796556809660207498?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 31, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="400" data-current-count="700" data-injectable="true">Toys for Bob was originally a subsidiary of Activision Blizzard and, along with them, were <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/uk-regulators-give-consent-for-microsoft-to-acquire-activision-blizzard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bought up by Microsoft in 2023</a>. It was only a few months before Microsoft went to work laying of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-people-making-the-games-keep-paying-the-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1,900 employees</a>, including <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/toys-for-bob-future-unclear-amid-studio-closure-and-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some that were at Toys for Bob</a>, leaving the developer’s survival in question. Subsequently, Toys for Bob was able to split from the newly acquired Activision and set out on their own.</p>
 <p data-characters="140" data-current-count="140" data-injectable="false">Since then, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/redfall-and-hi-fi-rush-developers-shut-down-in-another-awful-wave-of-microsoft-cuts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft has shuttered</a> Arkane Austin, Tango Gameworks, Alpha Dog Games, while absorbing Roundhouse Studios into ZeniMax Online.</p> <p data-characters="547" data-current-count="687" data-injectable="true">I consider myself to be a forgiving person, but I’m confused that the studio is so eager to partner with their former existential threat. I shouldn’t be too surprised because, at the time of their split, Toys for Bob said in a statement that they were looking into a possible partnership with Microsoft. It may have been a part of the deal that allowed them to separate. Or perhaps they are working on a property owned by Microsoft. Or maybe they feel it’s a safe partnership because Microsoft no longer has the power to lay off their staff.</p>
 <p data-characters="626" data-current-count="626" data-injectable="false">Toys For Bob most recently worked on the <em>Skylanders </em>series, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-spyro-reignited-trilogy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spyro Reignited T</a></em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-crash-bandicoot-4-its-about-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>rilogy</em>, and <em>Crash Bandicoot 4: It’s About Time</em></a>. It’s possible that the developer is looking to return to one of those licenses, which would necessitate a deal with Microsoft. However, that’s purely speculation trying to make sense of the matter. We won’t know until the project is revealed. According to the Tweet, “We’re still very early in development, so you might not hear from us for a bit – but know that we’re working hard on an experience we’re so sooo inspired about! Can’t wait to share more.”</p>

<p data-characters="230" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>EA Sports College Football 25</em> challenges players to pick their spots and protect their players from taking big hits at all costs. Here is everything you need to know about the wear and tear feature and how to best avoid injuries. </p> <p data-characters="470" data-current-count="470" data-injectable="true">Wear and tear is a new feature in <em>EA Sports College Football 25</em>, which accurately tracks the impact of every hit and fall on your players. For example, if your quarterback throws the ball 40 times in a game and takes a few shots from sitting in the pocket for too long, he won’t operate at 100 percent the following week. Or, if a running back takes a huge shot to his knee or lower leg, they won’t have the same explosiveness on the following set of plays. </p>
 <p data-characters="238" data-current-count="238" data-injectable="false">Thankfully, there is a way to mitigate wear and tear and prevent your best players from taking unnecessary damage that might potentially keep them off the field when they’re needed most. Lets jump right into how this feature works. </p>  <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cfb25-wear-tear-4-screens.png.adapt_.768w.jpg&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;1200&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;675&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="538" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via EA</figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Image via EA</figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Image via EA</figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="509" data-current-count="509" data-injectable="true">As seen in the image above, every limb and body part of a player is linked to a different color indicator. Yellow is slight, high is orange, and severe is red. Based on the hits or fatigue from that body part, the color will change, and a meter in the bottom left indicates how close a player is to becoming injured. Fortunately, their body parts will degrade slower based on the toughness rating, and players can regain health when they are not on the field, during timeouts, at halftime, and between weeks. </p>
 <p data-characters="424" data-current-count="424" data-injectable="true">To avoid injuries, users should regularly make substitutions to provide rest and prevent wear and tear. In addition, it’s always more fun to make an exciting spin move, juke, or hurdle over defenders, but you don’t always want to put your players in dangerous positions. So even though it’s not as flashy, sometimes running out of bounds or doing a safe catch might save your team for later in the season. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">How to check wear and tear</h2> <p data-characters="80" data-current-count="80" data-injectable="false">Here is a list of ways to check wear and tear in <em>EA Sports College Football 25</em>. </p> <ul data-found-items="6" data-current-count="320" data-injectable="false"> <li>Player reticle – Left side Wear and Tear bars, right side fatigue. Note, the bars depleting only represent the most hurt body part.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> <li>Depth chart – Here, you can see a Wear and Tear panel on the bottom right of the player card as well as the total an attribute is decreasing in the spreadsheet.&nbsp;</li> <li>Coach Vision – Hold LT+RS on Xbox or L2+R2 on PlayStation down to see the Wear and Tear status of your entire team.&nbsp;</li> <li>Picture in Picture (PIP) in the play call menu.&nbsp;</li> <li>We’ve added a ton of ‘Wear and Tear’ get-up animations. After a player is banged up, you’ll see a variety of animations for a given body part, depending on the severity.</li> <li>You can also manage your players’ Wear and Tear in the Dynasty player card.</li> </ul>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/soulmask-provides-yet-more-catnip-for-survival-crafter-lovers-on-steam.886527/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/soulmask-steam-survival-crafter<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you've got room in your life for another indie open-world survival-crafter, you might want to take a look at&nbsp;<em>Soulmask</em>, which was released today on Early Access and which is climbing the Steam charts rapidly.</p>

<p>Earlier this week,&nbsp;<em>Soulmask&nbsp;</em>publisher Qooland Games <a href="https://mask.qoolandgames.com/index/detail/144" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> that the game's release would be moved from June 18th to May 31st, and it looks like that's a move which has paid off.</p>

<p>According <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2646460/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">to SteamDB</a>,&nbsp;<em>Soulmask</em>'s 24-hour player count has already reached a whopping 16,665, which is pretty impressive considering the game has only been on release for a handful of hours at time of writing.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/soulmask-early-access-survival-crafter-pyramid.jpg?itok=cWBtgnQS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/soulmask-early-access-survival-crafter-pyramid.jpg?itok=QxwcGdKR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Soulmask&nbsp;</em>is taking the indie survival-crafter world by storm right now.</figcaption></figure><p>The game's numbers are even more impressive considering that the open-world survival-crafter market is arguably pretty saturated, with games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-finally-dethrones-baldurs-gate-3-as-most-played-game-on-steam-deck-in-february"><em>Palworld</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valheim-ashlands-update-ptr-launch"><em>Valheim</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-major-enshrouded-update-hollow-halls"><em>Enshrouded</em></a>, and many others competing for players' time.</p>

<p>Qooland and developer CampFire Studio know that they need to keep people engaged if they want to build something sustainable, though, which is probably why the two studios delivered an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2646460/view/4191240933898301822" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Early Access roadmap</a> yesterday.</p>

<p>Said roadmap offers an "initial blueprint for the future" and promises a new map, new mounts and masks, and new gameplay features, plus lots more.&nbsp;<em>Soulmask&nbsp;</em>has some pretty ambitious plans behind it, apparently.</p>

<p>Given that we're not even into the weekend yet, it's likely that&nbsp;<em>Soulmask</em>'s numbers will increase even further over the next couple of days, so we could have another bona fide indie crafter hit on our hands.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/soulmask-early-access-survival-crafter-flying.jpg?itok=UCn8JXXg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/soulmask-early-access-survival-crafter-flying.jpg?itok=Ii06FqyJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Big things are in store for&nbsp;<em>Soulmask</em>.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Soulmask&nbsp;</em>certainly talks a big game. Its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2646460/Soulmask/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">Steam page</a> promises "more than 500 hours" of content in the Early Access version alone, spanning activities like farming, exploring, and, erm, "raising pigs". Hmm.</p>

<p>In any case, if you'd like to check out&nbsp;<em>Soulmask</em>, you can do so right now via Steam Early Access. Can it make enough of a name for itself to stand out in a very crowded field? We'll have to wait and see, but early signs are pretty positive.</p>

Microsoft and Qualcomm aren’t talking much about this yet, but both companies have been dropping hints about game compatibility.</p><p>Qualcomm said previously that most Windows games <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24107331/qualcomm-gdc-2024-snapdragon-on-windows-games">should “just work”</a> on Snapdragon X Elite laptops, and Microsoft took the time to demo some more games onstage at Build last week. <em>Borderlands 3</em> was shown running around 60 percent faster than native 1440p resolution thanks to Microsoft’s Auto Super Resolution technology. This taps into the NPU to boost frame rates and resolution, much like how Nvidia’s DLSS utilizes its own GPUs to upscale games.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/21/24161936/windows-on-arm-ready-software-linaro-microsoft-qualcomm">Microsoft also revealed</a> a new “works on Windows on Arm” website that catalogs which games work on Arm-based Snapdragon X Elite laptops. Linaro built the website and claims to have tested more than 1,400 games on the new Surface Laptop and other Snapdragon X Elite devices. More than 700 games are listed as running at 1080p and 60fps, including titles like <em>Control Ultimate Edition</em>.</p><p>This all sounds rather promising for emulated games running on thin and lightweight laptops...</p><div>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-reportedly-prepping-summer-game-fest-reveals-hot-on-the-heels-of-state-of-play.886521/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-summer-game-fest-reveals-rumors/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday saw Sony roll out a new <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">State of Play</a>, and while opinions on such showcases always vary, it contained a fair number of announcements, including the ambitious new platformer <a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-revealed-ps5-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Astro Bot</a>, first gameplay and a release-date for the multiplayer FPS <a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-first-trailer-gameplay-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Concord</a>, as well as additional dates for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-new-2024-trailer-gameplay-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-launches-on-pc-in-september-with-dlss-3-7-and-fsr-3-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">God of War Ragnarok PC port</a>, and more. So, is that it for Team Blue? Astro Bot, Concord, Silent Hill 2, and GoW Ragnarok on PC would make a solid lineup for the rest of the year, so maybe PlayStation returns to its cave to hibernate for the rest of the summer?</p>
<p>Well, apparently Sony isn’t done with the “E3 season” announcements just yet. According to reliable leaker <a href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Midori</a>, we can look forward to info on “more titles from some SIE [Sony Interactive Entertainment] studios” at&nbsp; Summer Game Fest.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">And more titles from some SIE studios too! 😊</p>
<p>— みどり (@MbKKssTBhz5) <a href="https://twitter.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1796320512081354980?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Of course, take this with a grain of salt for now, but Midori has one of the better track records in the leaking game, so if she says something, you should pay attention. As for what Sony might show, that’s up in the air right now. <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/spider-man-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spider-Man 2</a> DLC seems like a fairly safe bet, as the big Sony leak from late last year revealed <a href="https://wccftech.com/spider-man-2-3-free-dlcs-carnage-other-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insomniac has a bunch of plans for 2024 DLC</a> they haven’t officially revealed yet. Maybe we also get another little looky-loo at <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/marvels-wolverine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wolverine</a>? Beyond the superhero stuff, perhaps we get another look at <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/fairgame/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fairgame$</a>, and a first peek at <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstations-new-firesprite-game-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firesprite Studios’ horror title</a> or the rumored Lego Horizon Adventures (yes, a crossover between Aloy and Lego is a supposedly real thing that’s been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-horizon-adventures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored by reliable sources</a>).</p>
<p>The Summer Game Fest kickoff show will stream live on Friday, June 7 at 2pm PT. What do you think Sony might bring to the big show? What are you <em>hoping </em>to see?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24168728/return-to-silent-hill-2-movie-bts-look<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="UzOfoo">Silent Hill is coming back to the movies. Details on the upcoming new <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23412809/silent-hill-movie-reboot-return-director">Silent Hill movie sequel</a> have been sparse since it was announced in 2022, but during Thursday’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24166622/silent-hill-transmission-may-2024-konami-remake-movie">Silent Hill Transmission livestream</a>, a short behind-the-scenes video revealed some new details, and gave us our best look yet at director Christophe Gans’ take on adapting the story of <em>Silent Hill 2</em>.  The livestream also featured an extended gameplay sequence from the upcoming video game remake of <em>Silent Hill 2</em>.</p>
<p id="BNQgKy">The movie, called <em>Return to Silent Hill</em>, will closely mirror the story of the second Silent Hill game according to Gans. That means it will follow James Sunderland, played in the movie by <em>War Horse</em>’s Jeremy Irvine, as he ventures to the town of Silent Hill in search of his lost love, Mary. But when he gets there, he finds it transformed into something dark and terrible. Or as Gans puts it, “It’s become something like hell.”</p>
<p id="PHKIqU">The livestream video is mostly on-set footage narrated by Gans, but even without the benefits of post-production, <em>Return to Silent Hill</em> is already looking pretty great. Part of that is thanks to Gans’ insistence, once again, that every monster possible is by played by a human — more specifically, a dancer. Gans explains that this was his approach on the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23411610/silent-hill-movie-new-game-announcement">original movie from 2006 as well</a>, and that he finds that these performers give the monsters an otherworldly, inhuman style of movement that’s both beautiful and unsettling. And based on the footage of the dancers in Thursday’s video, even without the monster make up, he’s definitely right.</p>
<p id="3EsgRJ">In the past, Gans has also explained that <em>Return to Silent Hill</em> will not be a direct sequel to his original movie, <em>Silent Hill</em>, or its sequel, <em>Silent Hill: Revelation</em>, which was directed by M.J. Bassett. Instead, Gans says to think of these movies more like an anthology series, where each entry can tell its own unique story in the Silent Hill universe without worrying too much about the previous movies. In fact, Gans has explained that he drew quite a bit of inspiration for the film from concept art for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/videos/2018/10/18/17990768/pt-is-the-best-horror-game-hideo-kojima"><em>P.T.</em></a> as well as <em>Silent Hill 2</em>.</p>
<p id="3iVMbo">There’s no word yet on when <em>Return to Silent Hill</em> will hit movie theaters. The video game remake of <em>Silent Hill 2</em> will be released on Oct. 8.</p>

  <p id="HVWoTY">I got most of my creative writing and literature education in Florida, so the works of Flannery O’Connor, the author at the center of Ethan Hawke’s new movie <em>Wildcat</em>, were heavily featured in my curriculum. Her Southern Gothic short stories, with their regionally specific character and settings and often violent scenarios, were staples of my classes from high school through college. <a href="https://learning.hccs.edu/faculty/selena.anderson/engl2307/readings/a-good-man-is-hard-to-find-by-flannery-oconnor/view">“A Good Man is Hard to Find”</a> shocked my classmates in AP English Literature with its bleak ending, but I was fascinated. My college creative writing workshops usually featured at least one O’Connor story in the curriculum, with a focus on how she conveys strong themes in the limited space of a short story, and on her sharp grasp of hypocritical human behavior. </p>
<p id="TDJ3PL">Many of my peers strove to emulate her unflinchingly brutal content and style, which directly led to them critiquing my work for not having the dark, gritty quality they associated with stories like “Greenleaf” or “A Circle in the Fire.” Personally, I love O’Connor’s short stories because of her strong characterization and the unflinching look at the American South. And I love to read dark stories, even though I don’t enjoy writing them myself. But as much as I love O’Connor’s prose, part of me still associates her with a sense of not being good enough as a writer — at least among my peers. </p>
<p id="YB32aZ">But <em>Wildcat</em> helped me recontextualize O’Connor and her work, and fully embrace my love for her writing as something separate from my own. The movie is about 80% biographical, with the rest drawing on O’Connor’s fiction. It finds the author (played by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23131219/stranger-things-4-review-part-1-season"><em>Stranger Things</em></a>’ Maya Hawke, Ethan Hawke’s daughter) in the days before and after her lupus diagnosis, interleaved with micro adaptations of her most famous short stories, like <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/olli/class-materials/Short_Story_By_Flannery_OConnor.pdf">“Everything That Rises Must Converge”</a> and “Good Country People.”</p>

<p id="GDagAZ">One key scene in the movie resonated with me most, because I’ve been in a variation of the same situation. A flashback scene shows O’Connor reading one of her stories in front of her creative writing class. Like the other stories weaving through this movie, <a href="https://jpcatholic.edu/NCUpdf/courses/HUMA122-ParkersBack.pdf">“Parker’s Back”</a> turns into a short film of its own, starring Maya Hawke as Parker’s wife, while she also narrates as O’Connor. When the scene transitions back to O’Connor reading in front of her class, her classmates (mostly men) stare at her, dumbfounded. No one seems to <em>get</em> her story, except for her professor. </p>
<p id="huouyp">But O’Connor doesn’t care. She knows why she wrote what she wrote, and she knows what she’s trying to say. And frankly, she’s not interested in listening to her small-minded peers explaining what she should be doing instead, like softening the language her characters use in order to make her work more commercially viable. </p>
<p id="R1m1ci">Hawke’s portrayal of O’Connor is stellar. She plays the author as sullen and stubborn, unwilling to let her classmates’ petty critiques get her down. At a department party, she lurks in the corner until she’s drawn into a debate about the Eucharist. She’s uncompromisingly herself in everything she does — from arguing with her publisher at the beginning of the movie to the moment she rearranges her office space after her lupus diagnosis.</p>

<p id="ainbDF">Ethan Hawke’s built-in short-story adaptations also emphasize O’Connor’s distinct perspective. For instance, a scene where O’Connor’s mother and her mother’s friend, two well-meaning but ultimately small-minded Southern women, drone on about updates in their small town, is interspersed with her short story “Revelation,” in which a prejudiced woman in a doctor’s waiting room makes racist and classist comments to the people around her. The short story is clearly informed by O’Connor’s environment and how she views the people around her. All her short stories come from the way she views the world, a fact repeatedly emphasized throughout the movie, though possibly at the cost of showing viewers more about her life.</p>
<p id="bwH78H">But that message was what I needed to hear, and why <em>Wildcat</em> lands better for me as an exploration of O’Connor’s works than an informative biopic. I shouldn’t be trying to write like Flannery O’Connor, because only she could do that. My former classmates who strove to be just as sardonic in their writing — and criticized me for not doing the same — should’ve taken away something entirely different from Flannery O’Connor. Her short stories are fantastic because she wasn’t trying to be like anyone else. She had a specific, unique perspective on the world, and that’s what she tried to convey in her works. No one else could write her stories. <em>Wildcat</em> helped me realize that was one of her greatest strengths.  </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/wordle-owner-goes-after-one-man-developer-of-location-guessing-game-worldle<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Wordle owner The New York Times has legally challenged the one man developer behind location guessing game Worldle despite saying it's "fine with [similar games]" in 2023.</p><p>As reported by the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cjrr5ee5zv8o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BBC</a>, The New York Times has accused Kory McDonald of "creating confusion" among consumers and attempting to capitalise on the success of Wordle, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wordle-new-york-times-deal">which it purchased for a seven figure amount in 2022</a>.</p><p>Worldle shows a Google Street View location to players each day and asks them to figure out where in the world they are. Just like Wordle, it gives them six guesses to reach the correct answer, and is "nearly identical in appearance, sound, meaning, and imparts the same commercial impression", according to The New York Times.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Wordle is about words, Worldle is about the world, Flaggle is about flags.</p></div><p>This comes one year after the company's head of games Jonathan Knight told the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-64627206" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BBC</a> that "imitation is the best form of flattery" and that it's "always been fine with [similar games] and think that they just help keep the game fresh and alive for people]."</p><p>McDonald said he was surprised and disappointed in the legal challenge but has no intention of stopping. "There's a whole industry of [dot]LE games," he said. "Wordle is about words, Worldle is about the world, Flaggle is about flags."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/04/15/wordle-1650045194490.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Wordle took the world by storm when it launched in 2021.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Even another game called Worldle is available, and has players guess a country based on its outline, but The New York Times declined to comment to the BBC if it would go after this too. McDonald's monetization of his game, for which he offers an advertisement free version for £10 a year though claims most of this goes to Google for using Street View, is perhaps related.</p><p>Wordle is the puzzle game created in October 2021 where players must guess a five letter word within six attempts after being told on each try which letters are correct and in the right position, correct and in the wrong position, and incorrect altogether.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-25-gameplay-deep-dive-provides-first-look-at-campus-iq-wear-tear-system-and-more<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Here's our first look at College Football 25's gameplay.</h2></div><section><p>After properly revealing it <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-25-first-trailer-revealed">a few weeks ago</a>, EA Sports has finally provided fans a first look at gameplay for the highly anticipated return of college football video games, giving us a first look at some new features coming to <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/college-football-25">College Football 25</a> such as Campus IQ, Wear &amp; Tear, and more. </p><p>College Football 25 introduces <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-25/news/college-football-25-gameplay-deep-dive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a slew of new changes</a> that aim to recapture the spirit of college football in a virtual capacity and provide more immersion to make players feel like they are a college football player and/or coaches. Among the new changes is Campus IQ, encompassing three fundamental pillars of College Football 25: All 22+, 134 Ways to Play, and Stories of Saturday. All provide things like differentiation, team variance and their different strategies, and momentum-based gameplay. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Some interesting tidbits the deep dive covers include confirmation there will be 80 abilities. These abilities are categorized by physical and mental and are further broken down into a four-tier system: bronze, silver, gold, and platinum. Players can have up to five physical and three mental abilities. One example of an ability is "Pocket Shield," which makes the offensive line hold better blocks when executing a standard pass play, though EA says even if the lineman have the highest tier, they can still lose in a matchup. </p><p>Wear &amp; Tear, a new system previously teased in the formal reveal, is a physics-based damaged system. While it sounds like a fatigue system, EA Sports is trying to illustrate it more as a management system designed to replicate real-life scenarios like players' damage and fatigue from playing a game, displaying every limb and body part of a player, each tied to unique attributes. For example, suppose a QB has been throwing a lot in a game and taking many hits. In that case, he will likely have a decrease in throw power and accuracy, and those effects may carry over the following week if you are playing Road to Glory or Dynasty mode.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>College Football 25 - Gameplay Deep Dive Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Weather conditions will also play a bigger role in adding depth and challenge to College Football 25. If it is raining, for example, it can be harder to throw or handle a wet football. Heavy rain or snow can also impact the trajectory of your kick while on special teams.</p><p>College Football 25's first deep dive also digs into the Option game. EA notes it wanted to make the mechanic mirror an exchange that can occur between the quarterback and the running back. </p><p>Another feature EA introduces in College Football 25 is Confidence and Composure. This system will see how players can maintain both attributes in high-pressure situations to match the energy seen in college football. So, rivalry games will have more stakes in maintaining composure than standard games. </p><p>Alongside Confidence and Composure, EA is also cranking up the pressure for a visiting team to win on the road with a home-field advantage, making it harder for visiting teams to win on the road at the Division 1 level. EA confirmed this home-field advantage would bring back NCAA Football 06's classic Stadium Pulse Meter, which causes the screen to shake and allows players to tell the crowd to "Get Louder" by flicking the right stick (RS) up. </p><p>College Football 25's gameplay also includes adjustments to passing and kicking. The former has increased the variance of the left stick (LS) pass lead intent, in addition to the development team making a significant overhaul to throw power, which now impacts not only the distance of the throw but how hard one is throwing to their intended target. While the new kicking mechanic removes the ability to use a thumbstick to aim and power up, the ball will automatically move side to side and you have to first lock the ball and then hold the A/X button to achieve maximum power. </p><p>Beyond the overhauls to offense, one major tweak to defensive play is the introduction of the Switch Stick. This mechanic will allow players to incentivize more defensive switching. For example, players can flick the right stick to switch the direction of their coverage while lurking in pass coverage.</p><p>The entire deep dive covered a ton of the new mechanics and systems introduced to College Football 25. EA teased plans to do more deep dives of other aspects College Football 25, such as Dynasty Mode and Team Builder, in the future. </p><p>College Football 25 is <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-25-release-date">out on July 19 for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S</a>.
