<p>Squirrelled away</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Maximum Entertainment popped up at the Fall IGN Fan Fest to reveal that the delightfully weird sandbox shooter, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/squirrel-with-a-gun">Squirrel with a Gun</a>, will be blasting onto Switch 2 on <strong>18th November</strong>.</p>
<p>Even if you didn't catch this one on its PC release last year, the title tells you just about everything you need to know. You play as a squirrel. You have a gun. What you do with it is up to you.</p>
<p>There's a fair emphasis on the 'sandbox' elements here, with platforming, collectibles, weird little challenges and a bunch of funky gun abilities at your disposal. And let's not beat about the bush, the titular conceit paints a funny enough image on its own.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots from the official <a href="https://squirrelwithagun.com/">Squirrel with a Gun website</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Fight Tooth, Claw, and Gun</strong><br>
Discover what an erratic squirrel is capable of with a gun in its paws (or just its paws) and how far how far this fuzzy fiend will go to collect its acorns. Escape a secret underground facility and defeat the Agents. Upgrade your weapons and locate the other secret bunkers to take down elite bosses; even blow up a tank! Swap out weapons to try your paw at all 12 types of enemy takedowns.<br>
<strong><br>
Solve Intricate Puzzle Rooms to Collect Golden Acorns</strong><br>
Navigate unique puzzle challenges to collect all the golden acorns by getting creative with how you use your arsenal of weapons, using weapon recoil to give yourself a boost. Collect enough golden acorns to unlock hidden sections of the game.<br>
<strong><br>
Have Some Nutty Sandbox Fun</strong><br>
Explore the world from a squirrel's eye view or cruise around in your toy car. Harass the neighborhood or ask for nice pets from curious passersby. Help them out in exchange for goodies (or simply mug them) and unlock cosmetics to create your squirrely style.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those who stick around right to the very end of the above Switch 2 announcement trailer will see Maximum Entertainment and Dee Dee Creations showcase a Squirrel with a Gun <em>physical edition</em> too. We don't have any information on when we can expect to see this boxed copy just yet, but it's always exciting news — heck, the mock-up doesn't even have the Game-Key Card icon on it!</p>

Let us know in the comments.</em></p></section></article><div><p>Jim came to Nintendo Life in 2022 and, despite his insistence that The Minish Cap is the best Zelda game and his unwavering love for the Star Wars prequels (yes, really), he has continued to write news and features on the site ever since.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/authors/JimNorman"><span></span> Author Profile</a></li><li><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jimnormann.bsky.social"><span></span> Bluesky</a></li><li><a onclick="return replyTo('JimNorman');" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/#"> Reply</a></li></ul>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tomonobu-itagaki-creator-of-dead-or-alive-and-responsible-for-ninja-gaiden%E2%80%99s-reboot-has-passed-away-at-58.1326268/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Veteran game designer Tomonobu Itagaki has passed away at 58. The sad and unexpected news comes directly from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tomonobu.itagaki" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his own Facebook page</a>, where he had asked a friend to post a message in the event of his passing, which he must have seen coming.</p>



<p><em>The flame of my life is finally about to be extinguished.</em></p>



<p><em>The fact that this message has been posted means that time has finally come. I am no longer in this world. (I have asked someone important to post this final message.)</em></p>



<p><em>My life was a continuous battle. I kept winning.<br>I also caused a lot of trouble.</em></p>



<p><em>I take pride in having fought to the end, following my convictions.<br>I have no regrets.</em></p>



<p><em>But I am filled with regret that I could not deliver new work to all my fans. I'm sorry.</em></p>



<p><em>That's how it is.<br>So it goes.</em></p>



<p><span>This is a hard-hitting message, to be sure, and one that is undoubtedly in line with Tomonobu Itagaki's unique personality, just like when he&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/itagaki-ps4-pro-just-rhetoric-vr/" target="_blank">criticized Sony for making the PlayStation 4 Pro console</a>. The game designer was mainly</span> known as the creator of the Dead or Alive fighting game franchise and also as the man responsible for the successful reboot of the Ninja Gaiden series. Itagaki left KOEI TECMO after sixteen years and filed a lawsuit against the company due to them withholding pay.</p>



<p>He then quickly launched a new game developer called Valhalla Game Studios alongside other former Team Ninja members. This studio released Devil's Third, an action/adventure game for the Nintendo Wii U. However, the game wasn't well received both critically and commercially. In November 2021, Tencent acquired Valhalla's parent company, Wake Up Interactive, for $44 million. The following month, Wake Up merged Valhalla Game Studios' staff and operations into another subsidiary, Soleil Ltd., effectively closing down Valhalla.</p>



<p>Tomonobu Itagaki once again did not despair and founded another company called Itagaki Games. The final news tidbit about the company was shared by Itagaki around a year ago, when he revealed that the company name had been slightly changed to Itagaki Games, Inc. Unfortunately, the studio never released a game before Itagaki's passing.</p>



<p>The news comes just days before the release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-tokyo-game-show-2025-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fourth installment in the Ninja Gaiden franchise</a>, many years after the previous iteration. </p>



<p>Wccftech would like to extend our heartfelt condolences to the friends and family of this important figure in the games industry.</p>

            <p>Around the time of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s release, the Metroidvania's Simplified Chinese translation was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/team-cherry-working-on-quality-issues-with-hollow-knight-silksongs-simplified-chinese-translation-following-mixed-steam-reviews">flagged as being a bit stilted</a>, with Team Cherry quickly promising to rectify the "quality issues". They've aimed to take the first step in doing just that with the game's fourth patch, which is now live in Steam beta with a fresh translation, but early impressions from players are largely negative.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>To be fair to Team Cherry, they have <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/506216918921794871/">made clear</a> that the fresh translation which has arrived with the beta release of patch 1.0.28954 is a "basic implementation only, to be refined and updated based on player feedback". They added that "implementation of this new translation is not yet finalised, so please expect some display issues throughout." There's a <a href="https://teamcherry.notion.site/12c63da3a1a780f4a8cfd8441a243a6e">bug report form</a> via which folks can leave feedback on the revamped wordage.</p>
<p>A fair few Chinese players have also opted to leave early feedback on the translation in comments on the patch post, and these verdicts are far from glowing. While it seems the original translation's classical grammar might be gone (though the comments offer mixed views on that), fresh problems are being reported, with place and NPC names seeming like the main sticking point this time around. The Deep Docks in particular <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/506216918921794871/#c506216918921801406">are cited</a> as now being referred to by a spoliery name.</p>
<p>"Thank you for your efforts in translating Chinese," reads <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/506216918921794871/?ctp=4#c506216918921814502">one of these comments</a>. "I have always been a fan of yours, but the new beta version of the translation has obvious shortcomings. The main problem is that the new translation version has changed the translations of place names and NPC characters that were originally well translated and recognised by most players. I hope the new version of the translation can keep the original NPC and place name translations, and make the dialogue and background introduction text more readable and understandable."</p><p>Team Cherry have been quick to acknowledge this initial feedback. "Thanks so much to everyone who's been sending in comments and concerns on the Simplified Chinese translation in public-beta," the studio wrote in a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/506216918921794871/?ctp=5#c506216918921817500">comment of their own</a>. "They've been a huge help. Two quick notes from us: We fully agree with comments that the names of characters, places etc, should generally remain the same as in the original version. Only a few specific names should be considered appropriate to change - those where the current translation is confusing or incorrect. We won't be releasing any translation that isn't up to the community's standards, and we'll continue to closely monitor feedback from fans."</p>
<p>Outside of this revamped translation, this beta version of patch four features a "short set of game fixes", set to be added to before full release. Among them are a switch to Unity's input system aimed at improving controller support and an update to the multibinder's initial bind to clear maggots.</p>
<p>Here's hoping Team Cherry are able to get a handle on these persistent translation problems soon.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-dandys-world-codes/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dandy%E2%80%99s-world-codes-october-2025.1326262/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’re a fan of both horror movies as well as old-school cartoon shows, then these Dandy’s World codes may well be worth your time.</p>



<p>Think of a Roblox game where you start in a building known as the Gardenview Center as a cartoon character, with the objective being to survive, while also collecting money to unlock new characters and solving puzzles to fix the broken elevator. Playable in a group of up to 8 players, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-roblox-prospecting-codes-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> Dandy’s World can be a rather scary experience, with scary monsters known as ‘Twisteds’ hunting the players down in every nook and cranny of the building.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dandy’s World is a game where strategy and teamwork are of utmost importance, as various shocking and dark plot twists can happen with each playthrough. Dandy’s World players must also be on the lookout for Tickets and Trinkets, while Ichor is the main in-game currency, used to upgrade characters and their abilities. Although simply playing the game will grant players plenty of Ichor, using codes in Dandy’s World is a good way to boost the amount of currency you can get.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-all-new-dandy-s-world-codes-october-2025">All New Dandy’s World Codes (October 2025)</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>ICHOR</strong>: 50 Ichor</li>

<figure><figcaption>Dandy’s World Codes Redemption Page | Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Redeeming these free rewards in Dandy’s World is a simple process that doesn’t require too much effort at all. For players who may be new to the Roblox environment, though, here’s a step-by-step guide that should make redeeming the Dandy’s World codes a cakewalk:</p>



<ol>
<li>Launch Roblox and open up Dandy’s World.</li>



<li>Click on the ‘Use Code’ option.</li>



<li>Input one of the active codes given above into the text box.</li>



<li>Click on ‘Use’ to instantly receive your rewards.</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-where-to-get-more-dandy-s-world-codes">Where To Get More Dandy’s World Codes</h2>



<p>Although there is only one active code in the game right now, Dandy’s World is a game that’s known to release new codes whenever it achieves a major milestone or launches an update for the title. With this in mind, it’s safe to assume that more are on the horizon, and players simply have to wait patiently to get their hands on more free Dandy’s World rewards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The best way to stay up to date with all the latest codes would be to simply bookmark this page and check back every now and then. We update this article as soon as new codes are dropped by the developers. This can save players from the hassle of having to manually go into the game’s socials and <a href="https://discord.com/invite/blushcrunch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Discord server</a> each time to check if new codes have been released.&nbsp;</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Gets Reduced Ticket Count in Conquest Mode and Players Aren’t Very Happy]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-gets-reduced-ticket-count-conquest-mode-players-arent-happy/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-gets-reduced-ticket-count-in-conquest-mode-and-players-aren%E2%80%99t-very-happy.1326259/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Battlefield 6 is certainly off to a strong start. Sales estimates <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-smash-hit-more-6-5-million-units-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggest that it has already sold more than six and a half million units across all platforms</a>, and the game launched to a positive vibe in the community.</p>



<p>That said, fans already disagree with the development team on a few things. For example, yesterday the developers <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1978462075488817479" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rolled out a backend update</a> that reduced the beginning ticket count when playing Conquest on all maps:</p>



<p><em>We've reduced the starting ticket count across all Conquest maps so matches finish at a more natural pace. Previously, many rounds were hitting the time limit instead of ending when one team ran out of tickets. We'll keep monitoring feedback and data to make sure the flow of each match feels right.</em></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Siege of Cairo from 1000 to 900</em></li>



<li><em>Empire State from 1000 to 900</em></li>



<li><em>Iberian Offensive from 1000 to 900</em></li>



<li><em>Liberation Peak From 1000 to 800</em></li>



<li><em>Manhattan Bridge From 1000 to 800</em></li>



<li><em>Operation Firestorm From 1000 to 700</em></li>



<li><em>New Sobek City from 1000 to 900</em></li>



<li><em>Mirak Valley from 1000 to 700</em></li>
</ul>



<p>The community isn't really convinced this was needed, though. Most comments <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1o7cerx/backend_update_battlefield_studios_has_reduced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Reddit</a> state that they never had that occurrence (rounds hitting the time limit instead of one team running out of tickets) happen to them. Some even go as far as accusing the developers of pursuing the Call of Duty crowd in Battlefield 6 with changes like this. That goes hand in hand with criticism leveled <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-starts-october-28-roadmap-unveiled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at the upcoming Season 1</a>, which will include new 4v4 and 8v8 modes. Veteran Battlefield players would rather get more large maps for classic franchise modes like Conquest, as they believe that the launch maps are on the smaller side.</p>



<p>For its part, Battlefield Studios has introduced a small change born out of user feedback: in the Manhattan Bridge map, when playing Conquest and Escalation modes, the Out of Bounds timer for vehicles has been doubled from five to ten seconds. Lastly, the developers actually just pushed a very small (27 MB on Steam) patch, updating the game to version 1.0.1.6. This update merely improves backend stability in anticipation of the Season 1 launch, scheduled for Tuesday, October 28.</p>

            <p>Tomonobu Itagaki, responsible for creating both the Dead or Alive and 3D <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ninja-gaiden">Ninja Gaiden</a> series, has died.</p>
<p>The announcement came via one final post on his Facebook profile. This news was corroborated by Itagaki's friend <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/milkman.bsky.social/post/3m3c3gq5q7c2k">James Mielke on Bluesky</a>, who posted their own statement mourning Itagaki.</p>
<p>The final message from Itagaki reads as follows:</p>
<p>"Final Words,</p>
<p>"The flame of my life is about to go out. The fact that this message has been posted means that my time has finally come. I am no longer in this world. (I have entrusted someone important to me with this final message).</p><p>"My life was a continuous battle which I kept winning. I caused a lot of trouble for others too. I take pride in having fought to the end, and having followed my convictions. I have no regrets, but I am deeply sorry that I could not deliver new works to my fans.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry. So it goes.</p>

<p>Tomonobu Itagaki was a celebrated figure in the Japanese video game development industry. He formed Team Ninja (originally called Tecmo Creative #3) back in the late 90's, creating not only the Dead or Alive series of fighting games, but also the 3D Ninja Gaiden games and Dead or Alive Beach Volleyball.</p>
<p>His career was not without strife. In 2006, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doa-producer-slapped-with-sex-suit/1100-6161240/">a former co-worker of Itagaki sued him for sexual harassment</a> which he denied, losing his executive officer role as a result. Ultimately, he was deemed innocent by Japanese courts in 2007.</p>
<p>Later in 2010, Itagaki and Koei Tecmo reached a settlement after Itagaki claimed the company was withholding bonuses for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-or-alive-4">Dead or Alive 4</a>. Itagaki moved on to develop <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/devils-third">Devil's Third</a> at Valhalla Game Studios.
</p>
<p>Valhalla Game Studios eventually closed, leading Itagaki to form Itagaki Games in late 2021. This studio has been working on a new game ever since.</p>
<p>Tomonobu Itagaki, known for his love of sunglasses and long-lasting career in the games industry, leaves behind a daughter.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/open-world-mmo-sword-of-justice-launches-on-november-7-with-path-tracing-and-an-ai-metaverse-of-intelligent-npcs.1326232/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>ZhuRong Studio, an internal development team of NetEase, announced that the global launch of the open world MMO Sword of Justice has been set for November 7 on PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2782500/SWORD_OF_JUSTICE/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>), <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netease.nshmna&amp;hl=en_GB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Android</a>, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sword-of-justice/id6743792551" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iOS</a>.</p>



<p>This is a free-to-play game, although the developers have promised that there is no pay-to-win at all and character progression is gameplay-driven, with strict stat limits and regular seasonal resets, creating an even playing field, where players are rewarded for their skill.</p>



<p>The MMO's narrative is adapted from Wen Ruian's classic literary masterpiece, The Four Great Constables: Sword of Justice. The story is set during the Song Dynasty (between 960 and 1279), and players can explore a vast open world, conquer peaks and caverns, seek out lost weapons and martial techniques, solve ancient puzzles, and, most of all, master martial arts to battle mythical beasts and outlaws in the wilderness and in dungeons to gather rare treasures.</p>



<p>The Windstride and Shadowbearer skills facilitate traversal of the world, as players can parkour, sprint on walls, glide, and more. Furthermore, unlike most MMOs, there are many paths to character development, including life skills such as cooking, fishing, case solving, performing, farming, archeology, presiding over court trials, and many more. Combat roles also reportedly break away from genre conventions, allowing tanks to heal and healers to deal significant damage. Players will thus be able to create their own unique fighting styles.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Sword of Justice also features an 'AI Metaverse' of intelligent NPCs with unique personalities, fluid routines, and personal memories, allowing them to interact with the player realistically. Lastly, the game was also enhanced with the latest visual technologies: ray tracing is supported on mobile devices, while the PC version <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-is-in-battlefield-6-lost-soul-aside-eve-online-will-be-added-in-sword-of-justice-wuthering-waves-starship-troopers-extermination/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supports full path tracing, NVIDIA DLSS Ray Reconstruction and DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation</a> to get the best performance and graphics.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>However, the base requirements to play Sword of Justice on PC are actually very low:</p>



<p><strong>Minimum<br>OS:</strong> Windows 10 64-bit or newer<br><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel i5 9th generation or better (or AMD equivalent)<br><strong>Memory:</strong> 8 GB RAM<br><strong>Graphics:</strong> NVIDIA GeForce GTX750TI or better (or AMD equivalent)<br><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 11<br><strong>Network:</strong> Broadband Internet connection<br><strong>Storage:</strong> 55 GB available space<br><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> SSD Recommended</p>



<p><strong>Recommended<br>OS:</strong> Windows 10 64-bit or newer<br><strong>Processor</strong>: Intel i7 9th generation or better (or AMD equivalent)<br><strong>Memory:</strong> 16 GB RAM<br><strong>Graphics:</strong> NVIDIA GeForce GTX1060 or better (or AMD equivalent)<br><strong>DirectX: </strong>Version 11<br><strong>Network:</strong> Broadband Internet connection<br><strong>Storage:</strong> 55 GB available space<br><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> SSD Recommended</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/the-outlast-trials-getting-invasion-pvp-mode-in-time-for-halloween/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-outlast-trials-is-getting-an-invasion-pvp-mode-in-time-for-halloween.1326226/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, Montréal-based developer Red Barrels announced that the co-op horror game The Outlast Trials will be getting an Invasion PvP mode next week, on October 21, in time for Halloween.</p>



<p>Players can access the new Invasion Mode via the Sleep Room Terminals and join as either a Reagent or an Imposter. Only a limited number of Imposters can invade any given Trial. While waiting, the others can serve as the eyes and ears of their murderous teammates. As their peers succeed in their sabotage… or die trying, each Imposter will get a chance to invade the Trial.</p>



<p>These are the key features of the new PvP Invasion Mode:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Become the hunter:</strong> stalk your prey from the shadows. Use stealth and subterfuge to sneak up on unsuspecting reagents before going in for the kill.</li>



<li><strong>Surveil the trials:</strong> Plan your route and attack strategy by carefully considering surveillance camera footage. Your fellow Imposters</li>



<li><strong>Don a Deadly Disguise:</strong> Dress in the garb and skin of your targets to gain their trust. Then, when the moment’s right…</li>



<li><strong>Stab them in the back:</strong> Close-quarters combat is the only rule of engagement. Outwit your opponents with multiple blade strikes or a single lethal stab. One slip-up means certain death, ratcheting up the intensity in the high-pressure trial arenas.</li>
</ul>

</p></figure>



<p>The update that goes live next week in The Outlast Trials will also add the Geister 2025 New Time-Limited Event and Time-Limited Catalog, two new MK-Challenges (Beguile the Children and Investigate the Minotaur), and the debut of the new In-Game Store.</p>



<p>As a reminder, The Outlast Trials <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outlast-trials-launches-on-march-5-2024-for-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched on March 5, 2024</a> for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series S|X after less than a year of early access on PC. The game has had a positive reception from fans, with between two and three million units estimated to have been sold via Steam alone.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Electronic Arts Sale Facing Resistance From ‘Concerned’ US Politicians: ‘National Security Risks’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/electronic-arts-sale-facing-resistance-us-politicians/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/electronic-arts-sale-facing-resistance-from-%E2%80%98concerned%E2%80%99-us-politicians-%E2%80%98national-security-risks%E2%80%99.1326208/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>At the end of September, it was announced that Electronic Arts, one of the largest game publishers in the world, was to be privately acquired by a consortium headed by the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund. The investment group also includes Silver Lake and Affinity Partners, founded and run by Jared Kushner, Donald Trump’s son-in-law.</p>



<p>In a letter to the United States Secretary of the Treasury, key politicians Elizabeth Warren and Richard Blumenthal have voiced ‘profound concern’ about the ‘foreign influence and national security risks’ of the impending acquisition.</p>



<h2 id="h-pushback-was-inevitable-in-the-ea-deal">Pushback Was Inevitable in the EA Deal</h2>



<p>If the last few years have taught us anything, it’s that lawmakers and regulatory bodies will always try to get their two cents heard as these immense acquisitions unravel. The Microsoft purchase of Activision Blizzard King was a great example of that, with the deal being scrutinized and challenged in the courts numerous times.</p>



<p>Electronic Arts is now facing a similar situation, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-announces-55-billion-private-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the consortium’s purchase</a> of the publisher being doubted by US lawmakers.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025-10-14-Letter-from-Blumenthal-and-Warren-to-Secretary-Bessent-re-Electronic-Arts.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent email</a> to Scott Bessent, the United States Secretary of the Treasury, it was stated:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We write with profound concern about the foreign influence and national security risks posed by the potential acquisition of American video game producer Electronic Arts (EA) by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), Silver Lake Group, L.L.C. (Silver Lake), and Jared Kushner’s Affinity Partners.</p>



<p>We urge you and the Committee to apply searching scrutiny to this unprecedented, proposed foreign privatization of a major American technology and entertainment company.</p>



<p>The proposed transaction poses a number of significant foreign influence and national security risks, beginning with the PIF’s reputation as a strategic arm of the Saudi government.</p>



<p>Saudi Arabia’s desire to buy influence through the acquisition of EA is apparent on the face of the transaction—the investors propose to pay more than $10 billion above EA’s trading value for a company whose stock has “stagnated for half a decade” in an unpredictably volatile industry.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The letter went on to detail the concerns around Saudi Arabia’s attempts to strengthen foreign influence within the United States, suggesting that a data privacy concern will arise from EA having collected the information of ‘millions of users’ over the years. There are also worries from US politicians that the deal will ‘eliminate transparency’ in the company’s operations.</p>



<p>In a final request, the letter asks that the CFIUS (Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States) conduct a thorough investigation and review of the privatization of Electronic Arts, feeding back findings by November 4, 2025.</p>



<p>Do you think the United States government is right to be concerned about the Electronic Arts acquisition? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Liam Hemsworth stepped into the boots of Geralt of Rivia some time ago, replacing Henry Cavill, who departed the show because of creative differences with the showrunners. While the masses have voiced their concerns about this switch, Hemsworth has proven willing to give the character all he has, which is the sentiment he professed in a recent interview.</p>



<p>Love or hate the casting, The Witcher returns this month with a penultimate series, and Liam Hemsworth is now the star of the show. In an interview with IGN, he explained how he’s handling all the doubt circulating online.</p>



<h2 id="h-liam-hemsworth-has-given-everything-he-has-to-geralt">Liam Hemsworth Has Given Everything He Has to Geralt</h2>



<p>In a recent interview <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witchers-final-seasons-liam-hemsworth-and-showrunner-lauren-schmidt-hissrich-on-replacing-henry-cavill-and-crafting-a-really-good-payoff-to-the-series" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with IGN</a>, Liam Hemsworth and Lauren Schmidt Hissrich (showrunner) sat down to talk about the upcoming series of The Witcher, which returns after a two-year hiatus between seasons.</p>



<p>For the last few months, fans of the show have been wrestling with the recasting of Geralt of Rivia, the instantly recognizable lead previously played by Henry Cavill. It was a sour move for many when Cavill departed the show, and plenty of viewers feel that Hemsworth doesn’t embody the character well enough.</p>



<p>Hemsworth disagrees:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It was a unique situation, to come into a show that someone else has been doing for a period of time. There was obviously a lot of talk from fans and opinions, and I think that’s great. This show has very passionate fans that care about these characters and care about this world. I appreciate that. I understand it.</p>



<p>I poured everything I had into this character. I wanted it to feel grounded. I wanted it to feel authentic. I really hope the audience enjoys the character and my interpretation of it… I got to work with so many great actors and play this wonderfully complex character that has a huge fan base. And I hope people come along for the ride. I feel very grateful to have had this experience.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Hemworth referenced that he’d played The Witcher games ‘years ago’ and tried to get back into them when playing Geralt of Rivia for the live-action series. </p>



<blockquote>
<p>I had just started playing [Geralt] and I was like, ‘I don’t know how many minutes or hours I can spend walking around as this character right now whilst shooting the show at the same time.’ So I had a quick look at it and it reminded me of what I experienced years ago when I played it.</p>



<p>It didn’t feel like it was going to be hugely helpful to my experience at that time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s worth stressing that The Witcher show is based <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/witcher-book-sapkowski/">on <strong>the books</strong></a><strong> </strong>and not <strong>the games</strong>.</p>



<p>Hissrich, the series’s showrunner, expressed how pleased she is with Hemsworth’s portrayal of Geralt:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You need someone who you can imagine can excel at these action scenes, who has such a physical presence that they could be both intimidating in the story, but also, Geralt has a huge emotional side as well… What I really loved about Liam’s work that I had seen is that he was able to organically blend those two things. He didn’t have physical scenes and then emotional scenes. He was able to really carry this specific, I guess I call it soul. </p>



<p>He has a soul that he brings into the role… To have that present even through action scenes when he’s fighting monsters, and it’s the same thing that’s present when he’s having conversations with Ciri or with Yennefer, that was a really special thing that we were able to capture.

<p>Overall, the achievement and trophy list in <a href="https://www.futurlab.co.uk/games/powerwash-simulator-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PowerWash Simulator 2</a> seems rather doable. While there are a lot of missions, a lot of these trophies have specific qualifications that revolve around cleaning a particular item first or last. We highly recommend taking a look at the trophy list before you start a job so you can square away the requirements as you move along.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Making a surprise return from the original entry on the Nintendo GameCube, Kirby Air Riders is yet another mascot racing game set to release on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>With that said, what about the prospects of the new game coming to the Nintendo Switch 1? Games like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-switch-2-exclusive-platform-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> have made their debut on both console generations. Is the same happening here?</p>



<p>Here is the answer to whether or not Kirby Air Riders will be on Nintendo Switch 1 or if it is a Switch 2 exclusive.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-kirby-air-riders-on-nintendo-switch-1">Is Kirby Air Riders on Nintendo Switch 1?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Dyna Blade is not ready to go back to the original Switch. Image by Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Unfortunately for those who have not upgraded their console yet, </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kirby-air-riders-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Kirby Air Riders is a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive</strong></a><strong>, and it is not releasing on Nintendo Switch 1.</strong></p>



<p>With the Switch 2 releasing just earlier this year, why would Masahiro Sakurai’s latest game not be available on the original Switch? Most of it likely comes down to performance. On the Switch 2, Kirby Air Riders may not be the most impressive graphically, but it runs at 60 fps, which might not be the same situation on the original console.</p>



<p>Of course, newer hardware is always more powerful than what came before, so we could definitely see a world where Sakurai and/or Nintendo wanted his first release since Super Smash Bros. Ultimate to be as smooth-running as possible. The Switch 1 is a great console, but its history of poor performance is well-known, even in Nintendo games.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-kirby-air-riders-ever-come-to-nintendo-switch-1">Will Kirby Air Riders Ever Come to Nintendo Switch 1?</h2>



<p><strong>While it is certainly possible that Kirby Air Riders one day comes to Nintendo Switch 1, it’s not something we would bet on.</strong></p>



<p>As mentioned above, the Switch 2 is, simply put, a more powerful console, and we’re not game developers ourselves, but we would wager a guess that the Switch 1 can’t handle <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/kirby-air-riders-switch-2/?srsltid=AfmBOoozuGVBxvh8fJftx43dJCineND4wXoWmBaXjdJiS58nTSdFgtbl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kirby Air Riders</a> quite as well.</p>



<p>Another thing to keep in mind is whether or not Sakurai and his team at Bandai Namco would want to put in the resources to port the game over to the original Switch post-release. You would imagine that the focus would be on supporting the game that is already available and then moving on to the next project.</p>



<hr>



<p>Are you bummed out that Kirby Air Riders is a Switch 2 exclusive and likely won’t ever release on the original Nintendo Switch? Vent your frustrations in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> is now available on the Switch and Switch 2, and the first Mystery Gift distribution event has officially gone live.</p>
<p>In case you missed the initial announcement, The Pokémon Company will be offering trainers across the globe an "early-purchase bonus" in the form of a Ralts holding a Gardevoirite stone as a gift. When trained, Ralts evolves into Kirlia and then Gardevoir. From there, it can be Mega Evolved into Mega Gardevoir.</p>
<p>Along with this, the digital version early-purchase bonus includes a "gift of 100 Poké Balls". Both of these gifts will be available to claim until <strong>28th February, 2026</strong>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="vf32irwF2Do" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5f76a2mqrskz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>As mentioned in the promotion above, it takes "approximately one hour of play time" before you can access the Mystery Gift feature. <a href="https://serebii.net/">Serebii.net</a> adds to this with some additional information:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Mystery Gift is unlocked after you get the Pokédex in the game story. If you already have the Gardevoirite stone by the time you receive it, the Ralts will not have an item attached."</p>

<p>As with previous Pokémon games, we'll be sharing all future distribution events for Legends: Z-A here on Nintendo Life. We'll also have a guide up on the site soon.</p>

<figure data-uuid="c11f95762e385"><a title="Nintendo Switch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c11f95762e385/nintendo-switch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Last week, the hacking group Crimson Collective <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/notorious-group-crimson-collective-claims-to-have-hacked-nintendo">claimed it had breached Nintendo</a>. At the time, there was no official response from the video game giant.</p>
<p>Now, in an update, Nintendo has shared a statement with <a href="https://www.sankei.com/article/20251015-6H66THKNKJKJLCI2BKXWZYB72Y/">The Sankei Shimbun</a>, and it appears to suggest there's been no personal, development, or business-related leaks.</p>
<p>Some external servers displaying Nintendo's website have reportedly been compromised, but there's apparently no evidence of this impacting customers or the company. Here's a rough translation including the statement shared on 15th October 2025:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nintendo responded to an interview with the Sankei Shimbun on the 15th, saying, "We have not confirmed any leak of personal information, and there has been no leak of development or business information." Some external servers that display Nintendo's website were defaced, but the company said there was no evidence of damage to customers or intrusion into the company.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, at this stage, there's been no personal data leaked, and it seems there seemingly won't be any secrets popping up about the company's games or business operations.</p>
<p>This update follows a story from earlier this week about the supposed hacker behind the Pokémon 'Teraleak' reportedly <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/pokemon-z-as-source-code-and-beta-builds-have-now-supposedly-leaked">leaking the new game's source code</a> and beta builds.</p>
