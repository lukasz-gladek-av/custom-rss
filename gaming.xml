            <link>https://kotaku.com/save-over-100-on-the-14-in-1-160w-anker-prime-docking-station-with-black-friday-today-2000647671</link>
            <guid>1366603</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Organized workstations don’t just look better, they make you more productive too. If you use a bunch of devices to get your busy work and play days (multiple monitors, laptop, keyboard, mouse, external storage), you need something that ties the entire setup together with a single unit. A docking station does that job well, and if you’ve been on the lookout for one, we just spotted a great deal to pick a highly-rated option for less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/">Thanks to Black Friday, Amazon is offering the 14-in-1 160W Anker Prime docking station for $161.</a> That’s after a nice 40% discount on the retail price of $270. It’s the lowest we have seen it drop to in 90 days, which means it didn’t even go this low during the October Prime Day. It’s selling out fast, though, so it’s best to snap it up as soon as you can.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multiple Ports to Connect and Charge</h2>
<p>The dock gets you 14 ports in total. The front panel offers you two USB-C (10Gbps), two USB-C (100W Max), one USB-A (10Gbps), one USB-A (12W Max), and one 3.5mm audio jack. On the back, there’s an Ethernet (1Gbps), three USB-A (480Mbps), one HDMI 2.0 (4K@60Hz), one USB-C upstream port, and an LED indicator. The three USB-C ports at 100W max each and one USB-A port at 12W max are capable of juicing your essentials up with 160W of total output. It’s great to power your laptop as you work without looking for another outlet, and even quickly top your smartphone or headphones up. Four charging ports mean you can charge multiple devices at the same time. The station even makes custom power allocation possible with its dedicated app, so you can always prioritize important devices. Need to head out for a meeting in a few minutes? Prioritize your laptop while still keeping your AirPods topped up.</p>
<p>Support for bigger workstations comes from the dual HDMI ports that let you stream or mirror across two additional displays at the same time, but only on Windows. You’ll get up to 2K@60Hz on a DP 1.4 laptop or 1080p@60Hz with a DP 1.2 machine. Those using macOS will only be able to mirror their main display. It’s not ideal, but can come in handy when you need to share your screen with others. Otherwise, compatibility is impressive. The station works nicely with Windows 10 and 11, ChromeOS, and laptops that support DP Alt Mode and Power Delivery. It’s not made for Linux, though.</p>



<p>You will always be kept in the loop with the smart display, which shows total wattage and interface status, plus gives visuals and overheat alerts when needed. And finally, despite all the power, the docking station remains portable and lightweight; enough to carry around easily with you on the go. Just toss it in your laptop bag, and you’ll be able to create an efficient workstation anywhere you want. Overheating won’t be a concern either, thanks to the built-in airflow system, paired with ActiveSheild temperature monitoring. The latter monitors the temperature of the docking station 3,000,000 times per day, and instantly notifies you if something feels off.</p>
<p>All in all, if you’ve been wanting to make your workstation cleaner, Anker Prime does a great job at that. You’ll still be able to use all your devices, just in a more efficient, smartly-managed way.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/"> It’s now down to $161, so you’re saving a nice $109 on it right now. Grab the deal fast before it expires for good, or the stock runs out.</a></p>

            <p>The Game Awards are nearly here, your annual fix for celebrating the best this year had to offer and checking out cool reveals. However, while the show is sure to be packed with all sorts of exciting new trailers to gaze upon, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> will not be among them.</p>
<p>This harsh truth comes from none other than CD Projekt Red co-CEO Michał Nowakowski, who took to X to express his pleasure at the upcoming RPG's presence on the Most Anticipated Games list, as well as snuff out hopes of a coinciding trailer.</p>
<p>Nowakowski wrote: "I'm very happy to see The Witcher 4 nominated in the Most Anticipated Game category at The Game Awards. Thanks to everyone who has already voted - your support means a lot to us. We won't be bringing any new content to TGA this year, but we're, as always, excited to watch the show and celebrate this amazing industry's great night alongside all of you."</p>

<p>Development on The Witcher 4 is well underway, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-bolsters-the-witcher-4-team-with-key-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-talent">with CD Projekt Red hiring new talent in recent months to maintain the charge to its eventual release</a>.

That being said, the performance seen during that tech demo is what the game is aiming for, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4s-northern-setting-revealed-in-new-unreal-livestream">and it did show off the northern setting for The Witcher 4</a>.</p><p>Even without The Witcher 4, The Game Awards is set to be a special one. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-makes-game-awards-history-as-most-nominated-game-ever">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has already broken records as the most nominated game of 2025</a>, and we've <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mystery-megabonk-developer-withdraws-from-the-game-awards-following-incorrect-nomination">had a withdrawal courtesy of Megabonk developer Vedinad</a>.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mount-blade-ii-bannerlord">Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord</a>'s War Sails naval expansion had its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/reschedule-those-sailing-lessons-as-mount-blade-2-bannerlords-war-sails-dlc-has-been-delayed">release pushed back</a> from June 17th to November 26th. You can <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marauding-medieval-masses-mash-together-beneath-the-mainsail-in-mount-blade-ii-bannerlord-war-sails">give it a go</a> right now if you fancy, so it obviously made that second date. Prior to the DLC dropping, I chatted with Bannerlord senior producer Falk Engel about what went into the decision to ditch the initial summer date, and why custom naval battles were <a href="https://forums.taleworlds.com/index.php?threads/war-sails-q-a-4.467565/">only confirmed</a> to be arriving with its launch quite late in the day.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Asked whether the delay was down to specific issues which needed to be overcome, or just a general desire to spend more time polishing the massive overhaul up, Engel told me it was a "bit of both". There's always this technical challenge to optimise it as much as possible," he said. "Especially as you add more content and features, because everything that you add can also break stuff that you thought was already done with.</p>
<p>"Then on the other hand, there was a conscious conversation, conscious discussion that the title was not yet at the level of quality and the amount of content and features that we wanted. So, it was just the sensible choice for us to take additional time and that time as well allowed us to push out the base game changes for player feedback and react to that player feedback."</p>
<p>So, Taleworlds spent time refining War Sails and patch v1.3.4, as well as answering questions from players in regular developer blog posts to keep interest in the DLC boiling away. In the <a href="https://forums.taleworlds.com/index.php?threads/war-sails-q-a-4.467565/">fourth of these posts</a>, the team answered a question about whether War Sails would include custom naval battles - standalone fights players can set up to their liking from the main menu in the base game - at launch. Surprise: the post revealed, following previous feedback, that those custom ship battles would be coming at launch.</p><p>When I asked Engel what went into the original decision not to have these custom naval battles right away, and how those plans changed, he conceded that it's a "bit more of a technical question", so he'd need to go out on a limb. "The way that I understand it, our custom battle is a separate module from sandbox, from campaign, etc," he explained. "With the way that we've set up our base game, it can function like that. The way that the DLC is set up, the ships and so forth are set up, it’s more complex to access the relevant elements of the game. One of the things that I believe we still don't have in naval custom battles, for example, are the [ship] figureheads. That is because of this sort of modular or module approach to different elements of the game."</p>
<p>He added that, natually, this modular approach is a boon for modding, revealing that "essentially, War Sails is a large mod". While he didn't get into specifics, Engel did add that developing War Sails has "resulted in changes to the way that modding is supported", which have had a "positive impact" overall.</p>
<p>As someone who's always a bit more comfortable watching an assault I know won't leave me having to lick my wounds and start rebuilding my army from scratch after a few painful nights in chains, I'm certainly glad Taleworlds were able to make custom battles work from the get-go. Plus, they're an ideal way of trying the game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mount-blade-ii-bannerlord-war-sails-designer-on-ships-that-mimic-horse-archers-and-dredging-for-inspiration-in-french-bogs">fleet of historically-inspired vessels</a> before you commit to investing the considerable coin to buy one in a full campaign.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[WD 14TB External Hard Drive Restocks at $0.01 per GB, Proving Margin Isn’t the Plan for Storage Deals This Black Friday]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-takes-23-off-the-massive-20tb-wd-external-hard-drive-but-not-for-long-2000646687</link>
            <guid>1366582</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Is there anything more annoying than the dreaded “low storage” warning that forces you to delete your old stuff just to save something new?</p>
<p>It’s more common than you think, but you don’t have to deal with the issue. Adding an external hard drive can give you both the space and peace of mind you need. There are plenty of options out there across all sizes and ranges. Capacities start from 16GB and go all the way up to multi-terabyte options, which are ideal for gamers and creatives. If you are looking to store an unusually large number of files and content, we’ve found a deal that lets you do that without shelling out big bucks.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5989/">Amazon is currently being generous with a 39% discount on the 14TB external hard drive by WD.</a> It normally retails for $280, but you can bag it for $170 today if you act fast. This drive is massive enough to take care of all your storage needs for years to come, so $270 is a solid price.</p>

<h2>Massive Storage, Impressive Compatibility</h2>
<p>You’re getting a mind-boggling 14TB of storage here. That’s enough to throw in a huge number of high-resolution photos, thousands of videos, hundreds of movies, all your favorite games (both new and old), multiple backups, and still have a lot of space left for your future downloads. You can use it to store literally everything you own, and offload a good chunk of files that you don’t need on a regular basis to free some space on your main device.</p>
<p>It’s ideal for whoever wants to never run out of storage. Work professionals can use it to house their presentations, years’ worth of documents, and spreadsheets that never seem to end.

<p>Transferring data will be quick, too, with USB 3.2 Gen support. Of course, speeds won’t match that of SSDs, but it’s still fast enough for large backups and heavy files.

The plug-and-play setup helps you get started in no time without any complicated installation procedures.</p>



<p>Despite all the capacity and power it offers, it’s quite lightweight and easy to carry around. It looks like a mini PC, and doesn’t take a lot of desk space. When working remotely, you can just toss it in your laptop bag and get going.</p>
<p>All in all, this hard drive by Western Digital is designed to take care of all your current and upcoming storage needs. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5989/">The 14TB capacity is truly massive, while the plug-and-play setup makes getting started fairly straightforward.

<p>If 14TB is a bit too much for you, there are other capacities available, too. Almost all options are discounted, so you can pick what you need without paying the full price.</p>
<p>Prime members will also enjoy free shipping with their purchase. That said, if you’ve been wanting to subscribe, now is a good time to do it.

<p>It’s been a big year for Nintendo with the release of the Switch 2 and a host of games from some of the biggest IPs, giving you plenty of options when deciding which Nintendo Switch games to consider gifting this holiday season.</p>



<p>Below, Insider Gaming has highlighted some of the best Switch and Switch 3 games to gift in 2025, including major recent releases and must-haves from Nintendo’s extensive catalogue.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-nintendo-switch-games-to-gift">Best Nintendo Switch Games to Gift</h2>







<figure></figure>



<p>The newest entry in the long-standing Pokémon franchise, Legends: Z-A brings players back to Kalos’ Lumiose City and features the return of Mega Evolutions, including favorites from the past and new additions. With open-world exploration and real-time balance mechanics, Legends: Z-A breaks off from the standard Pokémon script, yet impresses as one of the best games in the franchise’s history.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Mario Kart 8 seemed to go on forever, but, after many years of waiting, 2025 finally saw the arrival of Mario Kart World on Nintendo Switch 2. While it’s not available on the original Switch console, Mario Kart World is a must-have for any Switch 2 owner, providing plenty of enjoyment solo or against other players.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-hades-2">Hades 2</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>After an extended stint in early access, Hades 2 fully released a 1.0 version this year and Switch players are the first to be able to jump in as the title is a timed console exclusive. The roguelike game is great to play on Switch, with the ability to play on the go, and the biggest challenge you’ll likely face is putting it down.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Although now five years old, Animal Crossing: New Horizons continues to be a must-play title, standing as one of the best available on the Switch, and there’s even more content right around the corner. The big 3.0 update next year brings Switch 2 improvements to the game, but there’s also a bunch of new free additions for players across both generations of console.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Another title that stands as a must-have for any Switch player, Tears of the Kingdom is widely regarded to be one of the greatest games of all time. There’s so much to do that you’ll lose hours and hours in the game, with a gripping story to complete and a near-endless amount of side quests and exploration to tick off.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-super-smash-bros-ultimate">Super Smash Bros Ultimate</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Though it celebrates a seventh birthday this year, and is likely due to be replaced by a successor in the coming years, Super Smash Bros Ultimate remains the best in show in the brawler scene, and has a stacked roster like no other. Unlocking everyone is quite an undertaking, but it’s worth it and provides a fun challenge to the single-player push.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-super-mario-galaxy-super-mario-galaxy-2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>This two-in-one bundle has hours of entertainment through arguably the best Mario titles ever created, and the fact it’s at an affordable price makes it even more enticing. Super Mario Galaxy paved the way for the modern generation of titles and, while they may be old news by now, they’re worth picking up if you haven’t already.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-powerwash-simulator-2">PowerWash Simulator 2</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Don’t knock it until you’ve tried it. On paper, PowerWash Simulator 2 may not sound like the most thrilling adventure, and you’d be right, but what it does offer is relaxing gameplay that hits the spot every time you boot it up. There’s nothing else quite as satisfying as finally finishing a big job in PowerWash Simulator 2, and it’s well worth trying out.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-super-mario-party-jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Super Mario Party Jamboree is the latest instalment in the beloved franchise that has been testing friendships for generations, and it’s another must-have title for any Switch owner. With an array of mini games, plenty of boards to work through in matches, and unrivalled multiplayer, Super Mario Party Jamboree needs to be near the top of your wishlist.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-no-longer-plans-to-release-a-second-assassins-creed-shadows-expansion</link>
            <guid>1366576</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft has confirmed it no longer plans to launch a second major <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> expansion, something that previously would have formed part of the game's now-abandoned season pass. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shadows' first — and now, it seems, only — major expansion launched in September. The 10-hour <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-dlc-review">Claws of Awaji</a> had previously been described as the "first expansion" included in Shadows' season pass, an offer that was formally scrapped a year ago when Ubisoft delayed the game's launch from November 2024 to February 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As an apology to fans for the game's delay, Ubisoft said it instead would gift Claws of Awaji for free to all pre-order customers. But fans still assumed a second expansion would follow at some point, as has become custom for every other major Assassin's Creed title over the past decade. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"As of now, at this moment for Year Two, there is no expansion on the size of Awaji that is planned," associate game director Simon Lemay-Comtois said in an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iijrbz8XBc&amp;t=559s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JorRaptor</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lemay-Comtois caveated his answer by noting some exceptional examples in the past where Ubisoft had changed its plans to make more add-on content than it had originally envisioned (such as with the recent Saudi-funded DLC that arrived two years post-launch for Assassin's Creed Mirage). But, currently, it seems clear that no second expansion is on the cards, and there's no suggestion that Shadows' post-launch plans will extend into a Year Three.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's an extremely surprising decision by Ubisoft, which followed up the launch of 2017's Assassin's Creed Origins with two expansions (The Hidden Ones and The Curse of the Pharaohs), 2018's Assassin's Creed Odyssey with two expansions (Legacy of the First Blade and The Fate of Atlantis), and 2020's Assassin's Creed Odyssey with three expansions (Wrath of the Druids, The Siege of Paris, Dawn of Ragnarök) alongside numerous other smaller DLC drops. 2023's smaller-scale Assassin's Creed Mirage was itself originally planned as yet another Valhalla expansion, before it was ultimately released as a standalone game.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're still working on content for post-launch and supporting it, but it's not a full-on DLC the way a season pass would have had in the previous years," Lemay-Comtois said, confirming at least that Ubisoft still had plans for smaller additions to Shadows within 2026. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're trying to re-adjust for Year Two a little bit," he continued. "There's learning from Year One we can apply to Year Two. Any content we want to do in Year Two will probably be more sparse, not a drip-feed... but chunkier updates that shake things up a little more. I'm not announcing anything at this point but our strategy for Year One was to be quick and reactive, so it means smaller drops often, but for Year Two we don't need to put fires out or anything, so it's more what good, chunky little piece of meat... we can drop and have people come back and enjoy it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Digging into Lemay-Comtois' comment, the suggestion here is that Ubisoft's decision to change course on Shadows following its pre-release reception impacted the company's plans for post-launch support, with priority placed on fighting immediate "fires." And indeed, Shadows has enjoyed a series of recent patches that have added numerous fan-requested features, in a clear bid to turn sentiment around. Going into further detail, Lemay-Comtois also suggested Shadows had been a tougher game to develop technologically, further complicating plans to get post-launch content ready.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think with Shadows, we had a big jump in generations," he continued. "The engine work that we had to do on Shadows took a lot of time and a lot of our resources. So the planning for the post launch was not really clear as soon as it would have been on another [game] where the technology was more stable and well known. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We started fairly late on Shadows... because I remember during pre-launch we had the Season Pass," he admitted. "And the situation changed when we pushed back on the release date. That plan changed quite a bit and then we had to kind of adapt to the situation. So because of the new tech, because of the new generation, because of the pushes we had in production, we chose an approach that was way more, let's put our ear to the ground when the game launches... and react."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For 2026, Lemay-Comtois suggested Shadows would receive updates "not to the size of a DLC or expansion, but like yesterday's update plus," referencing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-defends-assassins-creed-shadows-microtransactions-and-sets-expectations-for-the-games-long-awaited-arrival-of-isu-content">the free update that arrived this week that added a new story quest, the game's Attack on Titan crossover, as well as a significant Isu Easter egg</a>. "At minimum this size," he emphasized, without stating whether these updates would continue to be provided for free or not.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Complete Assassin's Creed Timeline</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"And whether or not this is the right way to go, or a good learning, I think it's more of an experience we're trying with Shadows, to keep things small and reactive and see how the community feels about it and reacts to it," he concluded. "And the learnings that come out of that will be applied to whatever other projects we do next."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, it's to be expected that Shadows' lead developer Ubisoft Quebec is already planning its next major Assassin's Creed project (and indeed, it was previously reported that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-set-during-post-civil-war-period-canceled-last-year-due-to-increasing-concerns-over-us-political-climate-report">the studio had begun early pre-production work last year on a now-scrapped entry set in the post-U.S. Civil War period</a>). But the mention here of those projects is interesting, alongside confirmation of what sounds like smaller plans for Shadows in 2026 than fans have seen this year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then there's what else fans expect is coming: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-release-date-reportedly-leaked">a remake of Assassin's Creed: Black Flag reportedly waiting in the wings</a>, as well as numerous other Assassin's Creed projects that Ubisoft has already confirmed, including a multiplayer spin-off and the witchcraft-themed Assassin's Creed: Hexe. Amongst all that, and coupled with Shadows' delay drama,  Ubisoft seems to have simply decided a second Shadows expansion isn't necessary.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>If you're hunting for the best offers this week, we're actively rounding up the strongest Black Friday deals on video games, tech, and more.

            <link>https://aftermath.site/open-thread-thanksgiving/</link>
            <guid>1366564</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>It’s Thanksgiving, one of <a href="https://aftermath.site/sid-meiers-colonization-pc-windows-game/"><u>the more fraught holidays on America’s calendar</u></a>, which we nonetheless celebrate by partaking of a bird that’s not very good. Most of us – minus Luke, who lives in a country with much more interesting birds – are off for the day, but we still wanted to give you all a place to chat.</p><p>If you’re in the mood to discuss recipes or juicy family drama or what have you, go for it, but here’s a more gaming-related prompt for those who aren’t feeling the festivities:&nbsp;</p><p>As temperatures cool and skies gray, we all feel some desire to disappear into our caves, homes, or too-expensive apartments and hibernate for the remainder of the year. Alas, capitalism does not accommodate or even really acknowledge this distant echo of humankind’s humble beginnings, but there’s at least something to be said for curling up with a suitable game during the season’s long evenings. What kinds of games do you feel yourself drawn to this time of year?&nbsp;</p><p>For me, it’s JRPGs. Like clockwork, I always start a new one sometime around October or November. I rarely finish them, but I enjoy settling into games that tend to be both intimidatingly colossal and comfortingly formulaic. The holidays have a sort of drawn-out rhythm to them, and so do JRPGs. Their casts of characters similarly come to feel almost like a sort of family over the course of dozens of hours. JRPGs, implicitly if not explicitly, are Christmas movies.&nbsp;</p><p>This year I’m playing <em>Trails In The Sky 1st Chapter</em>, the new remake of the first entry in the beloved <em>Trails </em>series, and it’s really hitting the spot. Its opening hours adhere to a pace that I would call slow, bordering on sleepy, but in a small-town sense rather than one that has me saying “OK, let’s move things along.” I feel like I’ve really gotten to know my main characters and the place that raised them. The final side quest of the prologue sees you bid farewell to the town of Rolent by helping a childhood friend come up with a new recipe for her family’s tavern by enlisting the aid of another childhood friend who works on an idyllic farm, and that kind of sums up the whole vibe: Everyone is very caring, considerate, and hardworking. The game believes in people and the enduring power of our bonds. It’s an extremely welcome change of pace after a day of bleak headlines and doomscrolling.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But <em>Trails In The Sky</em> does not strike me as saccharine. Estelle, the main character, is a surprisingly nuanced take on the shonen archetype of a battle-hungry idiot with a tragic backstory, and now, at the outset of the game’s first real chapter, the world’s larger political machinations are starting to seep (back) into her life. I’m excited to see where it all goes. Maybe I’ll even finish a JRPG, for once.&nbsp;</p><p>How about you? What kinds of games do you play during the fall and winter?</p>

            <p>Original TimeSplitters and GoldenEye developers David Doak and Steve Ellis have reunited to make - oh, those scalliwags, you're going to love this - a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> word puzzler called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/beyond-words">Beyond Words</a>, which is being billed as "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a> meets Scrabble".</p>
<p>That quote is actually from <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/11/balatro-and-scrabble-just-had-a-baby-thanks-to-two-of-the-legends-behind-goldeneye-and-timesplitters">Time Extension</a>, but publishers PQube have reprinted it ecstatically in the announcement release, and well, come on, look at it. Watch the trailer below. If this game wasn't inspired by Balatro, I will eat an actual Scrabble board, mossy green bags and all. Then I will shit a match-winning seven-letter word of mild approval, like "quality". I do like Scrabble, even when it has 300+ modifiers in it and some possibly AI-generated polar bears.</p>

<p>You can find <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3823370/Beyond_Words/">a demo for Beyond Words on Steam</a>. If you click through and play that demo, I will not have to explain the game any further, and can save my precious high-scoring words for other breaking news stories, like whatever the hell Tim Sweeney has said now. But no, I see that you are still reading, because you are too much in thrall to words. Friend, I can only salute your lexophilia. Here is another paragraph, specially for you.</p><p>As in Scrabble, the goal in Beyond Words is to form your hand of letter tiles into high-scoring words. But this ain't the traditional Scrabble layout, with those wily triple-word bonus squares in the far corners. There's a selection of boards, aka "living puzzles". Some of them look like Zelda dungeons after a pinch of nose candy, sprinkled with gold coins and barricades and power-up signs.</p>
<p>This isn't the traditional Scrabble scoring system, either: you can change letter scores, duplicate them and destroy them. You can "bend the rules past breaking point with modifiers, stickers, and enhancements where every choice shapes your journey". There are also time attack challenges, boss battles, seeded runs and "the brain-melting flipside of negative scoring". If you play the demo, please get back to us to confirm whether your brain has melted - I'm quite attached to my brain and would rather not risk it.</p>
<p>Beyond Words is due in early access in early 2026. The Steam page carries the disclosure that "generative AI was one of many tools used by professional artists to assist in the creation of the artwork for the game". I have to write up Sweeney's latest next so I'll save today's torch-waving excoriations about generative AI usage for that post.</p>
<p>The court dutifully acknowledges that this is not the first time somebody's spilled Balatro over Scrabble - there's also <a href="https://playletterlike.com/">Letterlike</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3586660/Word_Play/">Word Play</a>, at the very least. If you'd rather play some kind of first-person shooter with N64 or PS2 graphics, maybe check out loving fangame <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/timesplitters-rewind-the-fanmade-sort-of-remake-project-finally-makes-it-into-early-access-13-years-on">TimeSplitters: Rewind</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dyson-leverages-amazon-to-clear-supersonic-nural-stock-premium-hair-dryer-hits-all-time-low-2000648096</link>
            <guid>1366555</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Dyson has established itself as the definitive innovator in air management technology and it revolutionized everything from vacuum cleaners to air purifiers through engineering approaches that competitors struggle to replicate. Their <strong>hair dryer line applies this same obsessive attention to airflow physics</strong> and creates tools that fundamentally differ from traditional blow dryers in both function and results.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6000/">At $399, down from $549</a>, the Supersonic Nural represents Dyson’s<strong> most advanced hair drying technology</strong> available at a record-low price on Amazon for Black Friday. The package includes <strong>multiple styling attachments</strong> and <strong>premium presentation packaging</strong> that justifies both personal use and gift-giving applications during the holiday season.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6000/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Intelligent Heat Control That Protects Hair Health</h2>
<p>The Nural designation references advanced sensor technology that <strong>measures air temperature 40 times per second</strong>, adjusting heating elements to maintain optimal temperature ranges that prevent heat damage. Traditional hair dryers blast constant high heat that dries hair quickly but causes cumulative damage through protein denaturation and moisture loss that leaves hair brittle and prone to breakage.</p>
<p>The intelligent regulation keeps effectiveness while preserving hair structure, and creates the paradox where faster drying causes less damage than slower methods. The system learns your drying patterns and adjusts automatically and reduces heat when you pause or change angles and ramping up when resuming active drying. This adaptive intelligence transforms the dryer from passive tool into active partner that protects hair health during every use.</p>



<p>The <strong>digital motor V9 spins at 110,000 RPM while weighing just 27 grams</strong> through miniaturization that defies conventional motor engineering. This extreme rotation speed generates the high-velocity airflow that enables fast drying without excessive heat and fundamentally changes the drying equation. The motor positions in the handle rather than the head and creates unprecedented balance that reduces wrist strain during extended styling sessions. Professional stylists and home users both appreciate how the weight distribution enables precise control without arm fatigue that plagues top-heavy conventional dryers.</p>
<p>Air multiplier technology<strong> amplifies the motor’s airflow by 3x through aerodynamic engineering</strong> borrowed from jet engine development, creating focused high-velocity streams that penetrate through hair to the scalp. This concentrated airflow dries from roots to tips efficiently rather than just moving surface moisture around, reducing total drying time substantially. <strong>Thick, long hair that requires 20-30 minutes with conventional dryers often completes in 10-15 minutes</strong>.</p>



<p>The included styling attachments address various hair types and desired outcomes through engineered airflow patterns rather than just changing nozzle shapes: The smoothing nozzle creates a wide, flat airflow perfect for straightening while drying, the styling concentrator provides precision for detailed work and the diffuser distributes air evenly for enhancing natural curls without frizz. The magnetic attachment system enables instant swapping without fumbling with clips or threads, maintaining workflow during styling routines.</p>
<p><strong>Negative ion generation reduces static electricity</strong> that creates flyaway hair and frizz and produces smoother results that require less finishing product. The ions work at the molecular level by neutralizing positive charges that develop during drying, creating hair that lays naturally rather than repelling itself. This chemistry creates visibly different results compared to non-ionic dryers and reduces the styling product dependence that many users accept as necessary for polished appearance.</p>
<p>The<strong> premium packaging and presentation elevate the Supersonic Nural beyond typical appliances into gift-worthy territory</strong> appropriate for milestone occasions. The included storage case protects the dryer and attachments during travel while maintaining organization at home. The build quality through materials selection and assembly precision creates an appliance that feels substantial and durable rather than disposable.</p>
<p>At $399, the Dyson Supersonic Nural is going for 27% below retail this Black Friday. Dyson’s hair dryer represents the company’s air management expertise applied to personal care with results that justify premium pricing through tangible performance and health benefits.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Samsung’s Black Friday blowout sale has spread into their top-level gaming monitor section, with a <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4560/">39% Amazon steal of a deal on the 32-inch Odyssey G55C Series QHD 1000R curved gaming monitor</a>. Ultra-low 1ms motion blur, 165Hz of speed, and dazzling QHD resolution of 2560 x 1440 on a high-quality curved screen will make your gaming setup more immersive and realistic for just $200.</p>
<p>This Black Friday deal brings the 27-inch and 32-inch Odyssey G55C Series monitors to the same $200, but the 39%-off deal on the larger model beats the 33%-off deal on the smaller version. Just $200 for a large curved monitor with QHD resolution that has 1.7 times the pixel density of Full HD is a steal, particularly considering how much razor-sharp detail it brings to your gaming.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4560/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Play Longer, Play Better</h2>
<p>The Samsung Odyssey G55C’s huge, sharp screen will make it hard to tear yourself away from your gaming grind, but that’s ok — you can put it into Eye Saver Mode to minimize blue light and reduce eye strain, and it has far less screen flicker, so there’s less irritation and tiring for your eyes.</p>
<p>With that in mind, feel free to take a nice long immersive gaming dive into the Odyssey G55C, and bring the fastest and most detailed console or PC games you can find. The greasy-fast 165Hz refresh rate keeps up with shooters, eSports, role-players, racers, and any other kind of game. The 1ms response time mean minimal blur, and you getting the jump on the rest of the field in the battle royal game.</p>
<p>AMD Radeon FreeSync is built into the Samsung Odyssey G55C, quietly ensuring the monitor and graphics card keep their refresh rates in perfect sync. That’s how the G55C virtually eliminates image tearing and keeps evey the fastest games looking ultra smooth.</p>



<h2>The Curve Has Verve</h2>
<p>Curved monitors have exploded in popularity with gamers in recent years for the added realism they bring to games. The curved monitor brings the action into your peripheral vision with outstanding detail and great speed, so when you get lost in the game, you&nbsp;<em>really</em> get lost in the game.</p>
<p>What sucks you in is the combination of the flawlessly smooth action and peerless color performance, with millions of colors all popping, and deep blacks and bright whites providing outstanding contrast to go with the pixel density and create a superior overall picture. If you’re usig the Odyssey G55C with a PC, it’s an outstanding everyday monitor in addition to being a top-level gaming monitor.</p>
<p>The Samsung Odyssey G55C 32-inch curved monitor was already an Amazon’s Choice before this Black Friday sale, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4560/">now that it’s 39% off to drop the price by over $100 to just $200</a>, it’s one of the best Black Friday gaming deals so far.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Epic Games CEO recently commented on AI disclosure for game stores, stating it makes no sense as it will be involved in almost all future production. </p>



<p>The gaming industry has conflicting views about AI use in development at the moment. Some seem to be for it, with companies like Ubisoft pushing for full-scale AI-driven <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-ai-teammates-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research projects</a>. The Witcher 3 director also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-3-director-calls-dispatch-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoke about</a> AI in development, stating he doesn’t feel “that games created with only AI will have soul.” Now Tim Sweeney has shared his two cents on AI in game development and store disclosure. </p>







<h2 id="h-epic-games-ceo-says-ai-will-be-involved-in-nearly-all-future-production">Epic Games CEO Says AI Will Be Involved in Nearly All Future Production</h2>



<p>The CEO of Epic Games, Tim Sweeney, recently responded to a comment on <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1993687499621728312" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) that said Steam and other digital marketplaces “need to drop the ‘Made with AI’ label.” Sweeney said that he agrees with that comment, adding that the AI tag is “relevant to art exhibits for authorship disclosure, and to digital content licensing marketplaces where buyers need to understand the rights situation.”</p>



<p>Sweeney added that AI disclosure “makes no sense for game stores, where AI will be involved in nearly all future production.” When another user spoke about customers deserving to know, Sweeney poked fun at those statements, <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1993890431462166818" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stating</a>, “Why stop at AI use? We could have mandatory disclosures for what shampoo brand the developer uses. Customers deserve to know lol.”</p>

<p>Talking about AI in game development, Activision was recently under fire by the community for using generative AI <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-responds-black-ops-7-ai-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to create their calling cards</a> for Black Ops 7. The controversy received so much attention that it prompted a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-ai-controversy-catches-attention-of-us-congressman-we-need-regulations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">response from US Congressman Ro Khanna</a>. He stated that “we need regulations that prevent companies from using AI to eliminate jobs to extract greater profits.”</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/27/splitgate-2-relaunches-sometime-next-month-exiting-beta-for-the-second-time/</link>
            <guid>1366534</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>1047 Games is going to give it another shot, announcing that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/splitgate-2">Splitgate 2’s</a> beta will come to an end on 4th December, and that the online shooter will then get a full relaunch later in the month – I’d put some money on a launch during The Game Awards, wouldn’t you?</p>
<p>In a simple announcement on Steam, the team writes, “Thank you to everyone who participated in the Splitgate 2 Beta! On December 4th, the Beta Season &amp; active Battle Passes will be ending, alongside your seasonal “rank” progress.”</p>


<p>This will be Splitgate 2’s second launch, following the turbulent aborted release earlier this year. Having launched during Summer Game Fest in a fashion that put a lot of noses out of joint – namely, the studio founder calling out the industry while at the same time announcing a trend-chasing battle royale mode. Combined with a number of gameplay direction changes that didn’t appeal so strongly, and the game floundered, leading to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/22/splitgate-2-goes-back-into-beta-original-splitgate-servers-going-offline-staff-cut/">1047 taking the game back to beta</a> and, more disappointingly, laying a bunch of people off.</p>
<p>So what’s changed? For the final targeted beta weekend 1047 outlined how they’ve adjusted the experience:</p>
<p><em>Since launching the beta in May, this game has majorly transformed. We started with factions and abilities, and we’ve rebuilt the entire foundation around what makes Splitgate special: portals, movement, and pure gunplay.</em></p>

<p><em>Here’s what’s changed. We removed factions entirely and reimagined abilities as power-ups. We brought back classic roundless modes like King of the Hill, Domination, and Team Deathmatch. We added Classic Arena, an even-starts mode that captures the spirit of original Splitgate. We’ve introduced new maps, new weapons, reworked the menus, and refined systems constantly based on your feedback.</em></p>
<p><em>We’ve also added portal overloading and EMPs, fundamentally changing how map control works. We’ve streamlined equipment to improve combat clarity. We’ve tuned our controller feel. We’ve fixed critical bugs and made countless optimizations.</em></p>
<p><em>None of this happens without you. The past six months have been a journey, and every piece of feedback, every playtest participation, every community discussion has shaped where we are now. Splitgate is in the best place it’s ever been, and that’s because you’ve been here with us.</em></p>
<p>It certainly sounds like a major overhaul that gets back to the game and the genre’s roots a bit more. Splitgate 1 launched just before Halo Infinite and was massively popular for just being a bit like Halo’s classic arena shooter style and having a fun portals mechanic.</p>

              <p>Happy Thanksgaming, <em>Kotaku</em> readers! It’s especially happy because, while all the full-time staff are off worshiping a giant effigy of a turkey (I’ve yet to quite figure out what Thanksgiving is), I’m taking advantage of their all-consuming distraction to post as many unknown indie games as I can onto the front page of this popular gaming site. Take <em>that</em>, capitalism!</p> <p>So please dive into this extraordinary list of upcoming or recently released indie games that you almost certainly won’t have heard of before. There’s definitely going to be&nbsp;<em>something</em> that’s in your field of interest, if not a dozen, and the very best thing you can do for yourself and the developers is slap them straight onto your wishlist. The more interest the games receive, the better opportunities come the creators’ way.</p>

 <p>This list is compiled from the hundreds of emails I’ve received <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/botherer.bsky.social/post/3m6ffpsw7os2r">after putting out an appeal to indie devs</a> earlier this week, which I then select at random (with a common sense filter for quality), and then include below. Unless I say so I’ve not played the games mentioned, so I’m not here vouching for their quality. I’m with you all, looking through the intriguing, amazing creativity that’s out there, and doing my best to celebrate it as loudly as possible. (If you like that sort of thing, by the way, do feel free to support my other unknown indies project,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.patreon.com/c/buriedtreasure"><em>Buried Treasure</em></a>!)</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1858950/Steel_Century_Groove/">Steel Century Groove</a></h2>  <p>Developer: Sloth Gloss Games<br> Release Date: Jan 28, 2026<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1858950/Steel_Century_Groove/">Store Page</a></p> <p>I think we can all agree after watching the trailer above that mecha games should&nbsp;<em>always</em> have been about dancing and nothing else. Oh my goodness, what a joyfully silly thing, watching giant robots have dance battles.&nbsp;<em>Steel Century Groove</em> is a rhythm-RPG, featuring both the mecha dance-offs and a bunch of betwixt-battle friendship making and RPG story. There’s a demo now, and the whole game comes out in January.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3842190/Die_or_Die/">Die or Die</a></h2>  <p>Developer: Ao Norte<br> Release Date: 2026<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3842190/Die_or_Die/">Store Page</a></p> <p>Well that doesn’t seem like the best option. Until you realize one of those “Die”s is dice. This is a top-down twin-stick shooter, inspired by <em>Nuclear Throne</em>, where slain enemies and treasures give you dice, used to roll for new abilities and powers, or to gamble against “Bummers” that make the game harder. There’s a demo on Steam to give you a better idea.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2983410/Xenopurge/">Xenopurge</a></h2>  <p>Developer: Traptics<br> Release Date: Out now<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2983410/Xenopurge/">Store Page</a></p> <p>Released just last week,&nbsp;<em>Xenopurge</em> is an auto-battler, but looks unlike any I’ve seen before. Rather than directly controlling some dude in the middle of a battlefield, here you’re indirectly issuing orders from a remote command center, making plans and setting routes on the fly. It sounds like if the original&nbsp;<em>Rainbow Six</em> were a 2D&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>clone, and that’s won me over immediately. Already installing.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3824720/Descent_Of_Lunaris/">Descent of Lunaris</a></h2>  <p>Developer: Unison Games<br> Release Date: 2026<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3824720/Descent_Of_Lunaris/">Store Page</a></p> <p>Oh my gosh, this went so quickly onto my wishlist. The mindset of a classic-style dungeon blobber, but with modern aesthetics and a super-weird Giger-punk vibe. Inspired by&nbsp;<em>Wizardry</em> and&nbsp;<em>Shin Megami Tensei</em>, and it’s all set on the moon. Absolutely thrilled to see if this one comes together.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3742720/Sobakistan_The_Land_of_Dogs/">Sobakistan: The Land of Dogs</a></h2>  <p>Developer: Terletski Games<br> Release Date: 2026<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3742720/Sobakistan_The_Land_of_Dogs/">Store Page</a></p> <p>Why this isn’t called&nbsp;<em>Sobarkistan</em> is upsetting me too much to think about, so let’s distract ourselves by focusing on how this is a parody of a nation emerging from isolated totalitarianism, in which you play through a branching narrative with puzzles, stealth and a bunch of different endings to find. It’s by the creators of the comic on which it’s based, and I am all in for its distinct pixel style.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1920290/Barkour/">Barkour</a></h2>  <p>Developer: VARSAV GAme Studios<br> Release Date: TBA<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1920290/Barkour/">Store Page</a></p> <p>See, that’s the correct way to name a dog-based game!&nbsp;<em>Barkour</em> is all about being a super-hi-tech dog, in a third-person action game about being a little woofy spy. The trailer looks completely charming, with a lot of stealth, hacking and swinging from rafters, all as a handsome doggo. There’s a demo on its Steam page.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3492830/Gunlocked_2/">Gunlocked 2</a></h2>  <p>Developer: FromLefcourt<br> Release Date: Out now (Early Access)<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3492830/Gunlocked_2/">Store Page</a></p> <p>I missed the original&nbsp;<em>Gunlocked</em> in 2022, but I’m very interested to go back and take a look now. It and its new sequel are Amiga-style vertical scrolling shoot ’em ups—think&nbsp;<em>Cyberdyne</em> or <em>Xenon</em>—but with a far more involved ship-building element. Employing more modern roguelite elements, it’s all about customization and careful movement through bullet-hell action. This sequel came out in August this year in Early Access, and is due a big update in the next couple of weeks.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2974540/Night_Machine/">Night Machine</a></h2>  <p>Developer: Cooler Games<br> Release Date: TBA<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2974540/Night_Machine/">Store Page</a></p> <p>That pesky moon of ours turns out to contain a vast alien factory, revealed after our closest neighbor cracked in half. In <em>Night Machine</em> you pilot a craft to the center of the moon-machine with the goal of destroying it, except everything about your ship is controlled via cards. And yes, there’s a deckbuilder for&nbsp;<em>everything</em> now, but this does sound enormously intriguing.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3406690/Puzzle_Spy_International/">Puzzle Spy International</a></h2>  <p>Developer: Travel-Friendly Cake<br> Release Date: Q1 2026<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3406690/Puzzle_Spy_International/">Store Page</a></p> <p>The trailer for&nbsp;<em>Puzzle Spy International</em> gives me vibes of both&nbsp;<em>Professor Layton</em> and&nbsp;<em>Curse of the Golden Idol</em>, although perhaps without the latter’s intense difficulty. This is about traveling around the the world to catch some naughty diamond thieves, while solving puzzles involving rearranging words and pictures on the screen, and chatting with the locals. The game’s out early next year, but there’s already a demo to check out.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2891370/Pieced_Together/">Pieced Together</a></h2>  <p>Developer: Glowfrog Games<br> Release Date: Q1 2026<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2891370/Pieced_Together/">Store Page</a></p> <p>Talking of rearranging words and pictures on the screen (I swear to god, I pick these at random, and am&nbsp;<em>far</em> too lazy to curate them into some clever order),&nbsp;<em>Pieced Together&nbsp;</em>is a scrapbooking game that explores the nature of friendship as we age. It looks like a warm hug in gaming form, and there’s already a demo on Steam if you wanna see.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2719850/Super_Spelling_Ducks/">Super Spelling Ducks</a></h2>  <p>Developer: SKYLE Games Ltd<br> Release Date: TBA<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2719850/Super_Spelling_Ducks/">Store Page</a></p> <p>I love a word game, but for some reason most of them seem to be ad-riddled mobile games. So hooray for&nbsp;<em>Super Spelling Ducks</em>, a particularly mad-looking game about using a duck to push lettered blocks around a grid, spelling out words to make them explode. Being a little rogueish, each run at the game involves putting together a different collection of upgrades and abilities, and it all looks pleasingly chaotic. Oh, and it will have co-op too!</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3637630/Camp_Keepalive_Endless_Summer/">Camp Keepalive</a></h2>  <p>Developer: Porch Weather Games<br> Release Date: Out now<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3637630/Camp_Keepalive_Endless_Summer/">Store Page</a></p> <p>We don’t have summer camps here in the UK, but what I’ve come to understand about them is that they are all absolutely overrun by axe murderers and killer clowns. That seems to be further proved by&nbsp;<em>Camp Keepalive</em>, a turn-based strategy in which you control a group of counselors trying to keep the camp’s residents alive despite the monsters and monstrous people stalking the woods. There game came out earlier this year, but hasn’t gotten the attention it deserves.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3078120/Reality_Drift/">Reality Drift</a></h2>  <p>Developer: Arganoid Industries<br> Release Date: Q3 2026<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3078120/Reality_Drift/">Store Page</a></p> <p>Well this looks stunningly bizarre. A driving game in which you seem to gain astonishing speeds, but all decided by which lanes you pick as you go. It was the location choices of “Space,” “Cat Land,” or “Hell” that convinced me. There’s even somehow deckbuilding in this too, in a game that looks more tactical than reflex-based. Despite still being a fair way off, there’s already a demo.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3241070/The_Amateur_Deity_Society/">The Amateur Deity Society</a></h2>  <p>Developer: Robert Carlson<br> Release Date: Out now<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3241070/The_Amateur_Deity_Society/">Store Page</a></p> <p>This combination of a point-and-click interface but an interactive fiction delivery has absolutely fascinated me. It’s all about being a member of the high school computer club which is attempting to program a world-simulator, but everything goes too…well? This came out last year but seems to have completely fallen under the radar. I’m installing it as I write, because I want to know more.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://computerjames.itch.io/stealth-cw">Stealth Crossword</a></h2>  <p>Developer: ComputerJames<br> Release Date: Out now<br> <a href="https://computerjames.itch.io/stealth-cw">Store Page</a></p> <p>As a massive fan of crosswords, both cryptic and <em>New York Times</em>y, I’m always hopeful for innovative approaches to the genre in games, and generally disappointed. But&nbsp;<em>oh my goodness</em>, I am so very here for&nbsp;<em>Stealth Crossword</em>. It’s literally that! You play as the letters needed to finish the clues on grids laid out in clandestine locations, sneaking past the other alphabetical guards to enter the correct cell! There’s a levels where you have to hack a computer (as a sentient letter, naturally), to find out the clues, then knock out a guard to push their unconscious forms into the correct place in the grid! Oh I’m in love. The whole thing is only 10 minutes long (but make sure to play again and get caught), incredibly silly, and brilliantly smart. And it’s free! And it’s out now! This deserves to be developed into a full-length game.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4136640/Mimic_Meadows/">Mimic Meadows</a></h2>  <p>Developer: sourencho<br> Release Date: TBA<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4136640/Mimic_Meadows/">Store Page</a></p> <p>I was absolutely <em>convinced&nbsp;</em>I’d played <em>Mimic Meadows&nbsp;</em>before, and that it had been&nbsp;<em>brilliant</em>, and I’ve finally figured it out. It’s an expanded version of an absolutely stunning puzzle game from 2022 called&nbsp;<em>Mimic</em>, which <a href="https://buried-treasure.org/2022/01/mimic/">I reviewed here</a>, where after saying how clever it is lamented, “There’s definitely a sense that it stops just as it hits its stride. Pursued further, you can see this becoming a&nbsp;<em>Baba Is You</em>, and I would be just delighted to see that happen.” My wishes are coming true! In the game, you play as a little red blob who can change into different animals by moving through tiles in a certain pattern. Doing so lets you enter terrain specific to that beast, but you’ll need to figure out routes that let you make those specific shapes. It was&nbsp;<em>great</em>, and I’m thrilled to learn it’s becoming a full game. (The video above is of the original version).</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2126810/Memorys_Reach/">Memory’s Reach</a></h2>  <p>Developer:<br> Release Date:<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2126810/Memorys_Reach/">Store Page</a></p> <p>“A first-person puzzle-adventure metroidvania” is a heck of a way to catch my eye. Then take a look at the <em>gorgeous</em> trailer above to be even more convinced. It’s all about unpicking the tragedy that led to the end of an alien civilization, by solving puzzles and gaining new abilities that let you reach further. And there’s no combat! There’s already a demo, despite no release date announced as yet.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3639950/Star_Spark/">Star Spark</a></h2>  <p>Developer: JoyFlow Games<br> Release Date: TBA<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3639950/Star_Spark/">Store Page</a></p> <p>Surely this can’t be the first time someone’s had the sense to combine a&nbsp;<em>Slay The Spire</em>-style roguelite progression with old-school NES-like turn-based combat?&nbsp;<em>Surely</em>? But I’ve never seen it until now, in the excellent-looking&nbsp;<em>Star Spark</em>. And I want to be playing it already! The sprite art, the feisty animations, and the pumped up music are all on point.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3162890/Project_Lexa/">Project Lexa</a></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000648102" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000648102"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000648102">© Ward Games</figcaption></figure> <p>Developer: Ward Games<br> Release Date: TBA<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3162890/Project_Lexa/">Store Page</a></p> <p>I love the idea of language-deciphering games, but then something like the incredible&nbsp;<em>Heaven’s Vault</em> comes along and it’s far too hard for me.&nbsp;<em>Project Lexa</em> looks like it could be my happy place, however. You play as a communications specialist, marooned on an alien planet and required to translate the glyphs of a vanished colony. It all looks delightful, with its cartoon art and 2D exploration. I cannot wait.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3210060/Skyfarm/">Skyfarm</a></h2>  <p>Developer: Plaid Games<br> Release Date: TBA<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3210060/Skyfarm/">Store Page</a></p> <p>A post-apocalyptic gardening sim is quite the prospect, but&nbsp;<em>Skyfarm</em> is a game about hopefulness. Only the taller rooftops remain safe in the cities after the floods, and you are to be charged with converting a roof garden into a farm to grow food for your community. It looks incredibly positive, positively educational, and also seems to be celebrating the possibilities of joy found in moments of solitude.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonys-compact-soundbar-just-dropped-to-under-100-ahead-of-black-friday-2000647699</link>
            <guid>1366522</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="661">Whether you primarily find yourself watching TV in you living room, bedroom, basement, or even a home theater, it might be time to upgrade your audio setup. While a great picture is important, it’s the sound that can really boost your viewing experience from good to exceptional. A high-quality sound system makes all the difference, and the good news is you don’t need to spend a fortune to achieve cinematic audio in your home. Historically, Black Friday has been a great time to find discounts on home theater upgrades, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5987/">and right now, Sony is offering a 2.0-channel soundbar at a 39% discount. Normally priced at $160, this soundbar is currently available for just $98.</a></p>
<p data-start="703" data-end="1161">Folks underestimate the importance of good audio, even though it makes up 50% of the TV viewing experience. Even with the best picture quality, if the sound is coming from your TV’s built-in speakers, it won’t have the same impact. A soundbar is one of the easiest and most cost-effective ways to upgrade your home audio system, especially if you’re on a budget.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5987/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="1163" data-end="1542">This particular 2.0-channel soundbar from Sony is equipped with a built-in tweeter and delivers deep, powerful bass for rich, immersive sound. Its slim design makes it perfect for smaller spaces, such as city apartments or just any room with limited space. You can easily place it on top of your TV stand, or if you prefer, mount it on the wall to save space and maintain a clean, sleek look.</p>
<p data-start="1577" data-end="2206">If you’ve ever been frustrated by the way audio is mixed in modern content, you’re not alone. A lot of us find ourselves constantly adjusting the volume to keep up. Action sequences will be blasting with loud sounds, only for the dialogue to come through as a faint whisper. With this Sony soundbar, you can forget about those volume battles. It features a voice enhancement mode specifically designed to amplify speech, ensuring that dialogue remains clear and easy to hear, without also having the background sounds make your house shake. You’ll be able to enjoy your content without reaching for the remote every few minutes to adjust the volume.</p>


<h2 data-start="2208" data-end="2249">Easy Connectivity and Immersive Sound</h2>
<p data-start="2251" data-end="2742">Setting up the soundbar is a breeze. It connects to your TV via HDMI ARC, allowing for simple and reliable integration with your existing setup. Once connected, you’ll be treated to immersive sound thanks to Sony’s S-Force Pro Front Surround technology. This technology simulates a multi-channel surround sound experience, providing cinema-quality audio no matter where you’re sitting in the room.</p>
<p data-start="2744" data-end="3026">The soundbar isn’t just for movies and TV shows. You can connect your phone or other devices via USB or Bluetooth, allowing you to stream your favorite music, podcasts, audiobooks, and more directly through the soundbar.</p>
<p data-start="3057" data-end="3524">Say goodbye to the poor-quality audio that comes with your TV’s built-in speakers. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5987/">The Sony 2.0-channel soundbar is a great option for upgrading your home entertainment setup and right now it’s priced at just $98, down from its original price of $160.</a></p>

<p>The Pokémon TCG has seen a popularity boom once again in 2025, making products harder and harder to source, but there are some Black Friday deals to take advantage of.</p>



<p>Pokémon has moved the TCG into the Mega Evolution era, following the return of Mega Evolution Pokémon in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, which is expected to remain until the release of Gen 10, expected later next year. </p>



<p>Sets continue to come out thick and fast, but, with the first line of Ascended Heroes products not landing until the end of January, there’s a bit of breathing room to take a look at the best Black Friday deals available—and don’t forget to look at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/holiday-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s other holiday guides</a>.</p>

<p>Admittedly, products don’t seem to be available at MSRP, even on places like Amazon, but there are some savings available. If you’re particularly after packs to rip, there are several options available, and, for the bigger collectors seeking a larger prize piece, the Mega Charizard X ex Ultra-Premium Collection is worth pulling the trigger on.</p>

<p>CD Projekt Red has told fans not to expect any new showcases of The Witcher 4 during The Game Awards next month, despite being nominated for an award.</p>



<p>The Witcher 4 faces stiff competition with the likes of Marvel’s Wolverine and Grand Theft Auto 6 to be crowned the Most Anticipated Game at the 2025 awards show, but no matter the outcome, there won’t be any Witcher 4 reveals.</p>

<p>The post read: “I’m very happy to see The Witcher 4 nominated in the Most Anticipated Game category at The Game Awards. Thanks to everyone who has already voted – your support means a lot to us.</p>



<p>“We won’t be bringing any new content to TGA this year, but we’re, as always, excited to watch the show and celebrate this amazing industry’s great night alongside all of you.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The holiday season is upon us, and sales are starting to hit the entire gaming hobby, including a huge price drop for Battlefield 6 just in time for Black Friday.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 is one of the biggest titles to release this year, achieving critical acclaim, and even more content is on the horizon with seasonal content. If you’ve not yet jumped in and purchased the title, this is the best opportunity to do so.</p>







<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-half-price-on-playstation-5">Battlefield 6 Half-Price on PlayStation 5</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Cut price. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Amazon has slashed the price of <strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/battlefield-6-ps-5-amazon-us/">Battlefield 6</a></strong> on PlayStation 5 to just $35, half the price of the launch cost and a whopping drop on the previous low price found earlier in the week.</p>



<p>Unfortunately for players on Xbox Series X|S and PC, the cut-price sale of Battlefield 6 on Amazon only applies to the PS5 version, but it’s worth keeping your eyes peeled for similar price drops over the Black Friday weekend.</p>



<p>Stock is likely to be limited, however, so if you’re sat on the fence about picking up Battlefield 6, it’s best to act fast, otherwise, you’ll likely regret it.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 has plenty to offer and, while the single-player campaign is fun at times, nothing beats multiplayer in the title, with combat on the ground and in the air. That’s not it, though, as datamines have previously revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-naval-combat-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">naval warfare content is already in development</a>, having <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-teases-naval-warfare-is-coming-to-battlefield-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously been teased by EA</a>.</p>



<p>Season 1 in Battlefield 6 kicked off on October 28, launching the REDSEC Battle Royale mode, which is free to play, new maps, new game modes, and new weapons.</p>



<p>The season is expected to close towards the end of January, expected around the 20th, with more additional content then being brought to the game in Season 2 and beyond.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> fans have accused <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> of accessibility negligence with its forthcoming Fan Fest event in California. After the "accessibility shitshow" of the previous event in the US, fans fear the production company of next year's event is ill-equipped to deal with accessibility needs and are vowing not to attend.</p>
<p>The Fan Fest events are huge conventions held regularly in the US, Europe, and Japan, where details of the MMORPG's next expansion are typically revealed. The last of these in the US, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-fan-fest-is-a-theme-park-for-its-passionate-community">held in Las Vegas in 2023</a>, was <a href="https://kaylriene.com/2023/07/31/final-fantasy-xiv-fan-fest-las-vegas-2023-was-kind-of-a-shitshow/">criticised for accessibility issues</a>. I attended myself and, while I'm not disabled, can attest to general poor organisation, lengthy queues for food, and a lack of facilities; the London event, by contrast, ran smoothly.</p>
<p>As such, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-fan-fest-dates-announced-so-when-is-the-next-expansion-due">move to Anaheim California for the 2026 event</a> was initially seen as a positive move, away from the desert heat. However, accessibility is once again proving to be an issue for the event organisers, as concerns have been raised by fans about how the third-party company Square Enix has hired is handling accessibility needs.</p>

<p>Upon purchasing a ticket for the event, fans are able to highlight their need for ADA assistance (relating to the Americans with Disabilities Act). While this initially appeared to be a positive step, these attendees are then emailed and required to have a personal phone call with a third-party organisation to raise their specific needs. Attendees then have 24 hours to agree to any accommodations.</p><p>Eurogamer can verify these emails, which are sent from The Trade Group, a company specialising in trade shows and conventions. Its work includes events for the Pokémon 2023 World Championship Series in Japan, and exhibits for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, Stadia, and Magic the Gathering among others.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is seemingly a single point of contact at The Trade Group dealing with accessibility concerns, who must now personally call all potential attendees with accessibility needs. As such, fans believe their accessibility needs will not be met, that The Trade Group isn't taking concerns seriously, and the convention will not be safe to attend.</p>
<p>"The way that FanFest handled accessibility in 2023 was the worst accessibility experience I have had at a con, and their booth at PAX East 2024 wasn't much better," wrote Final Fantasy 14 player Sara Winters <a href="https://forum.square-enix.com/ffxiv/threads/524332-Accessibility-Missteps-Fanfest-2026">on the game's forum</a>, under the username divisionten. "However at PAX West 24 and then East 25, the booth took some wonderful and active strides to make its space accessible and friendly for all players. It was clear that SQUEX took the criticism of prior events to heart and actively improved.</p>
<p>"When there was an ADA marker in the sign-ups for FF 2026, that gave me hope that you all had learned the lessons of FF 23. However, the third-party company Square hired has been fumbling the bag repeatedly. There is one singular point of contact for accessibility at this third-party company, and [they're] under orders to call each person who requests ADA assistance."</p>

<p>Winters, who is a blind player of Final Fantasy 14 and an accessibility consultant, conducted their own survey of 1000 attendees of nerd conventions and found about 14 percent have accessibility needs. They also spoke on this issue with the head of panels at MAGfest and organisers of PAX. In the case of Fan Fest, 15,000 tickets were sold at the previous Las Vegas event - assuming a similar attendance in Anaheim, that's over 2,000 people that just one person is expected to personally call to discuss their needs. What's more, access to outside food and drink or a quiet room are seemingly considered accessibility needs in this instance, rather than general convention norms, meaning many attendees will not have their assumed needs met.</p><p>"It's very clear to me that this is not the fault of this individual employee, who was clearly assigned a task vastly outside [their] scope," wrote Winters in their forum thread. "But if you - SQUEX - actually want to follow through with your commitment to accessibility, then you need to hire actual accessibility consultants and do what they recommend."</p>
<p>Winters also shared their experience on BlueSky, adding: "Means testing doesn't work. You are making it harder for disabled people to access services they need, and the non-disabled who really want to game the system will do so anyway. You help nobody and harm the people who need assistance."</p>

</span></p><p>Winters confirmed to Eurogamer the consultant at The Trade Group has experience in special education, which appears to have been conflated with accessibility needs. "Special education is adjacent to accessibility - it's not the same thing," said Winters. What's more, a phone call itself is not accessible as a means of communication, especially for those who are deaf or have auditory impairments among other disabilities.</p>
<p>"They're functionally treating accessibility like an IEP [individual education plan], giving each individual a call with individual accommodations," said Winters. "That's just not enforceable, feasible, or usable."</p>
<p>Other players have shared their concerns on both the Final Fantasy 14 forum and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1p6cchi/na_fanfest_accessibility_issues/">reddit</a> in response to Winters' thread. One player didn't tick the ADA box when booking a ticket as the phone call "seemed like too involved of a process" for their accommodations. "I'd hoped that provisions would be available without me needing to jump through hoops before the event, but based on FanFest 2023 experiences and the vibe you're getting from jumping through said hoops, I'm now getting a little nervous," they wrote.</p><p>Another player noted at the last event their medical needs changed the day before attending, but the new phone call system wouldn't account for this. They added the system isn't the fault of the single consultant, but it "will inevitably fail disabled attendees and overwhelm the staff member responsible for them unless this is properly addressed and adjusted".</p>

<p>The Anaheim Convention Center itself does have a guide to accessibility on its <a href="https://visitanaheim.mediavalet.com/portals/ACC-Rates-Policies-Guidelines">website</a>. This includes such basic provisions as wheelchair access, elevators, and accessible seating, but notes individual events are responsible for contracting with ASL interpreters, for example. The convention centre has not responded to Eurogamer's request for comment.</p>
<p>This would suggest that basic accessibility needs will be provided at the convention, as is required by law. Yet beyond that, attendees are concerned their individual needs won't be met. As one forum poster wrote, "accessibility improvements are a boon for all".</p>
<p>"I cannot in any sort of good conscience waste my time and money to attend this con," surmised Winters on Bluesky. "'23 was an accessibility shitshow, and I won't spend a grand to be subjected to that again."</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted both Square Enix and The Trade Group for comment, but received no response.</p>
<p>The last expansion for Final Fantasy 14, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naoki-yoshida-on-dawntrail-criticism-community-feedback-and-the-future-of-final-fantasy-14">Dawntrail, was less well-received by players than previous expansions</a> and, anecdotally, player numbers have dropped since its release. As such, the next round of Fan Fest events are particularly important for Square Enix to ensure a strong future for its award-winning MMORPG, especially as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/world-of-warcraft-expansion-midnight-release-date">main rival World of Warcraft will receive a new expansion next year</a>.</p>

		<p>Embark Studio has pushed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/arc-raiders">ARC Raiders </a>update 1.4.0 live, this smaller update focussed on content and bug fixes after the last two updates.</p>
<p>There’s some fixed lighting, a gun exploit that allowed it to be fixed more quickly by swapping to and fro, and they’ve ended an exploit that allowed all locked rooms to be opened.</p>


<p>Here’s the full ARC Raiders update 1.4.0 patch notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Exploit mitigation mechanisms have been added for all locked rooms across all maps.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed the gun exploit that allowed you to shoot quicker than intended by swapping to a quick use item and back.<wbr></li>
<li>The exterior access to Spaceport’s Control Tower locked room has been blocked off.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed the issue that sometimes caused low resolution textures in the Main Menu.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed players being able to push each other by jumping on each other’s backs.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed lighting artifacts that would sometimes occur upon entering maps.<wbr></li>
<li>Raider Voice now correctly respects the selected voice option after restarting the game.<br>
<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p>Again, that’s much smaller than the last couple of updates, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/13/arc-raiders-update-1-2-0-is-called-north-line-adds-the-stella-montis-map/">1.2.0 adding the Stella Montis map</a> and a community challenge, while <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/20/arc-raiders-update-1-3-0-patch-notes-are-here-with-bug-fixes-and-balance-changes/">1.3.0 brought some balance tweaks</a> and had a more extensive set of bug fixes.</p>

<p>After a couple weeks as the hottest extraction shooter in town, we delivered our review of ARC Raiders a few days ago. Tuffcub said, “Arc Raiders reminds me of Destiny at launch; the core gameplay is excellent, and there’s a heartwarming sense of community, but there are many aspects that need refining and expanding. Managing your stash on consoles is a chore and there are not enough in-game events to spice up each run.”</p>

			<p>Toss a coin to your Witcher and have patience, because The Witcher 4 will not be appearing at <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-nominees-full-list/">The Game Awards 2025</a> next month. The highly anticipated RPG from CD Projekt RED will be skipping this year's awards and will presumably only show up on stage during the call-outs for the Most Anticipated Game award.</p>



<p>The news comes directly from the joint chief executive officer at CD Projekt RED, Michał Nowakowski, who posted a message on X (formerly Twitter) expressing his gratitude that The Witcher 4 was nominated for the category, while also making sure to keep players' expectations in check.</p>



<p>"<em>I’m very happy to see The Witcher 4 nominated in the Most Anticipated Game category at The Game Awards</em>," Nowakowski wrote. "<em>Thanks to everyone who has already voted - your support means a lot of to us. We won’t be bringing any new content to TGA this year, but we’re, as always, excited to watch the show and celebrate this amazing industry’s great night alongside all of you.</em>"</p>

<p>It's perhaps disappointing news for players who can't wait to get their hands on the next installment in CD Projekt RED's popular franchise, but it can't be too surprising. If you've been following The Witcher 4's production, then you'll have heard that CDPR confirmed <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-wont-launch-until-2027-says-cd-projekt-red/">back in March 2025 that the game will not be released until 2027</a>.</p>



<p>We all still have a whole year of waiting before we can expect to start seeing new trailers and eventually, a release date. Nowakowski even reaffirmed this during the Q&amp;A portion of <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-eclipses-35-million-copies-sold-cyberpunk-2077-sequel-scales-up/">CDPR's recent third-quarter financial report</a>. When asked about The Witcher 4, Nowakowski would not comment on the game's production, saying, "<em>The only thing we're commenting is that we're not launching in 2026</em>."</p>



<p>So, with this year's show off the table for The Witcher 4, anyone waiting to return to the world of The Witcher will have to turn their attention to The Game Awards 2026, since that's a strong candidate for when we'd see a significant trailer reveal.</p>



<p>As far as what will be at The Game Awards, we're starting to see select developers confirm their attendance and that they'll be bringing a new trailer. <a href="https://x.com/EXODUSGame/status/1993365313962889525">Exodus, for example, will be at the show with a new trailer reveal</a>.</p>

            <p>You! Stop trying to break in! Also, while you're at it, stop using quick use item swapping to shoot me faster than you'd otherwise be able to! All of that is yelled by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>' latest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-latest-update-nerfs-an-overperforming-pistol-rebalances-boom-damage-and-also-has-ducks">patch</a>, which sees devs Embark go after a number of pesky exploits and also make piggybacks much less effective.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As outlined in <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/patch-notes-1-4-0">Update 1.4.0</a>'s notes, a gun exploit which allows shotgunners to rapid fire faster than intended by swapping to a quick use item and back again to skip a reload animation is no more. Dubbed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/GFw3n2StWfA">double pumping</a>, the exploit was typically used when wielding Il Toro, which is of course a pump-action lead-slinger. Anyway, it's gone now. You can almost hear that one Call of Duty character who used to yell that switching guns is always faster than reloading shedding a single tear of joy, as the impetus to carry around 20 shotguns returns to Arc Raiders.</p>
<p>Beyond that, Embark are sick of folks getting into places they shouldn't be. Hence some burglar-proofing "exploit mitigation mechanisms" being added to every locked room on every map. All of 'em. Exterior access to the locked room in the Spaceport's Control Tower locked room has also been blocked off, so good luck getting in there now.</p>
<p>Rounding out the patch, embark have nixed some lighting glitches, rectified some low-res main menu textures, and made sure restarting the game won't mess up any voices. Oh, and you now can't push other players around by jumping on their backs. Given how key backpacks are to raider fashion, this probably isn't the game to be try to get a surprise ride on your mate in. Even if you're only trying to shift them out of the way of a door. They might have a bad back, and that's probably making their life in robo-ruled future Italy tough enough without your antics.</p>
