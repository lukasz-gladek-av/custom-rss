            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Launching a new video game has never felt more precarious. It doesn’t matter if it’s received prime placement in a major awards show, has journeyed through early access, or is a sequel to a genre-leading sensation, things can always go a bit off the rails. That’s what happened to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/rennsport">Rennsport</a>, a sim racer with a fair bit of promise as it went through public testing, but where changing plans and reality set in at launch.</p>
<p>Marco Ujhasi&nbsp;co-founder and co-CEO of Competition Company admitted that “Of course you want to to deliver great product, want to get applause everywhere, and so on, but I learned a very, very, very important lesson in motorsport and I’m very grateful that an experienced colleague told me that when I was thrown into that, and he said, “The most important thing is that you and your team judge the performance you did, and then you look at the officially visible result and the comments on it.” This helped me in racing and this was also something I said to the guys when we got the reviews. This is not a product which should be judged only on the race, but maybe in 10 or 15 years.”</p>



<p>So where did it go wrong? The game arrived at launch with two main problems: a low number of cars and tracks compared to rivals in relation to the price tag, and with some truly shonky AI drivers that barely knew how to get around corners.</p>
<p>“At a certain point, you have to release, and we said, ‘okay, the idea is game as a service, which means we [can] release.’ So that was a plan, but then we saw the opportunity with the console, and console not only means [meeting] the technical capabilities, but you cannot release on console without singleplayer.</p>

<p>“But this was a few months of development to have the championships in the current state, also with the AI, all of what we talked about today. So, yeah, at the end, now, I would say we were not ready. […] It was maybe a bit of a misjudgement about what was needed, and especially when you put a price tag on it which was too high for what you deliver. It’s minus and minus. This doesn’t work.”</p>
<p>The positive here is that Competition Company is in the place where they can keep on pushing ahead and build on the technical basis and driving model that they already have.</p>
<p>“A cross platform, online multiplayer game is the most complex thing you can do. And especially in racing, it is maybe even more complex because the other genres do not operate on such a demanding physics. So to be capable to develop that is premium for a team, and on top of that, enabling such close racing between all the platforms where we need to sync everything and so on? This is an achievement. This is nothing that you can sell, but this is technically so demanding and this is what we delivered, and this is the part where we can be proud.”</p>

<p>As has now been outlined, there’s a lot happening for Rennsport through 2026. The first step is a major price adjustment to bring value better in line with content – unrelated to this, the publishing partnership with Nacon that helped to bring the game to consoles has been terminated and it will now be self-published. March will see the first batch of paid DLC, free content and game updates, and this will be followed month-by-month with more.</p>
<p>“It’s not just about the content, but also giving more reason to play. If you play on your own, if you virtually or on demand race against others, if you have something with your friends or if you go into the into the online multiplayer, we offer you a path if you want to walk through and develop, but we also give you the choice to just jump in. This is one part and giving you a reason also means, okay, why should I spend time in there?</p>
<p>“So this is why we why we changed the system of the [single player] championships. You also saw that we will integrate some one make series for manufacturers, so there’s a purpose of racing on our service as well.</p>
<p>“Step by step, we will hopefully get enough interesting stuff, maybe also some funny stuff at a certain point. So, yeah, why should we be there? I guess it’s fun and serious at the same time.”</p>
<div id="attachment_469280"><p id="caption-attachment-469280">Placing obstacles or making A-to-B races could be the foundations for new gameplay mods.</p></div>
<p>Some of that fun stuff will come from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/26/interview-modding-is-coming-to-rennsport-but-how-will-it-work-with-consoles/">the plans to release modding tools</a>, starting with track modding through the second half of 2026 – see more about that here – but another key lynchpin to this will be the redeveloped AI. We’ve seen a number of different approaches to this over the years, with machine learning having been used by some titles, abstracted player avatars, even drivers with names and distinct personalities. I was curious about Rennsport’s new approach.</p>
<p>“So in general, in racing, and this is then also the baseline for the AI thinking, the ruleset is pretty clear. What is the ruleset? You have tyre limits, you have to operate within those track limits –&nbsp;more or less at least – and in between those track limits, there is an ideal line and something can force you to not be on the ideal line. So, in general, this is racing. And when you do one lap in that case or from A to B in the shortest possible time, you win.</p>
<p>“You can describe it more complicated, but at the end it is exactly like this. And what would a classical machine learning system do within that?</p>
<p>“For the principle functionality, you don’t need that because the pattern is clear, no pattern needs to be identified, nothing. Where it’s getting interesting, because this you can programme, […] is that we are really simulating driver inputs to stay within those boundaries. And this enables us then, like [Lead Gameplay Programmer Rikard Häggström] also described, over time to make that part more flexible, more human, or whatever the right description is.”</p>

<p>“With those variables in, I think we have a pretty good idea, also with my background. What are the variables? A human being is dealing with. So somebody is more good in this, more good in that, more skilled in this. So one is breaking later than the other, for example. So in those parameters, if you first of all, have them separated, that you can tune them separated.”</p>
<p>“And on top of that, when you have that separation, then a bit of the machine learning comes in because then you can observe what’s specific people are doing, and you can try to imitate that.”</p>
<p>It’s certainly an interesting for the specific AI approach to be discussed in this detail, and stronger AI will make for a much stronger single player experience. Of course, it’s obviously worth remembering that so much of Rennsport’s initial plan and expectations for the future will remain with the online multiplayer, paths it can provide to pro esports racing, and embracing the modding community. The next few months will be key to getting Rennsport back on track, but the ambition here and the long-term plans are exciting and optimistic for what’s possible.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>We are under a week away from the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a> on Switch 2 on <strong>5th March</strong>, but that hasn't stopped The Pokémon Company from revealing a <em>little</em> more info as a part of today's Presents showcase.</p>
<p>If you weren't already sold on the adorable vibes of Pokopia from everything we've seen so far, this brand-new trailer isn't going to change your mind. If, however, you were already on board, then we just know that you're going to love meeting DJ Rotom and Chef Dente — a culinary Greedent who wears a large pot on his head.</p>
<p>The stereo Rotom is your go-to aux guy for Pokopia and can swallow up any CDs you happen to stumble across to change your crafting soundtrack to whatever takes your fancy. We heard tunes like 'Pallet Town Theme', 'The Academy', 'Fortree City', and 'Road to Cerulean City' in the trailer, and all of those empty slots promise more to be collected, too.</p>
<p>Your Greedent pal is around to expand your cooking skills. Each Pokémon you come across has different tastes and favourites, so you'll want to learn as many recipes as possible to keep everyone happy.</p>
<p>The trailer also showcased a little more of the multiplayer content, highlighting how you'll be able to choose select Pokémon to journey to a friend's island and assist with their crafting. You can even play hide-and-seek with your pals by morphing into everyday objects and scattering around the island — oh gosh, we're going to spend <em>too much</em> time doing that.</p>
<p>There are just a few days to go before we all get our hands on this one, and yes, the new trailer has left us even more excited.</p>

The games will launch in 2027 and are exclusive for the Nintendo Switch 2. Nintendo also shared a trailer showcasing a new trio of starter pokémon — Browt, Pombon, and Gecua — and a number of different environments you’ll be able to explore as you play through the games.</p><p>In addition to establishing that <em>Wind </em>and <em>Waves</em> takes place in an island setting, the trailer really highlights how much more detailed and complex the games’ environments are compared to past titles like <em>Scarlet </em>/ <em>Violet </em>and <em>Legends: Z-A. </em>It seems like you’ll be able to explore dense jungles, caves full of magma, and beneath the ocean all while encountering wild pokémon. In a press release, <a href="https://press.pokemon.com/en/releases/Pokemon-Continues-30th-Celebrations-with-the-Unveiling-of-Pokemon-Wind">Nintendo</a> said that <em>Wind </em>and <em>Waves </em>will be open-world games, and the company also noted that Brazilian Portuguese will officially be supported as a selectable language.</p><p>2027 is still a ways out from now, but <em>Winds </em>and <em>Waves</em>’ definitely seems like it’s going to be worth the wait.

              <p>As is by now traditional, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-winds-waves-pikachu-underwater-2000674398">initial announcement of the existence of <em>Pokémon Winds</em> And <em>Waves</em></a> was accompanied by the reveal of the three new starter Pokémon that trainers will be able to choose from at the beginning of the game, and by extension the first three Pokémon revealed as part of Gen X. They are Browt, Pombon and Gecqua. Let’s meet ’em.</p> <h2>Browt</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000674445" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000674445"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000674445">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <p>First up is Browt, an owl-ish baby bird with big eyebrows. Just imagine the long nights spent trying to figure out that name. It’s the Grass-type starter, described as a Bean Chick Pokémon, and we already have its vital stats:</p> <p>Height: 1′ (0.3m)<br> Weight: 7.7lb (3.5KG)<br> Ability: Overgrow</p> <p>It does seem a bit odd that the game’s gone back to owls as a starter inspiration, given Rowlet was only three generations ago. Although this might be more bizarre design choice than actual species, given it’s described as a “chick.” Given the leaf-like brows on the beast, we can assume it’ll lean into those Bulbasaur-like planty attacks.</p>

 <h2>Pombon</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000674443" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000674443"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000674443">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <p>This fluffy pup is yet another dog-like pocket monster, although the first time one’s been a starter. It’s the Fire-type for the set, and classified as a Puppy Pokémon. Its stats are:</p> <p>Height: 1’4 (0.4m)<br> Weight: 14.8lb (4.3KG)<br> Ability: Blaze</p> <p>There’s not a lot more to discern about this little doggo, other than its obvious inspiration by a Pomeranian. It’ll be interesting to see if it stays cute as it grows, or if things head in a more wolf-like direction.</p>

 <h2>Gecqua</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000674444" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000674444"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000674444">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <p>Hardest to spell is Gecqua, who we can infer from the name alone is an aquatic gecko. Water-type, of course, and with its huge eyes my immediate favorite of the three, with the unimaginative category of Water Gecko Pokémon. Stats are:</p> <p>Height: 1′ (0.3m)<br> Weight: 9.5lb (4.3KG)<br> Ability: Torrent</p> <p>It was only Gen VIII that we last saw a reptilian starter, and a Water-type to boot, with Sobble. And given the visual similarity between the two, especially when you think about Sobble’s final form, Inteleon, it’s another oddly overlapping design. Still though, Gecqua is completely adorable and is already my pick.</p>

 <hr> <p>So, who stands out to you? Have you already fallen in love? Or are you just bemused that Game Freak couldn’t think of any other species to be inspired by for the new starters?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[All Pokémon Winds & Waves Starters—Every New Pokémon Gen 10 Starter, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-winds-and-waves-gen-10-starters/</link>
            <guid>1448626</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon Winds and Waves was revealed to the world during the Pokémon Day showcase on February 27, including the first look at the Gen 10 starters.</p>



<p>Releasing as a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> exclusive in 2027, Pokémon Winds and Waves is the tenth generation of the franchise and will bring a heap of new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> into the fray.</p>



<p>While there were no new wild Pokémon revealed in the trailer, a detailed look at the Gen 10 starters was shown, and Insider Gaming has all the details.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-are-the-pokemon-winds-amp-waves-starters">What Are The Pokémon Winds &amp; Waves Starters?</h2>



<h3 id="h-browt">Browt</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Angry bird. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>Browt is a small, angry-looking bird-type Pokémon that serves as the Grass starter in Winds and Waves, standing at a measly 0.3m tall and weighing 3.5kg. It is described as the ‘Bean Chick Pokémon’, with the Overgrow ability.</p>



<p>Bird-like starters are not a new concept for the Pokémon franchise, with Browt joining the likes of Torchic and Rowlet in the category.</p>



<h3 id="h-pombon">Pombon</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Bark. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>Pombon is a brown, dog-like Pokémon that resembles a pomeranian, though it’s mane has some lion similarities. Pombon is 0.4m tall and weighs 6.7kg. </p>



<p>Described as the “Puppy Pokémon,” Pombon has the Blaze ability, and joins a long list of dog-like Pokémon in the franchise’s history, including Growlithe and Arcanine, who are also Fire-type.</p>



<h3 id="h-gecqua">Gecqua</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Dive in. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>Gecqua is the Water-type starter in Pokémon Winds and Waves, standing at 0.3m tall and weighing 4.3kg. Described as the “Water Gecko Pokémon,” it has the Torrent ability.</p>



<p>Similarities will certainly be made with Treecko, another Gecko-like starter Pokémon from Ruby and Sapphire, but it’s a good choice to fit the environment of the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-evolved-forms-of-the-pokemon-wind-amp-waves-starters">Do We Know The Evolved Forms of The Pokémon Wind &amp; Waves Starters?</h2>



<p>No further details are known about the Pokémon Winds and Waves starters, including their evolved forms, and reveals could be hidden until the game releases in 2027.</p>



<p>While there is certainly more to be shown from Pokémon Winds and Waves ahead of release, Pokémon always keeps a tight lid on major reveals like the fully-evolved forms of the starter Pokémon.</p>



<p>Additionally, the mid-evolution lines for the Gen 10 starters are unlikely to be shown until release, and spoilers will be at a minimum as the game is Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive, meaning it can’t be datamined.</p>

            <p>Amazon has shared a first look at Ryan Hurst as Kratos in the God of War TV series it's making.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/PrimeVideo/status/2027398332482465882/photo/1">The picture, shared on X</a>, shows Hurst topless and leaning forwards while teaching his son Atreus, played by Callum Vinson, how to hunt. It's an image that echoes the opening parts of the God of War reboot, which was released in 2018.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-series-has-found-its-kratos-and-its-ragnaroks-thor">Ryan Hurst was named as Kratos</a> in January and is no stranger to the God of War series, having played Thor in God of War: Ragnarok - a performance that earned him a BAFTA nomination. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-series-atreus-actor">Callum Vinson was confirmed as Atreus</a> earlier this month.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>He looks quite young, Atreus, doesn't he? | <span>Image credit: <cite>Amazon</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>They'll be joined by actor Ed Skrein - known for portraying sellsword Daario Naharis in the Game of Thrones TV series - as Baldur, who confronts Kratos at the beginning of the God of War game. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-keeps-casting-characters-from-ragnarok-adds-severance-and-homeland-stars-as-odin-and-thor">Severance actor Ólafur Darri Ólafsson has been cast as Thor, and Homeland actor Mandy Patinkin as Odin</a>. Shogun's award-winning director <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/emmy-winning-shogun-director-joins-amazons-live-action-god-of-war-series">Frederik E.O. Toye will direct the first two episodes</a>.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the Amazon God of War series doesn't have a release window yet, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-tv-show-getting-second-season-though-first-still-being-written">a second series has already been greenlit</a>.</p>

		<p>You think Fire Red and Leaf Green are the only classic Pokémon games coming to Switch for the franchise 30th anniversary? Think again, as Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness is coming to Switch Online + Expansion Pack in March, only playable on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p><iframe title="Play Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness with Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack (Nintendo Switch 2)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vGo686s8jdw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>



<p>Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness was a successor to Genius Sonority’s first GameCube title, Pokémon Colosseum – strangely, this has been confirmed for Switch Online previously, and was the earlier title, but hasn’t been released yet – taking the setting of Orre from that game’s adventure mode and spinning out a new tale. New sightings of Shadow Pokémon around the region have you heading out with a Snag Machine to try and capture them and restore their hearts to normal. However, while on this mission for good, you’ll run into the crime syndicate responsible for the Shadow Pokémon.</p>
<p>While the game sold fairly well, it was the end of Genius Sonority’s story mode efforts. By the time of Pokémon Battle Revolution for the Nintendo Wii, the studio reverted purely to colosseum battles,</p>

<p>At last, we're getting another Pokémon game on Nintendo Switch Online! And it's the cult favourite RPG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/pokemon_xd_gale_of_darkness">Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness</a> on GameCube.</p>
<p>Coming to the GameCube Nintendo Classics library — meaning it's exclusive to the Switch 2 — in <strong>March 2026</strong>, XD: Gale of Darkness is the second of two RPG-style spin-offs that released on the purple box. Interestingly, it lands <em>before</em> its predecessor Pokémon Colosseum, which is also due to come to the service.</p>
<p>And just like Colosseum, XD: Gale of Darkness is all about catching Shadow Pokémon, with the main focus being Shadow Lugia.</p>

			<p>2026 marks 30 years of the <strong>Pokémon</strong> franchise, and today, <strong>February 27, 2026</strong>, is the 30th anniversary of the original Pokémon Red and Green games' release in Japan. Considering all of that, players had high expectations for today's <strong>Pokémon</strong> <strong>Presents</strong> event, which provided a slew of updates about everything that The Pokémon Company has in the works, across its mobile titles, Pokémon TCG, and, of course, its mainline <strong>Nintendo Switch</strong> and <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> games.</p>



<p>The reveal of the Generation 10 Pokémon games capped off the Pokémon Presents show, with the announcement of <strong>Pokémon Winds</strong> and <strong>Pokémon Waves</strong>, the next mainline installment in the Pokémon series. It's another open-world title, this time adding an underwater element to exploration, and will be the first mainline Pokémon games to be <strong>exclusive to the Nintendo Switch 2</strong>.</p>



<p>They won't be out until sometime in 2027, though if previous Pokémon releases are anything to go by, we can probably expect a Fall 2027 release window.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="First Look: Pokémon Winds and Pokémon Waves | Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/38XHXMdDegg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>We also got a look at the three new starter Pokémon players will choose in this new entry, which continue the tradition of being a Grass, Fire, and Water type. <strong>Browt</strong> is the new Grass-type starter, which looks like a small chick with leaves for eyebrows. <strong>Pombon</strong> is the new Fire-type starter, which by name and by design is clearly inspired by the Pomeranian breed of dogs. Last but certainly not least is <strong>Gecqua</strong>, the new Water-type starter that appears to be a gecko-inspired water Pokémon.</p>

<p>As for the game's setting, we still don't have a name for the new region, but it appears to be inspired by Southeast Asia. We'll know more when we get closer to its release, but at least for now, Pokémon Winds and Pokémon Waves appear to be the best-looking Pokémon games in the franchise yet.</p>



<p>Regarding the rest of the event, the other notable bits of news beyond a reveal of Gen10 included the reveal that <strong>Pokémon</strong> <strong>XD: Gale of Darkness</strong> will be the next game added to the library of Nintendo GameCube games in the Nintendo Classics library. It'll join the library in <strong>March 2026</strong>, though was not given a specific release date.</p>



<p>We also learned that <strong>Pokémon</strong> <strong>Champions</strong>, the Nintendo Switch/Switch 2 and mobile Pokémon battling title that was revealed at the last Pokémon Presents event in <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-presents-legends-z-a-story-trailer-pokemon-friends-pokemon-champions/">July 2025</a></strong>, will be arriving at some point in <strong>April 2026</strong>, though it was also not given a specific release date. The presentation also confirmed that players will be able to transfer Pokémon they've caught in Pokémon Fire Red and Pokémon Leaf Green into Pokémon Champions through Pokémon Home.</p>

<p>We also got a small reminder about Pokémon Pokopia, which arrives on <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-pokopia-release-date-march-2026-nintendo-switch-2-game-key-card/">Nintendo Switch 2 next week, on</a> <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-pokopia-release-date-march-2026-nintendo-switch-2-game-key-card/">March 5, 2026</a></strong>, and the reveal of a new kind of Mega Garchomp that is getting added to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pokemon-legends-z-a-urban-renewal/"><strong>Pokémon</strong> <strong>Legends Z-A</strong></a> as part of its <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension-dlc-release-date-december/">Mega Dimensions</a></strong> DLC, which launched this past December 2025.</p>



<p>And, of course, there were a few more bits of Pokémon merch to celebrate the 30th anniversary revealed as well. You can check out the entire presentation below.</p>

<p>Just in case you're curious, the next most popular <em>Resident Evil </em>installments (according to SteamDB) are <em>Village</em>, <em>Resident Evil 2</em>, and <em>Resident Evil 3</em>, and the latter two fell short of breaking 100,000 peak players by quite some distance.</p><p>It's worth noting that this figure isn't the same as sales, although based on <em>Requiem</em>'s staggering popularity, it's likely that Capcom is about to announce a pretty impressive sales figure for the game in its first few days.</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>, it's the latest mainline installment in the popular <em>Resident Evil </em>series of survival horror games. This one takes you back to Raccoon City, which you'll explore as both new protagonist Grace Ashcroft and returning hero Leon S. Kennedy.</p><p>As you can probably guess, Grace's gameplay segments are more geared towards the survival horror end of the <em>Resident Evil </em>spectrum, while Leon's tend more towards a <em>Resident Evil 4</em>-style action focus.</p>

                                                      </p><div>
              
              <p>Amazon has started production on its live-action <em>God of War</em> series and <a href="https://press.amazonmgmstudios.com/us/en/press-release/prime-video-debuts-firstlook-image-of-ryan-hurst-a">released the first production photo online</a>. The photo features Kratos, played by Ryan Hurst, standing behind Atreus, played by Callum Vinson. And uh…it looks like a pre-taped <em>SNL</em> skit.</p> <p>On February 27, Amazon MGM Studios put out a press release announcing that filming on the long-in-development <em>God of War</em> live-action series had officially begun in Culver City, California. The series is being led by Ronald D. Moore, who is not only the live-action adaptation’s showrunner but also an executive producer and writer on the series. <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-amazon-show-cast-kratos-atreus-mimir-actor-2000666932">The series features Mandy Patinkin as Odin</a>, Ed Skrein as Baldur, Max Parker as Heimdall, Ólafur Darri Ólafsson as Thor, Teresa Palmer as Sif, Alastair Duncan as Mimir, Jeff Gulka as Sindri, and Danny Woodburn as Brok.</p>

 <p>To help get people excited about the series going into full production, Amazon shared the first photo from the set, giving us our first look at Kratos and his son Atreus in live-action. And my first reaction upon seeing it was to go “Oh…no…”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Father and Son. Behold your first look at Kratos and Atreus in the God of War series now in production for <a href="https://twitter.com/PrimeVideo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@PrimeVideo</a>. Their journey to the highest peak begins. <a href="https://t.co/vOkD1SiJ3q">pic.twitter.com/vOkD1SiJ3q</a></p> <p>— Amazon MGM Studios (@AmazonMGMStudio) <a href="https://twitter.com/AmazonMGMStudio/status/2027398333401088067?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 27, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Kratos, in particular, looks rough in live-action. In a game, his design can be exaggerated, but here he’s just a dude who looks like he’s cosplaying as his favorite dad warrior. Something about how pristine he looks, coupled with his pose here, just has big “SNL host doing a pre-recorded studio bit that isn’t very funny” energy. I don’t know. Perhaps Kratos’ oddball design is just not going to translate well to live-action TV.</p>

 <p>Atreus, on the other hand, looks fine, if not a tad out of place, standing next to Kratos as he takes on a pose and expression that looks like me while scanning for leftovers in the fridge at 2 in the morning.</p> <p>Ronald D. Moore is a very talented writer and showrunner. And Amazon is no doubt throwing as much money as needed at this show in an effort to make it a success. So perhaps this first image is just a bad tease of what could be something that I end up enjoying as much as the <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-two-review-amazon-more-episodes-bethesda-new-vegas-2000665533"><em>Fallout </em>show.</a> But for now, based on this first image, I’m nervous about the final product. <em>God of War</em> on Amazon has already been picked up for a second season. No release date for season one has been given. It is expected to arrive in early 2027.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Today, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company announced the next mainline entries in the long-running catch-’em-all franchise: <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-winds-waves-pikachu-underwater-2000674398"><em>Pokémon Winds</em> and </a><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-winds-waves-pikachu-underwater-2000674398">Pokémon Waves</a>.</em> And for those hoping they’d be able to hold off on buying a Switch 2 for a bit longer, I’ve got bad news. The 10th generation of <em>Pokémon</em> games are ditching the original Switch.</p> <p>On February 27, perhaps to avoid some confusion, <a href="https://x.com/Pokemon/status/2027394547756548460">the official Pokémon account tweeted out</a> that the tropical-based <em>Waves</em> and <em>Winds</em> will only be playable on Switch 2 hardware when it launches in 2027.</p> <blockquote><p>“In <em>Pokémon Winds </em>and<em> Waves,</em> <strong>releasing exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2</strong>, you’ll travel across beautiful windswept islands and a vast ocean with glittering waves that ebb and flow. You’ll also team up with Pokémon to overcome challenges and even the forces of nature!”</p></blockquote> <p>As seen in the first trailer for the just-announced upcoming <em>Pokémon</em> games, <em>Winds</em> and <em>Waves</em> looks gorgeous, with higher-resolution textures and more detailed models than anything seen in the series before. That’s great, <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-switch-2-graphics-ugly-art-style-1851767088">as <em>Pokémon</em> games have started to show their age in recent years</a> due to Switch 1’s lack of power compared to most other consoles. Ditching that machine and focusing exclusively on Switch 2 has seemingly freed up developers at GameFreak in a big way. But that comes at a cost.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/02/nintendo-switch-hardware-sales-pass-150-million-with-ps2s-record-still-a-way-off">Nintendo has sold over 150 million original Switch consoles</a>. And now, anyone who owns an OG Switch and loves <em>Pokémon</em> but hasn’t upgraded to the new console might be left behind. Under the tweet confirming the news that the game is Switch 2 exclusive, you’ll find plenty of people cheering this decision. But sprinkled throughout the replies are people frustrated and sad that <em>Pokémon</em>&nbsp;<em>Winds </em>and<em> Waves</em> is leaving them behind. Anecdotally, when I told some people the new game was Switch 2 only, they looked crestfallen. Sure, people have until 2027 to save up cash to buy a Switch 2, but that’s not easy or feasible for everyone.</p> <p>Then again, the Switch 2 is going to let GameFreak build a&nbsp;<span>truly modern-looking&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em> game, and trying to get that to work on the old Switch would likely have been near-impossible</span>&nbsp;without big compromises. So, while I do feel for folks who are going to have to buy a new console to play the next entry in their favorite series, I think in the long term this was the right call, even though I’m a bit surprised, in a good way, that GameFreak and Nintendo were willing to ditch an install base of 150+ million consoles in the process.</p>

<p>Pokémon Go is going all-out in a special 30th anniversary event next month, bringing back “almost all” Pokémon that have ever appeared in the game.</p>



<p>Although details were not revealed for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/pokemon-go/" id="52102" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Go</a>‘s 10th anniversary, which takes place later this year, a 30th anniversary event next week brings back the majority of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> that have ever featured in the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-go-announces-30th-anniversary-all-out-event">Pokémon Go Announces 30th Anniversary: All Out Event</h2>



<p>Following a brief teaser during the Pokémon Presents showcase, Niantic revealed full details on the 30th Anniversary: All Out event, which takes place Saturday, March 7, to Sunday, March 8.</p>



<p>From 10am local time on the Saturday to 8pm local time on the Sunday, “almost all” Pokémon that have ever appeared in Pokémon Go will appear in specific biomes.</p>



<p>While this brings back a host of Pokémon into rotation, there are some exceptions. Mythical Pokémon, Ultra Beasts, and species of Pokémon not normally found in the wild will not feature.</p>



<p>Additionally, certain Pokémon will continue to only be available in certain regions or hatchable from eggs, and costumed Pokémon will not appear in the wild.</p>



<p>Finally, for Pokémon with multiple forms, not all forms will appear in the wild.</p>

<h2>Game Music Collection</h2><p>The stream kicked off with a <a href="https://gameinformer.com/pokemon-presents/2026/02/27/game-boy-shaped-pokemon-soundtrack-player-announced">Game Music Collection jukebox for Pokémon Red and Blue</a>, with 45 songs on 45 cartridges for the standalone music player. It basically looks like a HitClips for classic Pokémon music. Remember HitClips? Anyways, that's available starting on February 27 (today).</p><h2>Pokémon World Championships and XP 2026</h2><p>The Pokémon XP and World Championships are headed to San Francisco on August 28 through 30, and today The Pokémon Company confirmed all the activities happening there. It's not just competition and fighting for the crown; the Pokémon XP expo will host several different events and places for families and friends to hang out and celebrate Pokémon. Plus, we got some new artwork today, commemorating the event.</p>

<h2>Pokémon Trading Card Game</h2><p>We got a look at the "future" of Pokémon Trading Card Game with a set celebrating the series' 30th anniversary releasing sometime in 2026. The stream showed off everything from classic cards to Tag Teams and more, so look forward to that if you're a fan of cracking Pokémon packs.</p><p>Numerous Pokémon that have appeared in past Pokémon Go events will return, as part of the game's 10th anniversary alongside the series' 30th. (Can you believe it's been a decade since that blissful, wonderful Pokémon Go summer?) The anniversary event runs in early March, and Pokémon Go Tour: Kalos starts tomorrow on Saturday, February 28. Make sure to grab the promotion with promo code GOTOURKALOS, valid until Monday, March 2.</p><h2>Pokémon Masters EX</h2><p>Red (1996) &amp; Pikachu are out today, with two more Trainers joining soon too: Florian &amp; Ogerpon (Anniversary 2026) on February 28, and Juliana &amp; Terapagos (Anniversary 2026) on March 2. It's the 6.5 Year Celebration for Pokémon Masters EX (it's a real anniversary, I swear), and you can also pick up 3,000 gems for logging in sometime between now and March 31.</p>

<h2>Nintendo Switch Online</h2><p>Pokémon XD Gale of Darkness, a lesser-known spin-off, is finally coming to Nintendo Switch Online's GameCube selection in March 2026. Honestly, this is huge news for anyone who's wanted to see what this odd side game is about, but doesn't want to pay exorbitant sums for a physical GameCube copy.&nbsp;</p><h2>Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen</h2><p>As <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/02/20/pokemon-firered-and-leafgreen-are-coming-to-switch-switch-2-digitally-next-week">previously confirmed</a>, the Game Boy Advance remakes of Pokémon Gen 1 are coming to Nintendo Switch. They're out today, and feature Pokémon Home integration as part of their modern Switch release.</p><h2>Pokémon Champions Arrives In April</h2><p>The battle-focused Pokémon experience comes to Switch in April, with a mobile version expected to arrive later this year. This is a client focused solely on facing off against other trainers, as shown by the trailer today, but might be a pretty cool thing for the competitive Pokémon players out there.</p>

<h2>Pokémon Legends Z-A Gets More Mega</h2><p>The latest Pokémon Legends entry arrived last year with Z-A, and it's getting a fresh crop of content in 2026. Mega Garchomp Z will be available for owners of the Mega Dimension DLC for Pokémon Legends Z-A today. Interesting that it's tied to owning both the game and DLC, but the new Garchomp <em>does </em>look pretty cool.</p><h2>Pokémon Pokopia&nbsp;</h2><p>Pokopia is just days away now, but there's still some news to show off before the cozy Poké-life sim goes live. DJ Rotom is a special stereo-focused form of the techno-Pokémon, able to play CDs that the player-Ditto finds. We also got a look at a culinary master Greedent named Chef Dente, who might be my new favorite Pokémon ever. The stream also showed off the four-player multiplayer town visits and other facets of Pokémon Pokopia. The new building-and-living sim arrives on March 5 for Switch 2, and honestly looks delightful.</p>

<h2>Pokémon Winds and Waves</h2><p>The 10th generation of Pokémon has been confirmed as Pokémon Winds and Waves, in a yet-unnamed but seemingly tropical region. We got glimpses of many different biomes and the Pokémon that will inhabit them, as well as a resort-like structure and towns built on the water. Plus, our three new apparent starters: the little bird Browt, the fire puppy Pombon, and water amphibian Gecqua. Also, possibly a tease for diving and underwater activities? This generation of Pokémon will aim for a global release in 2027 on the Switch 2, and we'll likely learn more about it later.</p><hr><p><em><span>How did you feel about this year's Pokémon Day Pokémon Presents livestreams?

            <title><![CDATA[I Still Don't Understand The Stock Market After Playing Insider Trading]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/insider-trading-stock-market-balatro-roguelike/</link>
            <guid>1448524</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3166810/Insider_Trading/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><em>Insider Trading</em></a>, number must go up, but number must also go down. The roguelike deckbuilder, which was released earlier in February, is recognizable as inspired by <em>Balatro</em>—the wildly popular, wacky poker game that sold <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/in/podcast/deconstructor-of-fun/id1241195252?ref=aftermath.site"><u>at least 7 million copies</u></a> since its release in 2024. Like <em>Balatro</em>, <em>Insider Trading</em> is centered around a deck of ever-changing cards pulled from a buildable collection. Make a great deck, and you're more likely to get it to work in your favor. You're not making a poker hand in <em>Insider Trading</em>, though. You're working the stock market.&nbsp;</p><p>Each day, <em>Insider Trading</em> has you draw a new hand of cards. You can either buy stocks or skip a day—a decision you'll make after looking at your drawn cards. The cards all have different modifiers that impact the stock market prices, like bringing the price up by a few dollars. Some of the cards delete ones next to it. Others will decrease the share price by 10 percent, but only if it's in a certain slot.</p><p>You're doing this daily for a week, hoping to reach a target dollar amount. You earn tokens that let you buy pills (lol) and other perks that modify the cards and the ways they work together. You need the stock prices to go up, so you can make tons of money. But you also don't want to make the price go up <em>too</em> high, where you price yourself out of the market. You'll want to crash the market, at times, by selling all your stocks. Then you can buy more once the price is low.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image: Naiive</span></figcaption></figure><p>I started playing <em>Insider Trading</em> with the <em>Balatro</em> mindset, in which I wanted the stock prices to go as high as possible. But that's the wrong approach, which makes my brain itch. The strategy behind buying and selling is quite complicated with all these different cards and modifiers. I can't really say that I totally understand what's going on, but that's what makes <em>Insider Trading</em> a strange challenge for me. It doesn't feel good to watch the stock market prices go down, but it's key to getting the number to go up enough.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Insider Trading</em> doesn't have its hooks in me the same way <em>Balatro</em> does, because of the aforementioned confusion underlying everything I do, but I'm still finding it satisfying to play. That's partly due to the retro-inspired interface and its rhythmic soundtrack. The cards activate—a tactile, muffled click—alongside the beat of the music in a <em>very</em> satisfying way. It makes it easy to hit the trade button even when things could go very badly.I imagine this is exactly the interface that day traders on Wall Street are using to do whatever they do there.</p><p>It's a good time for <em>Balatro-</em>like games. <em>Insider Trading</em> is among a group of similar games—at least, with that <em>Balatro </em>feel—including <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3314790/CloverPit/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Clover Pit</u></em></a>, the roguelite slot machine game; <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3430340/Dice_A_Million/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Dice A Million</u></em></a>, the roguelike dice roller; <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3371170/CHARK/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Chark</u></em></a>, the chess roguelike; <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3140120/Wordatro/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Wordatro!</u></em></a>, the roguelike wordgame; and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3205380/Omelet_You_Cook/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Omelet You Cook</u></em></a>, the cooking roguelike. Anything can be a roguelike, it seems.</p><p><em>Insider Trading</em> has a demo available to play. Otherwise, it's $10.95 on Steam until next week. (It just came out on Feb. 18, so this is an offer tied to its release date.) I don't know much about insider trading, but <em>Insider Trading</em> is probably <a href="https://aftermath.site/kalshi-mrbeast-insider-trading/"><u>a lot more fun than real insider trading</u></a> which usually comes with jail time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Concluding their 30th anniversary Pokémon Presents stream, The Pokémon Company revealed the next generation of mainline Pokémon game: Pokémon Winds and Pokémon Waves. The traditional game duo will be coming exclusively to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> in 2027.</p>
<p><iframe title="First Look: Pokémon Winds and Pokémon Waves | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B15Ydgm6QtI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There’s a lot to unpick from the trailer, including the introduction of two new Pikachus, turning up like your parents coming back from a holiday to Barbados or something, decked out in holiday clothing. Their official names? Mr. Windychu and Ms. Wavychu. It then rolls into the boy and girl protagonists for the new adventure, the boy in a stetson and girl in a blue baseball cap as they set out into the lush and vibrant wilderness. The outfits you get will be determined by the version of the game you buy.</p>
<p>Here’s a little bit of blurb about the world:</p>
<p><em>Developed by GAME FREAK exclusively for Nintendo Switch 2, these new titles feature an open world to explore, with beautiful windswept islands and a vast ocean with glittering waves. The Pokémon that live in harmony with this region’s lush environment have developed their own unique ecosystems. During this adventure, you’ll team up with all kinds of Pokémon to overcome both the difficult road ahead and even the forces of nature that block your path at times.</em></p>

<p>One thing that really stands out from all of this is the weather and wave effects. It’s clearly very windy at times, blowing the clouds through the sky, while the rolling seas look incredible – not far off the wave effects seen in the likes of Sea of Thieves and Skull and Bones. There’s also the suggestion that we’ll be able to go underwater and check out the marine life below the surface.</p>
<p>The trailer introduces us to the three starter Pokémon for this new generation of game, in the traditional fire, grass and water types.</p>
<p>Meet Browt, the leafy owl-like Pokémon.</p>

<p>Pombon is a firey pomeranian-looking dog Pokémon</p>

<p>And Gecqua is… well, they’re a water gecko,</p>

<p>It will be a good long wait for this game to launch, likely targeting a holiday 2027 launch, which makes the Switch 2 exclusivity make much more sense. At least there’s plenty of other Pokémon games to keep you entertained until then. Marking the 30th anniversary, there’s a fresh Switch and Switch 2 release for the Game Boy Advance remakes of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/20/pokemon-fire-red-leaf-green-are-coming-to-the-switch-next-week/">Pokémon Fire Red and Leaf Green today</a>. There’s also the launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a> next week, for more of a cosy gaming aesthetic.</p>

<p>We don't have anything specific on the release date front at the moment, though TPC confirmed that the games will receive a "global simultaneous release" at some point in <strong>2027</strong>.</p>
<p>This was more than we expected for a first peek! Aside from some panning shots of the new region (complete with its fair share of water-y areas, naturally), the trailer also introduced the game's three starters: <strong>Browt</strong>, <strong>Pombon</strong>, and <strong>Gecqua</strong>.</p>
<p>There was also the tease of underwater exploration (hello, Gen III fans), and Pikachu in some rather swanky summer outfits — they are characters in their own right called Mr. Windychu and Ms. Wavychu (yes, really).</p>
<p>Here's a bit more info about the upcoming titles' region and differences from <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/uk/pokemon-news/see-the-new-trailer-for-pokemon-winds-and-pokemon-waves-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2">The Pokémon Company</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Developed by GAME FREAK exclusively for Nintendo Switch 2, these new titles feature an open world to explore, with beautiful windswept islands and a vast ocean with glittering waves. The Pokémon that live in harmony with this region’s lush environment have developed their own unique ecosystems. During this adventure, you’ll team up with all kinds of Pokémon to overcome both the difficult road ahead and even the forces of nature that block your path at times.</p>
<p>Your main character will sport a different outfit depending on which version of the game you play—and of course, you’ll set out with one of three first partner Pokémon. Will you choose a Grass type by partnering with Browt, the lively but clumsy Bean Chick Pokémon? Or perhaps you’ll heat things up with a Fire type by picking Pombon, the guileless and friendly Puppy Pokémon. If Water types are more your speed, then the intelligent Water Gecko Pokémon, Gecqua, might be the partner for you.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The best news, in our eyes, is that it actually appears to be running pretty well. Sure, the environments look a <em>little</em> sparse at the moment, but the promise of all those different biomes, the exclusive mention of a Switch 2 release (at the time of writing), and the fact that there's still another <em>year</em> of development time for Game Freak to tinker away leaves us cautiously optimistic.</p>

<p>The Pokémon Company has announced a mini Game Boy as part of its 30th anniversary Pokémon Presents, but it's not quite what you might have in mind.</p>
<p>The Game Boy Jukebox / Game Music Collection is a small music player themed after Nintendo's Game Boy into which you slot one of 45(!) mini Pokémon Red or Blue cartridges, which unlock one track each from the original 1996 games.</p>
<p>On the 'inside' face of the carts are pictures showing screenshots from the games corresponding to the track they play.</p>

<figure data-uuid="34f5e0e830eef"><a title="Pokémon Game Music Collection" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/34f5e0e830eef/pokemon-game-music-collection.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Shown off in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/watch-pokemon-presents-february-2026-live">Pokémon Presents</a> in a segment with original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/pokemon_red_and_blue">Pokémon Red &amp; Blue</a> composer Junichi Masuda, he said that they "took particular care to make the audio sound just like a Game Boy".</p>
<p>It's available from today (27th February 2026) from the Pokémon Center in North America and the UK, but not from the German, Australian or New Zealand branches. At the time of writing, <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/">the Pokémon Center website</a> has a message saying to "Check Back Later Today to Get the Game Boy Jukebox".</p>
<p>Here are a couple of pictures of the genuine article. As you can see, it has the product code GBG-01, a nod to the original Game Boy's DMG-01. We've asked if it has a headphone jack and were told that it doesn't.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.pokemon.co.jp/ex/gameboy_musiccollection/ja/">official Japanese website</a> for the device shows off that region's cart and box art for Pokémon Red and <del>Blue</del> Green and lists the price as 9,900 yen — approximately $64 / £47 — and it's being sold via a lottery in that region, with expected shipping coming in late March. It's explicitly shown off as a keychain adornment on the site, too, so it's clear that this is a novelty device and not something for chiptune audiophiles.</p>
<p>It is stated to run on 3 LR44 alkaline button cell batteries. Here are the device's dimensions courtesy of Google Translate, if you're interested in that sort of thing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Main Unit: W5.2 x H8.65 x D1.98 cm (2.2" x 3.6" x 0.6")<br>
Cartridge (45 cartridges): W3.3 x H3.7 x D0.5 cm (1.3" x 1.7" x 0.5"), approximately 5g per cartridge<br>
Collection Box: W19.3 x H19.5 x D7 cm (7.2" x 7.6" x 0.7")</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Interested in picking this up? We'll update this article with more information on the Western release as soon as we find out the details, including the price.</em></p>

<p>Over the course of the introductory trailer, we got to see not only a look at the world of <em>Pokemon Winds and Waves</em>, but also at some of the Pokemon that will appear in it, including Wailord, Tangela, and Sandygast, to name but a few.</p><p>We also got to see the new starter lineup, and Nintendo and Game Freak are sticking with the Fire-Grass-Water trio, as you'd probably expect.</p><p>On the Grass side, this gen's starter is monobrowed bird Browt. It's joined by the fiery Pomeranian Pombon and the giggling water gecko Gecqua. I'm placing bets right now on Pombon becoming bipedal when it evolves into its final form.</p><p>The trailer concludes with a dive underwater, where we see more Pokemon swimming freely around. It looks like you'll be able to dive and explore beneath the water's surface as part of the game.</p>
<p><em>Pokemon Winds and Waves </em>were revealed as part of the latest Pokemon Presents show, during which we also learned that <em>Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness </em>is coming to Switch Online in March, and that <em>Pokemon Champions </em>will arrive on Switch in April.</p><p>Nintendo also showed off the Switch versions of <em>Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-firered-leafgreen-switch" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="057d121c-d519-4dfa-af54-03ce59fa9f52" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">which are out today</a>. <em>Pokemon Home </em>compatibility is coming to both games at some point in the future.</p><p><em>Pokemon Winds and Waves </em>arrive exclusively for Switch 2 in 2027.
