		<p>10 Chambers know how to make a multiplayer shooter. The team, built from the ground up by Ulf Anderson, Simon Viklund and Anders Bodbacka, spawned from the Payday 1 and Payday 2 team, with their opening studio salvo being the bloody and tough GTFO. If that was the game they ‘had’ to make, Den of Wolves is the game they ‘need’ to make. From our early hands-on session, this is the culmination of everything they’ve previously built, but they’re exploring the genre in some unexpected and intriguing ways.</p>
<p><iframe title="Den of Wolves - Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RlKiBVO1GLE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Den of Wolves is a techno-thriller, a multiplayer heist, and an Inception-like journey into the human mind. Fundamentally, this is Payday and GTFO by way of Deus Ex, set in 2097 in a future where corporations have built their own superstate in the middle of the Atlantic Sea.</p>


<p>Den of Wolves is set in Midway City. The island of Midway began life as one of Pan-Am Airways’ refuelling spots on its way to cracking travel between the US and Asia, before it became a crucial base for America during World War 2, but in this future, a giant cityscape has overwhelmed the island, spilling into the sea and thrusting into the clouds.</p>
<p>This evocative setting, one that ties the East and the West, plays host to the Corporations. The team describe it as a high-tech Venice, with a stock exchange that sits at the centre of global trade. All Corporations have a presence there, and the island is split into five distinct districts, each controlled by a different company.</p>

<p>Within this setting, cybercrime and industrial espionage are rife. You work for the Corporations, taking jobs from the highest bidder, and in Midway City, loyalty is bought rather than earned. You’re not, as you may have guessed, the hero of this piece; you’re a criminal mastermind, putting together a crew that’s capable of shooting, looting and hacking their way to success.</p>

<p>Each heist is built upon a series of smaller jobs, culminating in the central mission. The prep jobs might see you building up your tech or collecting information, but each acquisition affects how the final act plays out. For our playthrough, we got to play a single prep mission, and the team describe these as being ‘bitesized’ experiences, which will fit into a lunchbreak and let you move forward with the game even when you’re short of time.</p>
<p>Our team of four blasted through this vault theft in just under ten minutes – the fact that we were grouped up with Vlad and Calle of 10 Chambers might have helped us out a bit – but you can opt to extend these prep missions by heading back into the area to try and grab more loot.</p>
<p>There’s serious risk to balance against the reward though, and Vlad and Calle told us that the difficulty seriously ramps up the longer you stick it out, making the chances of success much slimmer. It’s a tantalising challenge, and the ghost of GTFO’s hardcore difficulty level satisfyingly rears its head here. The main run through both the prep and the final mission felt tough but fair, and we had to communicate and work as a team, balancing gunplay while breaking into vaults, reviving fallen comrades or throwing up defensive shields and turrets.</p>

<p>So far, you might be thinking that this is Payday in the future, and while it’s undeniably built on the same foundations, Den of Wolves has a digital ace up its cybernetic sleeve: The Dive. You are one of the few people capable of The Dive, which is an ability to hack neural networks in a way that AI can’t. In gameplay terms, they’ve crossed Inception with Cyberpunk.</p>
<p>The Dive can, fundamentally, be whatever 10 Chambers want it to be. These sections of a heist are separate in terms of their structure, and the way they play is notably distinct from the bombastic gunplay of the central heist. In our playthrough, The Dive saw our team leaping through the mind of a prisoner, jumping between floating platforms as gravity tilted and turned the landscape in disconcerting ways. It was set against a timer as well, where failing to make a jump and the inevitable drop into the abyss was a devastating blow to our team. Thankfully, only one player needs to make it to the end to succeed.</p>
<p>What’s exciting, for both players and the team at 10 Chambers, is that the possibilities here are nearly infinite. Simon spoke animatedly about the idea, saying, “The only thing where it limits us it it needs to be a first-person experience. It’s not going to be a Match-3 or an RTS or a side scroller, but you could be running through a maze hunted by a monster. Right now we’re working on a forest setting where there’s a creature tracking you. We can lean into military simulation or it can be a Japanese temple where you’re fighting ninjas, and what’s interesting is that it’s not just providing variation for the players, but for us developers as well”.</p>

<p>This idea is Den of Wolves’ golden bullet. The freedom and creativity that it allows is unprecedented, and the fact that in the midst of a heist you could suddenly be free-running across city rooftops like Mirrors Edge or battling demons in the ruins of a castle. I wasn’t the first to suggest that we might see a GTFO-like Dive, and the team seemed open to that possibility. Hell, they’re open to all possibilities.</p>
<p>Beyond the heists, the guns and the masks, it’s clear that 10 Chambers want Den of Wolves to be a truly global force. The team have already started on this path, releasing deep dive videos into different aspects of the game’s development, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNroOU2W1C4">motion capture</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpcCbA7jrE0">music</a>, and releasing a music video for Viklund’s stellar <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oli2M8Z1EU">Inject</a>.</p>
<p>The iconography, the visual design and the ethos all speak to a team that are creating a brand as much as they’re designing a game. In the modern development sphere, it’s a canny approach, and much like League of Legends, Den of Wolves’s rich, tangible sci-fi world has the potential to capture fans beyond the game’s frantic robberies.</p>
<p>The music is an integral part of that, and Simon, who was the composer for Payday 1, Payday 2 and GTFO, relished the opportunity to craft something fitting for the game’s futuristic settings. He told us, “In part, it’s the arbitrary choice of wanting to do something different, to challenge myself, while at the same time staying in the wider genre of EDM. I chose to go for something slower and heavier, like an unstoppable force type of energy.” He continued, “Hip-hop and rap music has a little bit of that, with the super deep 808 bass sounds and the slower tempo, and I felt that was a good fit – at least for the parts of the mission where everything is going to plan!”</p>

<p>When things go wrong, the audio tempo ticks up, reflecting the sudden overwhelming enemies that are homing in on your position. As your heart rate ramps up, and your teammates start shouting for support, Simon’s tracks take on a completely different tone.</p>
<p>Eye’s glinting, Simon says, “The music here still has the gritty texture and the electronics, but it’s more high-octane. It’s adrenaline-pumping music. I’ve sectioned off a certain part of EDM where I feel I can move around, and we can cover the emotions that we want the players to feel.” From first-hand experience, it definitely works.</p>
<p>Den of Wolves is another statement piece from 10 Chambers, and perhaps more clearly than ever, this is a game that’s about grasping the anonymity of the teams’ signature masks. Where the Payday games gave you the chance to be the villain, Den of Wolves explores some of the darkness that lurks at the edges of everyone’s psyche.</p>
<p>Simon describes this as ‘moral escapism’, the idea that beyond the mechanical freedom of firing a gun in a military shooter, here players can do something wholly illegal, become someone wholly different. It’s less Ocean’s 11, more neo-noir techno thriller , a dark undercurrent running through its narrative threads. Wherever your conscience sits on this moral scale, Den of Wolves brings a new sense of catharsis and freedom to the multiplayer space.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/april-fools-day-2025-gaming-roundup<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's April Fools' Day once again, and you know what that means: time to take literally everything you read on the internet today with a pinch of salt.</p>

<p>Of course, that doesn't necessarily include this article; we're gathering up everything we see that looks like an April Fools' joke to us, but there's every chance we're wrong and some of these announcements are legit. In any case, here's our roundup of this year's April Fools' shenanigans!</p>

<hr><h2>Level-5 invites you to cross "New Horizons"</h2>




<p>Level-5's April Fools' joke this year involves a trailer that will look very familiar to you if you were glued to a certain Nintendo game during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. It's intended to promote the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-release-date" rel="nofollow">impending release</a> of RPG sequel&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</em>.</p>

<h2><em>PUBG</em>&nbsp;gets romantic</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pubg-dating-sim-april-fools-day-2025.jpg?itok=qXtIPUXS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pubg-dating-sim-april-fools-day-2025.jpg?itok=JtFweEi4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Have you ever wanted to date your&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>weapons? Well, now you can.</figcaption></figure><p>Krafton is celebrating April Fools' Day in&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds&nbsp;</em>in the form of <a href="https://pubg.com/en/events/wwrdevent" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"Winner Winner Romantic Dinner"</a>, a dating sim that lets you romance, uh, your weapons. This one's been created with the help of gen AI, which is a bit yucky if you ask me.</p>

<h2><em>War Thunder&nbsp;</em>adds infantry into the mix</h2>




<p>This is one of those announcements where I'm not sure whether it's an April Fools' joke or not, but in any case, Gaijin has announced that <a href="https://warthunder.com/en/news/9447/current" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ground troops</a> are on their way to vehicular combat game&nbsp;<em>War Thunder</em>. Judging by the comments, this one might do well if it wasn't a gag.</p>

<h2><em>Sonic Racing: CrossWords&nbsp;</em>wants to have some words with you</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sonic-racing-crosswords-april-fools-day-2025.jpg?itok=S1Sx2Z8p 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sonic-racing-crosswords-april-fools-day-2025.jpg?itok=X8RKD4KE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This game is extremely real. Honest.</figcaption></figure><p>You've heard of&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</em>, but <a href="https://www.sonicracingcrosswords.com/special/crosswords" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">what about&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing: CrossWords</em></a>? A "demo" for the game is available now, and it challenges you to, uh, solve a word puzzle as fast as you can. I see what you did there, Sega.</p>

<h2><em>Party Animals&nbsp;</em>is calling your bluff</h2>




<p>A brand new board game mode has been added to party game&nbsp;<em>Party Animals&nbsp;</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1260320/view/498317142563751751" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">in the form of "Bluffalo Club"</a>, in which you must take turns saying ridiculous things and hoping your friends fall for them. There's more in the update besides the new game, too.</p>

<h2><em>My Time at Sandrock&nbsp;</em>wants you to sign a binding marriage contract</h2>

<p>Are you intending on marrying one of&nbsp;<em>My Time at Sandrock</em>'s handsome and beautiful NPCs? If so, then you'll want to sign this extensive and extremely legally binding <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1084600/view/514079741259548841" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">marriage contract</a>, which asks that you jump through all kinds of hoops in order to prove your love is enduring.</p>

<h2><em>Palworld</em>'s dating sim surely can't be real, right?</h2>




<p>I'm including this one mainly for posterity, but it's also worth mentioning the&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>dating sim that was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-dating-sim-announced-again" rel="nofollow">once again announced yesterday</a>. There's...just no way&nbsp;<em>Palworld: More than Just Pals&nbsp;</em>can be real...is there?</p>

<h2><em>Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing&nbsp;</em>is making a triumphant return</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/big-rigs-over-the-road-racing-april-fools-day-2025.jpg?itok=Zw7uyVVL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/big-rigs-over-the-road-racing-april-fools-day-2025.jpg?itok=-0Zwutc1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Are you ready to very decidedly not race?</figcaption></figure><p>Notorious terrible, horrible, very bad, not good video game&nbsp;<em>Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing&nbsp;</em>is coming to Steam, apparently. Again, I can't tell if this one's serious or not, but hey, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3598130/Big_Rigs_Over_the_Road_Racing/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">you can wishlist it here</a> if you want to find out.</p>

<h2><em>Dave the Diver: Remastered&nbsp;</em>is bringing realistic visuals to Mintrocket's pixel art extravaganza</h2>




<p><em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em>is probably one of the most diverse and minigame-stuffed games of all time, but wouldn't it be better if it looked a little more...realistic? Well, Mintrocket clearly thinks so if this&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver: Remastered&nbsp;</em>trailer is anything to go by. You'll only have to wait until 2049 to play it as well!</p>

<h2>THQ Nordic reveals&nbsp;<em>ArcAInia - The Fall of Sans Serif</em></h2>

<p>In the world of THQ Nordic's&nbsp;<em>ArcAInia - The Fall of Sans Serif</em>, "typography and magic are one", and you must destroy the corrupt sans serif fonts, who have allowed their power to go to their heads. This game is absolutely real and is absolutely launching in 2026. Cough, cough.</p>

<h2><em>Goddess of Victory: Nikke&nbsp;</em>is getting a feature film</h2>




<p>Jiggly mobile RPG&nbsp;<em>Goddess of Victory: Nikke&nbsp;</em>is apparently getting itself a feature film, complete with epic mecha battles and plenty of waifu-style characters. Whether or not this is all a huge, elaborate April Fools' Day prank remains to be seen (hint: it is).</p>

<h2><em>The Talos Principle Reawakened&nbsp;</em>has tons of features so you don't need to think anymore</h2>




<p>Are modern puzzle games too difficult for your brain? Do you wish they made you...well...think a little less? Croteam and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/talos-principle-reawakened-release-date" rel="nofollow">The Talos Principle Reawakened</a>&nbsp;</em>have you covered with a suite of hilarious features designed to stop your brain from needing to activate even once.</p>

<h2><em>Valorant&nbsp;</em>is, erm, throwing shade at&nbsp;<em>Smite</em>?</h2>

<p>I'll readily admit I don't get this one; I don't think there's any shame in that. Riot Games' FPS&nbsp;<em>Valorant&nbsp;</em>is apparently either teaming up with, throwing shade at, or affectionately ribbing&nbsp;<em>Smite</em>&nbsp;in <a href="https://x.com/VALORANT/status/1907062942022910313" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">this strange video message</a> posted on the game's official X account.</p>

Every year, the fruit flies and mosquitoes return to my kitchen, drawn to the illicit aroma of unlidded pasta sauce and the rank embroidery of carbonised toast around my cooker. Every year, I attempt to remove them non-violently by building intricate traps out of vinegar bottles, or performing slow-motion kung fu punches with a jug.</p>
<p>My inability to keep the winged hoodlums at bay has alienated me from my so-called friends, but on the plus side, it has also equipped me to play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-mosquito-gang">The Mosquito Gang</a>, an asymmetrical multiplayer affair in which one, regular-sized human player attempts to carry out various domestic tasks while four, tiny mosquito players attempt to suck their blood.

The Mosquito Gang is my favourite usage of the term "extraction" game in a while. As one of the mosq, you must obviously try to land on the human player without attracting their attention. Any mammalian essence extracted in that time can be spent at a blood bank to unlock random new abilities and modifiers. The blood bank mechanic is not a faithful representation of mosquito feeding habits, but does create a useful interval between extracting blood and profiting from it.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what the abilities are, exactly, but one of the screenshots shows a mosquito driving a toy car. The mosquitoes also appear to get side objectives, like unplugging fumigators and turning on a music player. Again, I must sternly object that this is not typical mosquito behaviour. A mosquito does not have the muscle power to operate a steering wheel. You'd need to be a horse fly or larger.
</p>
<p>
The human player, meanwhile, has to carry out chores that range from the ordinary - taking out the trash, preparing a meal - to the Madly Scientific - operating a DNA scanner, mixing a cocktail for a robot. You earn cash for completing jobs, which can be spent on useful implements such as bug swatters. There doesn't appear to be a pacifist mode, but I would love the option to trap the mosq in a jar and stand next to it for 20 minutes doing the floss. As for mosq objectives, perhaps they could add one where you maintain a just-audible presence near the ceiling, then suddenly whine right by the human's ear as they're falling asleep. Always a hit round these parts.
</p>
<p>
I'm a fan of Big vs Little in multiplayer games, and while this doesn't seem quite as high octane as, say, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/evolve">Evolve</a> or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a>, I can imagine it being a holler. Perhaps it'll teach me the real trick to staving off the annual kitchen invasion. People have suggested doing the washing-up more often but that feels pretty extreme, very much a last resort. The Mosquito Gang is slated to launch sometime this year. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2811100/The_Mosquito_Gang/">Read more on Steam</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-invictus-an-arcade-multiplayer-game-rumored-to-launch-this-year/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to insider Tom Henderson, Assassin's Creed Invictus could launch in 2025. The leaker <a href="https://x.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1906783248232923469" target="_blank" rel="noopener">answered</a> a question on X about the upcoming spin-off game, saying that Ubisoft should release it this year.</p>
<p>The publisher only acknowledged its existence with a brief sentence <a href="https://staticctf.akamaized.net/8aefmxkxpxwl/RQdGp9fytJeMffReMQpN3/fc14fdc4ed35de3550e1c94e250893a9/Ubisoft_FY23_H1_Earnings_PR_English_Final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in October 2022's financial report</a> that followed the 15th anniversary of the franchise and its updated roadmap:</p>
<p><em>Additionally, a team, including For Honor veterans, is currently working on bringing back multiplayer to Assassin’s Creed with a standalone experience through Infinity under the project codename Invictus.</em></p>
<p>The only information we have on Assassin's Creed Invictus comes from leaks via <a href="https://x.com/xj0nathan/status/1837577668365373935" target="_blank" rel="noopener">xJ0nathan</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-invictus-will-be-a-fall-guys-like-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insider Gaming</a>. Both confirmed that it's a multiplayer game with an arcade feel inspired by Fall Guys and Smash Bros. Players would compete in multiple rounds across various multiplayer modes, such as team deathmatch, free-for-all, and some sort of speedrunning competition. There are also reportedly powers that characters can use to get a boost. The camera is said to be further away from the player character, while maps and characters from previous games like Ezio and Cesare Borgia will make an appearance in Assassin's Creed Invictus.</p>
<p>Needless to say, it'll be an unusual experience, and it remains to be seen whether it'll be successful. Still, 2025 kicked off on the right note for Ubisoft with the strong launch of Assassin's Creed Shadows, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-has-surpassed-3-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> more than three million units in the first week, the second-best debut in the whole franchise after Valhalla (though that game launched during the pandemic and therefore had its sales boosted by the contingency).</p>
<p>There could be even more Assassin's Creed coming relatively soon, with the remake of the beloved fourth chapter (Black Flag) <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-is-reportedly-closer-than-we-thought/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored</a> to be targeting a 2026 release. It was actually originally scheduled for November 2025, but that was before the delay of Assassin's Creed Shadows. There was also a rumor about the latter game <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-is-reportedly-getting-a-co-op-mode-post-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">getting a co-op multiplayer mode post-launch</a>, by the way. There won't be any shortage of adventures in the franchise, that's for sure, especially following the creation of a new subsidiary <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-forms-new-subsidiary-based-on-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-and-franchises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">solely dedicated to the expansion of Ubisoft's biggest franchises</a> (Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six).</p>

            <p>The Last of Us showrunner Craig Mazin has addressed those criticising Bella Ramsey for not looking older as Ellie in the show's upcoming second season.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/the-last-of-us-season-2-craig-mazin-interview-1236169252/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Mazin said he understands "the difficulty that some people have where they say, 'She looked like she was 14 in season one. She still looks roughly the same to us, even though now she's 19'."</p>
<p>Mazin added he appreciates Ellie in The Last of Us Part 2 does look "much older" than she did in the first game. However, when it comes to the show, he isn't "interested in the physical aspect" of Ellie's appearance.</p>

</figure>
<p>"Some people do change quite dramatically and some people don't," Mazin said. "I've been looking at Bella's face for years while editing, and I can see that she's certainly grown. I'm interested in the emotional maturity, and the change in personality."</p>
<p>The Last of Us showrunner added he has "watched Bella grow and become independent and start to find her own two feet separate and apart from her parents", stating it's also about "how do I figure out how to be my own person now and test that full independence?"</p>
<p>This is something he "[feels in] Ellie completely" when it comes to Ramsey's portrayal of the character.</p>
<p>"So, I understand where people are coming from, but when they watch this year, I think they're going to see the difference," Mazin closed.</p>

            <p>Dungeons &amp; Dragons company Wizards Of The Coast have apologised for "mistakenly" sending a legal takedown to the creator of a free <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> mod that adds a village inspired by and featuring characters from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a>. The mod has attracted praise from Larian CEO Swen Vincke, who was naturally a bit piqued when it was taken offline.</p>
<p>Published on Nexus Mods on 16th March, the Baldur's Village mod in question was taken offline days later and placed "under moderation review". <a href="https://forums.nexusmods.com/topic/13511816-dmca-request-issued-by-wizards-of-the-coast-llc/">According</a> to a Nexus Mods staff member, legal firm Reynolds Law PLLC sent a claim of copyright infringement on behalf of Wizards on 27th March.</p>
<p>The mod has now <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/30888">been restored</a>, following a player backlash, so go ahead and marry pixelart Astarion as you please. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/wizards-of-the-coast-scores-pr-masterstroke-bullies-bg3-stardew-mod-that-had-swen-vinckes-personal-approval-off-the-internet-with-a-dmca/">PCGamer</a> also have a statement from Wizards, who claim the strike was one big whoopsie.</p>
<p>"The Baldur's Village DMCA takedown was issued mistakenly - we are sorry about that," it reads. "We are in the process of fixing that now so fans and the Stardew community can continue to enjoy this great mod!"</p>
<p>It's possible this has something to do with Vincke's intervention yesterday. In a predictably popular post on the Muskvine, he <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1906765058270540219">wrote</a>: "free quality fan mods highlighting your characters in other game genres are proof your work resonates and a unique form of word of mouth. Imho they shouldn't be treated like commercial ventures that infringe on your property.</p>
<p>"Protecting your [intellectual property] can be tricky but I do hope this gets settled," Vincke continued. "There are good ways of dealing with this."</p>
<p>For context, Larian have <a href="https://larian.com/fan-content-policy">said</a> in their fan content policy that they're fine with people making mods based on their games, as long as they give them away for free, don't pass them off as Larian's own work, and don't do anything "inappropriate, offensive, damaging, or disparaging". Larian are not, however, the legal custodians of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons world in which <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> takes place.</p>
<p>The Baldur's Village mod is informally set after the Larian RPG's ending, so beware spoilers if you're planning to install. Again, it's free, though the modders do run a Patreon. Given enough interest and crowdfunding, they hope to flesh out their chunk of the Forgotten Realms with further BG3 callbacks.</p>
<p>"Our next focus will be creating Halsin's romance storyline," the Nexusmod page FAQ explains. "Once completed, we will shift our attention to expanding the mod's world-building, background stories, and gameplay by introducing new features and items."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>To celebrate the 25th anniversary of Final Fantasy 9, Square Enix has launched a special website dedicated to the title. But all this has done is spark gossip and speculation that a Final Fantasy 9 remake is on the way and close to being announced.</p>



<p>Needless to say, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-single-player-record-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> project has been a hit. It’s won awards, both games have sold millions of copies, and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-developers-have-already-written-part-3s-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">third and final chapter of the trilogy</a> is sure to round things off in style. But while the FF7 remake talk has been constant, the chatter about a Final Fantasy 9 remake has been just as loud and fervent.</p>



<p>The ninth mainline game is considered as important as any to many in the FF community. So when Square Enix suddenly drops a new FF9 website, eyebrows are raised, and questions are sure to be asked.</p>

<p>A new official <a href="https://jp.finalfantasy.com/ffix25th" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy 9 website</a> celebrating the JRPG’s 25th anniversary launched in March 2025. It pays homage to the game and gives fans worldwide the chance to buy exclusive merchandise, learn about the title, and see what Square Enix has planned.</p>



<p>Nothing else has been confirmed for now. However, it’s been reported that <strong>a Final Fantasy 9 Remake has been in the works</strong>—although it may not involve <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-14-director-denies-ff9-remake-involvement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 14 director Naoki Yoshida</a>. The development of the title has reportedly happened alongside the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-will-release-on-a-wide-range-of-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FF7 Remake Part 3</a>.</p>



<p>A new website and all this commotion and celebration for Final Fantasy 9 likely doesn’t stop here. With the annual Summer of blockbuster gaming announcements upcoming, all signs are pointing toward the inevitable Final Fantasy 9 Remake confirmation.</p>

The latest is Patch 5, which brings the drug dealer sim up to version 0.3.3f14.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Patch 5 makes a number of important improvements to the game, of most interest to its many players is the developer’s note that Schedule I’s first content update is set to launch this weekend.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-top-selling-game-on-steam-right-now-is-schedule-i-an-indie-drug-dealer-simulator-with-more-players-than-monster-hunter-wilds-gta-5-and-marvel-rivals">Schedule I is currently the top-selling game on Steam</a>, with more players than big hitters such as Monster Hunter Wilds, GTA 5, and Marvel Rivals after going viral across social media, Twitch, and YouTube. In the game you go from being a small-time dope pusher to kingpin, manufacturing and distributing a range of drugs throughout the grungy city of Hyland Point. You can expand your empire with properties, businesses, employees, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s developed and published by TVGS, aka Australian indie developer Tyler, who has called Schedule I’s explosive launch “amazing but pretty overwhelming.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I never expected this kind of response!"

</li><li>Owned vehicles are now visible on the map app.
</li><li>Implemented a few validity checks/failsafes for NPC pathfinding and warping. I think this was one of the primary causes of crashing on certain chipsets (thanks to Chi Chi on Discord for bringing this to my attention).
</li><li>Refactored employee item movement behaviour to be a bit smarter.
</li><li>Implemented NPC effects culling at a certain distance to improve performance.

<strong>Bug fixes</strong>
</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fixed non-host clients sometimes not being able to hit/stand in blackjack.

</li><li>Fixed the dealer sometimes preemptively revealing its hand to non-host players in blackjack.
</li><li>Fixed first-person jacket looking janky.
</li><li>Fixed 'Master Chef' achievement being rewarded prematurely.
</li><li>Fixed some property null references that were causing multiplayer loading/desync issues.
</li><li>The drying rack 'dry' button is now non-interactable if the input slot is reserved by an employee.

			<p>A Sonic Adventure 2 Unreal Engine 5 remake is in the works, and a new playable demo is now available for download to allow users to experience for themselves the stunning recreation of some classic stages.</p>
<p>The demo, which can be downloaded <a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/SA2R/939490">here</a>, features the modern recreation of Radical Highway, White Jungle, and Green Forest, among other levels and boss fight updates. The demo, much like the yet-to-be-released full remake, is powered by the Azure Framework, a branch of Velocity+ that overhauls the physics, camera, controls, and UI to offer a brand-new experience that still sports some classic mechanics, such as a high-speed platforming experience and the return of the scoring system which rewards players to chain moves together to keep a perfect score and score more points. Visuals have also been significantly improved over the original, featuring real-time path-traced lighting and reflections.</p>

<p>Following the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-gamescom-hands-on-preview-shadow-frontiers/">Sonic x Shadow Generations</a>, Sonic the Hedgehog PC fans have definitely been eating well. Besides the recent release of the Sonic Adventure 2 Redux Unreal Engine 5 remake demo, some dedicated developers have released an unofficial port of <a href="https://wccftech.com/sonic-unleashed-unofficial-pc-port-download/">Sonic Unleashed</a>, finally giving PC players the chance to try out the console-exclusive game like never before. Hopefully, the follow-up to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/sonic-frontiers-review-wheres-the-fun-in-being-careful/">Sonic Frontiers</a>, which has yet to be officially announced, will receive the same amount of love from Sonic Team as these fan projects have from their developers.</p>

They're dated back to 2023, so it's possible that they aren't up to date. However, it does provide us a glimpse of what the project might look like. According to MP1st, the game's codename is "Bruno" and the screenshots suggest that it's an isometric tactics game.</p><p>Some of the screenshots show gameplay where Mandalorians and a droid take cover while others depict the user interface. One shows what looks like the hub area, called Kafrene Mining Colony.</p><p>As these images are over a year old, it's also possible that the final release could look drastically different.

            <p>The anonymous creator of Balatro, LocalThunk, impressed passersby at last month's Game Developer Conference with his card skills, but nobody recognised him.</p>
<p>Balatro won several awards at GDC's Game Developers Choice Awards, including Game of the Year, Best Design, Best Debut, and Innovation Award. As a result of the nominations, the game had a booth on the show floor.</p>
<p>LocalThunk himself played the game there, but managed to retain his anonymous status despite impressing onlookers at the booth.</p>

<p>"One of my fav moments from GDC - they had a booth set up to play Balatro since it was an award nominee. I watched for a bit then I gave it a go myself. Crushed a white stake run," the developer wrote on Bluesky.</p>
<p>"Someone approached me as I was about to leave. 'Wow you must have played this before!'</p>
<p>"'I guess you could say that'."</p>
<p>He added: "Also this was actually the first and only time I have seen strangers play my game in real life. Have yet to see Balatro in the wild. So as far as I'm concerned y'all are just Truman Show-ing me."</p>

<p>As with previous awards shows, Playstack Communications Director Wout Van Halderen collected Balatro's wins on LocalThunk's behalf.</p>
<p>In an interview last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatros-creator-sometimes-regrets-its-success-and-wants-to-stay-anonymous">LocalThunk admitted he sometimes regrets Balatro's success</a>, despite being grateful.</p>
<p>"Don't get me wrong - this has changed my life in a lot of amazing ways," he said. "I'm so grateful. But I do miss that time before. It was just a hobby that recharged my batteries. Sometimes I think, 'Maybe I would've been happier if I had never released this game to the public.'"</p>
<p>The correct pronunciation of the game's name has also been revealed. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ive-been-pronouncing-balatro-wrong-this-whole-time-have-you">Have you been pronouncing Balatro wrong</a>?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>75 people have been let go by Eidos-Montreal, the studio announced yesterday. The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a> and Tomb Raider developers laid off the workers because they didn't have the "capacity to entirely reallocate them", according to a statement. It's a further blow to the workforce at the Embracer-owned company, following hefty cuts last year.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Today, we informed our studio staff that we are going to let go up to 75 valuable members, as one of our mandates is coming to an end," said management in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/eidosmontreal_nous-avons-inform%C3%A9-aujourdhui-les-membres-activity-7312494582850543616-TzUD/?originalSubdomain=fr">the post on LinkedIn</a>. "It is not a reflection of their dedication or skills, but unfortunately, we don’t have the capacity to entirely reallocate them to our other ongoing projects and services.</p>
<p>"These very talented, highly experienced experts are going to enter the employment market, and we are working to support them through this transition."</p>
<p>The company doesn't specify what that "mandate" is. But it most likely means that work on a current project is finishing, for whatever reason. Note the classic use of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-call-a-job-cut-a-job-cut">not-our-fault spinlingo</a>. The statement says the axed workers are "going to enter the employment market" rather than, say, being frogmarched there.</p>
<p>"Eidos-Montréal stays committed to deliver its other projects currently in development," they added.</p>
<p>The only project that the studio has publicly acknowledged they've been working on lately is the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fable-has-been-delayed-until-2026-because-the-studio-needs-more-time-says-xbox">delayed</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fable">Fable</a>, on which they're helping out alongside core developer Playground Games. The company <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-deus-ex-game-in-the-works-for-two-years-reportedly-cancelled-almost-100-staff-laid-off-at-eidos-montreal">cancelled a Deus Ex game last year</a>, and laid off 100 workers in the wake of that cancellation. We don't know what else they're doing right now. </p>
<p>Eidos-Montreal was bought by Embracer Group in 2022, following the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/guardians-of-the-galaxy">Guardians of the Galaxy</a> the year before. Soon afterwards Embracer began a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-have-laid-off-8-of-their-global-workforce-since-their-restructuring-began">ruthless cost-cutting purge of workers</a> across all its studios. In March last year, Embracer's CEO claimed this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-say-their-restructure-is-over-but-its-too-early-to-start-acquiring-studios-again">process of "restructuring" was over</a>. But since then the multinational conglomerate has overseen the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-reportedly-close-down-cult-rpg-maker-piranha-bytes-creators-of-gothic-risen-and-elex">closure of the Gothic developers</a>, the axing of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/diablo-iv-support-studio-hit-by-layoffs-putting-139-people-out-of-work-proving-that-embracers-restructuring-is-not-over">139 people from a Diablo IV support studio</a>, and just last week other <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tomb-raider-and-perfect-dark-devs-crystal-dynamics-cut-staff-promising-that-current-projects-are-unaffected">layoffs at Crystal Dynamics</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>We already know that 2026 brings us a new reboot of Resident Evil. However, thanks to words from director Zach Cregger, it could be one of the most faithful adaptations of the legendary survival-horror series to date.</p>



<p>The history of Resident Evil movies isn’t the best. There’s been plenty to love, and we’ve seen countless nods to the game from characters to Resident Evil Apocalypse’s full inclusion of Nemesis. Milla Jovovich killed it as Alice in the original six movies, but the franchise has moved in a different direction since.</p>



<p>2021’s Resident Evil Welcome to Raccoon City has already been forgotten, but now we look ahead to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new 2026 Resident Evil film</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-resident-evil-movie-is-unlike-any-of-the-previous-films">Resident Evil Movie is “Unlike Any of The Previous Films”</h2>



<figure><figcaption>This news has us howling. Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>Through <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-resident-evil-movie-will-be-unlike-any-of-the-previous-films-director-promises?utm_source=facebook,threads,twitter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, we’ve learned from Zach Cregger—director of the Resident Evil movie reboot—that his interpretation “Will be built in the spirit of those games and follows one central protagonist from point A to point B, as they descend deeper into hell.”</p>



<p>He wants to capture a truer feel of the survival games, and has boldly claimed the reboot is “<strong>Unlike any of the previous films</strong>.”</p>



<p>Zach Cregger is an actor-turned-director and producer. He’s had several roles across TV and movies, but he’s recently best-known for writing and directing 2022’s Barbarian. The Resident Evil reboot is a huge project, and if the movie can be a success, it could start a new trend of Resident Evil movies to go along with the game series.</p>



<p>We know a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/capcom-confirm-new-resident-evil-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Resident Evil game</a> is well into development, and it’s also rumored that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-and-zero-are-next-two-remakes-insider-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil 0 and Code Veronica remakes</a> are on the way. Join the conversation in our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a> to see if anyone else is excited at the prospect of more Resident Evil screentime.</p>

That alone would be enough to carry today’s lineup, but the rest of the deals aren’t slacking either. TVs from LG and Insignia are seeing big discounts, and Samsung’s Galaxy Watch Ultra Titanium is finally priced like it wants to be on someone’s wrist instead of a museum pedestal.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Surging Sparks Booster Bundle Is In Stock Now</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also a stacked Humble Bundle full of family-friendly games (yes, Bluey made the cut), and the IGN Store has a highly detailed Death Stranding 2 model kit up for pre-order if your shelf is looking a little too normal.

It’s under $50, which in Pokémon terms is basically a clearance sticker.

It’s a 1/350 scale model of a massive mobile base from a game that hasn’t even released yet, and I respect the level of commitment required to care this much.

That’s 30% off apparantly, but it's not at all. It includes nine booster packs, a full-art N’s Zorua promo, sleeves, and the usual accessories, Most people just want the packs and the promo. If it’s gone when you check, keep trying. I’ve seen stock randomly reappear in the mornings and lunch time, just like <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3RDlq?object_uuid=c37b4d1b-d6b0-4f69-a7db-8c4f4a75a646&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Target's Journey Together stock</a>.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violetpaldea"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet—Paldea">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet—Paldean Fates Booster Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="8779f54b-0e08-4abc-82e6-49c5712ec775" id="217879"><div id="217879" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet—Paldean Fates Booster Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there’s the Paldean Fates Booster Bundle at $69.77.

The listing shows Silver Tempest Boosters, so there's a good chance of pulling some Sword and Shield chase cards here.</p><p>This one’s for the people who want it all: QLED, anti-reflection, studio-calibrated modes, and picture quality so good I paused a show just to stare at a lamp.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-pc-players-who-do-not-cheat-are-being-penalized-by-new-console-only-crossplay-option-for-regular-multiplayer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">With the launch of Season 3 this week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> and Warzone get a significant change that some within the PC community have said could hit their matchmaking queue times.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision published the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-3-patch-notes-are-here">Season 3 patch notes</a> and with it confirmed a big change coming to regular Multiplayer. It’s separating the Multiplayer Ranked Play and Call of Duty: Warzone Ranked Play settings and adding a new Multiplayer-only setting for Quickplay, Featured, and Party Games matches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each of these three settings (Multiplayer Ranked Play, Call of Duty: Warzone Ranked Play, and Multiplayer Unranked) will include the following crossplay options when Season 3 goes live on April 4:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>On: Enables matchmaking with all gaming platforms when playing in the selected playlists.</li><li>On (Consoles Only): Enables matchmaking only with other consoles when playing in selected playlists.</li><li>Off: Restricts matchmaking to your current gaming platform only in selected playlists.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision made a point of warning those who select 'On (Consoles Only)' <em>may</em> experience negatively impacted matchmaking queue times. But Activision outright said 'Off' <em>will </em>negatively impact matchmaking queue times.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s the console-only crossplay coming to regular Multiplayer that has some within the Call of Duty PC community spooked. They’ve said that console players having the option to essentially strip out matchmaking with PC players for regular Multiplayer may mean longer queue times for them, and you can see why they’d be worried.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty has a reputation for cheating (it comes with the territory of being such a hugely popular shooter and having a free-to-download battle royale). Cheating is more prevalent on PC (Activision recently confirmed as much, to the point where it said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-console-players-unlikely-to-be-cheating-theyre-just-killing-you-with-an-intel-advantage-activision-says">if you believe you’ve died unfairly to a console player, it’s much more likely that they’ve used ‘intel advantage’ than cheats</a>). So, some console players head straight into Call of Duty’s settings and turn off crossplay across the board, just to take the potential for PC cheaters ruining their day out of the equation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As a PC player…. hate this change but I get it,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops6/comments/1job9jr/comment/mkqf7p7/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">redditor exjr_ said</a>. “I hope it doesn’t affect queue times for the game in the long-run so I’m not forced to buy the game on PS5 to have a good experience.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This is awful for PC players because this just killed PC,” <a href="https://x.com/GKeepnclassy/status/1906786971831435531" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">added X / Twitter user @GKeepnclassy</a>. “Terrible idea because now PC players that ARE NOT cheating are being penalized. This is bullshit.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"My lobbies barely fill already to being with on PC due to sbmm," said @CBBMack. "This will withought a doubt make it worse. Time to plug in the console I guess."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some PC players have reacted angrily to the change, saying Activision should instead do more to make its anti-cheat more effective so console players aren’t driven to turn crossplay off in the first place. “Maybe they should fix their anti-cheat instead of isolating PC players,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops6/comments/1job9jr/comment/mkqgqcu/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">redditor MailConsistent1344 commented</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision, as IGN has reported, has spent millions of dollars in the battle against Call of Duty cheat makers, cheat sellers, and cheat users, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-cheat-maker-ordered-to-pay-activision-over-14-million-in-damages-and-hand-over-domain-name"><u>a number of recent high-profile successes</u></a>. Earlier in March, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prolific-call-of-duty-cheat-developer-insists-its-shutting-down-but-players-are-skeptical"><u>Phantom Overlay announced it was shutting down</u></a>, with fans reacting in disbelief that such a prominent Call of Duty cheat provider would fall by the wayside. And just last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/4-call-of-duty-cheat-providers-shut-down-in-apparent-sweep-and-clear-operation-ahead-of-verdansks-return-to-warzone">IGN reported on four cheat providers that were shut down</a> ahead of next week’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-confirms-release-date-for-return-of-original-verdansk-map-to-call-of-duty-warzone"><u>hotly anticipated return of Verdansk to Warzone</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it is an uphill battle that may be impossible to win. Activision has promised improved anti-cheat tech with the launch of Season 3, so it will be interesting to see if PC players feel any changes there, especially with the influx of players <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/verdansk-returns-to-call-of-duty-warzone-here-are-all-the-biggest-changes">the return of Verdansk</a> will bring to Warzone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, as many have pointed out, the ultra mainstream, super casual Call of Duty audience on console may never make use of these new crossplay settings because they may simply not be aware of them. Most Call of Duty players likely do not fuss over patch notes or spend much time in the settings. They jump into unranked Multiplayer, have some fun for an hour or two, then leave. These players may never know console-only crossplay is an option, or know why it would be needed in the first place. And so, the majority of console players may continue to play Call of Duty as they’ve always done: with full crossplay on by default.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a point made by Call of Duty YouTuber TheXclusiveAce, who reacted to PC player concern in a post on <a href="https://x.com/TheXclusiveAce/status/1906804429992730990" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social media</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I see a lot of pushback with this change from PC players concerned that they won't be able to find games in lesser played modes or that matchmaking will take too long,” TheXclusiveAce said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“To be clear, PC players will still be matchmaking with the largest pool of the playerbase since that majority of players won't even notice this setting exists so they'll stick to the default or even if they are aware of it, many will choose to leave it on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If anything, it's the players that decide to turn console-only crossplay on that will be limiting their matchmaking pool but that's a choice that's now in their hands for the first time in Pubs and it's a tradeoff that many of us will be happy to make.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Season 3 nearly upon Black Ops 6 and Warzone, it will be interesting to see if these changes move the needle, as Activision’s war on cheaters continues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>First it was rumoured, then it was implied, and now it seems all but officially confirmed that the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> Joy-Con will boast mouse functionality on the console's release.</p>
<p>A brief video shared on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-new-app-that-will-deliver-you-daily-information-and-content">Nintendo's newly minted Today app</a> counting down to tomorrow's Direct shows the Switch successor in various configurations. A console can be seen docked in front of a nice looking flat screen (devoid of kids' fingerprints, unlike mine) and one console is in its handheld mode with the Joy Con attached either side.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, while a pair of Joy Con have been slipped into Nintendo's handy little controller grip, two others lie loose to the side of another Switch 2 screen. Well, I say lie. One is lying on its back, as you would place an OG Switch Joy Con when not using it, but the second one is perched on its side.</p>

<p>This placement lends further credence to earlier reports of that aforementioned mouse functionality.</p>
<p>We got a look at what was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-trailer-appears-to-confirm-joy-con-mouse-functionality">perceived to be the Switch 2's mouse functionality</a> when Nintendo unveiled its upcoming console in January. During the brief teaser, two Joy Con could be seen being pushed along a flat service, their wrist straps out the back like little mouse tails.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there appeared to be some kind of attachment that gives the side of the Joy-Con a smooth edge.</p>

            <p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will retain its controversial sexual content from the original release, as revealed in its ESRB rating.</p>
<p>As with the original release of Metal Gear Solid 3, the forthcoming remake will be rated M for Mature. And it will retain the "Peep Demo Theatre" too.</p>
<p>Reads the <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40362/metal-gear-solid-snake-eater/">rating summary</a>: "The game contains some suggestive/sexual content: a man groping a woman's breasts; close-up cameras angles of deep cleavage; a character briefly groping a man's crotch; a Peep Demo Theatre allowing players to view cutscenes of a female character's body from a first-person perspective."</p>

<p>The Demo Theatre was an unlockable extra from the Subsistence version of the game onwards, which allowed players to view cutscenes while controlling the camera. The Peep Demo Theatre was one such cutscene that, once unlocked via multiple playthroughs, allowed players to see female spy Eva in her underwear.</p>
<p>In the main game too, players can press a button during cutscenes to see Snake's first-person viewpoint. This can provide an advantage, but in some scenes his gaze settles on more suggestive imagery.</p>
<p>While some players may have expected some of this sexual imagery to change in the remake for a more modern audience, the rating makes it clear the remake will stick closely to the original release.</p>
<p>The rating summary also details the amount of violence in the game. "Combat is highlighted by realistic gunfire, cries of pain, and blood-splatter effects," it reads. "Some close-quarter combat allows players to slit enemies' throats, resulting in large spurts of blood. Cutscenes depict further instances of violence/blood: a restrained character beaten and electrocuted; a character shot in the eye; a character on fire shot several times."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eaters-difficulty-is-being-adjusted-to-match-its-control-styles">remake will offer two styles of controls</a>, based on the original game and new modern controls, with difficulty altered accordingly.</p>
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will release on 28th August, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-release-date-announced-complete-with-a-butt-slapping-ape-escape-monkey">complete with the Ape Escape-themed minigame from the original game</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The Xbox handheld known as Project Keenan was teased with a not-subtle-at-all video that essentially confirmed who is making the yet-to-be-officially-announced system.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the ASUS ROG Global official X profile shared a new video teasing something new that the company is working on. During the video, an ROG Ally is shown together with an Xbox controller, strongly hinting at the fact that ASUS is <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-project-kennan-is-reportedly-being-made-by-asus/">indeed</a> the company making the Xbox handheld reportedly launching this year. The Xbox X profile also added more fuel to the fire by reacting with a rather telling meme, so it seems like it's all but confirmed that ASUS is making the handheld.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="qme"><a href="https://t.co/ONZpeEmNka">pic.twitter.com/ONZpeEmNka</a></p>
<p>— Xbox (@Xbox) <a href="https://twitter.com/Xbox/status/1906769447341510708?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 31, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The Xbox handheld codenamed Project Keenan, which will look markedly Xbox with a similar design sensibility and will run full Windows with the Microsoft Store and PC Game Pass as some of its focuses, is only a small part of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-release-2027-premium-handheld/">Microsoft next-generation plans</a>, which will also include a premium successor to the Xbox Series X and a full-blown handheld that will launch in 2027. Microsoft's next-generation system will supposedly deliver the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/">largest technical leap</a> ever seen, so it will be very interesting to learn how this leap will be delivered and how future games will take advantage of it.</p>

            <p>Former PlayStation exec Shuhei Yoshida has called NieR: Automata the "game that changed everything", as it was responsible for reviving the Japanese games industry on its release.</p>
<p>Speaking to Japanese outlet <a href="https://av.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/series/rt/2001799.html">AV Watch</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nier-automata-creator-yoko-taro-says-he-was-ordered-not-to-worry-about-overseas-reviews-by-games-producer/">Automaton</a>), Yoshida discussed how during the PS3 era, sales of Japanese games had declined and increasingly studios there were chasing "overseas tastes".</p>
<p>That changed with NieR: Automata in 2017, released for the PS4. "I think <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/yoko-taro">Yoko Taro</a> created it without paying any mind at all to making it sell overseas, but it was a tremendous success," said Yoshida.</p>

<p>The game proved Japanese studios could find success by creating Japanese-style games. "With NieR, everyone realised this," said Yoshida. "That it wasn't just something they could do, but something they had to do."</p>
<p>As such, Japanese studios strove to "create based on their own culture and what they knew", realising this was the appeal of their work overseas.</p>
<p>"I think that the Japanese game industry revived after NieR, so much so that you could talk about pre-NieR and post-NieR eras. Simply put, I think that was the title that made everyone want to pursue Japanese-style games," said Yoshida.</p>
<p>NieR creator Yoko Taro himself responded on social media, thanking Yoshida for the praise but crediting producer Yosuke Saito, who "ordered" him to make a game "that targets the Japanese market, without worrying about overseas reviews".</p>
<p>"Or, to put it more precisely," said Taro, "I remember being told something like 'Yoko, you can't make games for overseas, so (at least) try to make it for Japan'."</p> <div>

<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nier-developers-join-forces-for-new-project-that-might-be-nier-it-might-not-be-nier">Saito teased a possible new NieR project</a> alongside Taro, though nothing further has been said since. "I've been talking about wanting to do something with Yoko and Okabe for some time now," he said at the time. "I'll have something a bit more put-together to say in the not-too-distant future, so please stay tuned. It might be NieR, it might not be NieR. [Laughs] That's about all I can say for now."</p>

I'd say that it's much better than NieR:Automata."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
