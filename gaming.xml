            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/29/oneodio-a5-headphone-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>If you’ve been paying attention, there’s a battle being played out in the audio space for control over your ears. Stalwart companies like Sony and Bose continue to create the technological heavy hitters, but while they’ve been winning here for years, there’s been a steady improvement in their competition, and particularly in the value category. Manufacturers like SoundMagic and OneOdio are bringing the fight to them, shrinking the differences between the established firms’ output, while maximising the price difference. It’s a hell of a war, and with the OneOdio A5, they’re firing off another salvo.</p>
<p>The OneOdio A5 are ‘reminiscent’ of Sony’s category-defining XM5s. That is to say, to the casual observer you might mistake one for the other. Ostensibly the shape of the earcups, the headband, and the metal connection between the two, are closely modelled on Sony’s headset, and when the XM5s are arguably the best headphones of this generation, it’s a smart move, if thoroughly unimaginative. I’d have preferred them to offer something truly their own, but I understand the decision.</p>
<p>Where they differ is in the controls, with the A5’s opting for physical buttons rather than the touch and gesture controls of its inspiration. The right earpiece plays host to a volume rocker, power button, Active Noise Cancellation toggle and the USB-C socket for charging. Unlike other options in this category, there’s no 3.5mm connection for wired use, and that’s something of a disappointment, though clearly it’s been done as a marginal cost-saving exercise.</p>



<p>Our review unit came in the powder blue colourway, though it’s also available in a subdued black or off-white option. They definitely look more expensive than their £58 price tag would suggest, and they feel solid and well built in your hands, helped somewhat by the metal joints and smooth plastic on the outside of the sturdy headband. The OneOdio logo sits proudly at the centre of each earpiece, surrounded, in keeping with their design language, by a series of closely packed circular grooves. The downside is that dirt and fluff can build up in them, but a wipe with a cloth soon sets things right again.</p>

<p>You might be surprised by the way the headband extends though, and rather than stretching from the metal joints at the end of the headband, they extend out from a third of the way up each side of the headband, creating an ugly gap on each side if you need to extend them to fit your head. It’s the first true sign of the A5’s cheaper build and design, and it’s a shame when it looks so good elsewhere.</p>
<p>The passive noise cancellation of the OneOdio A5 is very good, reducing external sounds from around the house without having any additional help – a good start for the Hybrid Active Noise Cancellation which is rated for 45db, and can use AI to automatically adjust to your surroundings. In use, I didn’t discern whether the headphones were altering the level of reduction dynamically, but with ANC enabled the A5 does a decent enough job of cutting you off from the world around you, even if a long way away from what you’ll find in Sony’s or Bose’s top-tier offerings.</p>
<p>The audio response itself is very bass heavy. So bass heavy that my graphic equalizer needs a giant peak in the higher frequencies to correct it. Depending on the types of music that you listen to, it might not be quite such a big deal, and it’s certainly enveloping and powerful. Without EQ tweaking, it’s muddy and overpowering, with none of the detail you’d hope or expect from a headset that’s rated for Hi-Res Audio and supports and LDAC connection. That’s amplified if you’re connected to an Apple product, where the best codec you’re getting is AAC, or the Nintendo Switch which has no extra audio controls.</p>

<p>Listening to Mastodon’s Steambreather, the chugging guitars rumbled with enjoyable intent, but the vocals became lost in the mix, an issue that was only slightly remedied by further tweaks of the EQ. Things were dealt with better when listening to the soundtrack for Arcane’s Season 2, and tracks like Marcus King’s Sucker and Raja Kumari and Stefflon Don’s Renegade seemed perfectly designed for the extra bass, thumping along with plenty of energy. They feel perfect for the gym, or cutting out some serious external noise, but if you’re looking for nuance you’re better off looking elsewhere.</p>
<p>You find that the budget pricing seeps into the A5’s features the more time you spend with them, from the lack of auto-off when you take them off your head, to finding the controls for moving tracks backwards or forwards and Play/Pause mean that the power button and volume rocker are drawing double duty. From there, you’ll notice that the ambient mode is distinctly lacking, barely allowing the outside world in, and ultimately meaning that you’ll be better served by taking them off your head if you’re wanting to talk or listen for instructions.</p>
<p>What isn’t cheap is the A5’s battery, and there’s some serious longevity here, with a 45 hour life span with ANC on, and 75 hours without. That has definitely played out during my time with them, and I’ve barely had to charge them in the past month of use. When you do need to charge them in a rush, 10 minutes will get you 10 whole hours of use, and if you’re looking for a headset that’s going to last you days at a time, the A5 is a great pick.</p>
<p>The major competitor here is the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/09/monoprice-bt-600anc-headset-review/">Monoprice BT-600ANC</a>. While that is styled after Sony’s older XM4, you get a hard case and the audio they offer is far more balanced than the OneOdio A5s, albeit without the more modern looks. If you’re after comfort though, it’s worth considering the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/07/final-ux2000-headset-review/">Final UX2000</a> as well, which again, looks similar to the XM4 while also boasting plenty of low-end depth.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sniper-at-work">Sniper At Work</a> is the work of Cherrypick Games, hitherto known for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3179260/Kingdoms_Merge__Build/">"soothing merge-2 experiences"</a> featuring puppy-eyed princes. The only "twos" you shall be "merging" in Sniper At Work are bullets and faces. The only "cherries" you shall be "picking" are hoodlums in sore need of a skullful of lead. The only princes you shall acknowledge are their royal highnesses Distance, Wind, and Timing.</p>
<p>You may or may not find all that "soothing" - I won't judge. I will only repeat Nic's observation from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-maw-whats-new-in-pc-games-this-week-29">the Maw</a> that Sniper At Work look "a bit like Commandos, a bit like Hitman", which I would translate to "my comrade in PC gaming, if historic audience trends are any indication you shall do well here". Right, that's enough quotation marks for one article. There won't be any left for the next interview feature at this rate. Here's the trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>And here's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3452800/Sniper_at_Work/">the Steam page</a>. Elevator pitch: this is a stealthy-sandboxy urban execution sim with changeable environments and a heavy emphasis on both planning and plans going awry. Why are you in an elevator? Because you are heading to the roof with your rifle, of course. Mind the CCTV. Here are some features.</p>
<blockquote><p>Tactical Planning: Scout your targets, choose your vantage points, and get creative with traps, distractions, and tools.</p>
<p>Precision Sniping: Feel the thrill of the perfect shot with realistic ballistics, wind physics, and breathing control.</p>
<p>Upgradable Arsenal: Unlock and customize sniper rifles, gadgets, and tools to handle any situation--or make them worse in the most entertaining way possible.</p>
<p>Dynamic Scenarios: Missions adapt to your decisions (and occasional missteps), keeping keeping every playthrough unpredictable.</p>
<p>Creative Freedom: Choose your approach--subtle, explosive, or delightfully ridiculous--and leave your mark in style.</p></blockquote>
<p>I'm not wholly convinced by the switches to elevated third-person in the trailer. I can't figure out how they fit into the rest of the game. Beyond that, yeah, more of this please. It's not as conceptually ambitious as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/children-of-the-sun">Children Of The Sun</a>, and the developers have an uphill challenge crafting scenarios as ingenious as those of Hitman, let alone besting a direct rival like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sniper-elite-5-review">Sniper Elite</a>, but it feels like a game you shouldn't turn your back on. Especially given that it doesn't have a release date yet. They could strike at any moment.</p>
<p>Cherrypick Games are also working on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2949910/ANGST_A_TALE_OF_SURVIVAL/">Angst: A Tale Of Survival</a>, which is a low-poly trudge through an icy wilderness. The only cherries you shall pick here are chunks of frozen firewood.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
The developer of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-snap">Marvel Snap</a> has confirmed it has landed a new publishing partner in the wake of this month's outage that saw the game suddenly become unplayable in the US.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1884400415925817429?s=46">statement</a>, Second Dinner said it had "already signed agreements and started the work to bring almost all operational and publishing responsibilities in-house", with support from Skystone Games, a US-based indie games publisher.
</p>
<p>
Second Dinner had previously pledged to ditch its current publisher, Nuverse, in order to avoid any further disruption.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-snap-gets-surprise-us-suspension-as-stateside-tiktok-ban-takes-effect">Marvel Snap went offline in the US for over 24 hours</a> and was pulled from app stores in the country as a result of Nuverse's parent company being ByteDance - the Chinese owner of social meda app TikTok. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-in-talks-to-buy-tiktok-us-president-says">TikTok has officially been banned in the US</a> due to security concerns around how it handles user data, and similarly went offline for a brief period. For now, the ban has been paused while negotiations continue over an expected sale - with Microsoft reportedly one of the interested parties.
</p>
<p>
At the time of Marvel Snap's sudden outage, US users were greeted with a message apologising that the game "isn't available right now" as "a law banning Marvel Snap has been enacted in the US".
</p>
<p>
As players reacted in shock, the game's developers issued a statement which suggested they had been given no warning the downtime was set to occur.
</p>
<p>
"This outage is a surprise to us and wasn't planned. Marvel Snap isn't going anywhere," Second Dinner said in a defiant statement. "We're actively working on getting the game up as soon as possible."
</p>
<p>
After the game returned, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-snap-reveals-staggering-compensation-to-all-players-after-tiktok-ban-unexpectedly-took-it-offline">Second Dinner announced an enormous package of in-game rewards as an apology</a> to players, and pledged to find a new publisher "to make sure this never happens again".

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dino-crisis-and-dino-crisis-2-get-re-released-on-pc-via-gog-but-that-probably-wont-sate-fans-dying-for-a-remake<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Are those ripples in your morning cappuccino? Must be the stomping feet of an ancient lizard messing up that nice whippy heart your barista made in the froth. And when I say "ancient" I mean from 1999. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dino-crisis">Dino Crisis</a> and Dino Crisis 2 have appeared on GOG, making the classic survival horror games easily (and legally) playable on the PC once again.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>There's currently <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/dino_crisis_bundle">a bundle with both games</a>, or you can get <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/dino_crisis">the timid puzzles and exploration of the first game</a> separately from the more <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/dino_crisis_2">action-heavy shotgun blasting of the sequel</a>. Both are good times if you're a fan of digital fossils. Although if you're a console dabbler you may have already spotted these on the PlayStation store in October last year. </p>
<p>Both games have passed through <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gog-are-doubling-down-on-game-preservation-and-making-it-easier-to-see-which-games-run-well-on-modern-pcs">GOG's "game preservation" process</a>, which is basically a set of performance tests and checks that GOG like to do to make sure the games are DRM-free, compatible with modern machinery, and straightforward to launch for modern players. They get a shiny sticker when they pass. The original Resident Evil trilogy appeared on GOG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-original-resident-evil-from-1996-comes-back-to-pc-after-decades-of-gathering-flies">one</a> by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-original-resident-evil-2-from-1998-comes-shambling-and-groaning-back-to-pc">one</a> (by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-original-resident-evil-3-is-now-available-via-gog-following-the-arrivals-of-its-predecessors">one</a>) via the same process.

</p><p>One side effect of remastering Dino Crisis 2 seems to be that the characters are very crisp, making its pre-rendered backgrounds look blurry by comparison. It's as if Regina here is in a zoom call with the background slightly blurred. </p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Capcom</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>But look, here's some of the things each game has to make sure they'll work well on your PC.</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Full compatibility with Windows 10 and Windows 11</li>
<li>New rendering options (Windowed Mode, Vertical Synchronization Control, Gamma Correction, Integer Scaling, Anti-Aliasing, and more).</li>
<li>Full support for modern controllers (Sony DualSense, Sony DualShock 4, Microsoft Xbox Series, Microsoft Xbox One, Microsoft Xbox 360, Nintendo Switch, Logitech F series, etc.) with optimal button mapping for both wired and wireless modes, including hot plugging.</li>
<li>Added Cloud Saves support.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Dino Crisis is the well-liked cousin of the Resident Evil games, but has long been neglected by Capcom in comparison to the zombie-blasting series. Capcom released a poll that showed the series has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dino-crisis-is-the-series-most-capcom-fans-want-to-see-get-a-new-game">a lot of nostalgic fans</a>. But there has been no real sign of any remake happening in the style of the Resi games. Even Shinji Mikami has said that there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-space-for-dino-crisis-when-monster-hunter-exists-says-shinji-mikami">"no room" for the series to get a reboot when Monster Hunter exists</a>. </p><p>Meanwhile, GOG took this moment to remind people about their <a href="https://www.gog.com/dreamlist/">"Dreamlist"</a>, a list of user-voted games people would like to see appear on the store (they're touting this as a new feature but it is essentially a nice-looking revamp of their previous "wishlist" which saw users do the same thing). Currently, another Capcom game of yore is high on the list - Resident Evil: Code Veronica X. </p>

<p>Warzone is in a bad spot right now. We’re a long way since the heyday of 2020 when Verdansk was on everyone’s minds, and what remains today is a shell of what was once the most popular battle royale game in the business. The competitive scene is in bits, pro players have waited months for payments, and cheaters are harassing the global community with increasing abandon.</p>



<p>But fear not – in the recent patch notes published ahead of Warzone Season 02, Activision’s teams revealed that you now have the <strong>correct number of rocks to throw in the Gulag.</strong></p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-warzone-in-tatters">Warzone in Tatters</h2>



<p>Last week, I covered the news that many Warzone pro players still chase hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments owed by Activision and Co. </p>



<p>Following the World Series of Warzone last year, players from the top down <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/world-series-of-warzone-players-winnings/">failed to secure their winnings</a>. The state of play for Warzone esports was already rough enough, but this revelation extinguished any hope fans had for a resurgence of sorts in the coming months.</p>



<p>On social and streaming platforms, sentiments are at an all-time low.</p>



<p>On Twitch, the game’s <a href="https://twitchtracker.com/games/512710" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">peak of 1.6 million viewers</a> (in April 2021) seems like little more than a fever dream now. The average peak viewer count in the last seven days was around 24,000 users at the time of writing. That could be a symptom of the wider comedown of the battle royale genre, though – other games aren’t faring much better:</p>



<ul>
<li>PUBG – 12,800 avg</li>



<li>Apex Legends – 16,100 avg</li>
</ul>



<p>Only Fortnite stays strong, boasting a 65,800 average peak viewer count over the last seven days – but given <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-player-count-record-broken-juice-wrld/">the game’s rampant success</a> in recent years, that’s hardly a surprise.</p>



<p>The recent patch notes for Warzone’s Season 02 update revealed plenty of bug fixes and tweaks, but one that stood out and drew some jibes on social media read:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Fixed an issue where players only had one Gulag Rock instead of five in the Gulag.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This prompted many users to throw jabs at Activision’s prioritisation matrix, suggesting that this fix is but a grain of sand amid a beach of problems. </p>



<p>In a post on Twitter (X), CouRage suggested what needs to be done to revive Warzone:</p>



<div><article><p><span>It’s so sad to see the state of Warzone.

Call of Duty is one of the mismanaged IPs on the planet. Too many cooks in the kitchen. Too many egos. Too much greed from Activision.

Pull the plug. Reset from Warzone 1.0 and let it be it’s own standalone experience. Only additive…</span></p></article></div>



<blockquote></blockquote>



<p>In a spread of comments echoing the general sentiment, content creators across the net expressed their concerns:</p>



<ul>
<li>‘Warzone has gotta be one of the biggest embarrassments ever right now…’ – Timmy2Cans</li>



<li>‘The mismanagement of Warzone will go down as one of gaming’s biggest blunders when all is said and done.’ – Loochy</li>



<li>‘Perhaps the magic of Warzone is just gone and we all have grown tired of playing the game.’ – DougDagnabbit</li>
</ul>



<p>What do you think about the state of Warzone in 2025? Are you still playing, or have you long since moved on? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>
Hideaki Nishino has become Sony Interactive Entertainment's sole CEO, after a period of joint rule with PlayStation studios boss Herman Hulst. 
</p>
<p>
Sony's reshuffle also comes with a new boss for the overall company, with veteran exec and former CFO Hiroki Totoki now the company's overall CEO and president. 
</p>
<p>
Hulst, meanwhile, will remain the boss of PlayStation Studios - now reporting in to Nishino rather than running Sony's gaming arm alongside him.

<p>
Both men had shared leadership of PlayStation since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-boss-jim-ryan-is-retiring-in-march">last year's departure of former boss Jim Ryan</a>, with Nishino focused on the company's business side while Hulst focused on overseeing its game development studios.
</p>
<p>
Hulst will continue to look after "the development, publishing and business operations of SIE's first-party content" and further work with Sony Pictures to adapt key PlayStation franchises into films and TV series.
</p>
<p>
"I am truly honored to take the helm at Sony Interactive Entertainment," Nishino said in a statement. "Technology and creativity are two of our biggest strengths as we continue to focus on developing experiences that deliver entertainment for everyone. 
</p>
<p>
"We will continue to grow the PlayStation community in new ways, such as IP expansion, while also delivering the best in technology innovation.
</p>
<p>
"I want to thank Herman for his expertise and leadership as he continues his role as CEO, Studio Business Group," Nishino concluded. "I am deeply grateful for the PlayStation community and their continued support and I am very excited for what the future holds."
</p>
<p>
Sony has had mixed success over the past year, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-console-sales-top-65m-as-astro-bot-sells-15m-copies-in-first-month">continued strong sales of PlayStation 5 hardware</a> but also the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reflects-on-concords-failed-launch-and-removal-after-two-weeks">high-profile failure of live-service shooter Concord</a>, and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">reported cancellation of other live-service projects</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/29/cuisineer-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Have you ever wanted to run a restaurant? How about fighting weird monsters from an isometric perspective with food-themed weapons, like giant meat tenderisers? What if you could combine these two things by feeding the pieces of the monsters you’ve killed to your restaurant customers? Well, don’t be too shocked, but that’s exactly what Cuisineer is! The game begins with you, Pom, who appears to be a catgirl, returning to your hometown of Paell and finding the family restaurant in a state of disrepair. Her parents have gone away, racking up a debt in the process that someone needs to pay. Obviously, as is typical in debt-em-ups as I am now calling them, you’re the person that has to pay this off and you’re going to do it using oversized spatulas and your parents disused restaurant.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cuisineer | Console Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zBKSdSFD-Bs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Cuisineer gives a very strong first impression. It’s bright, colourful and well animated, and it feels great to play. The combat in particular is incredibly punchy, you can feel the impact of your weapons and it’s very responsive and quick. Running the restaurant is also a strange delight,&nbsp;as always in games like this. There’s just something about dashing around preparing dishes, taking payments, and occasionally stopping a dine and dasher that’s just inherently enjoyable.</p>


<p>The problem is that it is repetitive to the extreme.</p>
<p>Let’s start with combat. After that first run and getting a feel for how the fighting works, my second was immediately felt too familiar with its environments. I’m obviously starting off in the same zone so I expect the theming to be similar, but I was fighting through map tiles that I’d been through on my first run. I suppose I expected a much wider variety of tiles or more granular procedural generation, but every run thereafter I encountered the same again and again. It got incredibly same-y very quickly – even the enemies are usually in the same place and of the same type as last time.</p>


<p>The restaurant has a similar, but more pronounced issue. Whilst it is, much like the combat, enjoyable at first, it quickly gets dull due to how repetitive it is. You begin with a single pot to boil things in, preparing food to order for you while you wait for a timer to tick down, before you rush to take it to the customer (or for them to collect if you can’t be bothered). You can’t queue anything up until you upgrade it, which will also unlock higher tier recipes, but the experience of using it is always the same menu and timer. All the other kitchen workstations work in exactly the same way, so it soon loses its lustre and just feels like busy work.</p>
<p>The restaurant gameplay just never evolves as you would expect it to. With some additions, like staff to help in the restaurant, or something beyond just basic menu use for the cooking, with more variety in the wilderness, this game could be phenomenal. I love this kind of game where combat and management feed into one another, but while Cuisineer gets the basics very right, it doesn’t have enough depth to keep you going.</p>

<p>The stuff in between the restauranting and adventuring is also, unsurprisingly, very repetitive. You earn new recipes by completing side quests, which are almost always invariably bringing a person in the town a suspiciously large amount of something. 15 pieces of wood to make a painting, 25 of the rarest ingredient I’ve found so far, 10 of a specific dish that I have to cook myself, with a limited queue on the workstation that does it so I have to stand there staring at a menu whilst a bar fills up.</p>
<p>Upgrading your restaurant is slow and painstaking, with you investing large amounts of money and resources to unlock a handful of extra floor tiles for the first five upgrades. Your fridge also needs upgrading, as does your storage for wood and stone and so on, using the same resources. Wood, stone, orichalcum, and such all drop from rocks and trees that you can break whilst fighting, so you sometimes spend just as much time rushing around breaking trees and rocks as you do fighting the enemies.</p>
<p>The loot system is very limited as well, I haven’t found a new item for hours and the last one I did find – salt and pepper shakers – happened to handle exactly like the blue crystal boxing gloves I was already using. Each weapon has its own special power, but they sometimes leave you exposed whilst they activate and deal less damage than if you’d just attacked normally, so outside of a few that move you forward or attack from range I mostly ignored them. The affixes that items have seemed promising at first as well, with one or two that changed behaviours quite significantly, like leaving a puddle of ice when I dash that freezes enemies, but again they quickly became very same-y and once I’d started upgrading my equipment I didn’t want to switch to another and invest the cash to upgrade it.</p>

<p>Then as you head into the town of Paell, sometimes shops are closed so you can’t use them and everyone overshares the moment you speak to them. Despite how nice it looks, I found myself dreading having to venture into the town to find a specific side quest giver and deliver whatever disproportionate amount of food items they wanted, because there’s just so many that I could never remember which specific one it was. Every time I had just run between all of them and hope I found it sooner rather than later. It doesn’t help that sometimes they’re not even there, either.</p>

The first sign of sentient life this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-10-best-immersive-sims-on-pc">immersive sim</a> offers me is the greeting of a gasmasked freakdroid as I leave a warehouse. Tinny propaganda songs play from TVs too big to comfortably fit in anyone's car. The warehouse is so huge I thought it was outside until I looked up and there was <em>writing on the sky</em> and I realised it was a roof. I'm still messed up about it, honestly.</p>

<p>The freakbot's dialogue is all casually hyper-detailed cyberpunk patois. Slick and bitty. This feels like a world with depth sinking into itself. Hell yeah I'm into it.</p>
<p>He gives me an augmentation that lets me dilate time. It is made of bones. This is the most amount of spine I've had in an inventory for ages, and it's even got a skull attached. Also, a silenced rifle. I'm off to the planetarium to do a task for the bot in exchange for info. The city feels almost oceanic in its blues and greens and silvers, and also because there's a lot of piss and garbage in it. There's also maybe a tiny sliver of piss in the code. It's all a bit choppy but I'm treating that as text for now. The city is vast. A necropolis no-one bothered to show up to after death that now just feels incredibly dejected and morose about the whole thing.</p><p>I never make it to the planetarium. The city goes too deep and I want to see the bottom of it. You will probably make more progress than me. I need to luxuriate with this thing. It's the kind of cyberpunk I like. Human thought and conciousness? I barely noosphere. There's a demo <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1437760/Peripeteia/">on Steam here</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>"I want to immerse the player in a world of propaganda and perspective," says Snake, one of the games two leads. "A place where belief, ideology, and demons of the past meet in a cyber future." But this is filtered through Poland's unique history. "The game will in places explore elements of Polish culture of the 19th and 20th Century," says the game's programming lead Shodanon, including "Polish messianism, the work of Polish modernists, the anti-communist movements".</p></blockquote>

PC games shop GOG announced the release of <em>Dino Crisis</em> and its sequel, which are both available starting today. Alongside the launch, the service also announced a new tool called “dreamlist,” with the goal of letting players vote on which old games that want to see hit the service next.</p><p>For the uninitiated, <em>Dino Crisis</em> is essentially <em>Resident Evil</em> with dinosaurs. That’s not an insult: the first game was directed by original <em>Resident Evil </em>director Shinji Mikami, so the two series have a lot in common. <em>Dino Crisis</em> features the same methodical, survival horror gameplay but with faster (and occasionally much bigger) enemies to contend with. GOG says the new port supports Windows 10 / 11 and includes updates like support for “~4K resolution” and modern gamepads. The two games can be purchased individually on GOG or as a bundle.</p><p>As for the dreamlist, GOG describes it as an enhanced version of its existing wishlist feature:</p><div><blockquote><p>It’s a place where your memories meet action. You tell us what matters, and we work to make it happen. Each vote is a spark that inspires publishers to act. With the brand new design, it’s easier than ever to champion your favorites and make sure your voice is heard — because we believe that together we can keep the classics alive.</p></blockquote></div><p>It’s a notable development given how inaccessible most classic games are; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/14/23792586/classic-game-preservation-video-game-history-foundation-esa">a 2023 report from the Video Game History Foundation</a> claimed that 87 percent of games released before 2010 are “critically endangered.” Today’s news follows <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/13/24295683/gog-preservation-program-pc-game-drm">the launch of GOG’s preservation program last year</a>, which aims to keep classic games playable and accessible, even if they’re no longer maintained by their original developer or publisher.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Yesterday, GeForce NOW users started noticing that the billing system was offline. As it turns out, there's a very good reason for that. NVIDIA <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5618" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that it is taking over payment processing from a third-party provider. During this transition, existing paid users will effectively be able to play for free. On the flip side, new signups for memberships and upgrades/downgrades from existing plans are paused for the time being. The whole process is expected to last around five weeks.</p>
<p>NVIDIA prepared some answers to frequently asked questions (FAQ):</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Why are all memberships &amp; gift cards sold out right now?</strong></em><br>
<em>GeForce NOW is transitioning to a new payment provider. While we work through this transition, new sign ups for memberships &amp; day passes along with gift card purchases will be paused.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Why am I not getting billed?</strong></em><br>
<em>GeForce NOW is transitioning to a new payment provider and billing is waived while we complete that process. Your account remains in good standing during this transition.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Why can’t I change (upgrade/downgrade) my membership?</strong></em><br>
<em>Membership changes are paused while GeForce NOW transitions to a new payment provider. Recurring billing is waived while we transition payment services and your account remains in good standing.&nbsp;</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Can I use a gift card or promo code right now?</strong></em><br>
<em>Gift cards and promotional codes cannot currently be redeemed but will resume soon. For questions or assistance, please contact NVIDIA Customer Care.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Can I purchase additional hours right now?</strong></em><br>
<em>GeForce NOW is transitioning to a new payment provider. While we work through this transition, you will not be able to purchase additional time. Accounts affected by this change have been migrated to an unlimited playtime account. Those users will continue to enjoy unlimited playtime until their first billing cycle on or after January 1, 2026, as long as their Premium membership remains uninterrupted and in good standing once billing resumes.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Does this mean GeForce NOW is shutting down?</strong></em><br>
<em>No, GeForce NOW will continue to operate unabated while we transition payment service providers.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>When will I be billed next?</strong></em><br>
<em>Billing will waived for the duration of the transition, pushing back your next billing cycle by the same length of time. We expect the transition will take a minimum of five weeks. Visit your account portal for further updates.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>NVIDIA's cloud gaming platform is <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidias-cloud-gaming-service-geforce-now-is-officially-out-of-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">celebrating its fifth anniversary</a> next week. So far, it delivers the best cloud gaming experience available on the market, thanks to its vast library of games and support for high-end technologies like 4K, 120 FPS, DLSS, HDR, VRR, and even ray tracing for those subscribed to the premium tiers.</p>

            <p>
There's some good news for PC players who spent the end of last year casting jealous glances at PlayStation owners, following the surprise re-release of Capcom's beloved survival horror game Dino Crisis; not only is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dino-crisis">Dino Crisis 1</a> now available on PC, it's sequel has also been re-released, meaning PlayStation owners might be feeling a little green eyed now too.
</p>
<p>
Dino Crisis, if you're unfamiliar, originally released for PlayStation 1 back in 1999. It was created by legendary Capcom director Shinji Mikami, giving the B-movie survival horror template established in his earlier Resident Evil a jungle-based, dinosaur-themed twist. A more action-focused sequel released in 2000, followed by the Xbox-exclusive <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dino-crisis-3">Dino Crisis 3</a> in 2003, and that was it for the series - leaving it to develop something of a cult following in the years since.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, according to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dino-crisis-is-the-series-most-capcom-fans-want-to-see-get-a-new-game">Capcom poll last year</a>, Dino Crisis is the series fans want to see the developer revisit the most. To date, that hasn't happen - creator Shinji Mikami later <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-space-for-dino-crisis-when-monster-hunter-exists-says-shinji-mikami">told Eurogamer</a> he doesn't "feel like there's a whole lot of space" for a new Dino Crisis game thanks to the success of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter">Monster Hunter</a> - but Capcom did at least attempt to appease fans with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/octobers-playstation-plus-extra-and-premium-games-include-dead-island-2-dino-crisis">surprise PlayStation Plus re-release of Dino Crisis 1 last October</a>. Since then, Dino Crisis 1 has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-dino-crisis-is-now-available-for-all-to-purchase-on-playstation">made available for general purchase on PlayStation</a>, and now - in partnership with GOG - Capcom has launched the game and its beloved sequel on PC.

<p>
Both Dino Crisis GOG releases are DRM-free and include all content included in the originals, alongside a range of enhancements for modern-day machines. Dino Crisis 1, for instance, is now playable on Windows 10/11, and includes Original mode, Arrange mode, and the Operation Wipe Out mode exclusive to the game's original PC port back in the day. It also features enhanced DirectX rendering, 4K resolution support, plus new in-game options including V-sync, gamma correction, and anti-aliasing. That's in addition to support for modern controllers, and fixes for stability, transparency, and save issues.
</p><p>
Dino Crisis 1 &amp; 2 launch for PC via GOG today (<a href="https://www.gog.com/game/dino_crisis">here</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/dino_crisis_2">here</a>, specifically), and there's a <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/dino_crisis_bundle">two-game bundle</a> for anyone wanting to pick up both. Their arrival coincides with the launch of GOG's new Dreamlist tool - a "next generation" version of its Community Wishlist - intended to show IP owners community interest in old games and help bring them back to life.

			<p>This morning, a Sony press release <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-leadership-at-sony-interactive-entertainment-302362728.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> some changes to the PlayStation leadership. Hideaki Nishino will fully take over the role of President and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment, effective April 1, 2025. You might recall that last year, Sony <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-announces-its-two-new-ceos-hermen-hulst-and-hideaki-nishino/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">established</a> the mildly confusing two-CEO structure, with Nishino leading the Platform Business Group and Hermen Hulst helming the Studio Business Group. Hulst will retain this position, but he'll now report directly to Nishino.</p>
<p>Moreover, Hiroki Totoki is stepping down as Chairman of SIE to become President and CEO of Sony Group Corporation. At the same time, Lin Tao, currently serving as SVP of Finance, Corporate Development, and Strategy at PlayStation, will step down from her position at SIE to become CFO of Sony Group Corporation. Her successor at SIE will be announced at a later date.</p>
<p>Hiroki Totoki, Chairman at Sony Interactive Entertainment and President, COO and CFO at Sony Group Corporation, stated:</p>
<p><em>It has been a pleasure working more closely with Hermen and Nishino and gaining insight into the ever-changing, fast-paced world of Sony Interactive Entertainment. As we hand the baton to Nishino and this exceptional leadership team, I am confident that SIE will reach new heights in the days ahead. After 30 years of delivering exceptional entertainment worldwide, this marks an exciting new chapter for SIE, highlighting its commitment to fostering creativity and building meaningful connections for millions of players. I am delighted to welcome Lin as my successor as CFO of Sony Group Corporation. Lin has been instrumental to our success at SIE, leading the Finance, Corporate Development and Strategy functions, and I look forward to working closely with her at Sony Group Corporation.</em></p>
<p>Hideaki Nishino commented on his new role as the sole CEO of the PlayStation division with the following statement:</p>
<p><em>I am truly honored to take the helm at Sony Interactive Entertainment. Technology and creativity are two of our biggest strengths as we continue to focus on developing experiences that deliver entertainment for everyone. We will continue to grow the PlayStation community in new ways, such as IP expansion, while also delivering the best in technology innovation. I want to thank Hermen for his expertise and leadership as he continues his role as CEO of the Studio Business Group. I am deeply grateful for the PlayStation community and their continued support and I am very excited for what the future holds.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/throne-and-liberty-gets-free-wilds-of-talandre-expansion-on-march-6/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Amazon Games has <a href="https://www.playthroneandliberty.com/en-us/news/articles/wilds-of-talandre-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> the release date for Wilds of Talandre, the first (and free) <a href="https://wccftech.com/throne-and-liberty-already-had-3-million-players-in-its-debut-week-says-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Throne and Liberty</a> expansion: March 6. Starting on that date, players of NCSoft's MMORPG will get to explore a brand new zone, which includes new story content, an updated level cap (to 55), and several new events, field dungeons, and field bosses. Following the launch, based on the Milestone system, various additional content will be unlocked in Wilds of Talandre, including new regional events, archbosses, and field dungeons.</p>
<p>There's lots more. The expansion is going to add solo dungeons to Throne and Liberty. This activity is meant to be a way for players to get better before they head into more challenging group content, but it'll come with its own rewards.</p>
<p>Speaking of the aforementioned group content, Wilds of Talandre also brings the third tier of group dungeons. 3-Star Dungeons unlock at level 55 and require a minimum of 3,500 Combat Power. At launch, players can expect the following dungeons to be available:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rancorwood</li>
<li>Mansion of Tragedy</li>
<li>Chapel of Madness</li>
<li>Cruel Witch's Garden</li>
<li>Assassin's Lab</li>
</ul>
<p>Potential loot drops include the powerful Epic II Gear Sets, Training Dew, Amitoi, Abyssal Contract Token Points, and, of course, crafting materials. Players will also get rewards that can be used to craft items that drop Dimensional Soul Shards in each 3-Star Dungeon.</p>
<p>Throne and Liberty is getting a new cross-server PvPvE activity called Nebula Island. Players can spend up to 7 hours per week on the island, with additional time available through Nebula Charge Stones. The island features a central village (the Resistance Surveillance Camp) and six different regions, including one peaceful zone (the Fog Forest) and four war zones where PvP is always active. Various hunting grounds can be accessed through portals from the Resistance Surveillance Camp. On Nebula Island, players will also find hourly events and periodic limited-participation field boss battles.</p>
<p>The Weapon Mastery system has been revamped, and there's a brand new Artifact System as well. Artifacts can be obtained from Nebula Island and from the Abyss Dungeons in the Talandre region. The system consists of six parts: four Talistones, a Solar Stone, and a Lunar Stone, each with unique stats and effects. There are 14 different Artifact sets across three grades (2 Common, 4 Uncommon, and 8 Rare). Players can trigger set bonuses by equipping 2, 4, or 6 matching pieces from the same set. The Solar Stone provides an Active Skill, while the Lunar Stone grants a Passive Skill when equipped.</p>

<p>Lastly, Wilds of Talandre adds some new lifestyle content: 24 new fish, 4 new fishing rods, new collectibles, and 10 new cooking recipes and food items. Players will also have another reason to gather ingredients in Throne and Liberty as the 5 types of Elixir items (Excellent Attack/Defence Elixirs, Rare Attack/Defence/Purification Elixirs) can now be cooked.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-corp-announces-major-changes-to-its-structure-hermen-hulst-is-no-longer-ceo-of-sie.1094421/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/sony-major-changes-structure/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In major news that was revealed by <a href="https://variety.com/2025/biz/news/sony-corp-shake-up-hiroki-totoki-ceo-hideaki-nishino-playstation-1236289299/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a> on Tuesday night—Wednesday morning in Japan—, Sony Corp. has made unexpected changes to its organizational chart.  Hideaki Nishino, who was appointed co-CEO and handled the platform side in 2024, will now act as sole president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE). </p>



<p>Hermen Hulst, who was named Co-CEO of SIE last year no longer overseeing the entire company alongside Nishino. However, he remains in his position as CEO of the Studio Business Group, a subdivision created to run the PlayStation studios.</p>



<h2 id="h-sony-s-structural-changes-at-sie">Sony’s Structural Changes At SIE</h2>



<ul>
<li>Hideaki Totoki has been promoted to CEO of Sony Corp.</li>



<li>Hideaki Nishino has been promoted to president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment. He also will hold his positions as CEO of the Platform Business Group.</li>



<li>Hermen Hulst is no longer co-CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment as a whole. He will remain as CEO of the Studio Business Group and will lead PlayStation Productions.</li>
</ul>



<p>The change represents the second major leadership change over the last year at SIE. Previously, the position of CEO was held by a single person, Jim Ryan, who retired after 30 years of service. With his departure, Sony announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-hires-two-new-ceos-to-replace-jim-ryan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the position would be filled by two people</a>, the aforementioned Hulst and Nishino.</p>



<p>Now, the company has gone back on its decision, in a way. Another notable change was in the position of CEO of Sony Corp. Hideaki Totoki, a 38-year veteran of the company, will take over the position previously held by Kenichiro Yoshida. All of the above decisions were approved by the board and take effect on April 1st.</p>



<p>Totoki said the following:</p>



<p><em>“I am incredibly honored and humbled to have been entrusted with the important role of President and CEO,</em>” Totoki said. “<em>My predecessors as CEO, Kazuo Hirai and Kenichiro Yoshida, have greatly enhanced Sony’s value, and I will do my utmost to further build on this success and pass on an even better Sony to the next generation. At our Corporate Strategy Meeting in May of last year, we newly announced our `Creative Entertainment Vision,’ which outlines where we want Sony to be in 10 years, with our Purpose as the guiding principle. Our greatest driver in achieving this is the diversity of our businesses and people, which is part of Sony’s DNA, and our boundary spanners that transcend organizational barriers and organically connect that diversity to create new value. Together with our employees, creators, partners, and our new leadership team, I will work to create a bright future filled with a boundless sense of Kando (emotion).</em>”</p>



<p>Hideaki Nishino also commented on his promotion:</p>



<p>“<em>I am truly honored to take the helm at Sony Interactive Entertainment. Technology and creativity are two of our biggest strengths as we continue to focus on developing experiences that deliver entertainment for everyone. We will continue to grow the PlayStation community in new ways, such as IP expansion, while also delivering the best in technology innovation,</em>” Nishino said. “<em>I want to thank Hermen for his expertise and leadership as he continues his role as CEO, Studio Business Group. I am deeply grateful for the PlayStation community and their continued support and I am very excited for what the future holds,</em>“</p>
