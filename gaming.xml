            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Many people don’t need the latest MacBook Pro with its $4,000 sticker shock but they also can’t do real work on a $300 Chromebook that chokes on anything beyond web browsing. The middle ground does exist, and HP has hit it out of the park with<strong> this 17-inch laptop that offers real productivity features without the premium price</strong>.</p>
<p>The brand appears to be clearing inventory and rather than advertising these savings on their own site, they’re unloading units under the radar on Amazon at historically low prices. This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4476/">HP 17″ laptop (Intel Core i3, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, Windows 11 Pro) has been chopped from $2,399 down to $699, a 71 percent discount</a> that puts professional-grade computing in the budget of students and remote workers.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4476/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The 17.3-Inch Display Changes Your Workflow</h2>
<p>This is driven by the <strong>Intel Core i3-N305 8-core processor up to 3.2GHz</strong> and Intel UHD Graphics. This configuration handles everyday multitasking, web surfing, document editing and media playback without frustration or lag. The i3-N305 is Intel’s energy-efficient hybrid architecture designed for laptops that balances performance and battery life by dynamically shifting workloads between the performance and efficiency cores based on what you’re doing. You won’t be rendering 4K video or playing AAA games on max settings, but for office work and streaming entertainment, this processor delivers smooth performance.</p>



<p>Screen size matters more than many people realize until they’ve actually worked on a larger display: The <strong>17.3-inch HD+ screen gives you much more workspace than standard 15.6-inch laptops</strong>, reducing the constant window juggling and tab switching that breaks your concentration. The 1600×900 resolution packs approximately 1.4 million pixels and delivers crisp text rendering and sharp graphics for documents and videos. The anti-glare coating reduces reflections from overhead lighting and windows.</p>
<p>The 32GB of RAM changes how you work by eliminating the performance limitations of heavy multitasking. You can have dozens of browser tabs open, several <a href="https://gizmodo.com/download/microsoft-365">Microsoft 365 applications</a> open simultaneously, be in video calls as you work on presentations and still have apps running in the background without noticing the slowdowns.</p>
<p>The <strong>1TB PCIe NVMe SSD provides fast and spacious storage</strong> with Windows boot times in seconds and instant app opening. PCIe NVMe technology provides read and write speeds up to 15 times faster than traditional mechanical hard drives, which transfer files quickly and make opening large documents instant.</p>
<p>At $699, you’re getting a genuinely capable laptop that performs real work without compromise.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After much contemplation, we realize that the scheduled <em>Kingmakers</em> launch on October 8 will no longer be possible. We want to apologize to all of the fans who are eagerly anticipating this game. We are sorry for letting you down.</p><p>Why is <em>Kingmakers</em> being delayed? In short it’s an incredibly ambitious, uncompromising game, and we don’t want to cut any planned features, for the sake of getting it out the door earlier. Our goal, from the start, has been to create something that’s nothing like anything else on the market, in terms of gameplay, scale, scope, and interactivity.</p><p>With <em>Kingmakers</em>, we set out to push the Unreal Engine 4 codebase to its absolute limits, while still providing true 60 frames per second to midrange PCs, without the need for fake frames. We are an 80 percent engineering team, who got into this business to push technological barriers.</p><p>We currently have tens of thousands of soldiers, each with Al and pathfinding that rivals what you’d expect from a AAA third-person shooter. When you walk away from a battle, it continues to play out. Nothing is faked. We have giant 6 story castles where every room can be entered and every wall, floor, and ceiling destroyed. When you build a Lumbermill, it’s a real place that can be entered, or, in an enemy invasion, turned into a combat arena.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>When you drive a car into a tree, you’re ejected through the windshield, the tree breaks from its stump, and then rolls over whatever hapless soldiers are along its path.

We just need a bit more time on content polish before we feel good about charging money for it.</p><p>So that is what we are doing now. We’re making sure everyone who buys the game is enthralled and feels like their money was well spent. We want this to be the case whether you have a top-of-the line rig or a PC that’s seen better days.</p><p>Thank you so much for all of your love and support. We hope we are doing everything we can to earn it.</p><p>We will be presenting a half-hour-long deep dive on <em>Kingmakers</em> gameplay very soon, with a comprehensive overview of everything we’ve been working on.</p><p>—Redemption Road Games</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/kingmakers-early-access-delayed-to-unannounced-date]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-lina-khan-ftc-microsoft-activision-merger-2000631611</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ex-ftc-chair-slams-microsoft-as-%E2%80%98too-big-to-care%E2%80%99-after-game-pass-price-jumps-50-percent.1316221/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Microsoft’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cancel-controversy-console-pc-2000631061">unpopular Game Pass price hikes</a> have caught the attention of Lina Khan. The former head of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) took to social media on Friday to once again criticize the company’s acquisition of <em>Call of Duty</em> maker Activision Blizzard. “As dominant firms become too-big-to-care, they can make things worse for their customers without having to worry about the consequences,” she wrote just a day after the price of Game Pass Ultimate rose to $30 a month.</p> <p>It was Khan’s FTC during the Biden Administration <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-activision-ftc-deal-court-call-duty-xbox-ps5-1850623628">that sued Microsoft to prevent the $70 billion Activision Blizzard deal</a> from going through. The regulator argued that further market consolidation in gaming would harm consumers, and ended up taking the matter to court. A judge ultimately ruled in favor of Microsoft, but that hasn’t stopped Khan and others from criticizing the outcome in the years since.</p>

 <p>“Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision has been followed by significant price hikes and layoffs, harming both gamers and developers,” she posted on X today alongside a chart showing Game Pass prices doubling since the trial concluded. “As we’ve seen across sectors, increasing market consolidation and increasing prices often go hand-in-hand.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision has been followed by significant price hikes and layoffs, harming both gamers and developers. </p> <p>As we’ve seen across sectors, increasing market consolidation and increasing prices often go hand-in-hand. </p> <p>As dominant firms become… <a href="https://t.co/FoI50tlEsL">https://t.co/FoI50tlEsL</a></p> <p>— Lina Khan (@linamkhan) <a href="https://twitter.com/linamkhan/status/1974192096841265511?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>A similar point was made <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-ftc-black-ops-6-appeal-1851599323">when Microsoft raised prices last year</a>. “Microsoft’s price increases and product degradation—combined with Microsoft’s reduced investments in output and product quality via employee layoffs, see FTC’s February 7, 2024, Letter—are the hallmarks of a firm exercising market power post-merger,”&nbsp;<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24852374-24-07-18-ftc-letter-re-microsoft-game-pass-price-increases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the FTC wrote</a> last July when it was still appealing the merger.”</p>

 <h2>Microsoft promised regulators Game Pass prices wouldn’t go up</h2> <p>Khan isn’t the only one going “I told you so” this week. Shortly after the latest Game Pass price hikes were announced, players started circulating the company’s old quotes back during the Activision merger fight. The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority also tried to block the deal over pricing concerns.</p>

 <p>“Game Pass prices will not increase as a result of the Merger, and certainly will not increase to a point that offsets the substantial benefits of Activision titles coming to Game Pass on a day and date basis,” the company <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/microsoft-insists-game-pass-prices-will-not-increase-as-a-result-of-activision-merger/">claimed back in 2023</a>. “This is especially so given Game Pass will continue to be constrained by B2P [buy to play].”</p>

 <p>In the years since, Microsoft appears to have done exactly that, <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-game-pass-call-duty-points-discount-changes-2000631483">adding <em>Call of Duty</em> to Game Pass</a> but jacking up the price as well, even though players can still choose to buy the game à la carte for $70 on console and PC.</p> <p>Microsoft might argue that $30 a month is a fair price to pay for subscription-based access to <em>Black Ops 7</em> and hundreds of other games. It’s impossible to know without access to rest of the Xbox math, most of which Microsoft stopped reporting to the public years ago. All we know is that according to Microsoft, Game Pass was profitable and generating $5 billion in revenue a year, even before the latest price hikes.</p>

There are plenty of powerful guns and equipment to try, as we went over in our best BO7 loadouts guide but you'll also want to make sure you have the best perks to suit your playstyle. In this guide, we'll discuss the recommended perks and Wildcards, and we'll also break down how the new Combat Specialties work this year.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Best_perks_for_multiplayer">Best perks for multiplayer</a><ul><li><a href="#Perk_1_slot">Perk 1 slot</a></li><li><a href="#Perk_2_slot">Perk 2 slot</a></li><li><a href="#Perk_3_slot">Perk 3 slot</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Best_Wildcard_picks">Best Wildcard picks</a></li><li><a href="#Combat_Specialties">Combat Specialties</a><ul><li><a href="#Hybrid_Combat_Specialties">Hybrid Combat Specialties</a></li><li><a href="#Core_Specialties">Core Specialties</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="Best_perks_for_multiplayer">Best perks for multiplayer</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Perk_1_slot">Perk 1 slot</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Ghost:</strong> Undetectable by enemy Scout Pulse and UAV when moving, planting, defusing, or controlling Scorestreaks. This is in the Recon (blue) perk category.</p><p dir="ltr">Ghost is a great perk for staying off the radar if you're a player who wants to go for stealthy plays. This can also be a smart pick if you're planning on making a class to lay low with a sniper rifle.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Ninja: </strong>Move more quietly. This is in the Recon (blue) perk category.</p><p dir="ltr">Like Ghost, this perk can be used for stealthy plays. It's also one of the best picks for non-respawn modes like Search and Destroy.</p><p dir="ltr">Ghost and Ninja are both in the same perk slot this year, so you <strong>can't equip them both</strong> for a stealth loadout unless you choose the Perk Greed Wildcard, as mentioned below.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Cold-Blooded: </strong>Undetectable by AI targeting and thermal optics. Player-controlled scorestreaks don't highlight you. This is in the Recon (blue) perk category.</p><p dir="ltr">It's always good to have at least one loadout equipped and labeled as a Cold-Blooded class. This makes it easy to switch in a pinch, as Black Ops 7 features plenty of lethal scorestreaks that can target you.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Flak Jacket:</strong> Reduces incoming explosive and fire damage. This is a Strategist (green) category perk.</p><p dir="ltr">Flak Jacket is a solid pick if you're an objective player looking to jump on a Hardpoint or Domination flag. It will help protect you from the grenades lobbed your way.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4579846-bo7_mp_reveal_dawg_01_final_branded.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579846" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4579846-bo7_mp_reveal_dawg_01_final_branded.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579846"></a><figcaption>The D.A.W.G. scorestreak</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4579846-bo7_mp_reveal_dawg_01_final_branded.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Perk_2_slot">Perk 2 slot</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Looper:</strong> Gain the ability to re-earn Scorestreaks in the same life. This is an Enforcer (red) perk.</p><p dir="ltr">By default, you can't keep earning your streaks in the same life, and you need to die to reset them. Looper allows you to keep earning your streaks over and over. This is a good perk if you're someone who can rack up plenty of points and want to keep earning streaks.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Fast Hands:</strong> Swap weapons faster and extend fuses when throwing back grenades. This is a Strategist (green) category perk.</p><p dir="ltr">Movement and speed remain so important in Black Ops 7's fast-paced multiplayer. Having the faster weapon swap can really save you when your primary runs out of ammo.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Perk_3_slot">Perk 3 slot</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Dexterity:</strong> Reduced weapon motion and full ADS on slides, dives, and wall jumps. Take less fall damage. This is an Enforcer (red) perk.</p><p dir="ltr">This is the most popular pick for the third perk slot. Dexterity is what you'll want to equip to make the most of Black Ops 7's omnimovement while engaging in gunfights.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tracker:</strong> See rough locations of nearby enemies on your minimap and see their footsteps in the world. Aiming down sights auto-pings enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">If you don't care as much about the movement aspects, Tracker is a great perk for getting more intel. This perk lets you follow highlighted footsteps and hunt your enemy on the map.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Bankroll:</strong> Start each life with +150 score towards scorestreaks. This is in the Recon (blue) perk category.</p><p dir="ltr">Bankroll is great if you normally struggle to earn streaks or just want to give yourself a boost to earn them faster.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Best_Wildcard_picks">Best Wildcard picks</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4579847-wildcards.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579847" data-ratio="0.56328125" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4579847-wildcards.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579847"></a><figcaption>Black Ops 7 Wildcards</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4579847-wildcards.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Treyarch's Wildcard system returns in Black Ops 7. Each loadout can be equipped with one Wildcard to help you further customize and make your loadout feel even more powerful. Here are some recommended options:</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Overkill: </strong>Equip any non-melee weapon in Primary and Secondary slots.</p><p dir="ltr">Overkill lets you run an additional primary weapon. This is great for pairing something slow, like a sniper rifle or marksman rifle, with something faster, like a submachine gun. This lets you be prepared for more situations.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Gunfighter: </strong>Get three extra attachments for your primary weapon.</p><p dir="ltr">Gunfighter lets you add three more attachments to create a very powerful weapon build.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Perk Greed:</strong> Equip an extra perk.</p><p dir="ltr">It's always handy to have an extra perk, especially with so many good perks being stacked in the Tier 1 slot.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Combat_Specialties">Combat Specialties</h2><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 7 includes a Specialty Bonus system similar to Black Ops 6. The three perks you select for your loadout will determine your Combat Specialty.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For the first time in its robust 50-year history, GAMA has announced some major changes. The trade organization known for hosting Origins Game Fair and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/gama-expo-will-be-moving-to-baltimore-in-future" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GAMA Expo</a> will be rebranding and announcing a new ten-year plan towards the health of the global tabletop industry.</p>

<h2>The New GAMA Ten-Year Project</h2>

<p>According to an in-depth report by <a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2025/10/02/gama-unveils-10-year-plan-to-become-epicenter-of-global-tabletop-gaming-industry-renames-itself-after-almost-50-years/" rel="nofollow">Board Game Wire</a>, the new ten-year project for GAMA is for the organization to become the new epicentre of the global tabletop industry. This project encompasses a comprehensive range of plans to enhance GAMA membership globally and diversify its financial support, shifting its focus from solely sponsoring tabletop expos to leading the conversation on industry sustainability.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gama-expo-promo-screenshot.jpg?itok=EfYgj4we 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gama-expo-promo-screenshot.jpg?itok=DAW_X9Pu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In addition, GAMA's plan will continue their ongoing advocacy within the tabletop space, such as its lawsuits <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/gama-joins-second-anti-tariff-lawsuit-against-trump-administration" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">against the Trump administration's</a> disruptive trade tariffs and their wholesome promotion of the board game hobby through <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/gama-brings-game-store-day-to-flgs-retailers-this-november" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Game Store Day</a>.</p>

<p>The plan was spearheaded by President Nicole Brady. According to Brady, this shift was to allow the organization to manage important issues better long-term than "playing whack-a-mole" on a case-by-case basis. It was during an online "town hall" meeting that Brady articulated the future of the organization as a global one that treats the industry as more than just a hobby.</p>

<p>This push for formal organization and management is the impetus for the organization's new name. While originally known as the Game Manufacturers Association, the organization will now be known as GAMA: The Tabletop Association. As an official statement from the organization reads:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The tabletop game industry has grown far beyond where we were in 1977 when we were founded. Our new name honors that evolution while maintaining our legacy of nearly 50 years of serving the tabletop industry.&nbsp;We’re excited to move forward under a banner that celebrates the full spectrum of our industry and the people who shape it."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for immediate plans, GAMA's focus in the next two years will be on an anti-counterfeit initiative, education and certification programs, providing professional resources, and reaching out to media about business-relevant topics.&nbsp;</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-tips-guides-side-quests-2000631593</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/5-things-to-know-before-starting-digimon-story-time-stranger.1316152/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>In most ways, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-the-kotaku-review-2000630341"><i><span>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</span></i></a> <span>isn’t a complicated RPG. The turn-based monster tamer’s battles are mostly straightforward, and it’s got waypoints telling you where to go for most missions. However, after spending 40 hours in the game, I do have a few quick tips for those of you heading to the Digital World now that the game is out. Grab your Digivice and let’s go.</span></p> <h2><b>You will lose access to side quests for dozens of hours</b></h2> <p><span>Easily the most frustrating thing I encountered in my first playthrough of </span><i><span>Time Stranger </span></i><span>was the way it gates side quests. Without getting into spoilers, there’s a point when the game will warn you that some of the side quests you’ve been doing will be inaccessible for an undetermined amount of time. Years of playing video games had me expecting this meant I wouldn’t be able to complete those quests until I finished the story mission I was about to embark on. As it turns out, it would be dozens of hours before I could go back to those quests. This would normally have been fine, but side quests have a lot more to offer in </span><i><span>Time Stranger </span></i><span>than just a side story and some loot. Throughout the game, you’ll get Anomaly Points that raise your Agent rank. Digivolution levels are gated behind leveling up this rank, and if you can’t complete more quests, you might be stuck at a lower rank and unable to level up your party until much, </span><i><span>much </span></i><span>later in the game. So heed this warning when you hit it, because it really fails to adequately warn you just how long it will be before you can go back to those missions.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Using items doesn’t cost you a turn</b></h2> <p><span>One of the merciful things </span><i><span>Time Stranger </span></i><span>does is that it allows you to use an item </span><i><span>and </span></i><span>attack each turn, rather than choosing between them. This means you’ll be able to heal up your team, raise stats, or remove a status effect without having to give up doing some damage as well. A lot of other turn-based RPGs tend to make you choose between these options as a strategic challenge, but you’ll be glad </span><i><span>Time Stranger</span></i><span> doesn’t when you endure one of its long, drawn-out boss fights.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Upgrading your Agent rank helps circumvent grind</b></h2> <p><span>Those Anomaly points you get for completing quests are used to upgrade your Agent rank, which enables you to unlock Agent skills on a skill tree. Some of these perks are universal, such as giving you access to new high-impact Cross Arts abilities that can benefit your whole team. However, some of them are applied only to certain Digimon with different personality types. If you go down one skill tree, you’ll be able to raise stats and experience for the friendly Digimon in your team, while another path will grant you those perks for brave Digimon. So don’t just go down these skill trees without some plan in place, as they can help you reach powerful new heights if you target specific traits and personality types. It’s much simpler than grinding random battles.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Don’t get precious about saving your Cross Art</b></h2> <p><span>Cross Arts abilities can have a wide variety of uses in battles. They can heal your team, raise their stats, or they can take a chunk of your enemy’s health bar down and leave them with debuffs for a few turns. Since they can be so impactful, you might feel like you need to hold your Cross Art for a big boss fight, but this ability charges up fast when you do pretty much anything in battle. Attacking an enemy or using an item can give you points toward your Cross Arts gauge, so it’s pretty easy to fire off multiple uses of this in a longer fight. Feel free to use it often, and keep in mind that the more actions you can do in a turn, the more charge you’ll get toward using it again.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>Try to have a rideable Digimon on your team at all times</b></h2> <p><span>Some Digimon can double as both a party member and a rideable mount. I rode my Growlmon for much of the game, but when he digivolved to WarGrowlmon, he couldn’t carry me on his shoulders anymore. Thankfully, WereGarurumon stepped up and put me on his shoulder, and later, when he became MetalGarurumon, I was able to ride on his back. Riding your Digimon gets you places faster than walking on foot, but as they transform into new, stronger versions of themselves, they might lose the ability to carry you around. Just be mindful of this as you move throughout the evolution tree.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Jumping out of the Netflix animated movie and into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, the KPop Demon Hunters have arrived for some Demon Rush, a new Halloween month riff on Horde Rush.</p>
<p><iframe title="KPop Demon Hunters Takes Over Fortnite" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5ipctlvNePk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>KPop Demon Hunters has been a huge hit on Netflix, an animated movie from the studio behind Spider-Man: Into The Spiderverse that sees a trio of demon hunting KPop stars face off against demons that are now starting to fight them at their own game. It features the performances of Jeongyeon, Jihyo and Chaeyoung of Twice for the musical numbers, with the film’s soundtrack having plenty of success in its own right.</p>
<p>Anyway,&nbsp;Demon Rush is a limited time event, a revamped version of Horde Rush that sees Rumi, Mira, and Zoey fight endless waves of demons, and with KPop Demon Hunters inspired perks to use. The mode is available from 2nd October through 1st November.</p>
<p>Of course, this spills over to the Battle Royale and Blitz modes, with Rumi, Mira and Zoey outfits, accessories and emotes in the Fortnite Shop, and new new items available by completing quests including Rumi’s Sword and Mira’s X-tra Spicy Ramyeon.</p>

<p>And the tie in also extends to both Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN) and Fortnite Creative, using the assets for this movie tie in for their own creations.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Viral Medieval Shooter With Giant Armies Gets Indefinitely Delayed Just Days Before Launch]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/kingmakers-delay-medieval-shooter-steam-early-access-date-2000631559</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/viral-medieval-shooter-with-giant-armies-gets-indefinitely-delayed-just-days-before-launch.1316125/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Kingmakers</em> was due out in Early Access in just a few days but it’s apparently not ready yet. The medieval sandbox shooter has been indefinitely delayed as the team at Redemption Road works on getting everything working as intended. “We just need a bit more time on content polish before we feel good about charging money for it,” the studio wrote in an announcement on Friday.</p> <p>Odds are you’ve seen a <a href="https://kotaku.com/this-time-hopping-action-game-brings-a-grenade-launcher-1851274937">bit of <em>Kingmakers</em> here or there</a> over the years, even if you didn’t know it. The multiplayer game features sprawling maps and giant armies and is supposed to facilitate real-time destruction as you engage in everything from medieval combat to blowing up a bunch of armor-clad knights with tanks. The game’s impressive physics simulation helped it go viral on social media, land a big trailer at Summer Game Fest this year, and become the sixth most-wishlisted game on Steam. So it’s surprising to see it pulled from launch at the last minute.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/HhiDBLQrOS">pic.twitter.com/HhiDBLQrOS</a></p> <p>— Ian Fisch – Lead Coder on Kingmakers (wishlist!) (@Ian_Fisch) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ian_Fisch/status/1974143748419563537?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“After much contemplation, we realize that the scheduled<em> Kingmakers</em> launch on October 8 will no longer be possible,” the team <a href="https://x.com/Ian_Fisch/status/1974143748419563537">announced today</a>. “We want to apologize to all of the fans who are eagerly anticipating this game. We are sorry for letting you down.”</p>

 <p>The rest of the message goes on to try to explain why the game is being indefinitely delayed. TL;DR:<em> Kingmakers</em> is ambitions and delivering on that is hard!</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">GTA6, but you're dropped in the 1400s.<br>No cops. Just the angry knights you ran over 🚗 <a href="https://t.co/tLmQjUgmM3">pic.twitter.com/tLmQjUgmM3</a></p> <p>— Kingmakers ⚔️ (@Kingmakers_Game) <a href="https://twitter.com/Kingmakers_Game/status/1929956825589584144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“We currently have tens of thousands of soldiers, each with AI and pathfinding that rivals what you’d expect from an AAA third-person shooter,” Redemption Road states. “When you walk away from a battle, it continues to play out. Nothing is faked. We have giant 6-story castles where every room can be entered and every wall, floor, and ceiling destroyed. When you build a lumbermill, it’s a real place that can be entered, or, in an enemy invasion, turned into a combat arena.”</p> <p>The studio doesn’t really go into much more detail than that but promises that a deep-dive overview will be livestreamed soon to update players on where things are at. That makes it sound like the delay won’t just be a couple of weeks or months. Will it still be out before the end of 2026? We’ll see. “We’re making sure everyone who buys the game is enthralled and feels like their money was well spent,” the developers wrote.</p>

If Zombies doesn't show up when you boot up the beta, Activision recommends restarting the client.</p><p>The Black Ops 7 beta also added new multiplayer content today, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-all-maps/2900-7062/" data-ref-id="2900-7062">the map Imprint</a>.

In it, Kratos climbs Mount Olympus as he seeks to reach its zenith and bring his full might down upon the gods who wronged him.

It’s as playable as it is collectable, and it earns its spot as the set’s tenth hottest seller.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Lillie’s Determination – 119/132 (Uncommon)</h2></div><div catalogid="2dce66b8-2022-48cf-9c52-e0e3ddf24bc6" id="228665"><div id="228665" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lillie's Determination - 119/132</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Currently trading around $8.99, this budget-friendly Supporter has nonetheless become a staple. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The effect, of <a href="https://zdcs.link/ao6voe?object_uuid=00e6cc59-5995-4504-98ae-f4364156b82c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lillie’s Determination</a>, refreshing your hand and potentially drawing up to eight cards if you’re at full Prizes, makes it both flexible and efficient. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Collectors also appreciate Atsushi Furusawa’s sunny artwork, which frames Lillie in a lovely pastoral scene, making even the lowest-rarity printing feel special.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Lillie’s Determination – 169/132 (Ultra Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="2dce66b8-2022-48cf-9c52-e0e3ddf24bc6" id="228666"><div id="228666" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lillie's Determination - 169/132</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Jumping up in price, this version of <a href="https://zdcs.link/QWERLd?object_uuid=00e6cc59-5995-4504-98ae-f4364156b82c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lillie’s Determination</a> sits at about $38. While this variant of the card shares the same gameplay text, its foil treatment and alternate pose of Lillie in a breezy summer outfit elevate it for collectors. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Competitively useful and aesthetically pleasing, it hits that sweet spot of playability and visual charm for lovers of both the Mega Evolution set and the Pokémon Trading Card Game in general..</p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Mega Venusaur ex – 177/132 (Special Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="2dce66b8-2022-48cf-9c52-e0e3ddf24bc6" id="228667"><div id="228667" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Venusaur ex - 177/132</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At roughly $220, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QmOlAn?object_uuid=00e6cc59-5995-4504-98ae-f4364156b82c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Venusaur ex</a> shows why Grass decks are back in the conversation. Its Solar Transfer ability allows players to reposition Energy across the board, while Jungle Dump brings a hefty 240 damage and healing on top. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The bold, almost neon background complements Venusaur’s bulk, making it one of the most visually explosive cards of the set.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6.

The card’s Evidence Gathering ability lets you effectively cycle a card from hand into your deck, smoothing consistency in unexpected ways. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mina Nakai’s gritty alleyway artwork adds narrative noir flair, giving this otherwise humble Stage 1 the kind of character that turns heads.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Mega Lucario ex – 179/132 (Special Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="2dce66b8-2022-48cf-9c52-e0e3ddf24bc6" id="228669"><div id="228669" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Lucario ex - 179/132</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This Special Illustration Rare of <a href="https://zdcs.link/9l2eRx?object_uuid=00e6cc59-5995-4504-98ae-f4364156b82c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Lucario ex</a> currently fetches about $280, and it’s easy to see why. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Aura Jab accelerating Fighting Energy and Mega Brave hitting for a massive 270, Lucario slots perfectly into aggressive decks. The art, by 5ban Graphics, depicts Lucario mid-leap with fierce energy bursts against a Mega Venusaur, a dynamic visual that mirrors its high-impact playstyle.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Lillie’s Determination – 184/132 (Special Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="2dce66b8-2022-48cf-9c52-e0e3ddf24bc6" id="228670"><div id="228670" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lillie's Determination - 184/132</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Another entry for <a href="https://zdcs.link/aDrJLN?object_uuid=00e6cc59-5995-4504-98ae-f4364156b82c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lillie’s Determination</a>, and this one’s both the most valuable and in-demand, going for around $225. The floral backdrop and soft colour palette make this perhaps the most elegant version. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond its art, the card remains a valuable draw engine in decks seeking early-game acceleration, ensuring it appeals to both sides of the player base.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Mega Lucario ex – 188/132 (Hyper Mega Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="2dce66b8-2022-48cf-9c52-e0e3ddf24bc6" id="228671"><div id="228671" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Lucario ex - 188/132</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The undisputed third best-seller, the golden <a href="https://zdcs.link/QdpZGv?object_uuid=00e6cc59-5995-4504-98ae-f4364156b82c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Lucario ex</a> card is topping Pokemon TCG listings charts at a staggering $900 price against a $570 market price. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Aura Jab enabling Energy recovery and Mega Brave delivering 270 damage like its other versions, this card exemplifies the high-risk, high-reward nature of Mega ex. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The gold finish, courtesy of 5ban Graphics, turns Lucario into a gleaming centrepiece. Competitive players want it, collectors covet it, and together they’ve pushed it to the very peak. If you have one of the cheaper versions of Mega Lucario ex, it’s better to keep this one safe in your binder rather than put in your deck.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Marshadow – 146/132 (Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="2dce66b8-2022-48cf-9c52-e0e3ddf24bc6" id="228672"><div id="228672" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Marshadow - 146/132</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Marshadow has spiked dramatically since launch, with listings around $110 vs an $73 market price.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Hori has announced another addition to the ever-growing list of cheaper alternatives to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/684602/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-review">Nintendo’s $90 Switch 2 Pro Controller</a>. The Wireless Horipad Turbo is around $35 cheaper than Nintendo’s, and while it lacks a lot of premium features such as Amiibo support and the ability to remotely wake the Switch 2, it adds a lock button on the back that disables the buttons in the middle of the controller. That includes the Home and Screenshot shortcuts so they won’t do anything if accidentally pressed in the middle of a game.</p><p>The Wireless Horipad Turbo is currently <a href="https://horistore.com/shop/g/gnsx-126/">available for preorder in Japan through Hori’s online store</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0FRM1SR6Z?th=1">Amazon Japan</a> for 7,980 yen, or about $54, in mist black, aquasian, shine yellow, frost white, and ruby magenta color options. It’s expected to launch before the year is out. There are no details on when or if it may see a US release, or if pricing will be comparable if it does, but it will be compatible with all versions of the Switch.</p><p>Aside from the use of translucent housing, the Horipad Turbo looks very similar to Nintendo’s Switch 2 Pro Controller, including the game chat button located between the D-pad and right analog joystick. Hori has opted for drift-resistant <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/643886/joystick-drift-tunneling-magnetoresistance-tmr-hall-effect-gaming-solution">tunneling magnetoresistance</a> (TMR) joysticks instead of Hall effect or capacitive options, which alone could make it more appealing than Nintendo’s gamepad. But the company has also skipped other features, including a 3.5mm headphone jack.</p><p>You will find an extra set of buttons on the back of the Horipad Turbo, and the company has gone the extra mile by allowing you to remap the functionality of the action, shoulder, and trigger buttons, as well as the D-pad and joysticks. You can even reprogram a single button to replicate the functionality of two others simultaneously, and you can activate rapidfire using an additional button on the front of the gamepad featuring the red, white, and blue Hori logo.</p><p>The lock button on the back of the Horipad Turbo can be toggled between disabling the Hori, Home, and Screenshot buttons. There’s also an option that locks the plus and minus buttons, ensuring you won’t pop into a menu screen at an inopportune time with an accidental press.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/791438/hori-wireless-horipad-turbo-nintendo-switch-2-controller]]></content:encoded>

But is it any good? Well, Swifties are sorting through their feelings.</span></p> <p><span>Like most of Swift’s work, </span><i><span>The Life of a Showgirl</span></i><span> is pretty transparent in its references to her personal life.

So there’s some lore to unpack with a lot of these songs, but the ones that are getting the most attention right now are the ones that seem to reference her </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-engaged-ring-reaction-2000620394"><span>fiancé Travis Kelce’s hog</span></a><span> and seem to escalate an apparent feud between her and pop star Charli XCX that, at least publicly, appears largely one-sided at the moment.</span></p> <p><span>Let’s start with the song that is all about how well-endowed the Kansas City football player is. “Wood” starts out with a funky riff and a catchy beat, and you can already hear the Sabrina Carpenter influence in the composition. Then you hear the lyrics and you can tell that Swift is trying to emulate the </span><i><span>Short n’ Sweet </span></i><span>singer’s trademark graphic, sexual punchlines. Here, let’s look at the lyrics of the second verse.</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>Forgive me, it sounds cocky</span></p> <p><span>He ah-matized me and openеd my eyes</span></p> <p><span>Redwood tree, it ain’t hard to see</span></p> <p><span>His lovе was the key that opened my thighs</span></p> <p><span>Girls, I don’t need to catch the bouquet, mm</span></p> <p><span>To know a hard rock is on the way</span></p> <p><span>And baby, I’ll admit I’ve been a little superstitious</span></p> <p><span>The curse on me was broken by your magic wand</span></p> <p><span>Seems to be that you and me, we make our own luck</span></p> <p><span>New Heights of manhood</span></p></blockquote>   <p><span>If the clear reference to Kelce’s </span><i><span>New Heights </span></i><span>podcast wasn’t enough to make it clear that this is about her man’s schlong, the reference to a “hard rock” like the one on her finger would make it pretty clear. There’s an episode of </span><i><span>How I Met Your Mother </span></i><span>in which Marshall (Jason Segal) realizes he can’t tell any sexy stories from his dating life to his friends without everyone knowing they’re about his long-time partner Lily (Alyson Hannigan) because she’s the only one he’s really been with. Part of what makes love songs such a popular genre of music is that there’s a universality to them that people can project onto their own relationships. Who among us wouldn’t love to sing about a man’s dick lifting a curse and solving all our problems? But Swift’s very public personal life and clear references to her husband-to-be mean that I can’t hear this song without knowing whose dick it’s about.</span></p>   <p><span>That being said, the song is pretty catchy. What Swift may lack in Carpenter’s clever jokes, she makes up for in a fun song about love and lust. And hey, Kelce seems cool with it?</span></p>   <p><span>One song I have a less charitable read on, however, is “Actually Romantic,” which takes the other side of “everyone knowing your business” and seems to be essentially a diss track against Charli XCX. For those who don’t know, Charli has a song called “Sympathy Is a Knife” on the album </span><i><span>Brat</span></i><span> that addresses her insecurities in the pop girl space, and seemingly references Swift specifically triggering those feelings of comparison in her. “Actually Romantic” is being called a diss track aimed at the “360” singer, and at first blush, some think Swift may have straight-up misunderstood the intent behind “Sympathy Is a Knife,” which is actually fairly complimentary to her.&nbsp;</span></p>   <p><span>However, “Actually Romantic” does seem to gesture at further drama behind the scenes, even as Swift has been publicly supportive of Charli. Specifically, it references Swift’s past relationship with Matty Healy of the band 1975, which also includes Charli’s husband George Daniel, and things Charli has allegedly said about Swift in private.</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>I heard you call me ‘Boring Barbie’ when the coke’s got you brave&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>High-fived my ex and then said you’re glad he ghosted me&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Wrote me a song saying it makes you sick to see my face</span></p> <p><span>Some people might be offended&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>But it’s actually sweet&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>All the time you’ve spent on me.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>I guess I can buy that maybe there’s more happening than “Sympathy Is a Knife” lets on. It’s giving </span><i><span>Reputation</span></i><span> era, when Swift was very publicly calling out other public figures like Kanye West and Kim Kardashian, or </span><i><span>1989</span></i><span>’s “Bad Blood” which referenced her now-ended feud with pop star </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/katy-perry-womans-world-music-video-pokemon-pikachu-1851590464"><span>Katy Perry</span></a><span>. Again, it’s the effect of someone’s personal life being so public that these songs end up weaving a story that’s already playing out on social media and in gossip magazines. Though if this is all spun off from “Sympathy Is a Knife,” then it feels like punching down.</span></p> <p><span>The problem with </span><i><span>Life of a Showgirl</span></i><span> is that Swift’s status as a billionaire mega-celebrity clashes against the “relatable” persona she exhibits in her music here more than ever before. “Eldest Daughter” laments how mean everyone on the internet can be, when she’s enveloped in a massive cocoon of wealth and status. Like, girl, why are you even reading TikTok comments when you could be doing literally anything else with all that money?</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="und" dir="ltr">lol <a href="https://t.co/a78pUaSvCU">https://t.co/a78pUaSvCU</a> <a href="https://t.co/quyrERr07R">pic.twitter.com/quyrERr07R</a></p> <p>— grace spelman (@GraceSpelman) <a href="https://twitter.com/GraceSpelman/status/1973974944607580252?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Another song that really sticks out as an expression of Swift imagining threats to her status is “CANCELLED!” which I saw someone say is destined to become the new anthem of MAGA wine moms, and I can’t stop thinking about it. As the title suggests, the song is all about perceived judgments of her for who she chooses to associate with, with her singing that she likes her friends “cancelled” and cloaked in “scandal.” Broadly, this could be a song about cancel culture and how Swift is unwilling to drop people just because they run afoul of public scrutiny, but given that she has </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fauxmoi/comments/1n4fj0i/taylor_swift_celebrates_brittany_maga_mahomes/"><span>friends who are public Trump supporters</span></a><span>, that feels like underselling or minimizing people’s criticism as some kind of petty scandal, rather than a legitimate concern.</span></p>   <p><span>Ultimately, all of these reactions are born from the relationship with her fandom that Swift has cultivated over her decades-long career. When your personal life is the source of the characters and stories people listen for references to in each song, every album is like a new season of a television show for which millions of people tune in just to lap up every new lore drop. But is the music any good? In my first listen, I came away thinking that </span><i><span>Life of a Showgirl </span></i><span>is an obvious low point in Swift’s discography. I don’t think I’m alone in that assessment, but the album has been out for all of 12 hours at this point, and people will sort their feelings out over the next few weeks or months. Tonight, Swift is putting out a movie in theaters called </span><i><span>The Official Release Party of a Showgirl</span></i><span>, which will include commentary and context for the album from Swift. Maybe that will work in its favor. For now, the music is speaking for itself. For better or worse.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/fEAu5T8XnL">pic.twitter.com/fEAu5T8XnL</a></p> <p>— emily (@grIgenius) <a href="https://twitter.com/grIgenius/status/1973971796795011134?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">every year a taylor swift album comes out and she goes roses are red grass is green i love travis and my haters are mean and her fans go Omgggggg the lyricism</p> <p>— zade (@zadtwt) <a href="https://twitter.com/zadtwt/status/1973855618890158350?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">she did it omg <a href="https://t.co/pRaiOFRgtG">https://t.co/pRaiOFRgtG</a> <a href="https://t.co/idYwgDuRH0">pic.twitter.com/idYwgDuRH0</a></p> <p>— Wendell (@RhodeToLove) <a href="https://twitter.com/RhodeToLove/status/1973970282617667816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">yall im CRYINGNSIDNDHF <a href="https://t.co/nC25tp2KcZ">pic.twitter.com/nC25tp2KcZ</a></p> <p>— allypally (@allypallyxcx) <a href="https://twitter.com/allypallyxcx/status/1974027869689983175?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/3CIXeCfhyy">https://t.co/3CIXeCfhyy</a> <a href="https://t.co/NAQvUVy9Qp">pic.twitter.com/NAQvUVy9Qp</a></p> <p>— The Coke That Made Charli xcx Brave (@Neil_McNeil) <a href="https://twitter.com/Neil_McNeil/status/1974002104575328501?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/O23bECsSMr">https://t.co/O23bECsSMr</a> <a href="https://t.co/iK8u3dO19T">pic.twitter.com/iK8u3dO19T</a></p> <p>— keira (@kettlevinyl) <a href="https://twitter.com/kettlevinyl/status/1973991187330576725?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">These aren’t lyrics born of depth, just reference points engineered to ride the current wave internet talking points like ‘eldest daughters suffer more than jesus’ and spark a shallow ‘she’s just like me’ emotion from its listener.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Masters of Albion Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Masters of Albion is in the works by Molyneux's independent studio, 22cans, which he founded in 2012 after leaving Lionhead Studios. The game, which has players managing a medieval village, currently lacks a release window.</p><p>Molyneux, most famous for designing the god game Black &amp; White and the first three Fable games, is perhaps equally as famous for his pre-release hyperbolic and over-enthusiastic descriptions of his games, often leading to disappointment when they fall short of expectations or lack promised features.</p><p>To his credit, Molyneux is aware of his tendency to exaggerate, telling Edge: "I know people are going to say, 'Come on, it won't be your last game,' but, you know, I'm 66 years old." The veteran developer, who once <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/peter-molyneux-doesn-t-plan-to-retire-i-m-just-gonna-die/1100-6418258/" data-ref-id="1100-6418258">said in 2014 that he's "just gonna die"</a> instead of retiring, added: "I'm working as hard as I've ever worked in my life. And I just haven't got the life energy left to do this again."</p><p>Even after the public reveal of Masters of Albion, Molyneux expressed the possibility that this <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/peter-molyneux-says-masters-of-albion-could-be-his-last-game-due-to-his-smoking-drinking/1100-6526010/" data-ref-id="1100-6526010">next game could be his last</a>, speaking candidly (and rather morbidly) about his lifestyle, which includes smoking and drinking.</p><p>"I started to ask… what should I focus on? I was 60 at the time and this realization came to me that this next game could be my last," Molyneux said in 2024. "I am not announcing I'm retiring. I'll be found dead one morning with my head pressed against the keyboard."</p>
