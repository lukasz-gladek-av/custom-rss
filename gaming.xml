            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-is-ending-online-support-for-need-for-speed-rivals-in-october-2025.1240482/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>EA has announced that online support for Need for Speed: Rivals will be ending later this year on October 7, 2025. The shutdown was spotted by <a href="https://delistedgames.com/ea-returns-today-to-announce-need-for-speed-rivals-will-lose-online-services-october-7th/">Delisted Games</a>, where a reader noticed Rivals had been added to <a href="https://www.ea.com/legal/service-updates/i-q#:~:text=N-,October%207%2C%202025,-NEED%20FOR%20SPEED">EA's list of games</a> that are getting their online services shutdown.</p>



<p>Need for Speed: Rivals launched over a decade ago, on November 15, 2013, and originally launched for PS3, Xbox 360, and PC, before coming to Xbox One and PS4 a year later in October 2014. The shutdown of online services is for the PS4 and Xbox One versions of the game, meaning that players on those devices and on current-gen PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles, will no longer be able to play any of the game's online modes after October 7, 2025.</p>



<p>Racing against other players online is the core driving factor for why most racing fans play racing games, Need for Speed included, but at least in the case of Rivals, there is still an offline mode for players to dig into, if they want to revisit Rivals after October 7. But that's not the case for several online-focused games that have been shut down recently, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/anthem-going-offline-2026-ea/">Anthem</a>, which EA recently announced will have its online functionality shut down in early 2026, effectively making the game unplayable.</p>



<p>Games like Anthem essentially being taken away from players is at the crux of the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Killing Games</a> campaign, which is trying to get legislation passed that prohibits developers and publishers from taking away rights that they sold to players at the point of the game's purchase. </p>



<p>The campaign began last year and has recently been a hot topic of discussion regarding game preservation, as the petition recently surpassed 1 million signatures. In response, several of the video game industry's biggest publishers and developers, many of whom pull in hundreds of millions of dollars each year, some of them even billions, <a href="https://wccftech.com/publishers-argue-stop-killing-games-proposals-would-make-online-games-prohibitively-expensive/">claimed that the proposals made by Stop Killing Games, if accepted</a>, would make creating online-focused games "<em>prohibitively expensive</em>."</p>



<p>Minecraft creator Markus Persson, commonly known as Notch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/minecraft-creator-buying-game-purchase-pirating-not-theft/">also recently weighed in on the campaign</a>, saying "<em>If buying a game is not a purchase, then pirating them is not theft</em>," referencing the argument from publishers that players don't actually buy games at the point of purchase, but a license to play them until such time that publisher decides players don't get that privilege any more. </p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/total-war-warhammer-iii-tides-of-torment-dlc-delayed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/total-war-warhammer-iii-tides-of-torment-dlc-delayed-to-later-this-year.1240476/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Creative Assembly and publisher Sega have announced that&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer III</em>'s upcoming&nbsp;<em>Tides of Torment&nbsp;</em>DLC has been delayed to "later this year".</p>

<p>Originally,&nbsp;<em>Tides of Torment&nbsp;</em>was intended to launch this summer, but as Creative Assembly reveals in a <a href="https://community.creative-assembly.com/total-war/total-war-warhammer/blogs/75" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">new blog post</a>, the DLC won't be meeting that release window. Instead,&nbsp;<em>Tides of Torment&nbsp;</em>will be launching sometime later in 2025, although the studio doesn't commit to a more specific release window than that.</p>

<p>Creative Assembly says that during recent playtesting for&nbsp;<em>Tides of Torment</em>, the studio's developers asked themselves if the DLC "met the standards...set in recent releases", and as you've probably gathered from the delay, the answer was no.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/total-war-warhammer-iii-tides-of-torment-delayed-firebreathing_0.jpg?itok=YsOA1tEi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/total-war-warhammer-iii-tides-of-torment-delayed-firebreathing_0.jpg?itok=aGDp_7tf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Total War: Warhammer III</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Tides of Torment&nbsp;</em>DLC is going to take a bit longer to launch.</figcaption></figure><p>As a result of this dissatisfaction, Creative Assembly says it's going to spend some time "working on [<em>Tides of Torment</em>], reviewing the content, and improving the gameplay experiences that it’s set to bring".</p>

<p>That also means that the info shared as part of the Slaanesh and Norsca previews released back in May is probably "no longer accurate", according to Creative Assembly. More will be shared about these factions, as well as the third and final DLC faction, when the final What's Next video for&nbsp;<em>Tides of Torment&nbsp;</em>arrives.</p>

<p>The studio acknowledges that this year "has been a slower year" for many&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer&nbsp;</em>fans, and that while <i>Warhammer III&nbsp;</i>"is in a better space" this year than in previous years, Creative Assembly is "currently not meeting [its] commitments" to transparency, pledging to address this issue over the next few months through new updates, hotfixes, and preview videos.</p>

<p>With regards to the future of&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer III</em>, Creative Assembly closes by saying that "one of the biggest <em>Total War: Warhammer</em> content packs ever created in the trilogy" is coming next year, and that the possibility of smaller DLC packs that include certain legendary lords or hero units is also on the table.</p>




<p><em>Total War: Warhammer III&nbsp;</em>is available to check out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1142710/Total_War_WARHAMMER_III/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, and you can remind yourself of what our very own Andrew thought of the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/total-war-warhammer-3-review" rel="nofollow">right here</a>. The&nbsp;<em>Tides of Torment&nbsp;</em>DLC is set to launch sometime later this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Travis Scott’s new music video for 2000 Excursion has set tongues wagging after fans spotted what looks like a reference to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA 6</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At 3:56 in the <a href="https://youtu.be/dwuYa2DcC-o?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a>, we see a car with the license plate “GTA6 VI6.” That is, undoubtedly, a GTA 6 reference, but is it a tease for the rapper’s appearance in the game? That feels unlikely, given the strict control developer Rockstar employs over everything related to GTA that is public-facing. Perhaps it’s just an Easter egg, or a joke.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/10/screenshot-2025-07-10-153846-1752158367371.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Travis Scott’s new music video for 2000 Excursion has sparked GTA 6 speculation. Image credit: <a href="https://youtu.be/dwuYa2DcC-o?feature=shared">Travis Scott / YouTube</a>.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Either way, GTA 6 fans are speculating that Travis Scott will now appear in GTA 6 in some way, either with his own radio station (as celebs have done in previous GTA games) or as a character we see in the game. Perhaps Travis Scott just has a song in the game. Others are joking that the “VI6” part of the license plate means Travis Scott is already excited for GTA 12.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Travis Scott is no stranger to the world of video games. He famously starred in a live virtual concert in Fortnite, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-travis-scott-fortnite-event-is-a-completely-immersive-experience">which fueled huge concurrent numbers for Epic’s battle royale</a> back in 2020.

GTA 6 is the most anticipated video game in the world, and it enjoys more fan theories than perhaps any piece of entertainment (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-community-devastated-by-gta-6-trailer-announcement-no-show-after-moon-theory-proved-incorrect">the less said about the moon, the better</a>).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">With anticipation for Fallout Season 2, fans are wondering if Bethesda will capitalize on the smash hit Amazon show in a more significant way this time around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/fallout-the-series">Fallout Season 1</a> hit Prime Video in April 2024 and was an instant breakout hit. While the show’s popularity sparked a flood of new players across all Fallout games, Bethesda — and by extension parent company Microsoft — failed to make the most of it with, for example, the release of a new Fallout game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-explains-why-not-having-a-new-fallout-game-ready-for-the-fallout-tv-shows-launch-actually-worked-out-for-the-best">Xbox boss Phil Spencer ended up insisting that everyone involved benefited from the show’s success</a>, and that not having a new game lined up for the launch “gave us some creative liberty that [we] wouldn't have had if we tried to coordinate production of two very different creative processes to land at the same time.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That mention of “creative liberty” is a reference to the Fallout TV show’s canon status within <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-official-timeline-confirmed-how-the-show-fits-in-with-the-games"><u>the Fallout timeline</u></a>, and the fact it takes place after all the existing Fallout games. While this has meant <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-fans-are-convinced-a-brotherhood-of-steel-airship-confirms-one-of-two-canon-endings-from-fallout-4"><u>Fallout lore fans have analyzed the TV show to within an inch of its life</u></a>, its creators were able to move on from what’s gone before and tell a brand new story. If a new post-Fallout 4 video game had come out at the same time, Bethesda and the TV showrunners would have faced a tricky job ensuring all their Fallout timeline ducks were in a row.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But will Microsoft and Bethesda fail to capitalize on Season 2 of the Fallout show? When it comes to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>, at least, it sounds like tie-in content is indeed planned.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/fallout-season-2-fishing-tips-video-game-76-1236451304/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, Bethesda Game Studios’ Fallout 76 creative director Jon Rush said the development team is “always focused on the game,” but confirmed the two teams (TV show and video games) do talk to each other about “lining things up with the seasonal releases of the show.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think a distinct trait of the Fallout 76 game is that we’re the furthest back in time,” he said. “And it’s kind of funny, because the show’s the furthest into the future. So there’s a lot of room where we don’t necessarily need to overlap. There are some things that we could overlap the stories, that could exist, but we largely try to keep those pretty simple.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So the show is very effective storytelling, great storytelling, very Fallout, being made by folks that are big fans of the game and the series, and so are we. The two go together really well. So folks see the show and want more of that same kind of story, and they’re going to come into 76, they’re going to come into Fallout 4, or come into Fallout 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Lining things up with the seasonal releases of the show, it’s stuff that we talk about all the time, and we do have plans for things here and there. I’m not going to go into detail on any of those now, but the two teams do talk to one another.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Happy Bday Fallout: New Vegas</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, we don’t know what exactly Bethesda is planning for the launch of Fallout Season 2, but we do know <em>something</em> is in the works for Fallout 76. There are still a lot of unanswered questions. For one, we don’t have a Fallout Season 2 release date yet. Could Bethesda have a new Fallout video game in the works to go alongside the show? There is about as much anticipation for a new Fallout game as there is for Fallout Season 2 — and the speculation to go along with it as remaster and remake rumors swirl.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But perhaps we shouldn’t hold our breath. In June last year, Bethesda development chief Todd Howard said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-doesnt-feel-the-need-to-rush-fallout-5-in-the-wake-of-tv-shows-success"><u>he wasn't interested in rushing the next Fallout game out the door</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For other Fallout games in the future, you know, obviously I can’t talk about those right now, but I would say, sort of rushing through them, or we kind of need to get stuff out that is different than the work we’re doing in 76... we don’t feel like we need to rush any of that," he said. "The Fallout TV show fills a certain niche in terms of the franchise and storytelling."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, a brand new Fallout game is coming down the pipe, with Howard confirming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-5"><u>Fallout 5</u></a> is in the long-term plan, potentially after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi"><u>The Elder Scrolls 6</u></a> comes out. As for Fallout Season 2, it's off to New Vegas, the setting of Obsidian's much-loved <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

<p>Greetings, Arsians! We love games here at the Ars Orbiting HQ, and I'm not just talking the latest AAA blockbusters—we love <em>all</em> kinds of games, from modern to ancient and all points in between.</p>
<p>With that in mind, we're trying something different for the next few months to see how it goes: We've partnered with the folks at <a href="https://www.gog.com/">GOG.com</a> to create <a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8984087-15232592?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fpartner%2FArsTechnica">a store page featuring a hand-curated list</a> of some of our favorites from GOG's catalog. At the end of every month, we'll rotate a couple of titles off the list and add a few new ones; altogether, we have a list of about 50 games to set in front of you.</p>
<p>(Please forgive the messy affiliate link—it points to <code>https://www.gog.com/en/partner/ArsTechnica</code> if you'd prefer to go there directly, but arriving on GOG's site via that affiliate link gives Ars a small portion of revenue for anything you buy during your session once you're there. This helps us out quite a bit!)</p>
<p>About twice a month, we'll publish an article like this one, where we'll feature one of the games from the list—perhaps a retro game you've heard of, perhaps a modern title you missed. Regardless, GOG will have a DRM-free version of the game ready to go.</p>
<p>This is the first step in what will hopefully be a broader partnership where we'll offer neat stuff like GOG discount codes; keep your eyes peeled and I'll have the second July post in a couple of weeks with more details!</p>
<h2>This week’s game is <em>Star Trek: 25th Anniversary</em></h2>
<p>There weren't a lot of great Star Trek gaming options in the early '90s. If you wanted to put on your genuine licensed Starfleet uniform and save the galaxy in a starship named <em>Enterprise</em>, you were limited primarily to janky text-based titles like <em><a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/1210/star-trek-the-kobayashi-alternative/">Star Trek: The Kobayashi Alternative</a></em>.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>That changed with the 1992 release of <em><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8984087-15232592?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fstar_trek_25th_anniversary">Star Trek: 25th Anniversary</a></em>, or <em>ST25</em> to its friends, which brought the original series <em>Enterprise</em> and its crew to life in glorious 256-color VGA. And to players' vast relief, it was not a half-baked effort—locations like the <em>Enterprise</em> bridge were lovingly recreated, with beautiful atmospheric sound effects lifted straight from the TV show permeating every scene. The character art is sharp, and it's easy to tell Bones from Spock. The entire game is like a love letter to OG Trek.</p>

<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly given the time, <em>ST25</em> is a mouse-driven point-and-click adventure game. It's broken up into seven discrete chapters, with each chapter being a self-contained mission with problems to solve and objectives to accomplish. Starfleet Command is always watching—complete the minimum number of objectives and an admiral will give you a middling performance review. Go above and beyond and do everything, even your bonus objectives, and you'll have lavish praise heaped upon you by a grateful admiralty.</p>
<p>The missions themselves tend to follow a pattern. Each starts with the crew of the <em>Enterprise</em> on the bridge as Kirk makes a log entry. Starting with the CD-ROM issue of the game, all the lines are fully voiced by the original cast, so every mission kicks off with Bill Shatner's familiar "Captain's log..." lead-in telling us what we need to examine, investigate, locate, or shoot at. (Sadly, the only major voice cast omission in this one is Majel Barrett as the computer.)</p>
<p>Then there's what I always felt was the weakest part of the game: Most missions kick off with some sort of space battle, where the player has to awkwardly maneuver the <em>Enterprise</em> with the mouse, dodging phaser blasts and photon torpedoes (or just eating them because the controls are just that awful) and trying to blow the other ship up before it does the same to you.</p>

<p>Then, if you survive the mandatory space battle, you'll find yourself as Jim Kirk beaming down to a mysterious planet or over to an abandoned ship or station, scanning things with your tricorder and shooting things with your phaser. You're accompanied by a small landing party, most often made up of Spock, McCoy, and a redshirt, and no, the redshirt does <em>not</em> always make it back to the ship.</p>

<p>The game is at its best during these away missions, each of which is unique and all of which are absolutely swimming in note-perfect TOS nostalgia, from the sound effects to the visual design and intent. Layer on top of that some banter between McCoy and Spock while you work through some good ol' combine-object-X-with-object-Y adventure game puzzles, and you have an engaging and atmospheric little game, with enough complexity to keep you busy for at least a dozen hours or so.</p>

<p>And great news: If you really fall in love with the game, there's a sequel: <em><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/star_trek_judgment_rites">Star Trek: Judgment Rites</a></em>. <em>Judgment Rites</em> is essentially a straight continuation of <em>ST25</em>, made with the same engine, voice cast (this time with Majel Barrett), type of missions, and commitment to detail.</p>
<p>Feel like giving <em>Star Trek: 25th Anniversary</em> a whirl? <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8984087-15232592?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fstar_trek_25th_anniversary">Grab it for $9.99 on the GOG store!</a> The GOG-packaged bundle works out of the box on Windows and Linux, and since the GOG version is powered by DOSBox internally, making it work on a Mac should require only minor surgery.</p>

		<p>Creative Assembly has announced that it is delaying the release of the Total War: Warhammer III Tides of Torment DLC from this summer to later in the year, though no new date has yet been finalised. The reason being is that during playtesting the studio came to the conclusion that Tides of Torment was not meeting the standards expected.</p>
<p><iframe title="Total War: WARHAMMER III - Tides of Torment - Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zQNKhxbQKuM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a post, Creative Assembly said, <em>“<span><span>In recent playtesting, we asked ourselves if this next DLC met the standards that we’ve set in recent releases, and the short answer was no. However, we know it can and so we want to spend more time working on it, reviewing the content, and improving the gameplay experiences that it’s set to bring. </span></span><span><span>These changes will likely mean the content we shared in our What’s Next videos for Slaanesh and Norsca is no longer accurate. As soon as we know the final shape of those changes, we’ll share them to you directly as part of the final What’s Next video to give you the complete picture on our third faction in this DLC and the changes to the other factions.</span></span></em></p>
<p><em><span><span><span>We know this is disappointing news. 2025 has been a slower year for many of you in our Warhammer communities, and we’re not oblivious to that. We’re proud of the updates that we’ve released for the game this year, but we know that what you love most about this game is the option to experience more of it, especially through the new gameplay styles offered by new Legendary Lords, all of the unique new units , and the focus we give to reworks and core game improvements.&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Whilst the game is in a better space than in previous years thanks to the efforts we made through 2024, we are currently not meeting our commitments to be more active on these fronts, and we apologise for not being more transparent.”</span></span></em></p>

<p>Creative Assembly has also detailed what to expect over the coming months for Total War: Warhammer 3. In July, Siege improvements will be released for public testing, with the studio using feedback to tinker with these changes before fully releasing it. In August, update 6.3 will add quality of life improvements for Tomb Kings and Lizardmen, as well as some skill refreshes for orcs and goblins. There are no major updates planned for September, with hotfixes for 6.3 being a priority along with development of Tides of Torment.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Donkey Kong Bananza is yet another game like<a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-has-been-in-development-since-the-launch-of-the-first-switch-console/"> Mario Kart World</a> whose development began on the original Nintendo Switch, but development was moved on to the Nintendo Switch 2, as the core mechanics' best implementation could only be possible on the new generation system.</p>



<p>Speaking in a lengthy interview with&nbsp;IGN, Producer Kento Motokura and Director Kazuya Takahashi confirmed that the game development began on Nintendo's previous generation system. At the time, the development team was still using voxel technology and going over different ideas for applications, but as soon as they received news of the Nintendo Switch 2 development, they realized that the best implementation of the game's core mechanics would be on the new generation system.</p>



<p>According to Takashi-san, the continuity of destruction, which is an important part of the Donkey Kong Bananza experience, could be expanded on the Nintendo Switch 2. The system allowed the developer to create a rich variety of materials and very large-scale changes in the environment. Besides the system's better specifications, what really appealed to the development team were other features the Nintendo Switch 2 offered, like mouse controls, which can be used in co-op play.</p>



<p>During the interview, the Donkey Kong Bananza producer and director also went over how the game and its central mechanics came to be. The idea for the development of a Donkey Kong 3D game came from Yoshiaki Koizumi, Super Mario Odyssey producer and Donkey Kong Jungle Beat director, a prospect that prompted the team to get to learn more about the character from Shigeru Miyamoto, what makes him unique, and explore how these distinctive features could define a new game. Ultimately, the experiments with voxel technology featured in Super Mario Odyssey gave the development team the idea of destruction as a core mechanic, which worked well together with Donkey Kong's defining features.</p>



<p>Donkey Kong Bananza launches on July 17 on Nintendo Switch 2 worldwide. You can learn more about the game by checking out Nathan's <a href="https://wccftech.com/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-impressions/">preview</a>.</p>

Season two of the Peacock show wraps this week, meaning right now is exactly the correct time to start binging it all.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>You don’t have to work hard to sell <em>Poker Face</em>. It goes like this: “You know the guy who does the <em>Knives Out</em> movies, Rian Johnson? Well, he also has a TV show, modeled on <em>Columbo</em>, but it’s Natasha Lyonne in the main role.” At this point, most people are already in. For others you need to add, “Yeah, from <em>Russian Doll</em>. And, sure, <em>American Pie</em>.”</p><p>When I say “modeled on <em>Columbo</em>,” that’s not me being cute. <em>Poker Face</em> follows the Peter Falk show’s format from concept through to title fonts. So, as with the ‘70s/’80s classic murder mystery, you know who the killer is from the beginning of each episode, the murder shown in a pre-titles vignette before Lyonne’s Charlie Cale appears. Titles and credits then appear in the familiar yellow text, and in season one, Lyonne is even perpetually holding a cigar and walking with the same peculiar gait. It’s a <em>joy</em>.</p><p>However, <em>Poker Face</em> is also very much its own show, too. Charlie Cale is an itinerant amateur detective, on the run from the mob after getting far too involved in the machinations of a Laughlin, Nevada casino. Cale, you see, has an innate ability to tell when anyone is lying. Not a practiced skill, not something she’s learned from years of the study of micro-expressions or whatever, but just a superpower. She has an almost involuntary response of “bullshit!” whenever she hears a lie. Which makes her an excellent poker player, but not well liked by those trying to keep dark secrets.</p><p>Each episode, Cale shows up in a new town, mostly living out of her car, trying to get work and inevitably becoming entwined in the lives of the murder victim, or indeed the murderer. After the opening scene showing the crime, the episodes almost always skip back some hours or days to then show how Charlie fits into the situation, followed by her reluctantly solving the killing.</p><figure id="" data-id="14178115791f1ef231bd9c3841c728f7" data-recommend-id="image://14178115791f1ef231bd9c3841c728f7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Charlie Cale smoking a cigar." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Charlie Cale smoking a cigar." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Peacock / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="14178115791f1ef231bd9c3841c728f7" data-recommend-id="image://14178115791f1ef231bd9c3841c728f7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Charlie Cale smoking a cigar." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The show is exquisitely well written, and beautifully directed. Natasha Lyonne is a force, her take on Columbo a constant delight, always feeling like a distinct homage rather than an aping impression. And wow, the rest of the cast. Given Cale’s nomadic impermanence in any one spot, there are only a few occasionally recurring characters, meaning most episodes build the cast up from scratch. The program seems to have its pick of any actor it wants, with massive names appearing week after week. To name very few: Adrien Brody, Awkwafina, Jospeph Gordon-Levitt, Richard Kind, Katie Holmes, Giancarlo Esposito, Nick Nolte, John Mulaney, John Cho, Carol Kane, Lili Taylor, Method Man, Kumail Nanjiani...</p><p>The real skill of the show is to be able to bring in so many famous names, and have no one stick out like a Guest Star, but rather immediately establish deep, meaningful characters. Despite episodes lasting just 45 minutes to an hour, it paces itself so ideally, allowing you to get to know these people and to grow invested in Charlie’s relationships with them.</p><p>Because Charlie’s not a cop, it also frees the show to be far more morally ambiguous. This isn’t necessarily about capturing the evil killer and seeing justice dealt—while it sometimes definitely is that, there’s also room for far more nuance. Or, as is sometimes the case, for Lyonne just to find a resolution within the situation before moving on that doesn’t involve anyone being hauled away in handcuffs.</p><p>The mood of the show can also swing in some deft and impressive ways. While it’s <em>always</em> funny, that humor can become a lot darker, or a lot lighter, with incredibly breezy episodes between storylines that really take their toll on Charlie. She’s not asking for any of this, almost always dragged into a situation after she accidentally (and quite literally) calls bullshit. She hears the lie, and then can’t let it go. Sometimes that leads to excellent shenanigans, other times to losing newfound friendships. And sometimes she’s solving the murder of a school hamster.</p><figure id="" data-id="81851f6bf0ee59baa9bd864e04ca4a5b" data-recommend-id="image://81851f6bf0ee59baa9bd864e04ca4a5b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Charlie covered in mud and blood in a wooden cabin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Charlie covered in mud and blood in a wooden cabin." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Peacock / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="81851f6bf0ee59baa9bd864e04ca4a5b" data-recommend-id="image://81851f6bf0ee59baa9bd864e04ca4a5b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Charlie covered in mud and blood in a wooden cabin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Of the 21 episodes that have aired, with one more appearing today, July 10, there hasn’t been a dud. There’s none that feel like a drag, or that felt phoned in. As such, if you’ve not watched at all, then there’s no need to suggest you begin with a particular highlight, or offer a suggested list—just start with the first and blitz your way through. There <em>are</em> chronological elements to the overall arc, so it benefits from watching through in order, even if each episode also successfully stands alone.</p><p>Rian Johnson’s love of ‘70s and ‘80s crime drama and televised whodunits helped make <em>Knives Out</em> and <em>Glass Onion</em> so incredibly fun, with Daniel Craig’s detective Benoit Blanc a sort of amalgam of all their protagonists, perhaps with the heaviest dose of <em>Murder, She Wrote</em>’s Jessica Fletcher. In <em>Poker Face</em>, he draws from the same well, but with <em>Columbo </em>as that main source instead. And its respect for those programs hides no embarrassment, no sense that it needs to pastiche or satirize, but instead proudly delivers a modern version of the same. Yes, there’s cursing, and it’s perhaps a touch more brutal in some of the murders than you’d have gotten away with on ‘70s network TV, but the spirit is the same. And no, Lyonne doesn’t turn around every episode and say, “Ah, just one more thing...”—although there are very occasional lovely allusions toward it.</p><figure id="" data-id="5feca1066d5c8708e1dfe00f08730e37" data-recommend-id="image://5feca1066d5c8708e1dfe00f08730e37" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Charlie in her casino outfood, looking bemused." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Charlie in her casino outfood, looking bemused." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Peacock / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5feca1066d5c8708e1dfe00f08730e37" data-recommend-id="image://5feca1066d5c8708e1dfe00f08730e37" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Charlie in her casino outfood, looking bemused." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Likely the reason so few are on top of this incredible show is because it’s on Peacock, and, well, unless you’re after the <em>SNL</em> archives, there’s not a great deal of other motivation to pay yet another monthly subscription. But with the second season wrapping up today, now is the perfect moment to find a free trial, or pay a one-off to get it for a month. (Make sure to set a reminder to cancel it a couple of days before it’s due to renew—you’ll forget otherwise, you know you will.)</p><p>You’ll love it. You’ll love everything about it. It’s so funny, and warm, and just so incredibly well made. It’s kind of unbearable to know that after today, it’ll likely be a year before we get to see any more—and that’s <em>if</em> it’s picked up for a third run, on which there’s no word yet. So, if nothing else, watch it just so you push up the numbers and I get to see some more. For me.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/poker-face-peacock-natasha-lyonne-rian-johnson-columbo-1851786010]]></content:encoded>

<p>Speaking in an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/our-big-bananas-interview-with-the-developers-of-donkey-kong-bananza">IGN</a> alongside Bananza director Kazuya Takahashi, Motokura says that following "the original impetus" from his boss, Yoshiaki Koizumi, the first port of call for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Mario Odyssey</a> team was the office of the father of DK and Mario himself, to try and find the essence of the character and work out how to create the first 3D Donkey Kong platformer since 1999's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/donkey_kong_64">Donkey Kong 64</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="Vb6JFhMsLFI" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c2cb8xurwio&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb6JFhMsLFI" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Mr. Miyamoto has experienced not only working on the Donkey Kong games that he was directly responsible for, but also worked alongside Rare on the Donkey Kong games that they created. And for him, a lot of things that came up were the unique actions that a really strong character like Donkey Kong can engage in, things like the hand slap or blowing his breath."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Motokura and co. also tapped Mr. Koizumi for his expertise with the ape, as the Nintendo veteran served as director on 2004's bongo-fest <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/donkey_kong_jungle_beat">Donkey Kong Jungle Beat</a> on GameCube.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"For him, one thing that was a really important distinguishing characteristic from a character like say, Mario, is that Donkey Kong has these longer, stronger arms. So we took all of these distinctive features of Donkey Kong as a character and tried to think about how we could bring them to play in a new game."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The interview, which <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/donkey-kong-bananzas-director-and-producer-have-been-confirmed">confirms the game's producer and director</a> after the Mario Odyssey team was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/donkey-kong-bananza-developer-has-been-revealed">revealed to be behind Bananza</a>, goes into more detail about the genesis of the project, with Motokura mentioning how experiments with voxel tech <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/donkey-kong-bananza-like-mario-kart-world-was-initially-planned-for-switch-1">on Switch 1</a> became the foundation of the upcoming Switch 2 game.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When we realised the compatibility of Donkey Kong's distinctive characteristics, being strong and having these large long arms, and the possibility of Voxel Technology, we saw that this was a good match that led us to the idea of pursuing destruction as core gameplay in this title."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While it feels fairly obvious to use all the resources at your disposal when assembling your design ideas for a new game, it's still nice to know that Shigsy hasn't ascended to a marble-floored office in Nintendo HQ, not to be disturbed while he takes calls about theme parks and movies in his Mario t-shirt/sports jacket combo. It's good to hear younger devs can still knock on his door for advice, although we imagine he's not opposed to hitting the shop floor from time to time, either. Those tea tables aren't going to upend themselves.</p>
<p><em>Looking forward to DKB? It's out next week, so not long to go!</em></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-control-group-warbond</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-control-group-warbond-brings-brutal-new-weaponry-and-more-next-week.1240404/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Sony and developer Arrowhead have announced a new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond by the name of Control Group, and as usual, this one's packing plenty of new gear to help you give those troublesome Terminids, Automatons, and Illuminate what for.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/10/helldivers-2-control-group-warbond-launches-july-17/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation Blog post</a>, Control Group launches across PC and PS5 on July 17th, which is next Thursday at time óf writing. The Warbond's first major addition is the VG-70 Variable, a three-mode gun with seven barrels. You can fire on auto, choose to fire one barrel at a time, or discharge all of your ammo at once.</p>

<p>A new support weapon, the PLAS-45 Epoch, will also be added as part of this Warbond. It fires a plasma sphere that will explode if you overcharge it, so as with many of&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s other weapons, you should be careful not to misuse this gun.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-control-group-warbond-plas-45-epoch.jpg?itok=nR3BijWt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-control-group-warbond-plas-45-epoch.jpg?itok=is0Iinli 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Control Group Warbond has plenty of new toys for you to try out.</figcaption></figure><p>A new electric grenade will also be introduced in the form of the G-31 Arc grenade, which discharges electricity that hits everything in its proximity. That includes your fellow Helldivers, so once again, be careful when it comes to friendly fire.</p>

<p>If you're one for turret deployment, then you may want to give the new&nbsp;A/LAS-98 Laser Sentry a try. It'll continuously fire a laser beam to devastate your enemies, but it will overheat and explode if it isn't put on cooldown, so you'll have to watch for that as well.</p>

<p>Most excitingly, the LIFT-182 Warp Pack allows you to teleport short distances without needing to jump. You should, however, be aware that the singularity you're generating with the pack will deteriorate with each jump, and you may "experience death should the singularity fully collapse". Uh-oh.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-control-group-warbond-warp-pack.jpg?itok=-mTcyGA4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-control-group-warbond-warp-pack.jpg?itok=h9kaFJQj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>What if I told you you could teleport short distances with the new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond?</figcaption></figure><p>As always, the new Warbond also brings some new armor for you to kit yourself out with, as well as new capes and other extras.

            <p>Sometimes, when you're fighting aliens, you've got to whip out a gun that might explode in your own face. Them's the rules. You've got to risk it for a chocolate biscuit. Or, at least that's premise of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>'s latest warbond.</p>
<p>Dubbed Control Group, it'll give you access to a bunch of experimental gear Super Earth's scientists have cobbled together from captured Illuminate tech if you opt to pick it up when it drops on June 17th.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As outlined in <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/10/helldivers-2-control-group-warbond-launches-july-17/">the PS Blog</a> penned by Arrowhead community manager Katherine Baskin, this warbond for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> includes a primary weapon, three stratagems, and the usual array of stocking fillers.</p>
<p>I'll start off with the stratagem that's caught my eye, the LIFT-182 warp pack. With help from the Illuminate's spooky dark fluid (ooh, matron), it generates a "(somewhat) stable wormhole on demand", which you can then hop into to teleport short distances without a cooldown. As with all of the main Control Group warbond gear, however, there's a quirky catch. Each time you teleport, the hole destabilises a bit more. If you attempt one jump too many, it'll warp you into the afterlife. Nice.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Attention, Helldivers! The Ministry of Defense Research &amp; Development team has just declassified the following information for immediate release.</p><p>You have been cleared to field test a new range of experimental weapons built from acquired alien technology.

<p>Continuing that trend, the primary's a VG-70 Variable volley gun that comes with three firing settings, with one spunking out all of your remaining ammo at once in a fashion that's possibly fatal to the user. The PLAS-45 Epoch plasma gun stratagem might explode in your face if you overcharge it. The third stratagem, an A/LAS-98 laser sentry turret, will go boom if you forget to let it cool down every so often.</p>
<p>Armour-wise, there's the AD-49 Apollonian heavy set and the AD-26 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bleeding-edge">Bleeding Edge</a> medium set, with both boasting an "Adreno-Defibrillator" that'll revive you once, but leave you slowly dying once it's done so. So, best get the mission done quick once you're on your second life.</p>
<p>All it all, it looks to be one of the more fun warbonds Arrowhead's put together so far, especially for those of us who're not mega into alternative ways to look like you've got some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldiver-2s-next-warbond-will-let-you-look-even-more-fascist-than-normal-adds-in-a-literal-sword">dodgy views</a> about authoritarianism or cosplay as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-next-gear-drop-includes-judge-dredd-style-armour-just-in-case-you-want-to-be-the-law">Judge Dredd</a>. Given HD2's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-review">at its best when you're having a laugh</a>, I'm glad it's getting being stabbed with a slapstick syringe on the 17th.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-next-warbond-is-full-of-funky-alien-tech-including-a-somewhat-stable-wormhole-teleportation-pack]]></content:encoded>

These missions can involve anything from collecting a certain number of blue coins to navigating around an obstacle course using a particular item. Seven of these tasks that particularly stand out are the short three-lap tribute races based on tracks from the original <em>Super Mario Kart</em>, which debuted in 1992 on the SNES. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196698" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Princess Peach’s Leading Role And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="121" data-playlist="196698,195719,196572" data-current="196698"><div><p>Princess Peach’s Leading Role And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196698/196698_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196698/196698_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196698/196698_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196698/196698_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22254.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>394 P-Switch challenges function like the checkpoint races in other P-Switch challenges and not like a traditional race where the goal is to come in first. Additionally, finding their location can be a real challenge. The Free Roam map’s lack of details makes locating specific areas harder than it needs to be. Let’s go over what classic tracks are included and where to find the associated challenges. </p><h2 id="h63533"><a id="1"></a>Koopa Beach 1</h2><figure id="" data-id="8dbb1b20e6f373706252d8f2ed41db08" data-recommend-id="image://8dbb1b20e6f373706252d8f2ed41db08" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An overview of the Koopa Beach 1 tribute race." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An overview of the Koopa Beach 1 tribute race." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8dbb1b20e6f373706252d8f2ed41db08" data-recommend-id="image://8dbb1b20e6f373706252d8f2ed41db08" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An overview of the Koopa Beach 1 tribute race." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Fast travel to the Koopa Troopa Beach course and then drive immediately forward. Keep going until you see the Yoshi’s drive-thru and then take a left at the first mini island with two trees. Drive into the P-Switch up ahead to start the tribute race.</p><hr><h2 id="h63534"><a id="2"></a>Vanilla Lake 1</h2><figure id="" data-id="113c8d875d85b9230d5866b9a51fd8c1" data-recommend-id="image://113c8d875d85b9230d5866b9a51fd8c1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An overview of the Vanilla Lake tribute race." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An overview of the Vanilla Lake tribute race." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="113c8d875d85b9230d5866b9a51fd8c1" data-recommend-id="image://113c8d875d85b9230d5866b9a51fd8c1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An overview of the Vanilla Lake tribute race." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This one lies within the path connecting Sky-High Sundae and Wario Shipyard. You can start from either location, but the quickest way is to fast travel to Wario. He drives around the area and will start right in front of the track when you take control. The P-Switch that starts the tribute race can be found after circling to the other side.</p><p>Presumably due to the recreation’s changes, the challenge refers to this specifically as “Vanilla Lake” instead of citing a specific track. Nonetheless, it’s hard not to see Vanilla Lake 1 as the primary inspiration.</p><hr><h2 id="h63535"><a id="3"></a>Choco Island 1</h2><figure id="" data-id="0aec8fae6bf415ef1cdf02b2203935ed" data-recommend-id="image://0aec8fae6bf415ef1cdf02b2203935ed" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An overview of the Choco Island 1 tribute race." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An overview of the Choco Island 1 tribute race." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0aec8fae6bf415ef1cdf02b2203935ed" data-recommend-id="image://0aec8fae6bf415ef1cdf02b2203935ed" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An overview of the Choco Island 1 tribute race." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Fast travel to Choco Mountain and then turn around. Drive through the small tunnel and head straight onto the paved road. You’ll reach a looped path surrounded by mud, Piranha Plants, and big colorful blocks. Take the left side to soon come across a P-Switch that triggers the Choco Island 1 tribute race mission.</p><hr><h2 id="h63536"><a id="4"></a>Choco Island 2</h2><figure id="" data-id="d48df2c4514ed1e717412139b52c89ec" data-recommend-id="image://d48df2c4514ed1e717412139b52c89ec" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An overview of the Choco Island 2 tribute race." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An overview of the Choco Island 2 tribute race." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d48df2c4514ed1e717412139b52c89ec" data-recommend-id="image://d48df2c4514ed1e717412139b52c89ec" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An overview of the Choco Island 2 tribute race." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The second track of the set is a bit closer than you’d think. Fast travel to Choco Mountain and move forward this time. Drive along the dirt path until you reach a fork in the road surrounded once again by Piranha Plants and colorful blocks. Hang right and keep going until you reach the P-Switch. </p><hr><h2 id="h63537"><a id="5"></a>Ghost Valley 1</h2><figure id="" data-id="bf7407f37e1f6760fadb01257f9eb64f" data-recommend-id="image://bf7407f37e1f6760fadb01257f9eb64f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An overview of the Ghost Valley 1 tribute race." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An overview of the Ghost Valley 1 tribute race." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bf7407f37e1f6760fadb01257f9eb64f" data-recommend-id="image://bf7407f37e1f6760fadb01257f9eb64f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An overview of the Ghost Valley 1 tribute race." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>That brings us to the last set of <em>Super Mario Kart</em> tribute races. Longtime fans have probably already recognized them, especially when they’re all right next to each other. Fast travel to Boo Cinema and then immediately start driving left. Go down the wide set of stairs and drive into the P-Switch situated ahead on the pier.</p><hr><h2 id="h63538"><a id="6"></a>Ghost Valley 2</h2><figure id="" data-id="0fe86bbdd3e2449e05a12ecea391f1bf" data-recommend-id="image://0fe86bbdd3e2449e05a12ecea391f1bf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An overview of the Ghost Valley 2 tribute race." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An overview of the Ghost Valley 2 tribute race." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0fe86bbdd3e2449e05a12ecea391f1bf" data-recommend-id="image://0fe86bbdd3e2449e05a12ecea391f1bf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An overview of the Ghost Valley 2 tribute race." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You’ll only need to go a bit farther to reach the next one.

You might recognize Motokura’s name as the director of Super Mario Odyssey, and he’s also been a part of a number of other Nintendo games since he joined the company as a 3D character artist in the GameCube era, working on the likes of Super Mario Sunshine, Pikmin, and Donkey Kong Jungle Beat, as well as Super Mario Galaxy, Super Mario Land, and Super Mario 3D World on Wii U. As for Takahashi, he’s newer to Nintendo, only arriving at the company in 2020, but has a background in open world game design that he says gives him some “interesting” carryover from past experiences into Bananza.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve covered some of the highlights from this interview elsewhere, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-exists-because-yoshiaki-koizumi-asked-the-mario-odyssey-team-for-a-3d-donkey-kong-game"><u>how the game was conceived</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-leads-say-the-reason-pauline-is-13-years-old-specifically-is-for-the-player-to-puzzle-out"><u>where it lands in relation to other Donkey Kong games</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-was-originally-a-nintendo-switch-1-game"><u>why it’s a Nintendo Switch 2 title</u></a>. But there are plenty of other golden nuggets (or bananas) in the full interview, which we’ve published below. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Responses have been lightly edited for clarity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Can you both tell me about the conception of Donkey Kong Bananza? What idea or mechanic or theme was at the core of this game's development when it was first started?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Motokura</strong>: Well, I would say the very original impetus for the development of Donkey Kong Bananza was when my boss, Mr. Koizumi, approached our team and asked us to consider working on a 3D Donkey Kong game. And that's when we realized we really needed to know more about Donkey Kong, so we went and spoke to Mr. Miyamoto, the original creator of the character. And Mr. Miyamoto has experienced not only working on the Donkey Kong games that he was directly responsible for, but also worked alongside Rare on the Donkey Kong games that they created. And for him, a lot of things that came up were the unique actions that a really strong character like Donkey Kong can engage in, things like the hand slap or blowing his breath.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And I also spoke to Mr. Koizumi who had served as the director on Jungle Beat. And for him, one thing that was a really important distinguishing characteristic from a character like say, Mario, is that Donkey Kong has these longer, stronger arms. So we took all of these distinctive features of Donkey Kong as a character and tried to think about how we could bring them to play in a new game. Around the same time, we had a programmer who was experimenting with voxel technology. We actually had used this voxel technology in some areas of Super Mario Odyssey previously where for example, you could dig your way through cheese in the Luncheon Kingdom or you could plow through snow in the Snow Kingdom. So this programmer was engaging in various technical experiments where you might even throw voxels or make a hole having done so.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When we realized the compatibility of Donkey Kong's distinctive characteristics, being strong and having these large long arms, and the possibility of Voxel Technology, we saw that this was a good match that led us to the idea of pursuing destruction as core gameplay in this title. Sorry that answer went a little long, but that's how we went from the opportunity to work on this project initially all the way through to developing the concept that carried us through to the end.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Correct me if I'm wrong, but this is the first time a Donkey Kong game has been made in-house at Nintendo in, I think, 20 years. I was wondering if you knew why the decision was made to develop a new Donkey Kong game internally instead of having someone like Retro Studios make it?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Motokura</strong>: So because Nintendo does have a lot of characters to choose from, we're always considering what would be good timing to create a new game with a certain character to most pleased customers. But of course, that's just my best guess. You'd really have to ask Mr. Koizumi for the real answer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What sorts of things inspired you all while you were working on Donkey Kong Bananza? I know I've seen a lot of people remarking that someone on the team maybe liked Wreck-It Ralph a lot.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Motokura</strong>: No, I wouldn't say that we drew inspiration from any one particular source like you're describing, but rather because Donkey Kong has such a long history, we had a lot of different Donkey Kong titles to look at and consider places that we could receive inspiration. So when you mentioned in particular the comments on social media about Wreck-It Ralph, was it some similarity of Pauline to one of the characters in that movie?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yes, it's Pauline riding on the back of Donkey Kong who's big and strong and Pauline's kind of a small, younger character. In Wreck-It Ralph, you have Vanellope riding on the back of this big strong fellow who can smash through things.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Motokura</strong>: Yes, as it turns out, from a very early stage in development on Donkey Kong Bananza, the team was discussing what kind of character would be best to accompany Donkey Kong on his travels. And as early as that stage, I do recall that someone had suggested Pauline might be a good choice, but Pauline was not implemented directly into game spec at that time. I think the moment we actually realized we would go in that direction came about as a result of an artist who created some concept art of the zebra transformation. We saw that image and thought it was really fun, so we immediately prototyped it to try it out in the game. And when our composer saw that, they decided to create specific music just for that transformation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And the music for it was so good, we thought we could expand on this and turn it into a song and maybe Pauline would be a good choice to sing that song. And so we then asked the composer to create songs for each of the transformations and I think that's what really cemented Pauline's place. I think a lot of ideas really fell into place after we had decided on Pauline as the accompanying character, so I'll let Mr. Takahashi describe those.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Takahashi</strong>: I think one of the things that really works very well for us in choosing Pauline is that she's human so she speaks in a language that the player will understand. And our setting is a strange underground world where you're interacting with animals and even rocks that speak in some cases, so it's a lot to take in. I think it's really good for the player to have another human that they can see on-screen who is reacting to these strange things, noticing stuff, pointing them out, even giving hints. And in a game where you take destruction as its core gameplay, there's a lot of objects that are hidden waiting to be discovered. So it's really helpful to have information coming to the player as audio cues so it's not getting in the way of visual information on screen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And we also wanted to emphasize the power of Pauline's song in this game. And so she has the ability to make music that shows the route the player could follow or even opens up new routes to go see. And we have a co-op play that allows a second player to control Pauline's vocal blasts that can interact with both the terrain and with enemies. Sorry, that was a rather long answer, but I really do think that a lot of ideas came out from this choice of Pauline as an accompanying character. So looking back, I think it was a choice we're all very happy with.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Donkey Kong Bananza Direct Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I think a lot of people were surprised when you confirmed a specific age for Pauline, that she's 13. Why did you specify her age and why is she young in this game?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Takahashi</strong>: Well one of the important roles that we knew we wanted this character to accomplish was in accompanying Donkey Kong on his travels and acting in some cases as a bit of a narrator. And considering we would probably have both new players who are experiencing a Donkey Kong game for the first time, as well as people who are long-time fans of Donkey Kong. So we had the opportunity to offer a character that was familiar to long-time players, but had a new appearance that might be interesting for new folks as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Motokura</strong>: And so we're always thinking about the setting of not just the world but also each character itself and how that's going to impact player enjoyment in the end.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Takahashi</strong>: Now as to why 13-year-old in particular was the choice, I think that's something that we want players to, in the course of enjoying the game, start to puzzle out, think for themselves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Can you confirm Donkey Kong's age?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Motokura</strong>: I think that's another one that maybe is good fodder for player theories.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Seeing a young Pauline and knowing that you all worked on Super Mario Odyssey, I start to think story-wise, this is maybe a Super Mario Odyssey prequel. Is there an official Donkey Kong timeline? Is there a canon timeline that explains where all the Donkey Kong games go?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Takahashi</strong>: Certainly because a lot of team members also worked on Super Mario Odyssey, there are some similarities in terms of how they think about the setting of the characters for both games, but it's something we really can't explain all of for now because we need to leave something for people to consider as they're playing the game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>When you were creating Donkey Kong Bananza, at what point in development did you learn that Donkey Kong was going to be receiving a visual redesign?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Motokura</strong>: So we're always thinking about what sort of in-game expression of the character would be appropriate. You want to make sure that you have a character that can be very expressive, very emotive. And so from the very beginning of the project we were considering over the long history of Donkey Kong, what elements could we pull into in terms of creating this appearance that would be fun for fans. And as a result, we spent a lot of time thinking about distinctive visual features of Donkey Kong as a character among the developers. Even going all the way back to Mr. Miyamoto's original designs. We found a lot of expressive features in that character design as well. But also, in games like the Country series, you see him adventuring in a jungle where he has more of a cool and wild side. And so we wanted to pull together a lot of these different elements of the character over its long history, to come together for the design of Donkey Kong Bananza.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I think there's a perception that the new design of Donkey Kong exists because of the movie. Did it originally come from you all and then was reflected in the movie and Mario Kart World and everywhere else? Is that right?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Motokura</strong>: It's true that sometimes there is a base for the model that will be used as the fundamental structure for different types of content, yes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">[<strong>Author's note:</strong> Following the interview and prior to publication, Nintendo PR reached out to offer the following additional context to Motokura's response: "<em>Mr. Miyamoto’s original design for Donkey Kong serves as the fundamental baseline that can be used for different types of content, including in Donkey Kong Bananza but also the movie and Mario Kart World. The recent Donkey Kong as seen in Donkey Kong Bananza has roots in the original design created by Mr. Miyamoto with the element of Donkey Kong Bananza.</em>"]</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I know a lot of people identified very quickly that your team, the Super Mario Odyssey team, was behind Donkey Kong Bananza because of certain elements like the menus and the open world design. What do you feel distinguishes Donkey Kong Bananza the most from Super Mario Odyssey?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Motokura</strong>: I think one of the biggest differences is that in the case of Donkey Kong Bananza, the entire world is made up of this voxel technology. And the reason for that is we wanted to create an arena that would make the best use of Donkey Kong's physical strength as a character. So I think for me, that's the biggest difference.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Takahashi</strong>: And I think you can see this come across in the level design where we had to consider the importance of the continuity of destruction. And on one level, similar to Super Mario Odyssey, each level has to be fun just if you're playing through it the normal way without doing a lot of destruction. But the makeup of this game also allows for the kind of destruction that keeps connecting to new discoveries. If you see something in front of you and you pick it up and you throw it and it brings down a wall and there's something interesting behind it, but then you also start to destroy the wall in that back area and it leads to another new item or area. That's what we mean by the continuity of destruction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also, you may even encounter a Banandium Gem, which is different from the Power Moons in Super Mario Odyssey. In Donkey Kong Bananza, Donkey Kong actually eats the Banandium and gets a skill point that he can use to power up his skills. So you also might have different playstyles where experienced gamers are using these skill points to enhance or embellish their skills, whereas relatively new players or less experienced, might want to add to their life bar, for example, for survivability. We also have a gameplay cycle that I think differs from Super Mario Odyssey in that you can also go collect a lot of gold through your various explorations and use these to buy things which then allows you to experience different things in the game, creating a virtuous cycle that is different from what you would see in Super Mario Odyssey. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You mentioned the Banandium Gems. Are Banandium Gems bananas or are they rocks?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Takahashi</strong>: So yeah, what we're talking about is a material that only exists in the Donkey Kong Bananza universe, which we refer to as Banandium. And so that material makes up a lot of what you're encountering, whether it's a Banandium Gem or a Banandium Chip for example. And so when Donkey Kong engages in a Bananza transformation, he uses Bananergy. I know it may sound kind of silly to be explaining all of this in such a serious voice as we're talking about Banandium, but that's the setting that we've created for the game and that's what powers his transformations. But you'll also find that Banandium as a material has a deep connection to some story elements that I hope you'll enjoy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I'm going to imagine that Donkey Kong is eating banana-flavored rocks.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Takahashi</strong>: Yeah, that sounds pretty good actually.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Why was this game best suited to release on Nintendo Switch 2 as opposed to Nintendo Switch or both?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Motokura</strong>: So this game originally began its development cycle on Nintendo Switch 1 and at the time, we were still using voxel technology and thinking of lots of different ideas for applications. But when we learned about the Switch 2 development, we realized that the best implementation of these ideas and technology would be on Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Takahashi</strong>: And when I was previously talking about the importance of the continuity of destruction, that was something that we could expand on and have a longer continuous play experience with that kind of concept on Nintendo Switch 2. So this allowed us to engage in creating really extremely rich variety of materials and very large scale changes in the environment on that new hardware. And when destruction is your core gameplay, one really important moment that we wanted to preserve was when a player looks at a part of the terrain and thinks, can I break this? Because that creates a very important surprise that has a lot of impact for them and that was something that was best done on Switch 2. But it's not really even just the processing power of the Switch 2 that I think attracted us and gave us some interesting possibilities. There was also the device itself that offered things like mouse control, which you can use in co-op play for a second player to control Pauline's vocal blasts or DK Artist, a mode where you can sculpt a large set of voxels.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You mentioned earlier drawing inspiration from all the different Donkey Kong games there have been in the past. In what ways was it important for you to honor Donkey Kong's history and make reference to past games? And in what ways did you want to tread new ground with who Donkey Kong is in the future?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Motokura</strong>: I think that balance comes from us taking the core gameplay of destruction of voxel technology, but also thinking about past game elements and which will be the best match for this style of gameplay that we have now. We wanted to make sure that we were drawing elements from past titles that would be really fun for long-time fans of the series once they were implemented into Donkey Kong Bananza, especially considering the voxel destruction that makes up the core of our gameplay. But we didn't just want to rely on nostalgia alone, we wanted to make sure that these came together and blended into a new experience altogether.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Takahashi</strong>: So for example, we're bringing forward some familiar gameplay elements like barrel cannons and mine carts, but we're thinking about what is different and interesting about voxel technology that allows you to do something new that people haven't seen before. And that's also kind of thinking that we did in bringing forward animal companions like Rambi for example. But really, there's a lot of these kinds of elements for people to discover, so I hope you really enjoy finding all of those.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What am I not asking you about that you're really excited to talk about?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Motokura</strong>: So one thing that I do want to mention is that when we first considered making a new Donkey Kong game, we really wanted to think about how we would pull in lots of new players. So we have a lot of interesting gameplay elements here, but also we wanted to give people some flexibility in terms of choosing a difficulty level that they feel comfortable with. We wanted to find a way to please those fans of really hard stages in past Donkey Kong games, as well as welcome people who may be somewhat new to the genre of action games. And so as we said before, giving people the chances to make the decision about whether they want to raise different skills. For example, if it's someone who is experienced in action games, they may choose to enhance or embellish an exciting skill. Whereas if it's someone who's somewhat new to action games, they might want to raise their life for survivability.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Takahashi</strong>: And for those who have found Donkey Kong games in the past to be really difficult, we also want to mention assist mode, which allows you to adjust the difficulty as well. And if I were to bring up something that I just wanted to mention specifically in answer to your question, it would be talking about how many different prototype experiments we did testing out different kinds of voxel destruction. I'm really fond of the approaches that we found in terms of finding stages where you have to cool down lava using ice to proceed or find a way to negate the properties of a damaging material to move forward. And I think that's really created a lot of very interesting and unique gameplay that can only be found in Donkey Kong Bananza. I hope people have fun enjoying different types of new destructive gameplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Motokura</strong>: We also have a co-op play mode that allows for two players to play at the same time. And I think this is something that also allows for adjustment of difficulty as well. So we're hoping that people could either play with a friend or if you have a child that really likes Donkey Kong but maybe wouldn't be able to play out the game on their own. We hope this leads to some really good experiences.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. You can find her posting on BlueSky @duckvalentine.bsky.social.

But that wasn’t always the case. According to the game’s developers, it was originally conceived as a Nintendo Switch 1 title.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to IGN in a new interview, producer Kenta Motokura told us that the game began its development cycle on Nintendo Switch 1. However, as the team developed the “voxel” technology that lies behind Bananza's destruction mechanic, it became clear that the best implementation of that tech would be on Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Director Kazuya Takahashi continued the explanation by referencing something called “continuity of destruction,” essentially a philosophy behind Donkey Kong Bananza where players are led to destroy a portion of the environment and receive a reward, which then reveals another area that can be destroyed for another reward, and so forth. Takahashi said the team felt they could expand on that philosophy on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“This allowed us to engage in creating a really extremely rich variety of materials and very large scale changes in the environment on that new hardware,” he said. “And when destruction is your core gameplay, one really important moment that we wanted to preserve was when a player looks at a part of the terrain and thinks, can I break this?

Historically, it doesn't include exact information about character ages in official communications. Heck, it won’t even say whether or not Waluigi is Wario’s brother, friend, rival, or enemy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So when we spoke to the game’s producer Kenta Motokura and director Kazuya Takahashi, we had to ask. Why did Nintendo specify her age? And why is she so young in the game, when she’s clearly an adult in Super Mario Odyssey and other appearances?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We didn’t get a straight answer out of the pair, but Takahashi did explain a little bit about Pauline’s role in the game, and why she isn’t just a continuation of Pauline from Odyssey.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“One of the important roles that we knew we wanted this character to accomplish was in accompanying Donkey Kong on his travels and acting in some cases as a bit of a narrator,” Takahashi responded.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And considering we would probably have both new players who are experiencing a Donkey Kong game for the first time, as well as people who are long-time fans of Donkey Kong, we had the opportunity to offer a character that was familiar to long-time players, but had a new appearance that might be interesting for new folks as well. And so we're always thinking about the setting of not just the world but also each character itself and how that's going to impact player enjoyment in the end.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">He ended on a bit of a tease: “Now as to why 13-year-old in particular was the choice, I think that's something that we want players to, in the course of enjoying the game, start to puzzle out, think for themselves.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This was curious, so I asked a few more questions, which proved not much more enlightening unfortunately. I asked if the team would confirm Donkey Kong’s age, to which Motokura said, “I think that's another one that maybe is good fodder for player theories.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Okay, fine, it was admittedly a bit of a joke question. But here’s a real one: does this mean there’s an official Donkey Kong series canon timeline?

                <p>Last week, Microsoft announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-layoffs-begin-with-200-cuts-in-europe-report/1100-6532905/" data-ref-id="1100-6532905">sweeping layoffs and restructuring efforts</a>, much of which targeted the tech giant's Xbox division. Multiple games were canceled and projects defunded, and thousands of workers were let go. This move induced widespread condemnation and an outpouring of sadness from the industry, including from EA Japan's general manager, Shaun Noguchi.</p><p>Noguchi, writing in his personal capacity, <a href="https://x.com/SeptillionGames/status/1940932053299876351" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted</a> on X about how disappointed he was to see more waves of layoffs and cancellations. He wrote (in Japanese and translated by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-japan-gm-speaks-out-on-microsoft-layoffs-and-cancellation-of-games-like-everwild-and-perfect-dark-if-a-game-was-in-development-for-710-years-canceling-feels-like-the-worst-move" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>) about how the trend in Western companies to chase short-term profits and reduce long-term payoffs or stability has led to damaging the game industry as a whole. "The game industry is held up by every single creator and member of staff who diligently develops games on the ground," he wrote. "As someone in the same industry, I feel deep pain regarding this decision."</p><p>He later <a href="https://x.com/SeptillionGames/status/1941631379411976521" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reiterated</a> (in English) that Microsoft's decision to kill off projects that had been in the works for many years was deeply regrettable. Although companies justify canceling projects to cut losses and avoid the sunk-cost fallacy, Noguchi expressed specific concern for the staff who would have nothing public to show for their work. "This is just my personal opinion but if a game was in development for 7~10 years, canceling feels like the worst move. That's a decade of work, potentially a quarter of someones [sic] entire career completly [sic] lost," he argued. "Even if the final product isn't what people originally expected, I think it still deserves to ship. Something is better than nothing for both the team and for the players."</p><p>Noguchi's comments may be informed by Japan's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-president-takes-50-pay-cut/1100-6326055/" data-ref-id="1100-6326055">culture</a> and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/why-are-japanese-developers-not-undergoing-mass-layoffs" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">legal regime </a>that both emphasize corporate continuity and enforce strong protections for workers. Japanese developers have seemingly undergone much fewer contractions than Western developers in recent years, and it's not at all uncommon for Japanese workers to stick with one employer for their entire career.</p><p>Noguchi's employer, as a United States-based corporation, has been a high-profile participant in laying off staff and canceling games over the past few years. At the end of May, EA canceled its Black Panther game and laid off staff; this followed EA's reported cancellation of a Titanfall game and laying off of 300 people back in April.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Nintendo is keeping Donkey Kong's age in upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> platformer Bananza under wraps for now, because this bit of mystery is "good fodder for player theories".</p>
<p>While Nintendo previously confirmed DK's sidekick Pauline is 13 in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, the team won't commit to sharing anything about the main monkey's age. Speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/our-big-bananas-interview-with-the-developers-of-donkey-kong-bananza">IGN</a>, director Kazuya Takahashi and producer Kenta Motokura (who was the director of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>) said they instead want fans to speculate and theorise about DK's age in the game.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, when asked why Nintendo had chosen to share the exact age Pauline is in the game, the duo again played their cards close to their chest. "I think that's something that we want players to, in the course of enjoying the game, start to puzzle out, think for themselves," the developers teased, suggesting her age may actually play a part in Bananza's overall story.</p>

<p>Takahashi added that the Donkey Kong Bananza team wanted Pauline's character to act "in some cases as a bit of a narrator" on the game's release. "And considering we would probably have both new players who are experiencing a Donkey Kong game for the first time, as well as people who are long-time fans of Donkey Kong, we had the opportunity to offer a character that was familiar to long-time players, but had a new appearance that might be interesting for new folks as well," the director elaborated.</p>
<p>Motokura added the team is "always thinking about the setting of not just the world but also each character itself and how that's going to impact player enjoyment in the end".</p>
<p>Later in the same conversation, discussion turned to where Donkey Kong Bananza sits in any established timeline. After all, Pauline does crop up as mayor of New Donk City in Super Mario Odyssey, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-donkey-kong-bananza-is-being-made-by-the-mario-odyssey-team">given the same development team is behind both Bananza and Odyssey</a>, does this mean DK's next outing is actually a prequel? Again, Nintendo is for now keeping things cryptic.</p>
<p>"Certainly because a lot of team members also worked on Super Mario Odyssey, there are some similarities in terms of how they think about the setting of the characters for both games," Takahashi said, "but it's something we really can't explain all of for now because we need to leave something for people to consider as they're playing the game."</p>
<p>Hmm...</p>

<p>Donkey Kong Bananza is set to release later this month, on 17th July. Our Alex has been hands-on with the upcoming Donkey Kong game, saying his time with the Switch 2 title simply "flew by".</p>
<p>"Even if I spent much of it doing a lot of the same wrecking ball actions repeatedly," Alex wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on">Eurogamer's Donkey Kong Bananza preview</a>, "time flying is always a sure-fire sign of something that's good - so this formula might just be a winner."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-wont-confirm-donkey-kongs-age-in-new-game-as-its-good-fodder-for-player-theories]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>There are sounds in life you will never forget. The tone of your mother’s voice, the pure joy of your child’s laugh, the opening notes of Oasis’ Wonderwall. These sounds shape, memorialise and fashion your life, but they diminish next to the sheer titanic weight of the songs of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/patapon">Patapon</a>. Now with Patapon 1+2 Replay, a whole new generation of gamers can tap their way into a fever dream of rhythm-action warfare.</p>
<p><iframe title="PATAPON 1+2 REPLAY – Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M_dX4l4yPxw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Beaten on drums by you, the Lord of the Patapon, the songs of the Patapon are capable of commanding legions of one-eyed soldiers, leading and directing them in battle. When, taken alone, the basic sounds of the Pon, Pata, Chaka and Don drums, have no meaning, no reason, but as you stack them up, what you have isn’t just a call to war, it’s an earworm of cacophonous power that will never release you from its grip.</p>


<p>Where you could once picture your child’s laugh, now you just hear the high-pitched chanting of Pata, Pata ,Pata, Pon, the repetition of the musical command putting you in a trance-like state from which there is no return. This isn’t a bad thing, far from it, as Patapon is one of the greatest games of all time, and really, do you need to remember the first few chords of Wonderwall?</p>
<p>Patapon originally released on the PlayStation Portable, at a time when Sony was still happy to indulge its most experimental developers and studios. This is a first-party rhythm-action title that’s played on a 2D plane, has a cast of adorable eyeballs, and uses songs to make those eyeballs attack things. As elevator pitches go, it’s pretty out there, and the reality is even more weird and wonderful. In a truly unexpected move, Bandai Namco is bundling up the first two games together, and bringing them to PS5, Switch and PC under license from Sony, meaning that a whole new set of previously un-Pataponed platforms can discover what makes this series so special.</p>


<p>At least they can, once you’ve got the bad bit out of the way. Patapon 1+2 is a modern collection of two classic rhythm-action games, and the one fundamental to that is being able to press the buttons on your controller in time with the music, while a flashing border around the screen also appears in time with the beat to help you out. The problem is that modern TVs and sound systems all feature varying levels of latency: a delay in either direction between what you’re hearing and what you’re seeing.</p>
<p>These games were designed for the closed, fixed system of the PSP, and the simple act of being on different platforms means that,&nbsp;through no fault of your own, your TV, sound system or console may not match up with the buttons quite in time you press them. In other modern rhythm-action games – Guitar Hero or Rock Band for example – there’s a calibration tool, which tells you the delay between what you’re hearing and what you’re seeing, and tweaks the underpinnings of the game in response. Patapon 1+2 doesn’t have that.</p>
<p>What it does have is a ten-point input timing scale in the main options. This lets you tweak the input timing to try and match your TV, but it offers you no additional help to do this. Instead you’re forced to change the setting, load up one of the games, and then see if what you’ve done is better than what you had before. If it doesn’t work, you have to back out all the way to the front menu, and try again. It’s unbelievably frustrating, and quite possibly the most obvious oversight in recent gaming memory.</p>

<p>This is all exacerbated by playing on Switch, where there’s the further wrinkle of being able to play in both docked and handheld mode, and having different input delay across those two use cases. Handheld play feels perfect out-of-the-box, but only when playing with the Switch 2’s built-in speakers. Trying to use Bluetooth headphones renders the game nigh-on impossible in this mode and I couldn’t find a setting that made it feel comfortable. On Switch, you’re going to have to tinker across two use cases to get your input delay right, while headphones and speakers might change that on the fly. It is, frankly, a bit of a mess.</p>
<p>All that said, if you persevere, Patapon and its first sequel remain two of the most unique, joyful and utterly hypnotic experiences in gaming. The central loop sees you building up your army of eyeballs by acquiring different materials while out on missions, or, in the case of tree branches, playing a mini-game where you have to play along with a tree singing a song.</p>
<p>You make your way through each level by performing musical combos, stringing together the musical inputs for attacking, defending, advancing, and a batch of more specialised commands. If you successfully string ten combos together – or fewer if you’re perfectly on the beat – you enter Fever mode, which ramps everything up, from the song you’re playing along to, through to the Patapon’s high-pitched and chaotic chorus. It also makes your attacks more powerful, enhancing the Patapon’s strength and power, making it nigh-on essential to be in this mode at times, which is easier said than done.</p>

<p>Patapon was always tough, but it feels even more so here thanks to the input latency issues that the PSP never had to worry about. There’s a lot of grinding to be done, and your enjoyment and perseverance will depend very much on how much you’re sold on the music and presentation, as well as whether you can actually play the game. I still adore it, but I can see it being a fairly contentious title for some.</p>
<p>When it gets things right, Patapon 1+2 is an utterly brilliant collection, with a steady stream of songs and moments that will cement themselves in your memory. It’s so simple, and yet excruciatingly tough at times, giving you a real sensation of success while you pick up a host of new materials and weapons to upgrade your army with. As you earn move specific materials, you can create even weirder and more powerful Patapon, until your army looks like a pool of babbling, multi-coloured frogspawn carrying an array of tiny weapons. It is, in a word, iconic.</p>
<p>There are some minor concessions in the name of quality of life, so in addition to the timing adjustments, you do have the ability to display the core commands on screen, and there are now three difficulty settings, but the core challenge of this game does remain.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/donkey-kong-bananzas-director-and-producer-have-been-confirmed">Producer Kenta Motokura and director Kazuya Takahashi</a> explained that the game was being built on Switch 1 with the same voxel technology used to create the destructible environments. However, upon learning about the Switch 2, the team shifted development over to the new console to take full advantage of the increased specs.</p>
<p>It wasn't just the added power, however. The team were also keen to see how the new mouse controls could be implemented in the game. As demonstrated in the Direct presentation last month, you can used the mouse controls during multiplayer to initiate Pauline's vocal blasts.</p><div><figure data-videoid="Vb6JFhMsLFI" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c2cb8xurwio&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb6JFhMsLFI" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Here's exactly what the team said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Motokura</strong>: So this game originally began its development cycle on Nintendo Switch 1 and at the time, we were still using voxel technology and thinking of lots of different ideas for applications. But when we learned about the Switch 2 development, we realized that the best implementation of these ideas and technology would be on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p><strong>Takahashi</strong>: And when I was previously talking about the importance of the continuity of destruction, that was something that we could expand on and have a longer continuous play experience with that kind of concept on Nintendo Switch 2. So this allowed us to engage in creating really extremely rich variety of materials and very large scale changes in the environment on that new hardware. And when destruction is your core gameplay, one really important moment that we wanted to preserve was when a player looks at a part of the terrain and thinks, can I break this? Because that creates a very important surprise that has a lot of impact for them and that was something that was best done on Switch 2.</p>
<p>But it's not really even just the processing power of the Switch 2 that I think attracted us and gave us some interesting possibilities. There was also the device itself that offered things like mouse control, which you can use in co-op play for a second player to control Pauline's vocal blasts or DK Artist, a mode where you can sculpt a large set of voxels.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you remember, it was also confirmed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> had originally <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/mario-kart-world-was-originally-in-development-for-switch-1">started life as a Switch 1 project</a>. As revealed in an Ask the Developer session over at Nintendo, the development team stated that "it was difficult for us to incorporate everything we wanted" in the Switch 1 version, and so shifted the project over to the Switch 2; a move that supposedly provided "a ray of hope".</p>
<p>Donkey Kong Bananza is certainly shaping up to be something pretty special, and we can't wait to dive in properly when the game launches on 17th July 2025.</p>

			<p>The RPG genre has never been as popular as it is today. Though very popular in the past, the genre is currently flourishing thanks to major releases like Baldur’s Gate 3, which improved the traditional formula in many ways,  and smaller projects that pay tribute to some of the best games released in the past, like the recent Tainted Grail: Lost Avalon, which, despite its flaws, is a solid tribute to The Elder Scrolls series. </p>



<p>Of Ash and Steel, the first game from Fire &amp; Frost, fits well into this new wave of role-playing games that attempt to capture the spirit of classic games while offering a modernized experience. The influence of the Gothic series and the first two entries in The Witcher series are evident right from the get-go, but I feel there's still a very long journey ahead for Fire &amp; Frost to make the game one worth playing for anyone besides the most die-hard RPG fans willing to look past some critical issues.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Of Ash and Steel's first taste is coming with a playtest version I had the chance to try out before its launch on Steam, which offers the chance to play through the game's prologue set in the Grotto where main character Tristan ends up together with the expedition he is part of after some unspecified events taking place at the very start of the adventure and the game's first chapter, set in the Forgotten Reach which provides a better look at what the final game will offer: an open-world RPG where player choice matters and shapes the world.</p>



<p>Right from the onset, it's clear that Fire &amp; Frost's has a solid direction in mind for its game, regarding world design. Even in the prologue, which essentially works as a tutorial, the world feels very lively. NPCs don't feel like props put in place for the player's benefit, but walk around a lot, and interact with one another, talking about a variety of things, including events that may not have any bearing in Tristan's quest, but that still help flesh out the world better. In this regard, things become even better in the Forgotten Reach, also thanks to some rather diverse activities that, while not terribly original, make the experience more varied, leaning into the simulation side of the RPG genre much like mechanics like the light survival mechanics the game currently features.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, it is very difficult to enjoy the good that Ash and Steel has to offer in this playtest due to a variety of issues. In a somewhat ironic way, the team seems to have taken the Gothic series' inspiration a little too much to heart, as the game takes the typical jank of the Piranha Bytes titles to the next level, which is not too surprising, given the small size of the development studio. Not counting the subpar visuals, which include bland environments and stiffly animated characters with some bad facial animations to boot, everything surrounding the lively world of Of Ash and Steel leaves something to be desired: movement is extremely floaty, which makes both traversal and the stamina-based combat lightly reminiscent of the Souls series formula with some environment interactions feel very unsatisfying, controller implementation is terrible, as it is essentially slapping mouse and keyboard controls on a controller with one of the worst input schemes seen in recent times, which can be thankfully be changed, an extreme lack of quality-of-life features and a general blandness of the characters and the story.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Besides being lacking on many different fronts, it's the absence of too many features that have become essential in the genre that hurts the experience the most, such as a feature that highlights objects that can be interacted with. This absence becomes egregious in one of the first few uninspired quests in the game, which tasks Tristan with killing insects by stepping on them. The problem with these insects is that their color blends with that of the ground, making it very difficult to spot them, forcing players to rely on luck to complete the quest. The absence of any quest marker is a great choice to incentivize exploration, but as things stand, it's just a hindrance, because, most of the time, NPCs don't provide good directions to the player. Another of the early quests, uninspired as much as the one described above, tasks players with recovering some tools that have been "thrown up high" by one NPC on a rock, without providing any more detail. This also led to a short "platforming" segment, which was dreadful to play with the game's current movement floatiness and terrible controls. In addition, NPCs do not repeat key dialogue, forcing players to rely on the Journal to review the vague clues they have provided, which doesn't provide anything beyond the vague directions already provided by the characters.</p>



<p>Being a playtest version, it was expected that this early version of Of Ash and Steel wouldn't be perfect, but from all its issues, it's clear how Fire &amp; Frost still has a very long journey ahead of them to make the game one worth playing. Still, the game definitely has some potential in some of its features, so I hope the studio will be able to polish the experience up and improve what doesn't currently work to make traversing and shaping Grayshaft with Tristan's choices an enjoyable exp</p>



<p>Of Ash and Steel is in development for PC. A release date has yet to be confirmed.</p>

			<p>Yesterday, a report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-09/krafton-delays-subnautica-2-game-ahead-of-250-million-payout?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MjA4MzgyNCwiZXhwIjoxNzUyNjg4NjI0LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWjU4SUFUMVVNMFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.R0p1u8-Bar_mXzXyKWDJxsN-yaSdlIWVs2GZ5WCbpAM">Bloomberg</a> revealed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-delayed-subnautica-2-2026-reportedly-to-avoid-250-million-bonus-pay/">Subnautica 2 was going to be delayed into 2026</a>, and that Krafton, the parent company of Subnautica 2 developer Unknown Worlds, had made the decision because it believed it wasn't ready for an early access launch. </p>



<p>But to Unknown Worlds developers, the timing of the delay felt too convenient, as many of them, including the <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-developer-unknown-worlds-changes-leadership-krafton/">studio's founders who were fired by Krafton at the beginning of the month</a>, felt the delay was unnecessary, and that the game was ready to launch in early access before the end of 2025. There was also the fact that, based on Unknown Worlds contract with Krafton dating back to when Krafton <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-studio-unknown-worlds-entertainment-acquired-by-krafton-inc/">acquired the studio in 2021</a>, if Unknown Worlds hit certain revenue targets by 2025, the studio was owed a $250 million bonus.</p>



<p>To members of the Unknown Worlds development team, it seemed more like Krafton delayed the highly anticipated sequel to Subnautica, a game that sold more than 6 million copies since launch, in order to avoid paying Unknown Worlds the $250 million it would be owed. It's still possible for Unknown Worlds to hit the revenue targets that would earn the studio its bonus, but per Bloomberg's report, developers feel that reaching the revenue targets that would unlock the bonus is now "<em>unattainable</em>."</p>



<p>Hours after Bloomberg's report, <a href="https://unknownworlds.com/en/news/subnautica-2-coming-2026">Unknown Worlds published a statement</a> confirming that Subnautica 2 was in fact delayed into 2026. According to the statement, the decision to delay the game came from the feedback Unknown Worlds received from an internal playtest it recently conducted. </p>



<p>"<em>We got some great feedback about Subnautica 2 during those playtests," </em>the statement reads. "<em>The community was responding well to the environment, creatures, and story, and felt positive about the general direction of the game. It gave us a great indication that we're swimming in the right direction.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>It also provided some insight that there are a few areas where we needed to improve before launching the first version of Subnautica 2 to the world. Our community is at the heart of how we develop, so we want to give ourselves a little extra time to respond to more of that feedback before releasing the game into early access. With that in mind, we've made the decision to delay Subnautica 2's early access release to 2026</em>."</p>



<p>The studio also debuted a new gameplay trailer, as part of showcasing the team's confidence in what they've been building with Subnautica 2.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Krafton, for its part, gave a statement to Bloomberg, claiming that the decision to delay Subnautica 2 "<em>was not influenced by any contractual or financial considerations</em>." The publisher also maintained that talks about delaying Subnautica 2 took place prior to the founders of Unknown Worlds being removed from the studio. </p>



<p>Per Bloomberg's report, however, delaying the game was not what founders Charlie Cleveland, Max McGuire, and Ted Gill wanted. Cleveland also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lryw9o/what_is_a_wave_but_a_thousand_drops/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">publicly stated</a> that the game was ready for an early access launch.</p>



<p>And while the public statement from Unknown Worlds claims that the delay was to improve areas of the game based on feedback from playtesters, in an internal meeting, Steve Papoutsis, the former head of Striking Distance Studios who Krafton placed as the new studio head of Unknown Worlds following Cleveland, McGuire, and Gill's firing, told the Unknown Worlds team that Krafton felt Subnautica 2 needed more content before it could launch into early access. </p>



<p>Early access games are launched with the understanding that more content is going to be added, and that elements of the game will be fixed and improved based on community feedback. We'll likely never know the exact truth behind the decision to delay Subnautica 2, but it's difficult to believe that Krafton potentially having to give Unknown Worlds a $250 million bonus played no role in the publisher's decision to delay the game, especially if it would have ensured that Unknown Worlds hit the agreed revenue targets it was meant to achieve between 2021 and 2025.</p>



<p>Subnautica 2 could very well need more content, but so does practically every game when it launches into early access. Krafton saying that the game needed more content feels like a weak reason, to say the least, made even weaker by the direct claims from Unknown Worlds founders, who also made up the core of the development team for the first Subnautica, saying that Subnautica 2 was ready to take the next step and be built alongside the community through early access.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-expanse-osiris-reborn">The Expanse: Osiris Reborn</a> has attracted a fair few <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> comparisons for its sci-fi squad combat and romanceable companions since its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rogue-trader-devs-owlcat-are-making-an-expanse-rpg-with-mass-effect-style-combat">announcement last month</a>. Not least from developers Owlcat themselves, who've namechecked the "iconic" RPGs as inspirations. In a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/611007/expanse-osiris-reborn-mass-effect-comparisons">recent interview with Polygon</a>, creative director Alexander Mishulin said he's humbled, but that Osiris Reborn also has its own approach to choice, consequence, and storytelling  that's a bit different from Bioware's sci-fi trilogy and also the other one (Andromeda was actually pretty solid though).</p>

<p>"Some [people] get into the industry of making games because they saw [Mass Effect] and were inspired. So it would be impossible to deny that Mass Effect had a lot of impact on us as game developers," Mishulin told Polygon. “On the other hand, it’s an Owlcat Games game and it’s different in many ways. We make our story a little bit differently. We’re making more choices and consequences, and we want to make sure that this game still has a lot of them provided with a lot of agency.”</p>
<p>Which I choose to interpret as him very diplomatically calling Mass Effect's morality system a bit naff, at least in comparison to the CRPG lineage Owlcat are used to working with in games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pathfinder-wrath-of-the-righteous">Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader">Warty Thou: Rogue Trader</a>. Which, fair, but also choices like "do the horrible Genophage and annoy your best Krogan mates or don't do that" felt monumental at the time. </p>
<p>"If you happen to be playing a character of Mars origin or Earth origin — and you will be able to select your origin from the start — you will not be very welcomed on Ceres because of those events," Mishulin offers as an example of how your character's background will set the stage for future encounters. But if you're playing as a Belter in the same situation, there'll more "opportunities, more places to visit, probably some new side quests and everything".</p>
<p>Owlcat aren't "modernising" Mass Effect, Mishulin goes on to say, "just making a game in the same genre but with all the modern trappings."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/owlcat-welcome-mass-effect-comparisons-with-their-expanse-rpg-but-say-theyre-approaching-choice-and-consequence-differently]]></content:encoded>
