The follow-up to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/team-sonic-racing/" data-ref-id="5000-482784">Team Sonic Racing</a> aims to combine its predecessor's formula with the more competitive make-up of the Sonic Riders games, but the culmination lacks both the cooperative nature of the first game and thrilling sense of speed of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sonic-riders/" data-ref-id="5000-25205">Riders</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sonic-riders-zero-gravity/" data-ref-id="5000-32739">Zero Gravity</a>. All that's left is a game that plays fine, but feels like a lesser version of arcade racer juggernaut Mario Kart. CrossWorlds might have been better off solely building on the teamwork focus of Team Sonic Racing (or, better yet, giving us a true follow-up to Zero Gravity that isn't built around gimmicky motion controls).</p><p dir="ltr">If you have played any kart racer, you already have an idea as to how CrossWorlds works. Like its contemporaries, you pick a character and a kart for them to drive, and then after a brief countdown, do your best to drive around a track a set number of times while going over jumps, drifting around corners, and smashing into glowing boxes that reward you with an item to use to mess with other players. The first to finish the race wins.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds - Summer Game Fest Guest Characters Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">CrossWorlds' main gimmick is how each track can cross into another--when the player currently in first place finishes their first lap, they can choose to drive into one of two portals, each of which provides a clear view of a different track on another world. Whichever portal the player picks decides the outcome for everyone, and the second lap is then run on the new track. As lap three begins, the race returns to whatever the original track was.</p><p dir="ltr">At Summer Game Fest 2025, I played a demo that showcased the CrossWorlds' Grand Prix mode, trying it on easy as Jet the Hawk and then again on normal with Amy Rose. Like Grand Prix modes in other racers, this saw me competing in back-to-back races, earning a set number of points for the place I took in each one. CrossWorlds' take on the formula is three races on three different tracks, concluding with a fourth race where lap one is the first track in the series, lap two is the second track, and so on. There's also a "rival" feature, where the game told me which opponent was my rival, and I'd earn extra points for ensuring I at least finished ahead of that character.</p><p dir="ltr">All in all, I had a good time. Racers like this are always more exciting with friends than computers, so despite the game repeatedly reminding me that so-and-so was my rival, I just couldn't muster up the level of hatred in my heart for an AI-controlled opponent that I do for my back-stabbing "friends" who use a well-timed item to take away a hard-fought victory. But I couldn't help but compare CrossWorlds to Mario Kart. The changing maps and rival character are neat, but they don't add anything to the experience that fundamentally changes how you race.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4514620-sgf.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4514620" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4514620-sgf.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4514620"></a><figcaption>Several guest characters will be included in the playable roster, including Persona 5's Joker and Minecraft's Steve.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4514620-sgf.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's such a shame how large a departure CrossWorlds is from its predecessor, Team Sonic Racing. The main gimmick of Team Sonic Racing was that every player was racing as part of a team. For example, whichever member of the team was in front would leave behind a draft their allies could use to speed up. There was this great back-and-forth, pull-and-push nature to the gameplay, which didn't exist in other mainstream competitors. Being a good racer was still important, but it was crucial to work in tandem with your teammates to maintain your top speed. It was a new way to play a kart racer.</p><p dir="ltr">I think there's a lot that a sequel could have built upon that foundation, especially as a means to differentiate itself from Mario Kart, which CrossWorlds is clearly trying to emulate. Alternatively, if the teamwork element had to be abandoned in the sequel, going even further and switching to the Riders formula might have also worked. That game leaned into Sonic's legendary speed to deliver another arcade racer that's all about going almost uncontrollably fast, while needing to strategically weigh the risks of pushing forward or replenishing your fuel. That focus would also have been a fantastic way to stand out from similar racers.</p><p dir="ltr">By taking the middle ground, CrossWorlds doesn't rise to the level of what's come before. It's still fun, but any sort of unique flavoring it could have brought to the genre feels absent. Granted, there might be a lot more to the game than what I played at Summer Game Fest--if so, that could change my mind about it.</p><p dir="ltr">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is set to launch for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, Switch, and PC on September 25. A Switch 2 version of the game is also in the works, but no release date has been confirmed.</p>

Perkins and Crawford will now serve as Darrington Press' Creative Director and Game Director, respectively, <a href="https://darringtonpress.com/welcoming-chris-perkins-and-jeremy-crawford-to-our-team/">according to an announcement on the company's website</a>.</p><p>This is a massive shakeup for the TTRPG world. Critical Role, known for its livestreamed games of Dungeons &amp; Dragons played by high-profile voice actors, launched Darrington Press in 2020. While the company's first projects were Critical Role adjacent, this year it released Daggerheart, a standalone role-playing game designed to compete with Dungeons &amp; Dragons and other similar games. The cast is currently in the midst of a mini-arc using the game system, and fans have speculated the company might intend to move away from D&amp;D entirely one day.</p>

<p>Daggerheart, the tabletop role-playing game from Critical Role, is a system that uses dice and cards to tell stories in a fantasy setting.</p>

<p>By bringing on Crawford and Perkins, Darrington Press's pedigree increases significantly. The two have worked at Wizards of the Coast for many years (Crawford for 18, Perkins for 28), and are considered two of the primary architects behind Dungeons and Dragons' extremely popular fifth edition and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2024/05/14/the-art-of-the-new-dungeons-dragons">its 2024 overhaul of that ruleset</a>. The designers were public spokespeople for the brand as well, appearing in videos to explain new books or playtests and even clarifying rules on social media. Shortly after the new books were released, however, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/chrisperkinsdnd.bsky.social/post/3llyvdjkphk2p">Chris Perkins</a> and <a href="https://screenrant.com/jeremy-crawford-chris-perkins-leaving-dnd-interview/">Jeremy Crawford</a> each announced they had decided to leave the company.</p><p>Their jump to Darrington is an unexpected move, to say the least, but it seems Wizards of the Coast was aware of the transition, making a point to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dndbeyond.com/post/3lrqh6lyth22l">congratulate the move on Bluesky</a>. <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2025-06-16/critical-role-raids-dungeons-and-dragons-coffers-to-sign-storytelling-duo">The pair also did an interview with <em>The Los Angeles Times</em></a><em> </em>explaining their decision process and generally praising the Critical Role team.</p><p>The two will be "developing novel game concepts as well as expanding the games [Darrington has] released so far," according to the announcement. This likely involves additions to Daggerheart, which launched a few weeks ago. For more Daggerheart and its inspirations, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/tabletop/2025/05/15/exclusive-diving-deep-into-critical-roles-daggerheart">you can read our interview with its lead game designer, Spenser Starke</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/16/borderlands-4-standard-edition-confirmed-to-cost-70<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Gearbox has opened pre-orders for <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/04/30/borderlands-4-deep-dive-details-new-vault-hunters-open-world-changes-loot-shakeups-and">Borderlands 4</a>, confirming a $69.99 price for the Standard Edition. This news alleviates fan concern that the upcoming shooter would retail at $80 and follows CEO Randy Pitchford’s controversial comment last month that “real fans” would find a way to purchase the game at that price.</p><p>The worry over Borderlands 4’s price stemmed from an <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1922454876803551555">exchange on X</a> with Randy Pitchford on May 13 where a fan told him the game “better not be 80 dollars.” Pitchford responded by saying the decision was “Not my call”, then added the following:</p><p>“If you’re a real fan, you’ll find a way to make it happen. My local game store had Starflight for Sega Genesis for $80 in 1991 when I was just out of high school working minimum wage at an ice cream parlor in Pismo Beach and I found a way to make it happen.”</p><p>Pitchford’s comment attracted criticism from those who took this as him implying that players who couldn’t afford to pay $80 are not true fans. It also fueled speculation that Borderlands 4 would indeed follow the growing trend set by <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/04/07/nintendo-says-mario-kart-worlds-value-justifies-its-80-price">Mario Kart World</a> of retailing at the higher price point.</p>

<p>Following the backlash, Pitchford addressed his comment by <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1925108385625809225">sharing a clip</a> from a PAX East developer panel (which occurred before Pitchford’s controversial X post), where he elaborated on Borderlands 4’s then-potential price by speaking on the current realities of video game development budgets and pricing.</p><p>“It’s an interesting time, right?” says Pitchford during the Q&amp;A session. “On one level, we’ve got a competitive marketplace where the people who make those choices want to sell as many units as possible and they want to be careful about people who are price-sensitive. So there’s some folks who don’t want to see prices go up, even the ones deciding what the prices are. There’s other folks accepting the reality that game budgets are increasing and there’s tariffs for the retail packaging and it’s getting gnarly out there, you guys. Borderlands 4 has more than twice the development budget than Borderlands 3. More than twice. So the truth is, I don’t know what the price is going to be.”</p><p>He then added, “As artists, we want everybody to have it. We want to make it as easy as possible for everybody to enjoy what we’re creating.”</p>

The quest chain becomes available to you at the beginning of Act 3, and lets the Samurai frontman have the keys to V’s body to tie up some loose ends left by his untimely demise. If you’re playing a V that is wholly uninterested in Johnny’s wants and views his engram as nothing more than a digital parasite, it might not make sense to follow this path. But if you’re even the least bit curious about the impact Johnny’s left on those still alive in 2077, do these quests. They’ll show you new sides of Keanu Reeves’ character, and even unlock a new ending path.<br></p><p><strong>Available in:</strong> Act 3</p><p><strong>How to acquire:</strong> Given by Johnny at the start of Act 3</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9df0e79f1b7a31d6e37d122d8043ce06" data-recommend-id="image://9df0e79f1b7a31d6e37d122d8043ce06" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kerry and V are shown looking down at Night City from a balcony." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kerry and V are shown looking down at Night City from a balcony." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->CD Projekt Red / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9df0e79f1b7a31d6e37d122d8043ce06" data-recommend-id="image://9df0e79f1b7a31d6e37d122d8043ce06" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kerry and V are shown looking down at Night City from a balcony." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Some of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>’s best writing is in the companion quests, and Kerry Eurodyne, the rocker boy and ex-right hand of Johnny in the Samurai days, is a particular standout. Kerry’s quests take a fascinating look at how art persists in a capitalist hellscape like Night City, and explore how even if you preserve yourself with expensive cybernetics, age and time come for us all. It’s just a matter of how you adapt to its passage.</p><p>That’s what makes Kerry’s quests interesting regardless of the V you’re playing, but if you’re rolling a male V, you can also enter a relationship with Kerry, which is one of the most interesting explorations of V and Johnny’s cohabitation. He’s the last companion you meet in the game so his story comes pretty late, but it’s definitely worth seeking out before you head into the endgame.</p><p><strong>Available in:</strong> Act 3 after A Like Supreme</p><p><strong>How to acquire:</strong> Phone call from Kerry</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="17304c88a409d71d17e978f9aaab38ba" data-recommend-id="image://17304c88a409d71d17e978f9aaab38ba" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Judy is shown sitting on the hood of a car in diving gear." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Judy is shown sitting on the hood of a car in diving gear." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->CD Projekt Red / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="17304c88a409d71d17e978f9aaab38ba" data-recommend-id="image://17304c88a409d71d17e978f9aaab38ba" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Judy is shown sitting on the hood of a car in diving gear." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Judy Alvarez is one of the few unambiguously good people in Night City, and her questline, in which she attempts to fight for better working conditions for sex workers in the city, is some of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>’s best introspective work.</p><p>The final quest, “Pyramid Song,” is one of the most memorable in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, and shows Judy wrestling with what “home” means to her when Night City has only chewed her up and spit her out.

But that new path is only open to you because Panam and her Nomad family opens V up to a new way of thinking. Vibing with the Aldecaldos, who have no connection to the city and are mostly just passing through, offers a perspective you don’t hear very often in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. So much of the time you spend in Night City is with people who put the city and its values up on a pedestal, whereas Panam and her family have the perspective to see through its bullshit.</p><p>Panam’s questline is all about helping her get the nomads into a better position to leave Night City, and maybe by the time you’re done, you’re at least considering other possibilities for yourself.</p><p><strong>Available in:</strong> Act 2 after Life During Wartime</p><p><strong>How to acquire:</strong> Phone call from Panam</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="309233db0c8fe5f9ec83638d58eae9c7" data-recommend-id="image://309233db0c8fe5f9ec83638d58eae9c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="V and River are shown looking at a computer in a bedroom." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="V and River are shown looking at a computer in a bedroom." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->CD Projekt Red / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="309233db0c8fe5f9ec83638d58eae9c7" data-recommend-id="image://309233db0c8fe5f9ec83638d58eae9c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="V and River are shown looking at a computer in a bedroom." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Unlike Panam, Judy, and Kerry, River is the one companion you have to go out of your way to meet. Finding the Night City cop and helping him sort through a local mystery that weaves in and out of his family life makes for one of the most interesting breaks in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>’s usual action. Expect a little combat and chatter, but also light adventure game mechanics and some pretty horrifying Night City lore.</p><p>This questline does, however, unmask <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>’s weird, inconsistent framing of cops and law enforcement, even weaponizing the ACAB saying in a particularly tacky lift that I’m not wild about. But if nothing else, these quests offer, for your inspection, a layer of the game’s inherent worldview that’s worth examining and dissecting.</p><p><strong>Available in:</strong> Act 2 after Life During Wartime</p><p><strong>How to acquire:</strong> Phone call from Elizabeth Peralez</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="900670a1c9768768ed74cb62383e0c4b" data-recommend-id="image://900670a1c9768768ed74cb62383e0c4b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="V and Jackie are shown standing in an elevator." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="V and Jackie are shown standing in an elevator." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->CD Projekt Red / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="900670a1c9768768ed74cb62383e0c4b" data-recommend-id="image://900670a1c9768768ed74cb62383e0c4b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="V and Jackie are shown standing in an elevator." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The trouble with “Heroes” is the quest can take different forms depending on what decisions you make during “The Heist” in Act 1. Choose to send Jackie’s body to his family or tell Delamain to wait for you with his body and you’ll be rewarded with one of the best segments in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. On the other hand, if you send him to Ripperdoc Viktor Vektor you’ll experience a much worse result that is pretty bleak.</p><p>The “good” version of “Heroes” is one of the game’s best examples of how human connection can help people weather the harsh realities of Night City. The quest reflects on Jackie’s life and legacy, and lets you insert a little of your own relationship with him, too.</p><p><strong>Available in:</strong> Act 2 after The Heist</p><p><strong>How to acquire:</strong> Phone call from Mama Welles</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="69d3d472a97106d78ae61d41e4121aff" data-recommend-id="image://69d3d472a97106d78ae61d41e4121aff" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Joshua and a corpo are shown sitting at a restaurant table while he eats." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Joshua and a corpo are shown sitting at a restaurant table while he eats." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->CD Projekt Red / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="69d3d472a97106d78ae61d41e4121aff" data-recommend-id="image://69d3d472a97106d78ae61d41e4121aff" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Joshua and a corpo are shown sitting at a restaurant table while he eats." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The questline known colloquially as “Sinnerman” is harrowing, but offers one of the most rewarding hypotheticals V will face in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. It follows convicted murderer Joshua Stephenson, who has a religious awakening in prison. Here, he decides he wants to face execution by crucifixion, which will be recorded in a Braindance for millions to experience every sensation and emotion.<br></p><p>Joshua asks V to accompany him in his final days, and the drama that unfolds asks the player to question the prisoner’s faith, whether you’re just being inquisitive or outright antagonistic. It also presents you with opportunities to meddle and interrogate whether that’s your place, making for a fascinating philosophical debate with Joshua, Johnny, and ultimately yourself.</p><p><strong>Available in:</strong> Act 2 after Life During Wartime</p><p><strong>How to acquire:</strong> Phone call from Wakako Okada</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2d9def182ef496fb2d32063a92a1b430" data-recommend-id="image://2d9def182ef496fb2d32063a92a1b430" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Peralezes are seen sitting in their living room." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Peralezes are seen sitting in their living room." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->CD Projekt Red / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2d9def182ef496fb2d32063a92a1b430" data-recommend-id="image://2d9def182ef496fb2d32063a92a1b430" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Peralezes are seen sitting in their living room." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Much of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> is spent either on the ground floor of Night City or dealing with corporations and gangs, but “Dream On” offers one of the best looks into the universe’s political systems. The quest starts with some detective work for mayoral candidate Jefferson Peralez and his wife Elizabeth, and rapidly escalates into a grand conspiracy involving political power in Night City. It goes some wild directions before reaching its conclusion, and hints at some larger forces working in the background of Night City that are fun to speculate about.</p><p><strong>Available in:</strong> Act 2 after I Fought The Law</p><p><strong>How to acquire:</strong> Phone call from Jefferson Peralez</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4d958f9aceaa208dc9dbd0d4c7519b02" data-recommend-id="image://4d958f9aceaa208dc9dbd0d4c7519b02" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="V and Johnny are shown facing off in Delamain's core." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="V and Johnny are shown facing off in Delamain's core." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->CD Projekt Red / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4d958f9aceaa208dc9dbd0d4c7519b02" data-recommend-id="image://4d958f9aceaa208dc9dbd0d4c7519b02" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="V and Johnny are shown facing off in Delamain's core." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> has a few types of collectathon quests, but the Delamain cabs ones are probably the best. The questline starts with a simple call from Delamain, the AI that runs a self-driving cab service in Night City, as several of his cars have gone MIA around the city. Each AI-powered car you round up has a distinct personality. Some are great, like a car terrified of drive too fast that you have to carefully direct back to its home base.

It comes with confirmation that Scott has already officially stepped away from Nexus Mods, “following months of meetings, face-to-face talks, and a whole lot of soul searching.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The message keeps many of the behind-the-scenes details under wraps but says two new individuals — one named Victor (a.k.a. <a href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Foledinho" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Foledinho</u></a>) and another named Marinus (a.k.a. <a href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/rapsak" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Rapsak</u></a>) — have adopted the leadership role, with both of their profiles now bearing the “Site Owner” title. The leadership change signals the beginning of a new era for Nexus Mods, and for Scott, a much-needed break.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"The strain of being responsible for the behemoth I created has taken its toll.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“The strain of being responsible for the behemoth I created has taken its toll,” Scott explained. “The stress of the job has been a regular source of anxiety and stress-related health issues. I realised that I have been burning out and this started to have an impact on my staff and Nexus Mods as a whole. So, I firmly believe that the best thing for the future of Nexus Mods is for me to step aside and bring in new leadership to steer the business forward with renewed energy to make Nexus Mods the modding community we all truly deserve.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The small project born in Scott’s bedroom for The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind eventually ballooned into a massive entity in the gaming space. The Nexus Mods <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/about" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>About Us page</u></a> notes that this beating heart of the PC gaming community is made up of 63.4 million users and 16.8 billion file downloads, positioning it as one of the most highly trafficked UK-based websites on the planet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Nexus Mods has grown, so too has its impact on Scott, who has spent “every single day” for more than 20 years “on call.” Losing his direct input in the day-to-day operations of Nexus Mods will surely result in some changes, but Scott assured modders and gamers alike that the shift should not be cause for concern.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This is me doing something I probably should’ve done years ago: taking care of myself.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“Behind the scenes, I’ve already been stepping back bit by bit,” Scott clarifies. “Over the past few years, the team has taken on more of the weight and the site’s been doing better than ever. What’s changing now is simply the formality of it, making sure the right people are in place to guide Nexus Mods into the next era.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Scott says his stepping down from Nexus Mods, as well as a few small structural changes, are moves made to ensure “long-term stability” and won’t impact how the site has been operating recently. He goes as far as to say, “Nexus Mods is community-first and mod-author focused, that’s not up for negotiation.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Scott steps away from his direct leadership position, the modding creator says he’ll still engage with the Nexus Mods community on its Mod Author Discord, forums, and more. He’ll also help guide the site’s 40-person team as the page is turned, relieving his duties as its face and figurehead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So yes, the ownership of Nexus Mods has changed hands, but I want to be clear, this isn’t some corporate ‘exit’ or a backroom deal,” Scott adds. “This is me doing something I probably should’ve done years ago: taking care of myself. Reclaiming some headspace. And finally letting go of the idea that I have to do everything and be responsible for everything myself.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nexus Mods has housed thousands of fan-made creations for games like franchises like The Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Stardew Valley, Baldur’s Gate, Cyberpunk 2077, and many, many more for decades. In fact, just moments after The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion shadow-dropped earlier this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-mods-have-already-been-published-online">dozens of minor mods had already been published on the site</a>. It’s the go-to place for PC gamers to modify their games to their liking, and with its first change in leadership in 24 years comes a fair amount of uncertainty for its future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

But these items won't be cheap — and seemingly won't be available very often.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Go has recently allowed users to engage with more of the game's activities remotely, and begun selling items that bestow the stat-boosting Lucky Friend status on players when trading creatures. Now, the introduction of Bottle Caps marks another new frontier for the game, as something that will inarguably offer a gameplay advantage — better, stronger stats for the Pokémon of your choice — in exchange for your money.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The first Gold Bottle Cap, singular, will be offered as part of a new $19.99 event pass, GO Pass Deluxe: Ancients Recovered, which is set to be made available from Monday, June 23 until Sunday, June 29. Previous passes have cost either $7.99 or $14.99, making this offering the most expensive pass yet. It will also be the first time players will have overlapping event passes, as the monthly June pass will still be ongoing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While a free version of the Ancients Recovered pass will also be available, Pokémon Go's first Gold Bottle Cap will only be offered in the pass' Deluxe version, which is a paid upgrade. The free pass will include an encounter with a Legendary Pokémon (one of the Regi family), three Pikachu wearing "dapper" costumes, plus Stardust, XP and other items. The paid upgrade adds Zacian and Zamazenta masks for your in-game avatar, plus premium in-game items such as Incense, an Incubator and Lure Modules, as well as that Gold Bottle Cap.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you buy the premium upgrade via your browser on the Pokémon Go Web Store — outside of the game, and therefore outside of Apple and Google's pesky platform fees — you will additionally receive 10 Max Revives, 10 Max Potions, five Premium Battle Passes, five Max Particle Packs, a Max Mushroom, and an Incubator.

Various concepts for their implementation have been discussed, and fans have had much to say on how they expect the feature to be introduced, how much it will cost, and how it will affect game balance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ahead of today's announcement, I put these concerns to Pokémon Go game director Michael Steranka, who said the feature had been designed to ensure Pokémon Go as a whole would not become pay-to-win.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We have been really careful with the design for Bottle Caps," Steranka told IGN, during an interview held at the game's big Go Fest 2025 live event in Paris this past weekend. "That's something where, if we weren't thoughtful with the integration, it could really destroy the economy of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"An item like a Bottle Cap is only going to be available very, very rarely," he continued. "And because of that, we don't feel that players will be able to just spend their way to having the best of the best of everything. And even once you obtain a Bottle Cap, it's actually going to be quite a lot of effort for people to Hyper Train their Pokémon to get their stats up."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p> "It's not something that is just an immediate, you know, spend money and then get powerful Pokémon type of a system.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Once unlocked via the event pass and applied to the Pokémon of your choice, a Gold Bottle Cap will begin a new feature, Hyper Training, that requires you complete tasks to slowly level your Pokémon's stats over time. Raising a Pokémon's Attack stat requires you battle using the Pokémon while it is set as your Buddy. Boosting defense will be possible as you strengthen your bond with your Buddy, by playing together, exploring, and catching other Pokémon. Levelling up HP, meanwhile, will see you exploring alongside your trainee as a buddy, spinning PokéStops, earning Buddy Candy, or via other adventures. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The fact that this further gameplay is also required will also help protect game balance, Steranka continued. "It's not something that is just an immediate, you know, spend money and then get powerful Pokémon type of a system," he said. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ahead of today's official announcement, I spent some time at Go Fest 2025 chatting with players about their thoughts on the current state of Pokémon Go, and of the previously-datamined suggestion that Bottle Caps could be introduced at some point in the future. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid some excitement for the feature's arrival, a key question I heard from fans was how often Gold Bottle Caps would be offered — and the suggestion they needed to provided sparingly, in order to preserve game balance, and also to ensure players never felt continually pressured to spend money.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's announcement describes Gold Bottle Caps as "extremely rare" and states that "obtaining one is a special occasion, so select your trainee wisely!" When asked how often Gold Bottle Caps would be offered to players, Steranka said the exact frequency of their availability was still to be announced. Still, he confirmed, they would remain a rare item, and not another item designed to simply be always available via Pokémon Go's in-game shop.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/16/bafkreiakqe47b5kliht3pu3iieqmsf26d7d6coh6yftfdujte5bcjjuipy-1750066497410.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pokémon Go Fest 2025 in Paris. Image credit: IGN.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the past, Pokémon Go has offered the ultra-rare Master Ball item a handful of times over the past few years — and this frequency is something I heard a majority of players saying they thought would be fitting for Bottle Caps.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I don't think we're ready to share the frequency that Bottle Caps will be available," Steranka said when I asked about the exact availability of the item going forward, "but it definitely will be one of the most rare items in the game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the item's price, some fans have rationalised a high cost would be likely due to the sheer rarity of finding a 100% stat Pokémon via other means, such as paying for hundreds of chances to try and encounter the creature through normal gameplay such as raids. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Prior to the announcement, players had wondered whether other forms of Bottle Cap would be available, which perhaps might raise a Pokémon's stats by a fraction, or be offered for free. That does not seem to be the case.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Right now we're launching with the Gold Bottle Cap, and that will enable you to train with a Pokémon to take any Pokémon up to max stats," Steranka confirmed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's been a busy year for Pokémon Go, whose development team now sits as part of Monopoly Go owner Scopely, following the recent closing of its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-go-dev-moves-to-reassure-players-after-35-billion-sale-to-monopoly-go-company-is-confirmed">$3.5 billion buyout of Niantic's gaming portfolio</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

                <p>Ubisoft first announced that it was remaking the beloved action-adventure game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake/" data-ref-id="5000-518598">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a>, back in September 2020, but five years on, the game has yet to even get a release date. This week, Ubisoft assured fans that development is still ongoing--but provided little detail on the game's current state.</p><p>In tweets posted from the Prince of Persia account, the company shared that "development continues behind the scenes," and it thanked fans "for sticking with us" throughout the protracted process. Ubisoft also provided an (admittedly beautiful) piece of art ostensibly from the remake, which you can see in the embed below.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/princeofpersia/status/1934642136500060166/" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><div dir="ltr"><p>Yep, we’re still deep in the game — exploring, building, and ensuring the sands move with purpose. 🗡️⏳</p><p> This game is being crafted by a team that truly cares, and they're pouring their hearts (and a lot of coffee) into every step.</p><p> Thank you for sticking with us. 💖 <a href="https://t.co/9bKjZHjmur" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/9bKjZHjmur</a></p></div>  — Prince of Persia™ (@princeofpersia) <a href="https://twitter.com/princeofpersia/status/1934642136500060166?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 16, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>In its most recent earnings call, Ubisoft shared that it plans for the remake to launch by the end of its current fiscal year; this means that the game would be released by March 31, 2026, at the latest. This was a refinement on its previous announcement of a 2026 release window, which itself followed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-might-be-going-through-a-remake-of-its-own-report/1100-6522543/" data-ref-id="1100-6522543">multiple reports of development woes</a>.</p><p>While Sands of Time fans will still need to wait a considerable amount of time before getting their hands on the remake, it isn't the only Prince of Persia title in the works. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-rogue-prince-of-persia/" data-ref-id="5000-625410">The Rogue Prince of Persia</a>, a roguelike with a cel-shaded and cartoony art style, is currently in Early Access on Steam; its 1.0 version releases in August.

It had a limited presence at Summer Game Fest earlier this month, and it did not hold its normal summertime Ubisoft Forward event. This is likely due to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-delays-multiple-upcoming-games/1100-6531542/" data-ref-id="1100-6531542">its decision to delay many of its major upcoming titles</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-confirms-fairly-tame-pc-requirements/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4-confirms-fairly-tame-pc-requirements.1219860/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-confirms-fairly-tame-pc-requirements/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier today, Gearbox Software <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-wont-cost-80/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opened</a> up the official pre-orders for Borderlands 4. Fans of the looter shooter franchise certainly held their breath for a while when Gearbox president Randy Pitchford wouldn't confirm the pricing, and now they can rest a bit easier knowing that the game won't be priced at $80 as some had feared.</p>
<p>Alongside the opening of pre-orders, though, the Texas-based development studio also revealed the minimum and recommended PC requirements for Borderlands 4. They can be read on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/borderlands-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a> pages, although we've posted them below too for your convenience.</p>
<p><em><strong>Minimum:</strong></em><br>
<em>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</em><br>
<em>OS: Windows 10 / Windows 11</em><br>
<em>Processor: Intel Core i7-9700 / AMD Ryzen 7 2700X</em><br>
<em>Memory: 16 GB RAM</em><br>
<em>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 / AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT</em><br>
<em>Storage: 100 GB available space</em><br>
<em>Additional Notes: Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system. Requires 8 CPU Cores for processor. Requires 8 GB VRAM for graphics. SSD storage required</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Recommended</strong>:</em><br>
<em>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</em><br>
<em>OS: Windows 10 / Windows 11</em><br>
<em>Processor: Intel Core i7-12700 / AMD Ryzen 7 5800X</em><br>
<em>Memory: 32 GB RAM</em><br>
<em>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 / AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT</em><br>
<em>Storage: 100 GB available space</em><br>
<em>Additional Notes: Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system. Requires 8+ CPU Cores for processor. Requires 12+ GB VRAM for graphics. SSD storage required</em></p>
<p>Considering that Borderlands 4 is powered by Unreal Engine 5, these system requirements are fairly tame compared to others we've seen. The game is also said to offer the largest and most seamless map in the franchise, with anything you see in the distance reachable by the players.</p>
<p>Traversal has been improved, too, with moves such as double jumping, gliding, dodging, and grappling available. As with the previous entries, drop-in, drop-out cooperative gameplay is said to be the centerpiece of the game, and cross-play is also supported (although you'll need to sign up for a SHiFT Account to join fellow teammates from other platforms).</p>
<p>Borderlands 4 is set to debut on September 12 for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

The <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/christopher-perkins-retires-from-wizards-of-coast-after-28-years-working-on-dungeons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">two</a> <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/jeremy-crawford-game-director-of-dungeons-dragons-is-leaving-wizards-of-ghost" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">former</a> creative leads behind the most popular edition of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>will now collaborate with Critical Role's tabletop studio to produce new TTRPG experiences.</p>



<p>In an official <a href="https://darringtonpress.com/welcoming-chris-perkins-and-jeremy-crawford-to-our-team/" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, Darrington Press announced that Chris Perkins and Jeremy Crawford will be joining their design team. Perkins will be joining as the Creative Director, and Crawford's new role will be Game Director. They will be both developing novel game concepts and expanding upon games previously released by Darrington Press.</p>

Perkins was the Senior Story Designer for <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Fifth Edition, playing a key role in shaping the official campaign modules and settings of the fantasy TTRPG. Crawford was the lead system designer for Fifth Edition, introducing the highly influential Advantage/Disadvantage mechanic.</p>

<p>Perkins and Crawford recently left Wizards of the Coast after working on the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-dungeon-masters-guide-review-true-dms-best-friend" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024</em></a> Core Rulebooks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Storytelling has always been at the heart of everything I do, and joining Darrington Press feels a bit like coming home,” said Perkins, Creative Director of Darrington Press. “I’ve loved being a part of the extended Critical Role family as a regular guest over the years and I’m beyond excited to help create new worlds full of adventure.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The addition of Chris Perkins and Jeremy Crawford to the core design team has continued to expand Darrington Press' clout. There is a strong possibility they can bring their substantive experience to guide and build upon the company's <a href="https://darringtonpress.com/success-with-fear-daggerheart-sold-out/" rel="nofollow">best-selling</a> hit, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/daggerheart-review-narrative-forward-yes-and-ttrpg-that-is-force-to-be-reckoned" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Daggerheart</em></a>. Alternatively, their new position offers new creative freedom to try different things away from Wizards of the Coast.</p>

<p>Either way, this shift of talent is huge for the tabletop industry as a whole, one that will lead to ongoing competition and innovation.</p>

                <p>Roger Clark, who voiced Arthur Morgan in Red Dead Redemption II, has revealed his newest project--and it's out soon. It's not another western, but instead a game about cats.</p><p>Clark is lending his voice to Ultra Mega Cats, a PvE co-op shooter "where badass cats battle waves of enemies in explosive arenas." Clark is voicing the feline Clint, and he described his work on the game as <a href="https://x.com/rclark98/status/1934660290420822433" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"another wild ride in the gaming world."</a> Clint is a cowboy cat who dual-wields pistols, so while this role is unexpected and very different, it does harken back to Clark's most famous role in Rockstar's Western.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCut0thGMIY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oCut0thGMIY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Ultra Mega Cats has players controlling so-called Mega Cats, which are basically cats with super-abilities and incredible power.</p><p>"Imagine living in a world flipped upside down, where rodents and feathered forces rule and cats are shunned. You're one of the last cats standing--disgraced, brainwashed, and trained to serve your former prey as their personal killing machine," reads a line from the game's description. "But that is not enough, as the cat's soul knows no master! Awaken your inner predator and restore balance to this world!"</p><p>There are five different cats in Ultra Mega Cats, including two who will be available when the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1882130/Ultra_Mega_Cats/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">launches into Steam Early Access on June 17</a>. Each cat has 50 different modifications that can be unlocked over time. Take a look at the trailer above to get a closer look at Ultra Mega Cats.</p><p>After Red Dead Redemption II, Clark also had voice roles in Back 4 Blood and Tactics Ogre: Reborn, among other projects.</p><p>As for the Red Dead series, John Marston actor <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemptions-john-marston-actor-teases-exciting-news-coming-soon/1100-6532444/" data-ref-id="1100-6532444">Rob Wiethoff has teased big news for this week</a> amid reports of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-may-be-heading-to-switch-2-report/1100-6532372/" data-ref-id="1100-6532372">Red Dead Redemption II heading to Switch 2, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. </a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shadow-launches-next-generation-cloud-gaming-tier-%E2%80%98neo%E2%80%99.1219821/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/shadow-launches-next-generation-cloud-gaming-tier-neo/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, French cloud platform <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadow-impressions-cloud-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SHADOW</a> announced '<a href="https://shadow.tech/shadowpc/offers/#pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neo</a>', a new tier of its cloud gaming offering. Neo replaces the previous 'Boost' tier with much-improved specifications, delivering greatly accelerated performance in gaming (up to 150%) and software (up to 200%). All current subscribers at the Boost tier have been upgraded to Neo, which is still priced at $37.99 monthly, taxes excluded. These are the updated specs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CPU:</strong> AMD EPYC – 8 vCores @ 3.25-3.8GHz</li>
<li><strong>GPU:</strong> Equivalent to NVIDIA RTX 4060 16GB (Server-grade NVIDIA RTX 2000 ADA 16GB)</li>
<li><strong>RAM:</strong> 16GB DDR5</li>
<li><strong>Network:</strong> 1Gb/s fiber connection</li>
<li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 10/11</li>
</ul>
<p>Olivier Abecassis, CEO at Shadow, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Neo is our newest and most versatile cloud PC yet. Whether you’re gaming in 2K with RTX and DLSS, editing complex 3D models, or working on the go, Shadow Neo gives you the power of a high-end PC — instantly and from anywhere.</em></p>
<p>The new configuration supports DirectX 12, Vulkan 1.3, RTX, DLSS, FSR, and Frame Generation. This, however, raises the question of whether the Power tier makes any sense anymore. Currently, Power provides access to a similar CPU and an older GPU, the RTX 3070 Ti. When factoring in the fact that the RTX 4060 has access to DLSS Frame Generation while the RTX 3070 Ti does not, paying $50 for the Power tier does not make much sense, as the performance is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdmAG4PL7Nk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly the same</a> in some games. SHADOW will have to upgrade this tier too shortly to make it viable again.</p>
<p>Overall, you might be baffled to hear about such high prices compared to, for example, NVIDIA's GeForce NOW platform, which lets you rent an RTX 4080-class GPU for $20 monthly. The big difference is that SHADOW gives you access to a whole PC, so you can use it however you see fit. That means installing any kind of software, or, staying within the gaming subject, being able to install mods for your PC games, which isn't really possible on GeForce NOW (or similar competitors like Boosteroid).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-says-it-is-still-deep-in-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-development/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ubisoft has finally provided an update on how things are going with the highly anticipated Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake, and the update is that they're still working on it.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/princeofpersia/status/1934642136500060166">post on the studio's official Prince of Persia X account</a>, Ubisoft simply says, "<em>Yep, we're still deep in the game - exploring, building, and ensuring the sands move with purpose. This game is being created by a team that truly cares, and they're pouring their hearts (and a lot of coffee) into every step. Thank you for sticking with us</em>."</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/princeofpersia/status/1934642139247321113">follow-up post</a>, Ubisoft reminds players that there's another Prince of Persia game they could go play right now, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-early-access-review-the-year-of-the-prince/">The Rogue Prince of Persia</a>.</p>
<p>"<em>While development continues behind the scenes, there's another adventure waiting for you right now: The Rogue Prince of Persia</em>."</p>
<p>The post also includes a new piece of art from the game, displaying the exterior of one of the buildings those who played the original game will remember.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Last month, the company's annual earnings report confirmed that the remake will be out by<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-2026-no-word-on-splinter-cell-remake/"> March 2026</a>, which is only a small update from the game's previous release window of '<a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-releases-in-2026/">sometime in 2026</a>'.</p>
<p>Ubisoft has <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-will-expand-farahs-character-long-development-time-is-due-to-high-remake-bar/">previously spoken</a> about having a high bar for this remake, which is evident from the fact that the company <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-fully-rebooted/">entirely rebooted the game's development once before</a>, after its initial reveal <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-ubisoft-montreal/">failed to impress</a>.</p>
<p>It may be upsetting for fans of the series who are looking forward to this remake that there's still basically no update on how things are going, but it's also not surprising given <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-reveals-release-date-for-anno-117-pax-romana-a-1-0-release-window-for-the-rogue-prince-of-persia-and-showcases-a-new-game-morbid-metal-at-sgf-2025/">Ubisoft's muted appearance during this year's Summer Game Fest festivities</a>. And with the lack of a <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-will-not-host-its-annual-ubisoft-forward-event-this-year/">Ubisoft Forward</a> event for 2025, it's not worth holding your breath on any major updates from Ubisoft this year.</p>

That same rep claimed it would be added shortly after launch via an update if the team couldn’t get the feature working in time. </p><p>It is a bit funny how, in 2025, the idea of an online video game launching without crossplay is news. A few years ago, crossplay was still a relatively new concept, and it wasn’t a guarantee that a multiplayer game would support letting Xbox and PlayStation people play together. Now, if your game doesn’t ship with crossplay, it’s weird, and people get mad. We all really got used to crossplay being a given in a short amount of time, huh? </p><p><em>Rematch </em>is out now on PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and PC if you paid extra for the fancier editions of the game. It launches for everyone on June 19, when it will also become available via Game Pass on Xbox. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The cloud-gaming service Shadow, which provides cloud computational resources for gamers as well as professionals, has launched a new high-end machine. Called Neo, this new machine runs the equivalent of an Nvidia 4060 GPU and is a free upgrade for users who already subscribe to Shadow's high-end service.</p><p>The company states that this new cloud PC will facilitate "up to 150%" more performance in gaming-related tasks, alongside a 200% boost in "pro software" performance. Its new components enable more options for gamers, such as improved DLSS and ray tracing. In addition to the new GPU, the Neo PC has a CPU with eight vCores ranging between 3.25-3.8 GHz, 16GB of DDR5 RAM, and is connected to a 1Gb/s network connection.</p><p>Neo will be rolled out for free to existing users of Shadow's previous Boost tier, while new users can subscribe for $38/month. This upgrade brings Shadow's offerings closer to its main competitor in the PC cloud-gaming space, Nvidia GeForce Now, which offers 4080-equivalent performance at its highest tier. While GeForce Now is considerably cheaper (at about $17/month), Shadow's main advantage is that it provides a full Windows experience. This means that users can directly access and download their full PC games libraries without restriction, as well as use any software that works on Windows.</p><p>Shadow has been around for a while, and it seems to have found a niche with gamers who also want to have access to computational resources for other tasks. While the company once experimented with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shadow-game-streaming-offers-a-powerful-cloud-pc-b/1100-6465346/" data-ref-id="1100-6465346">offering its own set-top box</a>, it now emphasizes the accessibility of its app across many mobile and desktop operating systems.</p>

                <p>Two years ago, BattleBit Remastered caught on after its early-access release and it was briefly one of the most popular shooters online. BattleBit's player count had dramatically dropped since 2023 and the game was seemingly abandoned. Now, however, it appears the game could find a new lease on life with a forthcoming update.</p><p>A very short teaser for BattleBit Remastered's Operation Overhaul has been shared by the game's publisher and co-developer, SgtOkiDoki. There's not much to go in the clips, but it's the first sign of life that BattleBit has had in 18 months.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> BattleBit Remastered - Operation Overhaul | Gameplay Teaser Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>SgtOkiDoki and fellow indie developers Vilaskis and TheLiquidHorse released BattleBit Remastered in June 2023, and players embraced its easy-to-play mechanics. What the game lacked in visual splendor, it made up for with destructible environments, relatively realistic depictions of weapons, 254-player lobbies, and large maps to explore. At its peak, BattleBit Remastered had 87,323 concurrent players.</p><p>BattleBit's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/671860/BattleBit_Remastered/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam page</a> hasn't been updated with any details about the update yet and it still has the notice from Valve that the game hasn't had any developer activity for a long time. The most recent peak for BattleBit's concurrent players was just over 1,000, which suggests most of the game's audience has moved on. It remains to be seen if the new update can revive interest in the title.</p><p>In 2023, GameSpot's Firearms Expert Reacts featured <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/firearms-expert-reacts-to-battlebit-remastereds-guns-part-2/2300-6461878/" data-ref-id="2300-6461878">an extended look at BattleBit's depiction of weapons</a> and determined that they were largely true-to-life and realistic, despite the game's low-poly aesthetic.</p>

            <p>
With Borderlands 4's September release inching closer, publisher Take-Two has announced pricing and a variety of special editions for the shooter. And there's good news for anyone worried an $80 price tag might be on the cards following all that recent hoo-ha; the standard edition does not, it turns out, cross Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford's "real fan" threshold.
</p>
<p>
Pitchford, of course, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/80-for-borderlands-4-too-costly-randy-pitchford-says-if-youre-a-real-fan-youll-find-a-way-to-make-it-happen">raised more than a few eyebrows last month</a>, when he implied potential customers not willing to spend $80 on Borderlands 4 (amid a hypothetical discussion of its price tag) weren't 'real fans'. His statement - that "real fans" would find a way to get their hands on a copy of the game, even if it came with a $80 price tag - did not go down well, and Pitchford <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4s-randy-pitchford-seeks-to-justify-80-real-fans-comment">later attempted to justify his comments in a longer video</a>. Unfortunately, he then followed that up with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-slam-gearbox-ceo-randy-pitchfords-message-to-cost-sensitive-fans">another ill-conceived social media post</a> irritated fans quickly branded "tone-deaf".
</p>
<p>
But it turns out Pitchford could probably have avoided needlessly annoying the Borderlands community if he'd just held fire a little longer. Take-Two has now confirmed Borderlands 4 will, in fact, cost $70 for the standard edition of the game - but the full story is a little more complicated given regional pricing, variations in platform pricing, and the usual scrum of special editions offering various strands of Borderlands <em>stuff</em>.
</p>
<p>
PC is where you'll pick up Borderlands 4 cheapest; the standard edition costs £59.99 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/borderlands-4">Epic</a>, and you'll be paying £69.99 for the same version on Xbox Series X/S and PS5. That then climbs to £89.99 for the Deluxe Edition (which I suppose is now technically the Real Fan Edition given the price) and £119.99 for the Super (Fan?) Deluxe Edition.
</p>
<p>
And in case you're wondering what the difference is, the Deluxe Edition features the game, the Bounty Pack Bundle (which includes four post-launch DLC packs promising new areas, missions, and bosses), plus Vault Cards containing more challenges and rewards, new gear and weapons, four new vehicles, Vault Hunter cosmetics, and the Firehawk's Fury Weapon Skin.
</p>
<p>
The Super Deluxe Edition, meanwhile, includes all the above, plus the Ornate Order Pack (featuring Vault Hunter Skins, four Vault Hunter Heads and four Vault Hunter Bodies), and the Vault Hunter Pack. This latter includes two post-launch Story Packs, each bringing a new Vault Hunter, new story and side missions, new map regions, new gear and weapons, plus additional Vault Hunter and ECHO-4 cosmetics.
</p>
<p>
So to recap, Borderlands 4 - now with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-will-dial-down-the-toilet-humour-says-narrative-director">less toilet humour</a>! - launches for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC on 12th September.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-how-are-you-finding-mario-karts-open-world<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d9088ee9f8b68/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Many of us have just wrapped up our second weekend with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, and by this point you've probably seen most of the Grand Prix mode and had your rear end handed to you various times in Knockout Tour (I swear, there's no middle ground with that one - I either do really well or go out in the first two laps!), and are starting to explore Free Roam mode a little more.</p>
<p>'Open-world Mario Kart' sounded like a tasty drive-thru feast and while all of us here at Nintendo Life are love with the world itself and the way the tracks are seamlessly integrated across the regions, we're up and down like a suspension bridge on whether the open-world experience is as fun as it could be.</p>
<p>We're interested to get your thoughts, but first, let's see where Team NL are after spending a definitely-not-unhealthy number of hours with the game in the 11 days since launch...</p>
<h2>Hopping for more (Gavin Lane, editor)</h2>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9fb1e750ae6f4/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I love the world itself, the tracks, and — despite popular opinion — the transitions between circuits that finish up with a lap or two on the course proper. There's variety there, and I'm seriously impressed by how the devs mark out routes in such a way that I never, ever take a wrong turn. The terrain and track design is peerless.</p>
<p>Exploring the island, though, is a bit less engaging than I'd hoped from the company that gave us <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a>. There's definitely an element of, 'Oof, there's another coin I need to screenshot for a guide' that isn't the typical play experience, but I'm struggling to enjoy exploring as much as racing.</p>
<p>I do think that this game is crying out for a MK64-style on-the-spot spin - so often I want to just 180 degrees, but no, it's a slow arc...and then I accidentally hit a boost plate or something. Zeroing in on a specific spot on the map feels like trying to land a plane sometimes.</p>
<p>Same deal with the jump - right now, I'm just dying for a double jump because lining up a straight-line boost-hop thing, again, means I've got one approach and if I botch it (which I often do), I'll need to go around for another pass. Yes, rewind is a lifesaver but at the moment, I feel like open-world exploration would be much more enjoyable if the controls were 20% more platformer.</p>
<h2>Open to secrets (Alana Hagues, deputy editor)</h2>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c4c8cddcf05be/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It seems like I'm enjoying the open world more than most. Admittedly, a big part of that is because I'm going around finding all of the collectibles — I'm being forced to see just how the courses are interlinked, and how seasons and environments shift. It's honestly a little bit staggering.</p>
<p>All those collectible items encourage you to interact with the world in ways you've never had to in Mario Kart before. Deviously-placed Peach Medallions on top of a building, and there's no reasonable way up top? Time to find a pipe or a rail or something!</p>
<p>But I realise a lot of my enjoyment comes from either doing tricky challenges or simply taking a load off. I absolutely think that Free Roam needs something else to make it excellent and enjoyable for all. I'm sure others share this sentiment, but stickers being the only reward is bonkers. Why do I not get a themed kart for getting all the panels on one course? What is this highway other than a connecting road between Mario Circuit and Moo Moo Meadows? Why can't I collect music tracks or something else?</p>
<p>Anyway, Free Roam is fun to me, but it's not deep. I wish it were deeper.Though those miniature tributes to the SNES courses like Vanilla Lake and Choco Island are adorable.</p>
<h2>Racing to find the point (Ollie Reynolds, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4edc6317ec289/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Right now, exploring Mario Kart World via Free Roam is like being handed a giant bowl of delicious Lamb Jalfrezi with all the trimmings and being told I can't eat it. It's a truly stunning world; one that manages to outdo <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> in almost every conceivable way, yet I find it utterly boring.</p>
<p>There are P Switch missions, yes, and Peach Medallions, all that good stuff, but the game is simply lacking any compelling reason or incentive to actually seek them out. I'm sorry, but I don't care in the slightest about bloomin' stickers.</p>
<p>Truth be told, if Nintendo had tied character unlocks to the open world, this would have gone a long way toward making Free Roam a compelling mode. Perhaps you spot Pianta cruising along in the distance and driving up to it triggers a spontaneous head-to-head race. Beat it and you unlock it. Simple!</p>
<p>Just little things like this could potentially transform the open world into an environment worth exploring. At the moment, despite being full of cool little references and easter eggs, it feels weirdly barren.</p>
<h2>A pleasant pit-stop (Jim Norman, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8999c35c6b7fd/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Perhaps I am something of an outlier here because I have been knee-deep in P Switch guides for the last week and a half, but I'm finding the open-world driving to be a nice bit of harmless fun — if a little intimidating with there being so much to do.</p>
<p>I totally agree with Ollie that every challenge feels a little aimless at the moment, and some kind of Metal Mario-style reward might motivate me to hit the big 100% sooner, but I'm enjoying hopping in for a spot of open-world cruisin' when the stresses of Knockout Tour get too much.</p>
<p>You can barely drive for 10 seconds without spotting a handful of switchs, a coin, or a naughty Nabbit in need of pursuing, and it has been nice to drop in for five minutes here and there to cross a few of them off my list before hitting the track properly again. I'm enjoying the level of challenge most of the time, too (though anything too focused on Wall Riding can take a hike).</p>
<p>Do I wish there was a point to it all? Yeah, I do. Do I wish I could do more proper exploring with a partner in split screen? Absolutely. But as a first attempt for the series, it feels like a nice introduction to something different.</p>
<h2>Good, but the map can do one (PJ O'Reilly, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/39cb4a7b06450/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I've been finding the open world aspect a whole lot of fun, overall. It's not reinventing anything, and it does feel primarily aimed at younger gamers — I mean, the whole game is, but you can really feel it here. But it's easy-breezy and packed full of light puzzling fun with the underlying carrot of collectibles and outfits keeping you engaged.</p>
<p>However, and it is a big however for me, the map is absolutely awful. Why can't I just pull it up and see where I am quickly? Why make it so hard? Yes, the mini-map <em>is</em> very detailed, but it's too zoomed in for me, personally.</p>
<p>Aside from this gripe, though, yeah, it's a good time that feels like it warrants its place in the package as a whole. Do I wish you could drive to a stadium and start a race directly that way? Yes, and I feel like they could do more with how free roam is utilised for multiple players, but this is still a nice diversion when racing for all those three-star golds gets a bit tiring.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>So, that's where we are - but what about you? Are you taken with the open-world ambition? Are you merrily picking up Peach coins and P-Switches, or are you jonesing for something more? Let us know in the poll below.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/sloclap-rematch-wont-support-cross-play-at-launch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Rematch, the upcoming soccer game from Sifu developer Sloclap, is due to arrive for everyone this <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/sifu-developer-sloclap-has-announced-a-release-date-for-its-new-soccer-game-rematch/">Thursday, June 19, 2025</a>.&nbsp;</strong>It should be an exciting launch for the studio, as Rematch had an extremely popular beta test with more than 1.9 million players jumping in on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>
<p>But that excitement has been significantly quelled, with today's reveal by Sloclap that the game will not support cross-play between players on other platforms.</p>
<p>"<em>Crossplay between Steam, PlayStation &amp; Xbox won't be available at launch,</em>" <a href="https://x.com/PlayRematch/status/1934529603244028143">Sloclap announced in a post on the game's official X account</a>. "<em>But it's one of our top priorities for upcoming updates! We'll share an ETA as soon as possible, stay tuned!</em>"</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/PlayRematch/status/1934628094624567591">separate post</a>, Sloclap said it "<em>aimed for launch but couldn't quite get it ready in time. We're actively working on it.</em>"</p>
<p>Rematch is already available for those who paid for early access, and it was only about an hour before that early access launch that Sloclap delivered the disappointing news about cross-play functionality. It's clear the team was trying to have it ready in time, but delivering the news so close to the game's early access release, the one reserved for those who paid extra for the privilege of playing three days early, is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Rematch/comments/1lcua7w/the_game_still_feels_like_a_beta/">upsetting players online</a>.</p>
<p>The mood around Rematch isn't helped by the fact that players are reporting major server issues impacting their experience.</p>
<p><iframe title="REMATCH | Golden Rules Trailer | Release Date Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EFMw23F-KbA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hopefully, by the time the game is available for everyone on Thursday, Sloclap has resolved the biggest of its server issues, and players are able to have a smoother time than they are now. And hopefully it doesn't all break again once cross-play support is added.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nexus Mods</a>, PC gaming's premier destination for mods, is changing hands after almost 24 years. Site founder Robin Scott, aka DarkOne, announced the change in ownership but didn't make clear who the new owners are.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15301" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post</a> on Nexus Mods, Scott doesn't explicitly state who the site's new owners are, only that it took many months of meetings and face-to-face talks to find a new owner that would "respect the myriad intricacies of both Nexus Mods as a business and the wider modding community." The new owners are focused on "long-term stability, not changing the values or direction of the platform," Scott said, and that the site will continue to be "community-first and mod-author focused."</p><p>"So yes, the ownership of Nexus Mods has changed hands, but I want to be clear, this isn't some corporate 'exit' or a backroom deal," Scott said. "This is me doing something I probably should've done years ago: taking care of myself. Reclaiming some headspace. And finally letting go of the idea that I have to do everything and be responsible for everything myself."</p><p dir="ltr">Scott cited burnout and health reasons for stepping away from running the site he founded. Scott said running the website since 2001 and always being "on call" has been an ongoing source of anxiety and "stress-related health issues." While the site was born out of personal excitement for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind/" data-ref-id="5000-2508">The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</a>, it later transformed into a business that consumed his life.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's been rewarding, sometimes chaotic, often exhausting, and always personal," Scott said. "Somewhere along the way, I forgot to step back and breathe, or sleep properly. The dilemma of running a major social network that does not rest!"</p><p dir="ltr">Scott said that his burnout and exhaustion began to have a negative effect on the site and the Nexus Mods team, making him come to the realization that the "best thing" for the future of Nexus Mods was to step aside and bring in new leadership.</p><p dir="ltr">Though Scott is no longer the owner, he will still be involved in helping guide the overall direction of the site, just "without needing to be the person who signs off on every little thing." In terms of what will change, it doesn't seem like it will be much, at least according to Scott. He said he had already started stepping back in recent years and that the structural updates to the company's ownership are more of a formality to make sure the right people are in control to guide the site into the future.</p><p dir="ltr">Modding, and Nexus Mods, has only continued to grow in the last two decades. Massive RPGs like Skyrim, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-fallout-4-mods/2900-5217/" data-ref-id="2900-5217">Fallout 4</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-cyberpunk-2077-mods/2900-6512/" data-ref-id="2900-6512">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-baldurs-gate-3-mods/2900-5661/" data-ref-id="2900-5661">Baldur's Gate 3</a> all having extensive modding communities that are made easily accessible thanks to sites like Nexus Mods, where mod creators can easily upload their creations and those looking to augment their games on PC can easily browse for new additions.</p><p dir="ltr">For those looking to make the jump into the wild world of user-made mods, be sure to check out our round-up of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-skyrim-mods/2900-6392/" data-ref-id="2900-6392">best Skyrim mods to play in 2025</a>, as well as similar lists for popular mod-friendly games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-elden-ring-mods/2900-5480/" data-ref-id="2900-5480">Elden Ring</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-stardew-valley-mods/2900-5735/" data-ref-id="2900-5735">Stardew Valley</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/recreating-the-freedom-and-fantasy-of-tony-hawk-s-pro-skater-3-4<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="captioned-content" data-testid="featured-image"><p><span>Via Iron Galaxy/Activision</span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The impact that the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater games had on extreme sports titles and the skateboarding community can't be overstated. The original games from developer Neversoft deftly captured the joy of building your skate style and exploring a popular destination transformed into a skatepark. Vicarious Visions' 2020 remake, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, was a firm reminder that iconic THPS gameplay still hits—and we're getting the next bundle soon with the revamped </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During Summer Game Fest 2025, we had the opportunity to play Iron Galaxy’s take on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>3 + 4</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. While checking out the renewed titles, we spoke with game director Kurt Tillmanns about stepping in for the previous remake developer and what makes the classic THPS gameplay so timeless.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We're huge fans of the franchise; most of the team have been playing the games their whole lives," said Tillmanns. "It's a great honor to be working with Tony Hawk to carry on with what Vicarious Visions had done on an amazing project [with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>1 + 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">], and then just carry it forward and make improvements and additions in every possible place we can."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developer Iron Galaxy has an extensive history of assisting developers and even taking over development from other teams, particularly Killer Instinct's final seasons. Much like the 2020 remake, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>THPS 3 + 4</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> focuses on revitalizing the original 2000s-era games with refined gameplay and more fleshed-out mechanics that incorporate features from later games in the series, such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tony Hawk's Underground</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and its suite of wall planting and spine transferring.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/after-years-of-preparation-ioi-is-ready-to-apply-its-lethal-learnings-to-007-first-light" target="_self" data-discover="true">Lethal learnings from Hitman prepared IOI for making 007: First Light</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Iron Galaxy chose a novel approach in adapting the career mode from the fourth game of the series, which offered free-roam maps and other skaters hawking missions. It was a well-loved feature and even formed the basis of the skater story mode in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tony Hawk's Underground</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but, as is, it couldn’t work with both </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>4</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—so the developers opted for a more seamless blend between them. The compromise allows players to skate in parks for up to an hour, giving them the freedom to skate as they like.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The experience of exploring a sandbox skatepark filled with half-pipes and bizarre activities that lean into the rebellious nature of skate culture is at the heart of what makes the THPS games so enjoyable. When it came to delivering a remake of the third and forth games, the developers still wanted to deliver on the heightened reality of the "skater fantasy."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Humor and rule-breaking are part of the Tony Hawk formula">Humor and rule-breaking are part of the Tony Hawk formula</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Part of the legacy of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater is that it has a sense of humor about itself, and it can break a bunch of rules," said the game director. "Some of that even starts with the level, like the way that we designate levels in Tony Hawk or think about the forbidden, fantastic places in them. You have forbidden places in real-world locations that you just want to skate in and feel like a real skater, and then we also have places like Area 51 or this Pinball Machine level."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/what-i-learned-during-a-marvellous-meeting-with-to-a-t-creator-keita-takahashi" target="_self" data-discover="true">What I learned during a marvelous meeting with To a T creator Keita Takahashi</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We can kind of break reality, and then the skaters are also an extension of that. Having a variety of guest characters [such as Michelangelo from TMNT and the Doom Slayer] is another way for us to break the rules of reality and just give you a new skater fantasy."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">More than 25 years since the release of the original </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the games have left an undeniable impact and set a standard for action-sports games—and the upcoming remake of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>3 + 4</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> looks to keep the party going.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Iron Galaxy, the experience of being a skateboarder and leaving your mark in a setting that has been transformed into a skater's playground is what makes the series feel timeless and approachable.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There's something about these games that represents freedom, like there's no wrong way to play a Tony Hawk game, right?" said the game director. "It's like you can express yourself in a million different ways, and every time you play a level, it's going to be different however you want to complete the goals in whatever order you want. We've seen people replay levels, and each run opens up new possibilities.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/why-remedy-entertainment-built-fbc-firebreak-around-the-player-s-schedule-not-the-other-way-around" target="_self" data-discover="true">Why Remedy Entertainment built FBC Firebreak around the player's schedule, not the other way around</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"To me, I think the timelessness stems from the fact that it has an awesome sandbox where people are free to do anything they want. I think that's what makes it timeless for sure."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributor</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Alessandro Fillari is a writer/editor who has covered the games, tech, and entertainment industries for more than 12 years.
