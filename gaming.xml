		<p>We got to get an early start on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> last night, booting up our Nintendo Switch 2 and diving into the new generation open world kart racer from the very start.</p>
<p>We’d absolutely recommend watching this on as high a resolution TV or screen as possible, as the stream is available in full 4K to show off the game at its highest fidelity.</p>
<p><iframe title="Watch us play Mario Kart World &amp; Switch 2!" width="780" height="585" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IVLByZfnbiY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>We sample a bit of the Grand Prix mode (where I drive really, really poorly), before hopping into a Knockout Tour, some of the open world Free Roam mode, and then wrapped things up just ahead of the PlayStation State of Play stream.</p>
<p>We’ll likely be streaming more of what we’re playing on Nintendo Switch 2 over the coming days on YouTube, so make sure to like, subscribe, click the bell icon and the usual things to get notifications. And obviously keep your eyes peeled for our full reviews of the Switch 2 launch titles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-gets-pc-requirements-and-new-gameplay-trailer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During <a href="https://wccftech.com/everything-shown-at-the-june-2025-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yesterday's State of Play livestream</a>, KONAMI aired a new Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater gameplay trailer. The footage shows off Snake's various stealth and disguise options before moving to more direct fight scenes against a few of the game's bosses. Before the end, the developers also offered a glimpse at the returning Snake vs Monkey minigame, which will be available on PC and PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>Following years of rumors telling of a Metal Gear Solid 3 remake, KONAMI finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-mgs3-remake-original-trilogy-returning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater in May 2023. This new version is being made with the help of Virtuos, which has also worked with Bethesda on the recently released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered.</a></p>
<p>Last year, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-hasnt-been-messed-with-says-konami-console-graphics-modes-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that the narrative would remain exactly the same as in the original. At the same time, the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-gameplay-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">admitted</a> that the control scheme had to be updated to modern standards.</p>
<p>Players can opt for the newly added, more modern control style. These intuitive controls allow them to focus entirely on the game. Alternatively, it is also possible to stick with the classic control style for those who desire the full-blown nostalgia effect.</p>
<p><iframe title="Metal Gear Solid Δ: Snake Eater - Gameplay Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sKMayCD1u3w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is powered by Unreal Engine 5 technology, which brings a massive visual improvement over the original game. The developers said that characters are rendered with such detail that you can see facial wrinkles and pores, as well as separate eye and iris movements, allowing for rich and expressive facial animations.</p>
<p>You can also find the PC system requirements below, courtesy of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2417610/METAL_GEAR_SOLID_D_SNAKE_EATER/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page</a>. The game is out <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-releases-august-28-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on August 28</a> for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

        <p>Dice Legends is a fair bit more interesting than that name suggests</p>

            <p>I haven't yet decided whether the loot tortoise in roguelike deckbuilder <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dice-legends">Dice Legends</a> looks satisfied or exhausted. Both make sense to me. "He's grown used to this, but still isn't thrilled about it," offered my sister. I would not be thrilled either. Imagine being aware of Pratchett's world turtle and knowing you're a glorified ATM by comparison.</p>
<p>"A roguelike deckbuilder, Nic?", you exclaim with mock interest. "Well, kick me down a well and break out the Vimto we've had mouldering in the cellar since the nineties, the last decade in which anyone consumed or thought about Vimto. Haven't had one of those since the time I went to collect the post forty five seconds ago. Also, the post was two flyers, each advertising a roguelike deckbuilder". I will not argue with your sage industry analysis, friend, although this one does have a couple of notables that may make the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3112170/Dice_Legends/">Steam demo</a> an intriguing prospect.</p>

<p>It's got lovely pixel art, for one, although thoughtful art direction isn't too surprising. Dice Legends is the latest project from CD Project alum Rafał Jaki, co-creator of The Witcher 3's Gwent minigame and showrunner on Cyberpunk: Edgerunners.</p>
<p>It's also got a tabletop twist on traditional card flinging. Each of the three playable heroes uses a different type of dice (D6, D8, or the haughty D12 - also known in some circles as 'the shape bastard'), and you'll use these to roll a dice pool to activate cards. Some cards need a number within a certain range but will still have the same effect. Others scale up with your dice results. Otherwise, it's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slay-the-spire">Slay The Spire</a> at its very core. Attack, build up shield to defend against telegraphed damage, apply debuffs, and conquer nodes on an overworld map.</p>
<p>Additionally, the soundtrack is pure Bardcore. It is certified <em>jaunty</em> up in here. Is Dice Legends a 'fifth page on the Nintendo Eshop sale'-ass name for a game? Yes. But I think it's good time nonetheless. This one's out in the third quarter of the year, to use the language of my most hated enemies, the year quarterers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Here's everything that was announced during the show!</p>

<hr><h2><em>Lumines Arise&nbsp;</em>is an all-new puzzler coming later this year</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lumines-arise-playstation-state-of-play-june-2025.jpg?itok=eUWLMrvS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lumines-arise-playstation-state-of-play-june-2025.jpg?itok=QCnw9ywE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A new&nbsp;<em>Lumines&nbsp;</em>game is on the way.</figcaption></figure><p>First up, we got a look at a new puzzle game in the&nbsp;<em>Lumines&nbsp;</em>series, which is coming to PS5 later this year (and also to PlayStation VR2, if that matters to ya). It'll pack in 30 stages across a number of new backdrops, plus more of the music you know and love.</p>

<h2>Hey, Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Pragmata&nbsp;</em>isn't dead</h2>




<p>Capcom stepped up next to reveal a new trailer for sci-fi adventure&nbsp;<em>Pragmata</em>, which has been missing in action <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pragmata-thrusts-you-into-strange-new-earth" rel="nofollow">for quite some time</a>, prompting some to believe it was dead. Turns out it isn't, and its rather unique-looking gameplay has you controlling two characters at once. This one launches in 2026.</p>

<h2><em>Romeo Is a Dead Man&nbsp;</em>looks very, very Suda51</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/romeo-is-a-dead-man-playstation-state-of-play-2025.jpg?itok=8X6Wdx6h 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/romeo-is-a-dead-man-playstation-state-of-play-2025.jpg?itok=BvHNR3P1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Romeo Is a Dead Man&nbsp;</em>is a characteristically Suda51 game.</figcaption></figure><p>Grasshopper Manufacture's&nbsp;<em>Romeo Is a Dead Man&nbsp;</em>was next on the slate, and it looks like exactly what you'd expect from a Grasshopper game. It's an action title with exactly the kind of over-the-top aesthetic you've come to love from the studio and its founder, and it's coming next year.</p>

<h2><em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>launches on September 25th</h2>

<p>Konami revealed the release date for its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-f-officially-revealed-konami" rel="nofollow">upcoming psychological horror game</a>&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f</em>, which will be launching on September 25th. That release date holds true not only for PS5, but also for PC and Xbox, so don't worry if you're not a PS5 owner.</p>

<h2>A new&nbsp;<em>Bloodstained&nbsp;</em>game is coming</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bloodstained-the-scarlet-engagement-playstation-state-of-play-june-2025.jpg?itok=oyZ4HlOj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bloodstained-the-scarlet-engagement-playstation-state-of-play-june-2025.jpg?itok=0EFdev1f 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement&nbsp;</em>returns to the Metroidvania stylings of&nbsp;<em>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Next, a brand new game in the&nbsp;<em>Bloodstained&nbsp;</em>series,&nbsp;<em>Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement</em>, was announced for 2026, and unlike the old-school&nbsp;<em>Curse of the Moon&nbsp;</em>spinoff series, this one's a true blue Metroidvania. You'll be switching between two characters,&nbsp;<em>Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin</em>-style, to explore a new castle.</p>

<h2><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger&nbsp;</em>gets a release date</h2>

<p>If you've been excited to check out the next game in the&nbsp;<em>Digimon Story&nbsp;</em>series, you're in luck.&nbsp;<em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger&nbsp;</em>launches on October 3rd, and we got some more info about its story, characters, and customization elements as well.</p>

<h2><em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles&nbsp;</em>revives a strategy classic</h2>




<p>In a similar vein to 2022's&nbsp;<em>Tactics Ogre: Reborn</em>, a remastered version of&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy Tactics&nbsp;</em>was announced during the State of Play June 2025 show. It'll boast improved visuals, quality-of-life improvements, and fully voiced dialogue when it launches on September 30th.</p>

<h2>Release date sizzle reel</h2>

<p>Next, we got release dates for some games that have already been revealed. Here's a list of the new release dates we got!</p>

<ul><li><em>Baby Steps&nbsp;</em>(<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baby-steps-bennett-foddy" rel="nofollow">from Bennett Foddy and Devolver Digital</a>): September 8th</li>
	<li><em>Hirogami&nbsp;</em>(origami platformer from Bandai Namco): September 3rd</li>
	<li><em>Everybody's Golf Hot Shots&nbsp;</em>(golfing sim from Bandai Namco): September 5th</li>
	<li><em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound&nbsp;</em>(action-packed 2D platformer): July 31st</li>
	<li><em>Cairn&nbsp;</em>(climbing game from the&nbsp;<em>Haven&nbsp;</em>devs): November 5th</li>
</ul><h2><em>Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection&nbsp;</em>brings retro fighting thrills this year</h2>

<p>Next up, Digital Eclipse revealed&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection</em>, a package containing (or perhaps that should be "kontaining") many old-school&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat&nbsp;</em>games. Eight have been announced so far, and more reveals are on the way before release later this year.</p>

<h2>Project Defiant is a wireless fight stick made by Sony</h2>

<p>If you're into your fighting game peripherals, you may want to take a look at Project Defiant, a wireless fight stick created by Sony. It's got the signature PS5 look to it, but built into a classic fighting peripheral design. This one is coming next year.</p>

<h2><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>shows off its boss battles</h2>

<p>Boss battles have always been the cornerstones of a&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear&nbsp;</em>game, and&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>is no exception. Konami's upcoming remake looks like it'll faithfully recreate Snake's battles against the Cobra Unit when it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-release-date-leak-playstation" rel="nofollow">arrives in August</a>.</p>

<h2><i>Nioh 3&nbsp;</i>announced for next year, limited-time demo available now</h2>




<p>That's right: there's going to be a new&nbsp;<em>Nioh&nbsp;</em>game, and what's more, you can try it out right now.&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3&nbsp;</em>is coming to PS5 next year, offering a choice between two distinct combat styles. A limited-time demo can be downloaded right now on the PlayStation Store.</p>

<h2><em>Thief&nbsp;</em>is back...in VR form</h2>

<p>Next was perhaps one of the cruelest teases of the entire State of Play show. The venerable&nbsp;<em>Thief&nbsp;</em>franchise is back, but&nbsp;<em>Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow&nbsp;</em>is, as you've probably come to realize, a VR-exclusive game. It comes to PS VR2 later this year.</p>

<h2><em>Tides of Tomorrow&nbsp;</em>is a colorful-looking adventure from the&nbsp;<em>Road 96</em>&nbsp;devs</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tides-of-tomorrow-playstation-state-of-play-june-2025.jpg?itok=SziQv_NQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tides-of-tomorrow-playstation-state-of-play-june-2025.jpg?itok=5OSFFtmj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tides of Tomorrow&nbsp;</em>is an asynchronous multiplayer game from&nbsp;<em>Road 96&nbsp;</em>developer DigixArt.</figcaption></figure><p>DigixArt, the studio behind&nbsp;<em>Road 96</em>, appeared next to show off&nbsp;<em>Tides of Tomorrow</em>, its colorful adventure with an "intriguing asynchronous multiplayer" element that shows you not only your choices, but a previous player's choices as well. It's coming in February.</p>

<h2><em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>is getting new challenge levels</h2>

<p>Team Asobi head Nicolas Doucet took to the virtual stage next to reveal that beloved platformer&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>is getting five new challenge levels later this month, and you'll be able to rescue new PlayStation-inspired bots as well.</p>

<h2><em>Sea of Remnants&nbsp;</em>is a new pirate RPG coming next year</h2>




<p>If, like many, Ubisoft's&nbsp;<em>Skull and Bones&nbsp;</em>didn't do anything to quell your desire for pirate adventure,&nbsp;<em>Sea of Remnants&nbsp;</em>could well do the trick. It's a stylized puppetry-inspired pirate RPG coming sometime next year.</p>

<h2><em>Sword of the Sea&nbsp;</em>is the&nbsp;<em>Journey&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Pathless&nbsp;</em>artist's next adventure</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sword-of-the-sea-playstation-state-of-play-june-2025.jpg?itok=bDWQyvox 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sword-of-the-sea-playstation-state-of-play-june-2025.jpg?itok=R73wxomm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll never guess who's behind this one.</figcaption></figure><p>The first few seconds of the trailer for&nbsp;<em>Sword of the Sea&nbsp;</em>pretty much gave away who was behind it. This one comes from Matt Nava, the artist behind&nbsp;<em>Journey&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Abzu</em>, and it's coming on August 19th, with a day one PS Plus Extra release lined up.</p>

<h2>More games are heading to PS Plus</h2>

<p>As well as&nbsp;<em>Sword of the Sea</em>, Sony also revealed during the showcase that the PS2 version of classic immersive sim&nbsp;<em>Deus Ex</em>, as well as racers&nbsp;<em>Twisted Metal 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>4</em>, are coming to the Classics Catalog in June and July. Not only that, but&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>3</em>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Myst&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Riven</em>, are also coming to the service.</p>

<h2>IO Interactive shows off a little bit of&nbsp;<em>007 First Light</em></h2>

<p>Next, it was IO Interactive's turn to show off <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/io-interactive-007-first-light" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>James Bond&nbsp;</em>adventure&nbsp;<em>007 First Light</em></a>, and it looks...well, like a&nbsp;<em>James Bond&nbsp;</em>game, shockingly enough. This one's coming next year, and we'll get more info about it in the coming days.</p>

<h2><em>Ghost of Yotei&nbsp;</em>is getting a gameplay deep dive in July</h2>

<p>A very brief clip of&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yotei&nbsp;</em>was shown next, and Sony says a gameplay "deep dive" is coming in July, so we'll get to learn more about the game then. This one is launching in October, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-yotei-release-date" rel="nofollow">as previously revealed</a>.</p>

<h2><em>Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls&nbsp;</em>is an anime-inspired fighter coming next year</h2>




<p>Finally, we got a reveal trailer for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls</em>, a gorgeous-looking anime fighter from&nbsp;<em>Guilty Gear&nbsp;</em>developer Arc System Works. The game will feature Marvel mainstays like Captain America, Spider-Man, and Storm, and it's coming next year.</p>

<hr><p>That's everything we got to see during this year's Sony State of Play show! Hopefully, we'll be learning more about some of these rather exciting-looking games in the coming months.</p>

What I'm here to discuss is a note left at the end of the announcement by writer Yasumi Matsuno, which reads:</p><blockquote><div><p>Nearly 30 years ago, the collapse of Japan's bubble economy engulfed the nation's financial institutions in mountains of bad debt, triggering a wave of corporate bankruptcies, a sudden and extreme rise in unemployment rates, and stagnation of Japanese society as a whole. It was an era when many were robbed of hope, when dreams were measured by their price tag.</p><p>Against this historical backdrop, I crafted a story. It was the story of Ramza, a young man who fought tirelessly against the entrenched social class system. It was the story of Delita, who sought to take advantage of this confusion and despair to advance his own social position. It was a story of a peculiar destiny, in which friendship and betrayal intertwine.</p><p>And now, in 2025--a time when inequality and division are still deeply rooted in our society--I offer this story once again.</p><p>The will to resist is in your hands.</p><p>YASUMI MATSUNO - ORIGINAL SCRIPT, SCENARIO WRITER AND EDITOR</p></div><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Hell yeah dude. </p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/neightreign-is-good-but-lumpy-counter-intuitive-and-experimental"><h3>Nightreign is Uneven And Counter-Intuitive.

Alongside a mysterious girl, players will voyage across vast seas, uncharted islands and a city slowly awakening to its secrets. Through open-world exploration, intense naval combat and dynamic interactions with a cast of over 300 eccentric characters, players will uncover the truth behind their forgotten identity and shape the fate of the world around them.</p><p>On this sprawling journey, players can recruit a crew of unique puppetfolk allies, customize their ships with modular upgrades, and build specialized teams for exploration and turn-based battles. Every decision—whether sparing enemies or seizing opportunities—will unleash dramatic ripple effects across the world.

Additionally, release-day delivery is not guaranteed. Square Enix charges <em>high </em>prices for faster shipping speeds. Two-day shipping is $35, and overnighting the game at launch would cost you $55--so you'd pay more for shipping than the cost of the item itself.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://na.store.square-enix-games.com/final-fantasy-tactics---the-ivalice-chronicles" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/na.store.square-enix-games.com\/final-fantasy-tactics---the-ivalice-chronicles&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://na.store.square-enix-games.com/final-fantasy-tactics---the-ivalice-chronicles">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles Collector's Box</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://na.store.square-enix-games.com/final-fantasy-tactics---the-ivalice-chronicles" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/na.store.square-enix-games.com\/final-fantasy-tactics---the-ivalice-chronicles&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://na.store.square-enix-games.com/final-fantasy-tactics---the-ivalice-chronicles">$200 (no game) | $250 with the game</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles is getting a jam-packed Collector's Box that looks appropriately lavish for this all-time classic.</p><p>Here's what you get with the Collector's Box:</p><ul><li><strong>Special Art Box:</strong> Shown above, the box holding all of the merch has intricate character art against a decorative depiction of Ivalice in the background. Square Enix printed the artwork on matte-textured art paper.</li><li><strong>Ramza Beoulve Figure (Akademy Version):</strong> It's unclear how tall this figure is, but it is described as a "figure," not a statue. That said, it does come with a base stand. Overall, this looks like a high-quality figure with vibrant colors and impressive attention to detail.</li><li><strong>Mini Chocobo Plush Set:</strong> Adorable miniature plushies of the standard yellow Chocobo, Black Chocobo, and Red Chocobo. Each plush has an elastic loop, so you can connect it to a backpack or even your belt (if you're especially cool).</li><li><strong>Zodiac Stones Acrylic Magnet Set:</strong> All 12 Zodiac stones as acrylic magnets.</li><li><strong>Outlying Church Pop-Up Diorama:</strong> A pop-up 3D display of the Outlying Church from the game. If you compare it to in-game screenshots, it looks like an faithful recreation.</li><li><strong>Art Prints: </strong>Printed on glossy polypropylene (plastic) sheets, the three pieces of framable artwork feature: Ramza, a world map of Ivalice, and the key art that's used for the standard edition of the remaster.</li></ul><p>The Collector's Box is available on its own for $200 or bundled with game for $250. If you choose the latter, the game will be packaged separately. This just means that the Collector's Box is the same regardless of which choice you make, and the box, as shown above, doesn't have a Nintendo Switch or PS5 logo on it. Since physical editions aren't available for Xbox, PS4, or PC, a universal Collector's Box makes sense.</p><p>Square Enix's store page doesn't explicitly state that the Collector's Box is exclusive to its own storefront. If it is available elsewhere, it'd be wise to buy it at a major US retailer. <strong>Standard shipping costs $20</strong> from the Square Enix Store to the US. Two-day and overnight shipping is offered, but these options cost $49 and $69, respectively. Not nice.</p><p>You can check out all of the collectibles in the image below.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large"

			<p>While <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-gameplay-deep-dive-announced-for-july-2025/">Ghost of Yotei</a> might've been a game players expected to see in during today's State of Play, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/astro-bot-celebrated-platformer/">Astro Bot</a> was definitely not what people would've expected.</p>
<p>Team Asobi studio head Nicolas Doucet briefly appeared during the presentation to announce that five new levels will be added to <a href="https://wccftech.com/all-winners-at-the-game-awards-2024-astro-bot-game-of-the-year/">The Game Awards 2024 GOTY winner</a> on July 10, 2025, and that a new version of the limited-edition Astro Bot DualSense controller will be launching sometime later this year.</p>
<p>This latest batch of levels brings the total for the game over 90, and like most of the levels Team Asobi has released for Astro Bot post-launch, they're meant to provide a little extra challenge for the platformer fans who want it.</p>
<p>All together, they are the Vicious Void levels, and Team Asobi revealed the names for four of the five, and a sneak peek that the Ghost of Yotei protagonist, Atsu, has been added to the game as a new bot to collect.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Regarding the new version of the controller, it pretty much looks exactly the same as the old one, except the eyes are made to look like the Astro-persona inside your controller is smiling. The rest of the color layout, and everything about it, seems to be exactly the same.</p>
<p>Now that Astro Bot has more than 90 levels, and that we're starting to come up on the one-year anniversary from the game's launch, it's possible that this is one of, if not the last batch of DLC levels Team Asobi releases, before moving on to whatever its next project will be.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/astro-bot-five-new-vicious-void-galaxy-levels-special-bots-launch-this-july/">PlayStation Blog</a> post for the update, Doucet wrote "<em>It has been a real delight to continue offering you, our valued fans, an extended Astro Bot experience at no additional cost</em>," which doesn't exactly have the ring of Team Asobi wanting to slow down soon. We'll see what the anniversary brings, and if we get more clarification on what Team Asobi's future looks like, then.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">One of the unexpected surprises from PlayStation's latest State of Play presentation was a tease of Sony's first official fight stick controller, codenamed "Project Defiant." While details are currently limited, we at least got a glimpse of the fight stick's design, features, and confirmation that it will support both PS5 and PC when it launches in 2026.</p><p dir="ltr">The Project Defiant fight stick uses an eight-button layout and a joystick with a black and white color scheme that matches the look of the PS5 and other official peripherals. According to Sony, Project Defiant will feature a "sturdy, ergonomic design for a comfortable feel during intense fight sessions," and support ultra-low latency wireless connections via PlayStation Link or wired connections on PC and PS5.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4507248-stick.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4507248" data-ratio="0.56267409470752" data-width="1077" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4507248-stick.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4507248"></a><figcaption>PlayStation "Project Defiant" Fight Stick</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4507248-stick.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's unclear how moddable the Project Defiant will be, but so far, Sony has confirmed it will have three different movement gates for the joystick--square, circle, or octagon--that can be swapped out without needing tools. There will be a built-in compartment for storing the extra restrictor gates and the included PS Link USB adapter when not in use.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the rest of the inputs, the eight main face buttons (which map to Cross, Circle, Square, Triangle, R1, R2, L1, and L2) use mechanical switches. The rest of the standard inputs from the PS5's DualSense controller are also present on the fight stick, including:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">PS Button</li><li dir="ltr">Share Button</li><li dir="ltr">PlayStation Link Button</li><li dir="ltr">L3 Button</li><li dir="ltr">R3 Button</li><li dir="ltr">Touch Pad</li><li dir="ltr">Options Button</li></ul><p dir="ltr">There is also a Lever Mode Switch for changing how the stick operates and a Lock Button. You'll be able to wake up the PS5 from sleep mode using the Project Defiant's PS Button. Project Defiant will also include a sling carry case.</p><p dir="ltr">Sony says more details will be revealed over the coming months, so we expect to know the price and finalized release date soon. For now, it's planned to launch sometime in 2026. This reveal is notable for several reasons--the most obvious being this is PlayStation's first official fight stick peripheral. While the PS5 has plenty of excellent fight sticks to pick from--including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Playstation-Aluminum-Ergonomic-Detachable-Tournament-5/dp/B0B3VRDML3?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PDP's Victrix Pro FS</a> and its leverless sibling, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Playstation-Aluminum-Ergonomic-Detachable-Tournament-5/dp/B0B3VQKGHW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the Pro FS-12</a>--we're curious to see how a PS5-dedicated model made specifically by Sony will stack up to the third-party options.</p><p dir="ltr">The June 4, 2025 PlayStation State of Play had several other exciting fighting game announcements, including the reveal of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-marvel-fighting-game-is-coming-from-arc-system-works/1100-6532114/" data-ref-id="1100-6532114">Marvel Tokodon: Fighting Souls</a>, a 4v4 team fighting game developed by Arc System Works and featuring a roster of Marvel characters, releasing on PS5 and PC in 2026.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-announces-project-defiant-a-wireless-fight-stick-for-ps5-and-pc/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>PlayStation has announced its latest peripheral, a wireless fight stick that's currently codenamed Project Defiant.</p>
<p>Fittingly, it was revealed during today's<a href="https://wccftech.com/40-minute-playstation-state-of-play-announced-for-tomorrow/"> State of Play</a> presentation, right after retro-remastering experts Digital Eclipse announced their latest game, the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/mortal-kombat-legacy-collection-launches-on-ps5-ps4-this-year/">Mortal Kombat: Legacy Collection</a>, which will bring nine classic Mortal Kombat titles to PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC sometime in 2025.</p>
<p>According to a<a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/introducing-project-defiant-the-first-wireless-fight-stick-designed-by-sony-interactive-entertainment-for-ps5-and-pc/"> PlayStation Blog post</a>, Project Defiant uses PlayStation's proprietary PlayStation Link technology, which "<em>provides ultra-low latency,</em>" though it's not a wireless-only fight stick, as it does work with a wired connection as well.</p>
<p>The short trailer for the fight stick that we saw during the presentation just gave us some glamour shots of the new game pad, which bears the signature white and black PS5 pattern. Notably, the&nbsp; fight stick will come with a sling carry case, according to the Blog post, presumably to make it easier to transport between fighting game tournaments.</p>
<p><iframe title="Project Defiant Wireless Fight Stick - Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oCeba1xfKxg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Project Defiant also touts "<em>a high-quality digital stick that's custom designed by Sony</em>," and "<em>toolless interchangeable restrictor gates (square, circle, and octagon) for the stick, buttons with mechanical switches, and a touch pad like the one found on the DualSense controller.</em>"</p>
<p>We won't hear more about Project Defiant, like the price or what it'll officially be called, until 2026, when it's expected to launch. Considering the large fighting game community that exists on PlayStation, it's a wonder why the company hasn't made its own fight stick before. But at least it's on its way.</p>
<p>Speaking of fighting games, Mortal Kombat: Legacy Collection wasn't the only fighting game revealed during the State of Play, as we also got the reveal of <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-tokon-fighting-soul-is-a-new-4-vs-4-fighting-game-by-arc-system-works-launches-in-2026-on-playstation-5-and-pc/">Marvel Tokon: Fighting Soul,</a> a new 4v4 fighting game from Arc System Works, set to launch in 2026.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/who-is-van-chapman-and-what-is-epic-level-6-cloudward-ho-interview-with-siobhan-thompson.1207791/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/who-is-van-chapman-and-what-is-epic-level-6-cloudward-ho-interview-with-siobhan<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dimension 20</em> is heading out on another adventure, and this time they're taking it to the skies. <em>Cloudward, Ho</em> tells the story of a group of adventurers reuniting to search for the mythical land of Zood. Van Chapman is the bosun on this adventure, making sure that everything is ship-shape. I got to catch up with <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b6ff64e2-0570-485e-860b-402771d3faf6" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/we-chat-dimension-20-burrows-end-generational-trauma-and-environmental" rel="nofollow">Siobhan Thompson</a> ahead of the premier to learn more about Chapman's motives, what the inspiration was for Chapman's very 'milennial' restaurant, and how <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3579fb91-ffa9-4c99-a750-de9f92ba642f" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow"><em>D&amp;D</em></a> is getting a new twist for <em>Cloudward, Ho!</em></p>



<p>To begin, I wanted to know what inspired this competent character and her retirement from the life of adventuring.</p>

<p>"Van Chapman is a retired ship bosun and now she is running a very greyscale, small plates-large plates, gastropub with her very tiny husband." Thompson began.</p>

<p>Where we first meet Champan, though Thompson wanted to be clear, "she's done with adventure, she doesn't need to go back, she's living a vey happy retirement."</p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed//P0B-JHNnH28"></iframe></p>

<p>The cast of <em>Cloudward, Ho!</em> is filled with the other members of the Intrepid Heroes; Lou Wilson, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="07cb71f8-cd27-491b-a25d-4583267bfba1" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/ally-beardsley-talks-fantasy-high-junior-year-and-how-kristen-has-changed-between" rel="nofollow">Ally Beardsley</a>, Brian 'Murph' Murphy, Emily Axford, and Zac Oyama not to miss <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="55a80c6c-ea7c-4151-9523-d332db6f6cd5" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/how-brennan-lee-mulligan-created-never-stop-blowing-up-love-letter-to-80s" rel="nofollow">Brennan Lee Mulligan</a>, the DM.</p>

<p>For the player, I was also interested in learning what it was that Thompson found most important in a character introduction. What notes she always wanted to hit when coming into a new game.</p>

<p>She was able to describe it quite succinctly as "give a physical description, even though we have art, there's something about the linguistic description that's helpful. I always try to give a description of how they're feeling in this moment."</p>

<h2>Getting The Band Back Together? I'm In</h2>

<p>As the party is getting pulled back together over the course of episode one, in a mix of <em>Oceans Eleven</em> meets <em>Atlantis: The Lost Empire</em> style recruiting, we learn how each member is integral to the crew. Whether it's Maxwell Gotch (played by Murph) as the wallet bankrolling the trip, Marya Junkova (played by Emily Axford) as the engineer, or Olethra MacLeod (played by Ally Beardsley) as the new member with a key piece of information to draw everyone together.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cloudward-ho-full-party-artwork.jpg?itok=_NSY1QSJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cloudward-ho-full-party-artwork.jpg?itok=nOLtG7eK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Knowing that each member of the Intrepid Heroes had an important role to play in the crew it was interesting to hear how each player and character fell into place.</p>

<p>"We all came in with a bunch of different ideas, for me the Bosun was so fun because it's that you're not the Captain, but you're the one telling everyone what to do," Thompson explained "and it was fun to come in with a character whose big defining trait is loyalty."</p>

<p>"She's a good soldier and in the real, true sense of the word, if there was an order that she recieved that she thought was stupid she would push back on it but she also knows that her job is to make things happen for other people"</p>

<p>I questioned Chapman's drive saying "I know you're playing a fighter, but it almost sounds like you have a Paladin oath."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is very philosophically where she is. She is a pirate to her bones. She comes from this long line of adventurers and she's very… she's not even proud of it, it's just so utterly defining of her"</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cloudward-ho-sky-ship-miniature.jpg?itok=IySS7Pl0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cloudward-ho-sky-ship-miniature.jpg?itok=KdPDz4l0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>The Rusty Nut Is Milennial Incarnate</h2>

<p>A key part of Chapman where we pick up with her is in the description of the Rusty Nut, the gastropub that she runs with her husband. With "Milennial Grey" walls, and rustic lights all at head height there was a very clear idea in her mind when creating this setting.</p>

<p>"It was [based on a specific location], unfortunately there are so many of these places. I also have to give credit to my friend Bea Roberts who I asked 'What are good pub names?' and we just sent pub names back and forth and she came up with Rusty Nut"</p>

<p>"I feel like calling it Milennial Grey is so unfair because none of us painted it that color it's just the houses we've ended up living in and none of us can afford to buy anything"</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Some are born Milennial, some achieve Milennialdome, and some have MIlennialship thrust upon them"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thompson also added that with her own experience working in the restaurant industry she "also loves making fun of the way that the service industry works. It was a fun little side game for me"</p>

<h2><em>Cloudward, Ho!</em> Uses Old <em>D&amp;D</em> Rule: Epic Level 6</h2>

<p>As each character is introduced and we're provided their stats I couldn't help but notice that there's a currently empty field labeled Epic Epiphanies. Thompson revealed that for this season of <em>Dimension 20,</em> the characters wouldn't be leveling up, but would instead use a remixed version of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3rd Edition</em>'s Epic Level 6 ruling.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cloudward-ho-van-chapman-character-sheet.jpg?itok=Aw0NjvDv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cloudward-ho-van-chapman-character-sheet.jpg?itok=ZKGwqbO2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>"Instead of leveling up you take a feat everytime that you would level up. It gives you a much more 'adventure genre' set of stats"</p>

<p>Thompson explained it by comparing <em>Cloudward, Ho! </em>to classic adventure titles like <em>Indiana Jones</em>. "Indiana Jones is very smart, and strong, and quick but if a giant Nazi is going to come and punch him he'll die and he's very aware of that and whatever his 'in-universe' health stats are"</p>

<p>This shift from leveling to Epic Level 6 allows for the adventure for <em>Cloudward, Ho!</em> to continue to develop mechanically without fear of the characters reaching the kinds of god-like powers that are seen in higher levels of <em>D&amp;D</em> play.</p>

<p>Thompson also highlighted that on top of keeping the game tense this approach to leveling also really promoted players getting deep into the different feats available to characters.</p>

<p>The first episode of <em>Cloudward, Ho! </em>is available right now to watch on <a href="https://www.dropout.tv/browse" rel="nofollow">Dropout.</a></p>

A demo is live now on PS5 until June 18. Players who complete the demo will unlock an exclusive in-game helmet at launch. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the official blurb, from <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/nioh-3-announced-for-ps5-limited-time-demo-available-today/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a>:</p><blockquote>In Nioh 3, the protagonist is a young warrior poised to become the next Shogun. Why is he dedicated to battling against yokai? We’ll save those details for another day, but what we can tell you today is as the battles unfold, players will now be able to fight using two distinct combat styles: Samurai and Ninja.</blockquote><blockquote>The Samurai style provides a gameplay experience similar to previous Nioh titles. New actions such as Arts Proficiency, which enhances the power of martial arts, and Deflect, which allows players to block enemy attacks at the last moment have been added, helping create a series of intense and deadly face-to-face confrontations.</blockquote><blockquote>Meanwhile, the Ninja style excels in quick movements like dodging and aerial actions, giving ninjas the advantage of being able to attack from outside of the enemy’s range by utilizing a variety of “Ninjitsu” techniques according to the situation on the battlefield. Players have the ability to use techniques like Mist, which leaves a clone after an attack, and Evade, which allows for narrowly avoiding enemy strikes. Both techniques help players outmaneuver foes while delivering devastating speed attacks from behind.</blockquote><blockquote>Players will be able to switch between battle styles instantly at any time, playing in their preferred style in a storyline defined by the strong, the swift, and the wicked. Based on the tendencies of the enemies and stages, some players will prefer to switch seamlessly between Samurai and Ninja techniques, while others will choose to fight using only one style continuously based on the challenge ahead. Feel free to play with the style you like best as you battle some of the fiercest enemies we’ve created to date!</blockquote><blockquote>Aside from the new battle styles, Nioh 3 also enables players to enjoy an open field that offers a new freedom of exploration to the unique tension and confrontations that have become a defining characteristic of the Nioh series. Experience unexpected encounters with formidable yokai, explore suspicious villages riddled in violent secrets, and take on the daunting challenges of The Crucible. Enjoy the thrilling, hostile new environments as you fight to survive the cursed kingdom!</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">We're pretty big Nioh fans here at IGN. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/nioh">gave the original Nioh a 9.6/10</a>, calling it "an epic, unforgettable adventure carried by a fierce combat system that cleverly balances style and strategy." We similarly praised Nioh 2 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nioh-2-review">with a 9/10</a>, saying that its "many systems may be a little overwhelming, but the stellar combat and satisfying difficulty make it worth it." The Nioh series has been very, very quiet ever since the 2020 release of Nioh 2, though Team Ninja itself has kept busy with releases such as Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, Rise of the Rōnin, and the upcoming Ninja Gaiden 4.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In case you missed it, here's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-state-of-play-june-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at Sony's State of Play June 2025 showcase</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

Per the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/pragmata-coming-to-ps5-2026-new-gameplay-revealed/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a>, it looks like the main threat is a lunar station AI that's preventing Hugh from returning to earth...from the moon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pragmata was first unveiled <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pragmata-capcom-release-date-2022">way back in 2020</a>, with a trailer of an astronaut, a little girl, and some weird yet beautiful imagery, but little explanation as to what sort of game we were looking at. It was originally planned for a 2022 release, but was then <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pragmata-delayed-2023">later delayed until 2023</a>, and then paused indefinitely <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pragmata-delayed-indefinitely-as-capcom-apologizes">with an apologetic trailer</a>. We haven't seen anything of it since, so this re-unveiling hopefully means that its development is finally making some serious progress, and we'll get our hands on it soon...in 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/open-world-racing-game-carx-street-coming-to-consoles-pre-orders-open-now-on-xbox<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Build your car from the ground up and prove you’re the best racer in Sunset City.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer CarX Technologies has made a name for itself over the last decade with series like Drift Racing, Highway Racing, and Rally. In 2022, they branched out with CarX Street, an open-world racing game with a level of freedom they’ve never had before. Then they brought it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1114150?utm_source=ign&amp;utm_medium=cpv&amp;utm_campaign=productlanding" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">to Steam</a> in 2024, where it was wishlisted by over 600,000 people. And now, they’re bringing it to consoles — it arrives June 18 <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nn082lmvv2c?cid=ign_street" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">on Xbox Series X/S</a> and later this summer on PlayStation 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">CarX Street takes you to the sprawling Sunset City and its suburbs, where your goal is straightforward: prove you’re the best racer in the city. There are racing clubs scattered throughout the city, each with their own identity. For example, Union Underground is a crew of automotive engineers who value a car’s performance but don’t care about looks. Kanjo Spirit is for hatchback enthusiasts who use volatile, high-risk driving styles.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/04/screenshot-2-1749055195431.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll need to be prepared for a variety of different race types, like classic sprint races, circuit races, and drifting competitions. All of the races make use of CarX Technologies’ car physics engine, designed with a focus on realism. That realism means that the cheaper cars you can afford at the start of the game won’t handle well enough to tackle harder races and won’t make the grade necessary for you to enter them in the first place. So you’ll need to upgrade your ride early and often.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Luckily, there are tons of options when building a new car. That starts with 92 different vehicles, with additional ones added regularly. There’s also an extensive customization and tuning system that lets you tailor your ride to your preferred driving style — including the engine, drivetrain, suspension, body, and wheels.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/02/screenshot-5-1748885683850.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Sunset City might be full of racing clubs, but beating them isn’t the only thing to do in the city. You can accept quests to deliver cars or parts to people across the city, and completing them can net you resources to improve your vehicle. You can explore the map on your own and speed down open highways or find mountain roads with sharp turns and narrow passages to put your driving skills to the test. Or you can buy properties across the city that come with parking lots where you can display your custom cars. Through all of this, Sunset City has a dynamic day-night cycle, leading to races having a different feel depending on what time of day you do them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also multiplayer modes if you’re feeling competitive. Battle Mode is a 1v1 showdown in circle or sprint races, Chase Mode has one player try to escape through the city while their opponent tries to keep up, Speed League has circuit and sprint races in a 1v5 format, and Time Attack challenges you to set the best lap time you can while you rise up the leaderboard and earn increasingly valuable rewards. The multiplayer modes will also have crossplay between the PC and console versions of the game.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/02/screenshot-4-1748885649922.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">All of these features will be present when the game arrives on console, but the developers have also announced their plans for future additions. That includes new competitive multiplayer modes, gymkhana (obstacle courses), a team multiplayer mode, dynamic weather effects, a network of high-speed expressways, full narrative campaign, and police chase mechanic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">CarX Street releases on Xbox Series X on June 18, and pre-orders are open now. It’s planned for release on PlayStation 5 later this summer.
