		<p>The Harbinger of the Void has been revealed in this new cinematic trailer for World of Warcraft’s The War Within expansion. “With Xal’atath’s dark plans set in motion, her gaze now shifts to Azeroth’s heroes and the struggles they face within,” say Blizzard.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-how-to-play-video-released-by-games-workshop<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Back in March, Games Workshop announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-fourth-edition-signals-new-age"><em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar Fourth Edition</em></a>. Naturally, the arrival of an update to a beloved tabletop miniatures game includes changes. To help bring new players up to speed, GW has even made a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-age-of-sigmar"><em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em></a> How To Play video.</p>



<p>In an official <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/2024/05/21/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-faction-focus-stormcast-eternals/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Warhammer-Community post</a>, Games Workshop highlights what the <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em> How To Play video covers. As expected, the video covers every aspect of an Age of Sigmar match. What you need to play. How to build your army. The structure of a Battle Round and the phases of combat. The list goes on.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-how-to-play-video-miniature-screenshots.jpg?itok=xmM4QWQJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-how-to-play-video-miniature-screenshots.jpg?itok=vq9mzfKx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Need to know the difference between ranged phase and charging phase? Watch this.</figcaption></figure><p>The video also highlights the changes being introduced in <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em> <em>Fourth Edition</em>. This includes the more flexible <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-fourth-edition-preview-introduces-modularity">modularity</a> of assembling an army as well as various changes to melee combat, spellcasting, and prayers.</p>

<p>As for the <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em> How To Play video itself, it covers a lot of ground. GW's own Lewis' narration is supplemented by clear visuals illustrating rules, abilities, and the logistics of dice rolls.</p>

<p>The video even acts as an extended preview. It shows off several new models and units for the Skaven and Stormcast Eternals armies, providing established fans a glimpse what is in store.</p>

<p>At eight minutes and thirty seconds, the <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em> How To Play video only covers the basics of play. It does not go into further detail on more unique abilities held by certain armies. Neither does it stray into specific edge cases. In that regard, the video ends encouraging players to read the core rulebook to learn more.</p>

<p>Emphasizing this glimpse into further complexity, the post links to ten different articles focusing on other armies in <em>Age of Sigmar</em>.</p>

<p>It showcases notable tactics and units for the Stormcast Eternals, Skaven, Gloomspite Gitz, Nighthaunt, Cities of Sigmar, Kharadon Overlords, Disicples of Tzeentch, Ogor Mawtribes, Flesh-Eater Courts, and the Fyreslayers. An eleventh article on the Idoneth Deepkin is set to release soon.</p>

You’re not going to access wildly broken farming resources through it, or even rare items. Plus, some of the most useful stuff to snag from foes are items, which means you can’t use them in Hard mode (<em>Rebirth</em>’s end-game difficulty that locks you out of using things like potions, ethers, offensive items like grenades, and more).</p><h3 id="h24582"><a id=""></a>Celeris is one of the most abundantly stealable items (and it’s very useful)</h3><p>Celeris lets you cast Haste on a target. This speeds up your attack speed. While you can cast this as a spell with Time materia, using an item doesn’t drain MP. You can steal Celeris from the following enemies (the Fiend Intel enemies are the most farmable):</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><strong>Aggrevrikon</strong>: Fiend Intel 5 in Grasslands</p><p><strong>Bandit</strong>: Fought during Phenomenon Intel 3 in Grasslands</p><p><strong>Beck</strong>: Fought during Phenomenon Intel 4 in Grasslands</p><p><strong>Burke</strong>: Fought during Phenomenon Intel 4 in Grasslands</p><p><strong>Butch</strong>: Fought during Phenomenon Intel 4 in Grasslands</p><p><strong>Levridon</strong>: Fought during the “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-ff7-best-sidequests-1851320689&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-ff7-best-sidequests-1851320689">O Chicken, Where Art Thou” side-quest</a></span></p><p><strong>Levrikon</strong>: Found roaming in the Grasslands</p></blockquote><h3 id="h24583"><a id=""></a>You can steal crafting components from enemies</h3><p>There are a few items worth using this materia for. To start, many monsters carry items used in crafting via the Item Transmuter option in the main menu. To see which items an enemy has that’s stealable, simply Assess them and you’ll see what items are available on the left side of the screen. </p><p>You can check the stats of any enemy you’ve previously scanned, which includes what items are stealable (and morphable using the Morph materia) in the menu under Enemy Intel.</p><h3 id="h24584"><a id=""></a>You can steal helpful restorative items</h3><p>Giga-potions, which restore 3,000 HP, are also very handy to have around. You can steal these from Devil Riders, which appear during the “Hustle and Grind” side-quest. Mega-potions aren’t as good (they only restore 1,500 HP), but they’re still good to have. You can steal these from Rude and the smaller Tonberries that spawn <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-tonberry-king-crown-steal-1851305368&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-tonberry-king-crown-steal-1851305368">during the Tonberry King boss fight</a></span>.

The first is only fightable in the Temple of the Ancients (Chapter 13), while the second is a boss fight during the arena showdown in Chapter 12. </p><p>Elixirs, which fully restore HP and MP, are also great. You can steal these from Roche during his boss fights.</p><h3 id="h24585"><a id=""></a>Snag the Fortitude Ring from Reno</h3><p>The Fortitude Ring is an accessory that’ll raise a character’s vitality and spirit by 50. You can steal this item from the boss fight with Remo.</p><hr><p>Steal might not feel immediately useful the first time you get it, but it can help you keep stock of more than a few handy items, especially on multiple runs of the campaign.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The kit is packed with references from the game, including customizable landscape scenes and a collection of new microfigures based on Minecraft characters, NPCs, and enemies. The set launches later this year, but preorders are already available online.</p><p dir="ltr">The Lego Minecraft Crafting Table is a 1,195-piece kit that, naturally, resembles the in-game crafting table, but with two open sides and a removable top that reveals an interior landscape diorama. The inner diorama includes 12 mini scenes based on the game's many biomes, including overworld zones like the Plains, Forest, and Cherry Grove, and underground sections like Dripstone Cave, Deep Dark, and more.

The eight microfigures for this set include the Minecraft mascots Steve and Alex, in-game monsters like the Creeper, skeleton, and witch, and friendly NPCs the villager, cow, and pig. There is also a selection of swappable display bricks featuring famous phrases from the game, like "Create New World," "You Are The Player 1," and the Minecraft logo that you can place on designated panels on the outside of the diorama.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/best-vecna-the-lich-builds-in-dead-by-daylight/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=best-vecna-the-lich-builds-in-dead-by-daylight<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="374" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The Dungeons &amp; Dragons-themed killer Vecna, The Lich, has officially come to <em>Dead by Daylight</em>. Despite early reports that Vecna was a rather weak killer compared to others, players have discovered some specific builds that can really take advantage of the four spells Vecna has it his disposal. Here is the best Vecna, The Lich build in <em>Dead by Daylight</em> as of patch 8.0.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-best-vecna-the-lich-builds" data-injectable="false">Best Vecna, The Lich builds</h2> <p data-characters="456" data-current-count="756" data-injectable="true">In the early part of the Public Test Server for Vecna, The Lich, players felt as though the new D&amp;D killer was a bit on the weaker side. However, after players got more time to learn him and discover his strengths and weaknesses, alongside a launch day buff specifically for Vecna, he’s shaping up to be one of the stronger killers in the game when paired with the right build. Here are all of the best Vecna, The Lich builds in <em>Dead by Daylight</em>:</p>
 <h3 id="h-the-handy-lich-build" data-injectable="false">The Handy Lich Build</h3> <p data-characters="48" data-current-count="48" data-injectable="false"><strong>Add-Ons: </strong>Potion of Speed and Ring of Telekinesis</p> <p data-characters="7" data-current-count="55" data-injectable="false"><strong>Perks: </strong></p> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="215" data-injectable="false"> <li>Scourge Hook: Pain Resonance</li> <li>Scourge Hook: Floods of Rage</li> <li>Make Your Choice</li> <li>Friends ‘Til The End</li> </ul> <p data-characters="487" data-current-count="702" data-injectable="true"><strong>About this Build:</strong> One of the hardest killer counters in the meta of <em>Dead by Daylight</em> is the crafty use of pallet dropping. Vecna has the perfect kit to counter this with his Mage Hand spell that allows him to punish Survivors for making the decision to drop pallets. With this build, you’re able to quickly catch up to survivors thanks to the Potion of Speed and punish Survivors for dropping a pallet via the increased pallet lift speed of Mage Hand thanks to Ring of Telekinesis.</p>
 <h3 id="h-vecna-master-of-bleeds-build" data-injectable="false">Vecna, Master of Bleeds Build</h3> <p data-characters="44" data-current-count="44" data-injectable="false"><strong>Add-Ons:</strong> Vorpal Sword and Dragontooth Dagger</p> <p data-characters="6" data-current-count="50" data-injectable="false"><strong>Perks:</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="210" data-injectable="false"> <li>Sloppy Butcher</li> <li>Scourge Hook: Gift of Pain</li> <li>Blood Echo</li> <li>Forced Penance</li> </ul> <p data-characters="433" data-current-count="643" data-injectable="true"><strong>About this Build:</strong> The Vecna Master of Bleeds build for The Lich focuses on utilizing the new Dragontooth Dagger Add-On to apply Hemmorhage and Mangled on Survivors hit with a basic attack while holding a Magic Item. While higher-level players can counter this build by not picking up Magic Items, the items themselves are often too strong to be passed up on and is really an easy way to typically enhance your chances against Vecna. </p>
 <h3 id="h-speedlich-build" data-injectable="false">SpeedLich Build</h3> <p data-characters="49" data-current-count="49" data-injectable="false"><strong>Add-Ons:</strong> Boots of Speed and Ring of Spell Storing</p> <p data-characters="6" data-current-count="55" data-injectable="false"><strong>Perks:</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="215" data-injectable="false"> <li>Corrupt Intervention</li> <li>Bamboozle</li> <li>Deadlock</li> <li>Pop Goes the Weasel</li> </ul> <p data-characters="452" data-current-count="667" data-injectable="false"><strong>About this Build:</strong> The SpeedLich build for Vecna focuses on the synergy between the two Add-Ons, Boots of Speed and Ring of Spell Storing. Boots of Speed increases the speed of Vecna by 5% for 2 seconds after casting Mage Hand, while Ring of Spell Storing reduces the cooldown on all your spells, including Mage Hand, by 4 seconds. This allows Vecna to essentially become a speed demon by using Mage Hand as much as possible to quickly traverse the map.</p>

These specific automobile changes have proved controversial online, as some players and pros argue that cars are too powerful and have turned the online third-person shooter into something completely different than before. In response, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1796238498711679236&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1796238498711679236" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Epic has already nerfed and tweaked</a></span> some parts of Season 3 to seemingly address car complaints.

These free cars are included in the game at no cost to players, or can be unlocked for free without spending any money. The relevant detail is that these free cars tend to feature large windshields, making it much easier to shoot the driver inside the car. </p><p>Meanwhile, most premium cars—some of them based on real-life vehicles—have smaller windshields. As a result, it’s much, much harder to shoot players in these cars. </p><p>This has set off a firestorm online as players feel like this directly contradicts Epic’s claim that cosmetics offered in <em>Fortnite’s </em>item shop don’t provide any kind of advantage during gameplay.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/summer-game-fest-2024/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/summer-game-fest-2024-will-feature-2-hours-of-game-showcases.888597/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/summer-game-fest-2024/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Summer Game Fest 2024’s opening show will be 2 hours long, followed by another 2 hours of Day with the Devs and Devolver Direct.</p>



<p>Geoff Keighley will return with his prestigious games showcase event on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-summer-game-fest-answered/">June 7</a>, with Summer Game Fest 2024. Anticipations for the event will be at an all-time high, with the likes of Nintendo, PlayStation and Xbox joining the fray with their announcements, along with third-party publishers such as Ubisoft, Kojima Productions and more. On top of that we should see a bunch of indie game reveals too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With so many developers and publishers, many must be wondering about how long the opening show is going to be and we finally have an answer. The official Summer Game Festival X account (formerly Twitter) posted a Tweet that provided fans with a <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Summer+Game+Fest+2024&amp;iso=20240607T14&amp;p1=137&amp;ah=4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">link</a>. This link tells them the exact time the stream kicks off in their region. Interestingly, the link also revealed that the show is going to be a whopping 4 hours long, which confused the players.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SummerGameFest?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SummerGameFest</a> will be a 2 hour live show, followed by Day of the Devs and then Devolver Direct.</p>— Summer Game Fest (@summergamefest) <a href="https://twitter.com/summergamefest/status/1797506575818797291?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 3, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Fortunately, Summer Game Fest cleared the air stating that the live show is going to be 2 hours long, which will be followed by a Day of the Devs segment and then Devolver Direct. Regardless, 2 hours is pretty long for a showcase. But, it is good to know that no developer will be rushed off stage and will have ample amount of time to talk about their game. Additionally, we can hope for more game reveals this time around too with a longer show.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In terms of what to expect from these publishers, we recently reported that ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-summer-games-fest/">LEGO Horizon Adventures</a>’ could be a part of PlayStation’s showcase during Summer Game Fest 2024. Other than we can expect announcements for games such as Black Myth: Wukong, Helldivers 2, Stellar Blade, Dragon Ball: Sparkling Zero, Star Wars Outlaws and many more that we saw in the recently released trailer. </p>

<p>If there is any reason to head into your garage or attic and dig out that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2010/09/playstation-move-1/">PlayStation Move controller</a>, it's <em>Johann Sebastian Joust. </em>Actually, there's a second good reason: that game, and three others with the same spirit, are all free now on Steam for PlayStation, Windows, Mac, and Linux.</p>
<p>The reason and timing are unfortunate, as Die Gute Fabrik, the Danish developer collective behind <em>Sportsfriends</em>, can no longer support or update the 10-year-old game. But the group is <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/277850/discussions/0/4356745862494842519/">doing the right thing</a>, making the game free on all platforms, including <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/277850/Sportsfriends/">Steam</a>, transferring ownership of the game to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/05/chromes-autoplay-video-blocker-is-accidentally-killing-web-based-games/">Bennett Foddy</a> (<em>Getting Over It</em>), and working to open-source a version of the<em> JS Joust</em> game for Linux so that perhaps it can be fit to work with other motion-sensitive controllers or through some other scheme.</p>
<figure><p><iframe type="text/html" width="980" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rTV04J-hHiQ?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption><p><em>Sportsfriends</em> launch trailer.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p><em>Sportsfriends, </em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/05/sportsfriends-with-benefits-2014s-best-indie-party-game-compilation/">previously described at Ars</a> as a "stellar pack of multiplayer-only gems," are four games meant for "couch co-op," i.e. playing in the same room as other folks holding controllers (or glowing Move sticks, in the case of <em>JS Joust)</em>. Each one is a little masterwork of clever design and hard to encapsulate briefly, but if you don't have time for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/05/sportsfriends-with-benefits-2014s-best-indie-party-game-compilation/">the deeper dive</a>, here goes:</p>                                            
                                                        
<ul>
<li><em>Super Pole Riders</em>, by Bennett Foddy, has you use the left PlayStation stick for your feet, and the right stick to angle and pivot a vaulting pole, then attempt to knock a ball through a hoop to score points or knock an opponent off their pole. (There's an <a href="https://www.foddy.net/2011/11/poleriders/">early web version</a>.)</li>
<li><span><em>Baribariball</em></span> is a one-on-one or two-on-two <em>Smash Brothers</em>-like experience, but with more old-school arcade dynamics and in-air movement.</li>
<li><em>Hokra</em>, a kind of soccer game with Atari-esque visuals and deceptively simple controls.</li>
<li><em>JS Joust</em>, in which you try to not get your Move controller jostled while goading or physically nudging other players' controllers, with your ability to move dictated by Bach's Brandenburg Concertos.</li>
</ul>
<figure><p><iframe type="text/html" width="980" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c2Ei9fgFAOs?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption><p><em>Johann Sebastian Joust</em>.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are no solo versions of any of these games, and <em>Joust</em> does not work with Windows, because Windows does not support the Move controller. With any luck, this can be worked around. And while no controller may yet provide the kind of perfect combination of motion sensitivity and glowing colored orb that the Move controller does, opening <em>Joust</em> up to more hardware can only be beneficial. More people need to try to lightly assault their friends in the name of camaraderie.</p>

<p data-characters="357" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wuthering-waves-perspective-bender-how-to-unlock-it-and-all-puzzle-solutions/"><em>Wuthering Waves</em>‘ puzzles</a> range from straightforward and simplistic to intricate, multi-step challenges. During your travels, you may accidentally stumble upon a Guide Crystal or its chest location, with no clear indicators of how to complete the entire process. Here’s how to complete both Guide Crystal puzzles and where to use them afterwards.</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-find-the-guide-crystal-puzzles-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false">How to find the Guide Crystal puzzles in Wuthering Waves</h2> <p data-characters="184" data-current-count="184" data-injectable="false"><em>Wuthering Waves</em> features two Guide Crystal puzzle sequences in Whining Aix’s Mire. The first is directly north of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-find-a-way-to-turn-on-electricity-in-wuthering-waves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Court of Savantae Ruins</a>, while the second is directly east. </p> <figure data-current-count="484" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="83" data-current-count="83" data-injectable="false">Upon approaching the north Guide Crystal location, you’ll find the following:</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="203" data-injectable="false"> <li>Six pressure platforms surrounding a puzzle cube</li> <li>Two additional pressure plates near a locked cube</li> <li>A closed door</li> </ul> <p data-characters="162" data-current-count="365" data-injectable="false">Each pressure plate corresponds to various parts of the puzzle, and you’ll need to use your character and both cubes to unlock a door to your first crystal.</p> <p data-characters="84" data-current-count="449" data-injectable="true">Similarly, you’ll find the following at the eastern Guide Crystal puzzle area:</p>
 <ol data-found-items="3" data-current-count="120" data-injectable="false"> <li>An Energy Matrix puzzle in front of a locked door</li> <li>Vine thorns and an explosive charge directly west of the door</li> <li>Exiles guarding the area</li> </ol> <p data-characters="226" data-current-count="346" data-injectable="false">Finishing this puzzle and finding your second crystal requires defeating the Exiles, clearing away the thorns, and using the nearby energy pieces to complete the matrix. Doing this unlocks another door to your second crystal. </p> <h2 id="h-first-guide-crystal-puzzle-solution-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false">First Guide Crystal puzzle solution in Wuthering Waves</h2> <p data-characters="136" data-current-count="482" data-injectable="true">Starting from the Guide Crystal puzzle north of the Court of Savantae Ruins, you’ll take the exact steps listed below to solve it:</p>
 <ol data-found-items="5" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <li>Start next to the center cube and look at the locked door. Use <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-unlock-and-use-the-levitator-in-wuthering-waves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Levitator</a> to drop the center cube onto the platform before you, closest to the locked door.</li> <li>From the center, stand on the plate to your right to unlock the locked cube.</li> <li>Drop the now unlocked cube on the pressure plate to the right of the first cube.</li> <li>Take the first cube and drop it on the pressure plate to it’s left.</li> <li>Stand on the plate next to the one from step four.</li> </ol> <p data-characters="236" data-current-count="436" data-injectable="true">Your first step involves using Levitator to bring the puzzle cube onto your first pressure platform, followed by stepping on one to unlock a second cube. Your camera will pan to the cube unlocking, indicating you picked the right spots.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="200" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true">Next, you’ll place both cubes on their respective platforms before standing on the last one. Like before, your camera will pan to the door, showing you picked the right locations for everything.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="213" data-current-count="513" data-injectable="true">Once you place both cubes on the plates and stand on the third, you’ll open the locked door, revealing an advanced supply chest and the first Guide Crystal. Pick it up before heading to the eastern location.</p>
 <h2 id="h-second-guide-crystal-puzzle-solution-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false">Second Guide Crystal puzzle solution in Wuthering Waves</h2> <p data-characters="216" data-current-count="216" data-injectable="false">Next, we have the eastern Guide Crystal puzzle location. If this is your first time here, you’ll likely see a group of Exiles guarding the area. Eliminate them before taking the steps below to solve the puzzle:</p> <ol data-found-items="2" data-current-count="296" data-injectable="false"> <li>Take the explosive charge and throw it at the vine thorns to clear them away.</li> <li>Locate the four Energy Matrix pieces and arrange them in the circle.</li> </ol> <p data-characters="259" data-current-count="555" data-injectable="true">The first thing you’ll do after defeating the exiles at the puzzle location is use the nearby Explosive Charge to deal with the vine thorns. One of the Energy Matrix pieces is caught under these thorns, so you’ll need to burn them before starting.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="267" data-current-count="567" data-injectable="true">Once you clear away the thorns, you’ll need to get your hands on four Energy Matrix puzzle pieces. You’ll find two in front of the Energy Matrix, one directly left of the door, guarded by some exiles, and one northwest of the puzzle next to a stone block.</p>
 <p data-characters="226" data-current-count="226" data-injectable="false">After gathering all four pieces, your goal is to cover every blue circle with the pieces. You can use the outer edges to help fit each piece in, but you’re not required to fill them all in. Below is the completed puzzle:</p> <figure data-current-count="526" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="100" data-current-count="100" data-injectable="false">With all four Energy Matrix pieces in place, the door will open, revealing the second Guide Crystal.</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-use-guide-crystals-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false">How to use Guide Crystals in Wuthering Waves</h2> <p data-characters="240" data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false">Now that you have the two Guide Crystals, you can use them outside the Court of Savantae Ruins to uncover a hidden premium supply chest. To do this, head to the ruins before climbing the eastern cliffs until you find a large floating cube. </p> <figure data-current-count="640" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="275" data-current-count="275" data-injectable="false">Near this cube, you’ll see two glowing spots where you can place your Guide Crystals to reveal the treasure chest. You’ll obtain Union EXP, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-astrite-in-wuthering-waves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Astrite</a>, and Shell Credits for your troubles, which, considering the puzzles also had their treasures, is worth the effort.</p>

<p data-characters="218" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If there’s a type of game that I never tire of, it’s a breezy Metroidvania. The best find a perfect balance between satisfying gameplay loops and combat but never reach a point where they are overwhelming. </p> <p data-characters="246" data-current-count="246" data-injectable="false"><em>Minishoot’ Adventures </em>(apostrophe stays in the name) by two-person SoulGame Studio promises to be just that. You play as an adorable ship traversing a bright world taken over by the dastardly Unchosen, and saving your friends along the way.</p> <p data-characters="497" data-current-count="743" data-injectable="true">It’s a neat premise for a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/im-so-glad-people-are-still-making-bullet-hell-games/">bullet hell</a>/metroidvania hybrid inspired by the top-down <em>Legend of Zelda </em>titles, and the game lives up to it. <em>Minishoot’ Adventures’ </em> story is minimal, but more than makes up for that by being an incredibly charming title that wears its influences on its sleeve. It also provides some of the smoothest twin-stick shooting I’ve played in ages. Tightly-paced exploration, fun side activities, and an adorable art style are extras to an amazing ride.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="136" data-current-count="436" data-injectable="true"><strong>Minishoot’ Adventures (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1634860/Minishoot_Adventures/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a> [reviewed])<br>Developer:&nbsp;SoulGame Studio</strong><br><strong>Publisher: IndieArk<br>Released: April 2, 2024<br>MSRP: $14.99</strong></p>
 <h2 id="h-gliding-to-adventure" data-injectable="false">Gliding to adventure</h2> <p data-characters="316" data-current-count="316" data-injectable="false">The biggest compliment I can give <em>Minishoot’ Adventures </em>is how laser-focused it is on being a fun adventure. Much of this comes down to just how amazing shooting is. It’s a bit of a no-brainer that a twin-stick shooter would focus on good controls, but I was surprised by the ship’s responsiveness.</p> <p data-characters="330" data-current-count="646" data-injectable="true">Focusing on <em>Minishoot’ Adventures’ </em>“game feel” above all else might sound odd, but it’s genuinely incredible, to the point it lifts the game from fun to fantastic. Part of this comes from how rock-solid it should perform on a computer made in this decade, but it mostly stems from its tight controls.</p>
 <p data-characters="470" data-current-count="470" data-injectable="true">The ship glides across its environments but never feels slippery or weightless. There’s a clear momentum in movement, but it always remains strong. Bullet trajectory has the slightest curve toward enemies keeping moving and shooting smooth. It’s subtle enough not to hinder the challenge and only helps the combat’s pace. Anyone wanting more automated firing has the option available through the game’s difficulty settings, which is a nice touch.</p>
 <p data-characters="392" data-current-count="392" data-injectable="false">The challenge while dungeon-crawling remains in the shooting, with bosses as a highlight at the end of major areas. While normal enemy and mini-boss variety are fine for <em>Minishoot’ Adventures</em>‘ length, bosses let the bullet-hell side shine. None reach the absurdity in titles like <em>Ikaruga </em>or similar bullet-hell/Metroidvania hybrids like <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-tevi-pc-metroidvania/">TEVI</a></em>, but that’s not the intent here.</p> <p data-characters="250" data-current-count="642" data-injectable="true"><em>Minishoot’ Adventures </em>excels at being a more casual experience while remaining challenging. I died a handful of times on my standard difficulty playthrough, but there was never a point where I felt stuck, whether on standard or boss encounters.</p>
 <p data-characters="323" data-current-count="323" data-injectable="false">One thing I appreciated when starting a second playthrough on the highest difficulty, was <em>Minishoot</em>‘s focus on changing bullet speeds and patterns as a difficulty modifier. Those adjustments in place of buffing damage make the experience worth revisiting if you want to squeeze more playtime out of the whole package.</p> <figure data-current-count="623" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-pretty-chill-for-a-bullet-hell" data-injectable="false">Pretty chill for a bullet hell</h2> <p data-characters="358" data-current-count="358" data-injectable="false">As fast as combat goes, I found <em>Minishoot’ Adventures</em> incredibly relaxing. The normal difficulty is always manageable, and the art design paired with the soft electronic score makes it a chill experience. Secret areas are plentiful with notable tells, and the game’s short length means you’re bound to find something cool every few minutes.</p> <p data-characters="297" data-current-count="655" data-injectable="true">Flat upgrades, like increasing damage and ship speed, are done through a simple upgrade menu with skill points earned by killing enemies. I wasn’t initially sure how I felt about it, but it made lulls between bigger upgrades less noticeable since even killing enemies works toward something.</p>
 <p data-characters="302" data-current-count="302" data-injectable="false">It’s the exploration and dungeon design where <em>Minishoot’ Adventures</em>‘ <em>Zelda </em>inspirations are at their clearest. Some light platforming elements are also present, using ramps and dashes to get over bottomless pits. These are simple but satisfying to blaze through without much thought. </p> <p data-characters="336" data-current-count="638" data-injectable="true">Most major areas also contain some major upgrades for traversal or weapons needed for progress and are all simple and wonderful. Getting to glide over water, or destroy those boulders blocking your path, were game-changers in a way the best Metroidvanias can capture. The short game length means this satisfaction hits incredibly often.</p>
 <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="373" data-injectable="false">One thing I would have liked to see more of was more puzzles within the dungeons themselves. While fighting enemies and clearing environmental hazards were great, I tanked damage by the mid-game with relative ease. There are some instant kill hazards and rooms with timed goals, and more of those would have been great before <em>Minishoot’ Adventures</em>‘ latter half.</p> <p data-characters="246" data-current-count="619" data-injectable="true">It’s more of a nitpick from me and wasn’t something I had thought about until after I started collecting my overall feelings. As it currently is, the overall package is a blast, with little breaking the pace of combat and exploration.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-the-cutest-apocalypse-around" data-injectable="false">The cutest apocalypse around</h2> <p data-characters="208" data-current-count="508" data-injectable="true"><em>Minishoot’ Adventures </em>is one of the cutest games I played recently thanks to the adorable art direction. Its world is soft and bright, even after it’s been ravaged by sinister forces years prior. </p>
 <p data-characters="511" data-current-count="511" data-injectable="true">It’s genuinely beautiful too, with vibrant hues giving life to the lovingly illustrated 2D environments and objects. My favorite area is the forest just south of the starting zone. The way its more muted blue-green grass and trees are drawn makes it feel cozy to exist in, rather than eerie. Another forest in the northeast is lovely with its vibrant autumn-like oranges, but the southern forest’s soft blue-green and calming score gives it an atmosphere where I could see myself taking a nice nap.</p>
 <p data-characters="381" data-current-count="381" data-injectable="false">Complementing this is the lovely sound design. Subtle touches, like how each hit creates a satisfying ding, emphasize the already great combat. The sounds also explain why I grew slightly attached to the title character and playable ship, Minishoot’. While the design is tiny in a cute way, its happy beeps are adorable, and I cared about the little guy finding its friends. </p> <p data-characters="280" data-current-count="661" data-injectable="true">This isn’t to say <em>Minishoot’ Adventures</em> has a complicated or emotional story beyond what the premise implies, but solid design and sound add quite a bit to the attachment factor. The world is gorgeous, and worth saving while there’s still so much life left in it</p>
 <p data-characters="261" data-current-count="261" data-injectable="false">The actual narrative is thin, however. There isn’t much beyond the basic concept of defeating the Unchosen and helping your friends. Despite keeping this straightforwardness for the entire plot, one development caught me off guard with how bittersweet it was.</p> <p data-characters="300" data-current-count="561" data-injectable="true">I won’t spoil what it is, but it helped put into perspective how much I liked the little playable ship and had me thinking about what its story was trying to say. It wasn’t massive, but I appreciated this story beat’s bold direction, even if the overall experience remained simple and cute.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-making-the-best-of-well-used-parts" data-injectable="false">Making the best of well-used parts</h2> <p data-characters="466" data-current-count="766" data-injectable="true">Not much about <em>Minishoot’ Adventures</em> sounds noteworthy when talking about it, but it’s one of those games where everything clicks when playing. All the pieces fit so well together that, even if nothing is new, it’s refined to the point I slipped into a cozy rhythm of exploring my former home and fighting bad guys. It’s a title proudly wearing its inspirations on its sleeves and dedicates itself to bringing the best out of them, and I admire that.</p>
 <p data-characters="348" data-current-count="348" data-injectable="false"><em>Minishoot’ Adventures</em> is a 2D <em>Zelda </em>game capturing the feeling of exploring a beautiful and dangerous world, and it’s a bullet hell whose movement and shooting are as satisfying as some of CAVE’s best. It’s not exactly like either, and uses elements from both to create an experience all its own, but it’s not perfect.</p> <p data-characters="390" data-current-count="738" data-injectable="true">Beyond the lack of truly perilous hazards and puzzles, the singular notable issue I have with <em>Minishoot’ Adventures </em>is some minor bugs. It’s mostly in some collision detection, as the ship sometimes clipped under passageways, but these were rare. Another oddity I noticed was one area where performance tanked to under 60 FPS when it otherwise stayed locked at 144 FPS everywhere else. </p>
 <p data-characters="263" data-current-count="263" data-injectable="false">This is otherwise a highly polished experience, and these blemishes didn’t impact my time much. The developers have also been steadily <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1634860/view/4172098098034089446" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">releasing patches</a> that fix issues I hadn’t encountered, so hopefully, anything I noticed will soon no longer be present.</p> <p data-characters="370" data-current-count="633" data-injectable="true"><em>Minishoot’ Adventures </em>may be simple, but it’s a blast. The story is thin and occasional bugs dampened some moments, but the experience remained amazing overall. Most of that is thanks to the moment-to-moment gameplay having some of the best shooting and exploration I played in a long time. It’s pure fun, and I honestly can’t ask for anything more from a game. </p>

<p data-characters="202" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-play-alhaitham-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alhaitham</a> is a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/genshin-impact-character-tier-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">powerful Dendro DPS character</a> in <em>Genshin Impact</em>, but he relies on having the right teammates to reach his full potential. Here are some of Alhaitham’s best teams to maximize his damage.</p> <h2 id="h-alhaitham-s-best-quicken-teams" data-injectable="false">Alhaitham’s best Quicken teams</h2> <p data-characters="389" data-current-count="389" data-injectable="false">As an on-field DPS, Alhaitham will rely on triggering Spread as many times as possible to deal the most damage. This means pairing him with off-field Electro teammates to trigger Quicken, which allows Alhaitham to trigger Spread. <strong><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-fischl-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fischl</a>, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-beidou-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beidou</a>, and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-yae-miko-builds-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yae Miko</a></strong> are good offensive picks, while <strong><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-kuki-shinobu-builds-weapons-teams-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kuki Shinobu</a></strong> makes for a good healer. Pick one or two Electro teammates to complement Alhaitham.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="201" data-current-count="590" data-injectable="true">Then, round out your team with a second Dendro unit. <strong>Nahida</strong> is the best in this slot, but you can also use <strong>Dendro Traveler</strong>. <strong><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-baizhu-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baizhu</a> and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-yaoyao-healer-builds-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yaoyao</a></strong> make for good Dendro healers if you need defensive utility.</p>
 <p data-characters="304" data-current-count="304" data-injectable="false">If space permits, you can bring an Anemo character with 4pc Viridescent Venerer. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/genshin-impact-are-kazuhas-constellations-worth-pulling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kazuha</a>, Sucrose, and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-venti-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Venti</a> have good crowd control and will increase your Electro teammate’s damage by applying a RES debuff to enemies. Alternatively, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-zhongli-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/">Zhongli</a> can apply a similar debuff while granting Alhaitham a shield.</p> <h3 id="h-examples-of-alhaitham-quicken-teams" data-injectable="false">Examples of Alhaitham Quicken teams</h3> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="464" data-injectable="true"> <li>Alhaitham – Fischl – Beidou – Dendro Traveler</li> <li>Alhaitham – Yae Miko – Nahida – Zhongli</li> <li>Alhaitham – Fischl – Kuki Shinobu – Nahida</li> <li>Alhaitham – Fischl – Baizhu – Kazuha</li> </ul>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-alhaitham-s-best-hyperbloom-teams" data-injectable="false">Alhaitham’s best Hyperbloom teams</h2> <p data-characters="311" data-current-count="611" data-injectable="true">Hyperbloom teams are similar to Quicken teams, but with added Hydro. Dendro and Hydro create Dendro Cores, which look like little green seeds on the ground. Hitting these Dendro Cores with Electro attacks triggers Hyperbloom, which deals significant damage based on your Electro character’s Elemental Mastery.</p>
 <p data-characters="234" data-current-count="234" data-injectable="false">Bring an Electro character who deals consistent AoE Electro damage. The best Electro characters for Hyperbloom in <em>Genshin Impact</em> are <strong><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-raiden-builds-genshin-impact-dps-and-hyperbloom/">Raiden Shogun</a></strong> and <strong>Kuki Shinobu.</strong> Choose one or the other; you don’t need more than one Electro unit.</p> <p data-characters="243" data-current-count="477" data-injectable="true">As for Hydro units, Alhaitham can work with most off-field Hydro options. These include <strong><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-furina-builds-weapons-teams-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Furina</a>, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-xingqiu-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xingqiu</a>, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-yelan-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yelan</a>, and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-kokomi-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kokomi</a>.</strong> I recommend only bringing one Hydro character, since too much Hydro can make it harder for Alhaitham to trigger Spread.</p>
 <p data-characters="247" data-current-count="247" data-injectable="false">The last team slot can be a second Dendro character (<strong>Nahida, Dendro Traveler, Baizhu, or Yaoyao</strong>) or a flex unit of your choice. Anemo characters like Kazuha, Sucrose, or Venti are fine picks, or you can bring Zhongli for his RES debuff and shield.</p> <h3 id="h-examples-of-alhaitham-hyperbloom-teams" data-injectable="false">Examples of Alhaitham Hyperbloom teams</h3> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="407" data-injectable="false"> <li>Alhaitham – Kuki Shinobu – Xingqiu – Dendro Traveler</li> <li>Alhaitham – Raiden – Xingqiu – Yaoyao</li> <li>Alhaitham – Raiden – Furina – Baizhu</li> <li>Alhaitham – Kuki Shinobu – Yelan – Zhongli</li> </ul>

That’s great, but I just wish it didn’t come at the cost of <em>fishing</em>, a mechanic that was introduced during the Season of the Deep, and brought me tremendous zen when I grew tired of shooting things ad nauseam in <em>Destiny 2</em>.</p><p>Fishing is, for all intents and purposes, a pretty pointless activity. I don’t want to suggest it didn’t have depth, but it was hardly the optimal way to earn anything during the Season of the Deep. It would net you seasonal reputation and captured fishes (which ranged in rarity akin to weapons and gear) could be deposited into a tank for further rewards, which was a nice touch. You could even begin an exotic quest line while fishing, but that was the most it ever mattered. Otherwise, fishing holes simply popped into existence on several of <em>Destiny 2</em>’s worlds for folks to kick back, cast a line, and catch a break. Saving the galaxy from being torn apart by the warring factions of the Light and Darkness is hard work. Guardians deserved the break.</p><p>Fishing was a fun idle activity, but it also reminded me of how important distractions like it are to MMOs like <em>Destiny 2</em>. I was just talking to a friend about how they went fishing in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online--1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online--1"><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></a></span><em> </em>a few weeks ago, and they were so excited to tell me about it and what they got from participating. Fishing is a banal activity, but it helps people feel connected to their environment and the people around them. Why do you think certain father-son relationships are predicated on partaking in fishing trips? Why do you think so many MMOs—which thrive on fostering worlds that draw players in and incentivize them to stay—so frequently have fishing minigames? It extends beyond MMOs too! Folks love fishing in games like <em>Stardew Valley</em>, and they often plumb the depths of these pretty simple features just to spend time in these games and worlds.</p><p><em>Destiny 2</em> has never hurt for activities. If anything it has too many of them, and they often boil down to the same loop of shooting things, defending objectives, and moving on to the next target. These activities are fun because <em>Destiny 2 </em>remains one of the best-feeling FPS games on the market, not because they are inherently novel ways to pass the time. That’s why fishing felt like such an odd but welcome addition. It was <em>actually</em> something different, and even if it was ultimately pretty shallow, I preferred it to the similar combat gauntlets <em>Destiny 2 </em>has recycled and remixed for years. That’s why fishing’s removal is such a bummer.</p><p>The removal of content is something Bungie is still figuring out, and it remains a thorn in the side of its community. Many of the larger aspects of <em>Destiny 2</em>’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-into-the-light-final-shape-excited-1851384918&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-into-the-light-final-shape-excited-1851384918">recent <em>Into the Light </em>update</a></span>, such as the raid boss gauntlet Pantheon and a social hub with its own reward track, are already getting gutted from the game. Bungie has already said it’s looking for ways to reintegrate systems introduced via <em>Into the Light </em>into the main game, which raises questions about why they’re being removed in the first place. On the other hand, it does suggest there could be ways to reimplement features like fishing, meaning all hope isn’t completely lost.</p><p>The eternal problem with <em>Destiny 2 </em>is that it’s a huge game with a lot of technical debt: it currently comes in at more than 100 GBs of memory across its several platforms, and the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-file-size-preload-1851510165&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-file-size-preload-1851510165">number will only grow higher</a></span> with the inclusion of <em>The Final Shape</em>. It’s why whole campaigns were removed from the game in the first place. Moving forward, Bungie’s got to be smarter about what it adds, especially if it’s going to keep taking things away from its players. Why is the game constantly growing only to continue shrinking? It doesn’t seem feasible or fair to either the developers or the players that vast swaths of <em>Destiny </em>will continue to disappear.</p><p>The hope is that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-3-leak-sequel-bungie-payback-1851403208&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-3-leak-sequel-bungie-payback-1851403208">whatever shape the <em>Destiny </em>franchise takes after</a></span> this expansion accounts for these problems. It’s imperative to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bungie-destiny-2-sony-final-shape-playstation-1851077097&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bungie-destiny-2-sony-final-shape-playstation-1851077097"><em>Destiny </em>and Bungie’s long-term health</a></span> that <em>The Final Shape </em>not only succeeds, but transforms the game into a more manageable one whose development <em>doesn’t </em>constantly cause fires like this. As a player, it’d just be great to have all the chunks of the game that I support every year stick around. For me at least, that begins by carving out a place for fishing, the most completely mundane part of <em>Destiny 2 </em>that I will miss so dearly.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24167443/indika-video-game-movies-cinematic<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="nwMpOV">For two decades, the words “cinematic” and “blockbuster” have been, for most game directors, synonymous. During this window, which stretches back to the original <em>God of War</em> and <em>Halo</em>, we’ve enjoyed (or, for others, endured) big-budget video game creators aspiring to emulate their blockbuster film counterparts. </p>
<p id="M82jej">If — somehow — you’ve never seen the films of Steven Spielberg or Michael Mann, you’ve nonetheless experienced them via contact highs from Uncharted, Grand Theft Auto, and practically every other Big Game released this millennium. </p>
<p id="fBIFu7">But <em>Indika</em>, a game that sounds like a weed strain and plays like being stoned and scrolling through the Criterion Channel, has me hopeful that we’re approaching, with narrative video games, a turning point for what it means for a game to be “cinematic.” </p>
<p id="HEuHEu">What fuels that hope is <em>Indika</em>’s creative similarities to a micro-budget indie horror film from the ’90s.</p>

<h3 id="uxgRaU"><strong>The Blair Witch effect</strong></h3>
<p id="yKyEMU">Is it possible for one game to change the look of an entire medium? And why would it be <em>Indika</em>, a game most readers haven’t played, or even heard of?</p>
<p id="81EvNJ">25 years ago, <em>The Blair Witch Project</em> inspired countless parodies with a single shot. You know the one. You can see it in the trailer, the poster, or at the top of this story. The lead actress-slash-camera operator holds a cheap camcorder inches from her face. Tears well in her eyes, and a flashlight casts hard shadows across her dry skin. </p>
<p id="gAwxOx">She’s terrified. She’s a mess. She’s barely in focus or even in frame.</p>
<p id="jJr6YJ">At that time, few commercial directors would film a shot so crudely, nor would a celebrity offer the audience such an intimate look inside their nostrils. Filmgoers expected movies to conform to a certain look, sound, and feel. But <em>The Blair Witch Project</em> didn’t resemble anything in theaters; it looked like a cheap documentary you’d find on the local PBS station. It looked real.</p>

<p id="1J14RY">With that emphasis on “realism” above all else, the amateur camerawork accomplished its goal — scare the shit out of people — better than any expensive shot on an industry-grade camera could.  </p>
<p id="Xz6HR8">The filmmakers had taken the empathic visual language of the documentary form and weaponized it. Look again at the shot. You don’t see an actress staring into the camcorder; you see a person. And so, as happens when you look someone in the eyes, a connection forms. This person, you think, could be you. Alone. In the woods. Something unknown stalking through the branches. </p>
<p id="l1Hsa3">The camerawork of <em>The Blair Witch Project</em> wasn’t cinematic, not in the classical sense. But in time, what audiences expected film and TV to look like would change to meet that image. Do we have the sprawling found-footage horror genre without it? Or the mega-popular docu-sitcoms like <em>The Office</em> and <em>Modern Family</em>?</p>
<p id="ihyD8f">The creators of <em>The Blair Witch Project</em>, because of their limitations (no money! No sets! No actors!) looked for inspiration where others didn’t have to, and wouldn’t choose to. The film’s success then gave future creators big and small permission to follow its lead, forever changing what a Hollywood movie could look and feel like.</p>

<strong>Indika and the film school games</strong> </h3>
<p id="vp7x9s"><em>Indika</em>, the fantastic new adventure game from Odd Meter, tells the story of a young nun who loses her grip on reality in an alternate-history version of 19th-century Russia. Tortured by a voice in her head that may or may not be a demon, Indika partners with a sickly man who may or may not be divinely chosen by God. Together, they embark on a perilous road trip through beautiful forests, abandoned towns, and literalizations of biblical allegory. </p>
<p id="cppAoi"><em>Indika</em> is the latest — and one of the most impressive — examples of a sea change in the look and feel of cinematic games. </p>
<p id="JaEZ5V">You don’t have to play <em>Indika </em>to see what I mean (though, hey, you really should). In the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23921305/odd-meter-11-bit-studios-indika-announcement">announcement trailer</a>, the game’s creators borrow liberally from filmmakers rarely associated with games. These directors, who can’t afford the spectacle and scale of big-budget filmmaking, rely on more audacious (and affordable) craft to distinguish their work. </p>
<p id="R7lRxe">“We tried to use a standard limited set of [virtual camera] lenses to depict the limitations of inexpensive auteur cinema,” <em>Indika</em> game director Dmitry Svetlow told Polygon over email. He cited<em> Poor Things</em> director Yorgos Lanthimos, Russian filmmaker and slow cinema pioneer Andrei Tarkovsky, and former Monty Python member and infamous weirdo auteur Terry Gilliam as inspiration. </p>

<p id="5svlZB">In <em>Indika</em>, the stark exterior landscapes and cold architecture resemble the striking but antiseptic sets of Lanthimos. In the game’s nunnery, a SnorriCam shot — in which the camera is strapped onto the actor and aimed at their face — recalls <em>Blair Witch</em>, of course, but also the works of ’90s music video director turned ’00s filmmaker <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awoTylLBF9I&amp;t=1s">Spike Jonze</a> and Robert Webb’s comedy sketch series <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lnusc9Rlx6w"><em>Sir Digby Chicken Caesar</em></a>. </p>
<p id="FWWL7H">Where <em>Blair Witch</em> borrowed the documentary aesthetic to force audiences to straighten their backs and pay attention, Svetlow and company are reaching into the toolbox of low-budget filmmaking to do something similar with games.</p>
<p id="mm1572">Or, to put it crassly, <em>Indika </em>doesn’t just look like art films but feels like them. The story opens with the player inhabiting the habit of the titular young nun and fetching a pail of water from a well, then doing it again. And again. And again and again. Her steps up and down a grimy, snow-crunched slope in the abbey echo Tarkosvky’s long shots (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3Dp6EdFRHo">like this one</a> of a man carrying a candle for seven minutes) that were intentionally tedious, forcing us to feel time passing not just in a movie or a game, but in our life as we experience them. </p>
<div id="HdS3Q0"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O3Dp6EdFRHo?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="oIuGmq">To make the game more cinematic, Svetlow wrote the team needed a “greater focus on dramaturgy, on the quality and depth of characters, as well as the necessary level of presentation of events.” </p>
<p id="dY5eRb">In <em>Indika</em>, you don’t save the world or nail sick headshots. You accumulate poorly hidden collectibles and earn points, though they’re worth nothing and, by the standards of other games, a waste of time — something the game’s loading screens emphasize any chance they get. (“Don’t waste time collecting points, they are pointless.”) Sometimes Indika comes across a bench, and if you direct her to sit down on it, the game hands over the “film editing” to the player, allowing them to swap between different camera angles, some of which Indika doesn’t even appear in. </p>
<p id="PYPFNa">You could move on, directing Indika to stand back up and continue about her business. Or you could let the camera rest, your mind wandering as your eyes lock onto a field of mud and snow. In a medium full of realistic 3D worlds rife with kinetic empowerment, <em>Indika </em>encourages you to indulge in a moment of peace and ceding of control.</p>
<div id="CcsQnh"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wZZ63QYbwPk?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<h3 id="skv4lS"><strong>Change happens slowly and then all at once</strong></h3>
<p id="zEPJjI">Can we be certain games like <em>Indika </em>will influence their big-budget peers? They already have. </p>
<p id="o7mQrn">Here’s just one example: In 2009, Naughty Dog released <em>Uncharted 2</em>, a game rife with some of the most iconic blockbuster moments in the history of video games. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVNxI86vLKI">Its opening</a>, in which the hero climbs up a train that dangles off a cliff, may have inspired the latest Mission: Impossible, which ends with Tom Cruise doing something <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQn9hrj0byk">very, <em>very </em>similar</a>.</p>
<p id="b40caj">But tucked into<em> Uncharted 2</em> is a sequence meant to contrast with these sorts of set-pieces. Around the midpoint, Nathan Drake hikes through a Tibetan village. He doesn’t climb any deadly cliffs. Nothing blows up. Nobody gets shot. This was, in its time, unusual — a moment in which the player could exist in a beautiful 3D environment without being required to destroy the village or its population.</p>
<p id="fcozpE">The Tibetan village sequence (and I swear this was acknowledged publicly, though now I struggle to find any quote) was cribbed from 2008’s <em>The Graveyard</em>, a short art game from the now-defunct micro studio Tale of Tales. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZZ63QYbwPk">In the game</a>, an elderly woman walks the path of a graveyard, sits on a bench, reflects, and then returns from where she came. To younger readers, this will sound tedious. But to game critics at the time, this scene dropped into our minds like a new drug — a total shock to the system.</p>

</p>
<p id="XTyiHo">With <em>The Graveyard</em> and <em>Uncharted 2 </em>and many other (mostly indie) games of that time period, the video game industry witnessed a surge in what would be dubbed “walking simulators,” a somewhat derisive term for a powerful idea: You make a beautiful, rich virtual space, then afford your players some time to exist within them.</p>
<p id="VWk2Oz">If The <em>Graveyard </em>could reshape the assumptions of cinematic video games, then why shouldn’t <em>Indika </em>help to bring the style of low-budget and arthouse filmmaking to <em>Indika</em>’s many peers? </p>
<p id="ySijkQ">That’s the magic of this moment in video games: <em>Indika</em> isn’t alone in its ambitions to challenge our assumptions of what makes a game cinematic. Indie developers have been steadily pushing against the confines of what games look and feel like for over a decade. <em>To the Moon</em>. <em>El Paso, Elsewhere</em>. <em>Disco Elysium</em>. I could double my word count with nothing more than titles.</p>
<p id="BABkZj">But what’s different now, and what <em>Indika</em> reflects, is the independent games scene accelerating up an exponential hockey stick of creative output.</p>

<p id="zMesGS">Much like <em>The Blair Witch Project</em> (and countless other indie films since its release) was made possible by the first boom of consumer-level cameras and filmmaking tools, <em>Indika </em>and its ilk reflect a new era of game production where a small team — thanks to cost-effective and ultra-powerful dev tools — can take a risk on a personal project. In fact, with modern game engines, indie game developers can accomplish visual feats indie filmmakers could only imagine.</p>
<p id="rrZBar">“We recreated a non-existent fairy-tale world; to do this for cinema would have cost an order of magnitude more,” Svetlow told Polygon.</p>
<p id="AeMQlA">Since I finished <em>Indika</em>, I’ve played three more oddly “cinematic” games — <em>Arctic Eggs</em>, <em>1000xResist</em>, and <em>Crow Country —</em> and it feels like every week another new game appears, its creators taking a bat to the expectations of what a game should look and feel like. Now and then the bat is bound to connect and pop open this medium, releasing an entirely new style that artists will pounce on, like kids grabbing candy from a smashed piñata.</p>
<p id="LzgMxc">Perhaps <em>Indika</em>, in time, will reveal itself to be one of these special games. The <em>Blair Witch</em> of video games, launching a thousand projects that build on the arthouse aesthetic. Or perhaps this abundance of creativity will — not with one bold release or one inspirational aesthetic — radically change the idea of what makes a game “cinematic” to the point that we’re less worried about how a game can look like a film, and these interactive narrative experiences that we’d previously compare to great films can have a look that’s recognizably and thrillingly their own.</p>
<p id="Bojxxp">I hope we get there. In the meantime, I’ll be grateful to play games that aspire to match ambitious and inventive directors, rather than playing yet another video game that could be mistaken for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22611267/free-guy-review"><em>Free Guy</em></a>. </p>

		<p>Crusader Kings III: Roads to Power is the next expansion for the grand strategy game, Paradox Interactive has revealed, and it will be available from September 24th. This new expansion, which is part of Crusader King III’s Chapter 3 expansion pass, adds new ways of vying for power in this ruthless medieval world.</p>
<p><iframe title="Crusader Kings III: Roads to Power - Available September 24!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PxamTWMq1M0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Roads to Power will add two new ways to play Crusader Kings III. The first is that of a Landless Adventurer who starts with nothing and builds their reputation through mercenary work. Get powerful enough and you could challenge the power structure of a kingdom, and take over. The second pathway is set in the Byzantine Empire, which is a non feudal system. Here players will need to scheme as noble in the imperial court against other families in attempt to grab power, and place allies in the strongest positions.</p>
<p>Paradox Interactive has outlined the features players can expect in Crusader Kings III: Roads to Power:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Administrative Government: Experience medieval rule outside of the feudal system with a new style of empire management. A web of Governors jockeys for position in the empire with intrigue and power, sometimes rewarding merit and sometimes rewarding perfidy. Only a truly skilled Emperor can keep these squabbling forces in line.</em></li>
<li><em>The Family Estate: Run and manage a powerful Family Estate, the seat of your House’s power, even when you hold no other land. Construct new buildings and improvements to further your power and influence within an administrative empire.</em></li>
<li><em>Influence System: Build up a character’s influence within an administrative empire to climb the rungs of bureaucracy. Raise your status in the realm and gather more power for yourself. Start as a landless noble on an estate, and compete for valuable provinces to govern before making your bid for the Purple.</em></li>
<li><em>&nbsp;A Life of Adventure: Freely roam the map, untied to any realm or holding, going wherever the winds of fortune blow you. Fulfil contracts as a landless adventurer, even through the generations, building up a reputation of your own. Earn gold, prestige and fame travelling the globe until you decide to settle down and claim land you have earned through merit.</em></li>
<li><em>Choose Successor or Caesar: Spend the influence you have gathered to determine the course of the Empire and get the successor you want, whether a royal family member, a powerful noble, a martial hero, or any other candidate you can rally the people behind. The Emperor can even opt to co-rule if the burden of the throne is too much for one person.</em></li>
<li><em>New Byzantine Flavour Content: New events, monuments and activities built around the Byzantine theme, including chariot racing.</em></li>
<li><em>Cosmetic Additions: A Byzantine-themed UI skin and new court fashions for your characters, new 2D event art, new on-map monuments of the Byzantine world, new on-map holding designs, and a Byzantine throne room for Royal Court sessions, among other aesthetic improvements. New music inspired by Orthodox holy chants is also included.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Screenshots of some of the new content were also shared.</p>

  <p id="yugZzI">It’s quiet in here — almost <em>too </em>quiet. Consider this the calm before the storm; with June kicking off, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24164051/best-new-tv-summer-2024-release-calendar-schedule-shows-series">we’ll be knee-deep in a treasure trove of new shows</a>, and that pace keeps up, more or less, the whole summer. </p>
<p id="tV8L27">Still, there’s a lot of fun stuff to dig into. <em>Clipped</em>, starring Laurence Fishburne, details the events that led to Donald Sterling’s lifetime ban from the NBA; <em>The Acolyte</em>, the latest Disney Plus Star Wars show, is <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23931403">the first time the High Republic era has been on screen</a>. All that and <em>Doctor Who</em> is still going, and <em>Top Chef</em> no longer has <em>Last Chance Kitchen </em>to catch its fallen soldiers. Things are heating up all over the place!</p>
<p id="hkG9Dv">Here’s the best new TV premieres this week. </p>


<hr id="IF1ehv">
<h2 id="fs6TI9"><strong>New shows on Netflix</strong></h2>
<h3 id="jRZLpn"><strong>Sweet Tooth season 3</strong></h3>

<p id="OHuQK7"><strong>Genre: </strong>Charming fantasy<br><strong>Release date: </strong>June 6, with all episodes<br><strong>Showrunner/creator: </strong>Jim Mickle<br><strong>Cast:</strong> Christian Convey, Nonso Anozie, Stefania LaVie Owen, and more</p>
<p id="IlizaR">In <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22517814/sweet-tooth-review-netflix"><em>Sweet Tooth</em></a>’s final season, all your questions — about the hybrids, the “sick,” and (hopefully) Gus’ (Christian Convey) mom — will be answered! And for its third and final season, <em>Sweet Tooth</em> will be going the logical place to bring all these strands together: the Arctic. </p>
<h3 id="voOLwv"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></h3>
<div id="xr9qwa"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ntczSnSogQ8?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>

This will not shock you given the nature of the story, but... she may have her own agenda, and her own secrets, that will rock the established order of this school. </p>
<h2 id="GCVQ6m"><strong>New shows on Disney Plus</strong></h2>
<h3 id="C4G30Z"><strong>The Acolyte</strong></h3>

<p id="9Hf7jf"><strong>Genre: </strong>High Republic Star Wars<br><strong>Release date: </strong>June 4, with two episodes<br><strong>Showrunner/creator: </strong>Leslye Headland<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Lee Jung-jae, Amandla Stenberg, Carrie-Anne Moss, and more</p>
<p id="bwwhbU">It’s the final days of the High Republic and one Jedi (<em>Squid Game</em> star Lee Jung-jae) is trying to investigate a series of crimes — and who should he stumble upon but his old Padawan (Amandla Stenberg), and a troupe of more sinister forces. </p>
<h2 id="g2nDJp"><strong>New shows on Hulu</strong></h2>

<p id="ISaX3s">Maybe you know it from the podcast — <em>The Sterling Affairs</em>, as part of ESPN’s <em>30 for 30</em> — or maybe you just know it from having followed the chaos. Either way, <em>Clipped</em> is gonna make sure you know it now: the story of Donald Sterling (Ed O’Neill), the Clippers boss who got caught saying some racist stuff in a recording and how it rocked the NBA. </p>
<h2 id="y7Od1Q"><strong>New shows on Paramount Plus</strong></h2>

Plus, a prolific serial killer from their past is getting transferred right into BAU’s backyard, Felicity Huffman will be guest-starring as Dr. Jill Gideon, and there’s <em>speculation</em> that Matthew Gray Gubler will return (he has at least expressed willingness to return). </p>

The showcase led with a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnStS9d2xg&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnStS9d2xg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lengthy cinematic trailer</a></span> introducing the game’s wacky band of misfits, and the internet immediately clocked it as a <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>-esque romp. This was followed with a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jqQJhjf_3o&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jqQJhjf_3o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gameplay trailer</a></span> that showed off an <em>Overwatch</em>-style competitive shooter, and given that it led the showcase and took up a sizable portion of the show, Sony was likely hoping it would garner fanfare from PlayStation’s community. However, the reaction has likely been less enthusiastic than Firewalk and Sony were expecting.<br></p><div data-video-id="191038" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="In Eternights You Press R2 To Hold Hands Just Like IRL" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="191038,191253,195697" data-current="191038"><div><p>In Eternights You Press R2 To Hold Hands Just Like IRL</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191038/191038_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191038/191038_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191038/191038_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191038/191038_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/17148.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>So what is the problem? For one, the hero shooter genre has been oversaturated for almost a decade thanks to games like <em>Overwatch</em> and <em>Apex Legends</em>, so games like <em>Concord </em>and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-trailer-release-date-pc-roster-heroes-1851369240&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-trailer-release-date-pc-roster-heroes-1851369240"><em>Marvel Rivals</em></a></span><em> </em>can feel years late to a trend well past its prime if they don’t do enough to distinguish themselves. With <em>Concord </em>failing to communicate a clear hook that makes it memorable in an oversaturated live-service market, some folks are already dismissive of it, seeing it as another game to add to the pile of genre contenders that will likely launch, flop, and possibly put people in game development out of a job. The comment section on <em>Concord</em>’s two trailers is scathing.</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>“Just call it ‘Modern Audience: The Game’” - @rile_up</p><p>“So many people are gonna lose their jobs over this game....” - @patrickwilliams7582</p><p>“Is this seriously what Sony thinks people want?” - @mrnatak-ic6lj</p><p>“The most shocking thing about the trailer was that Sony left the comments open” - @T.O.Wallee</p></blockquote><p>Once it was established that everyone was going open season on <em>Concord</em>, criticisms were directed at it from every angle. Pushing away with all our might the fact that there is a reactionary group mad the game features a diverse cast, let’s instead focus on the actually worthwhile conversation points sprouting up around the game. The cinematic trailer came under fire for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnStS9d2xg&amp;lc=UgxVWpGJ3FTdhKwsUM94AaABAg&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnStS9d2xg&amp;lc=UgxVWpGJ3FTdhKwsUM94AaABAg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">portraying <em>Concord </em>as something with a narrative throughline</a></span>. Then it became clear it was a competitive shooter with external “vignettes” that would tell the story. After games like <em>Overwatch </em>have <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-missions-campaign-canceled-blizzard-1851345720&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-missions-campaign-canceled-blizzard-1851345720">pushed narrative to the side</a></span> in favor of a live-service competitive game that diminishes its setting, fans are wary of a game that could repeat the failures of its clear inspirations. The format has become tiresome, though we’ve seen so little of <em>Concord</em>’s story elements that there’s a possibility it may integrate those ideas more successfully. </p><p>Some also took <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1d4ylfi/concord_might_have_the_ugliest_characters_designs/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1d4ylfi/concord_might_have_the_ugliest_characters_designs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jabs at its character design</a></span>, which lacks the same recognizable spark of its hero shooter contemporaries. Others criticized what’s widely seen as its derivative nature, stating that it clearly drew inspiration from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1796301790121533550&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1796301790121533550" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">properties like <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em></a></span><em> </em>but lacks the charm. If you’re coming in years late to the hero shooter trend and don’t offer anything new, exciting, or even remotely memorable, it’s going to feel like a disingenuous cash-in.</p><p>Some of the disdain may be rooted in backlash toward Sony’s recent pivots and business decisions. PlayStation had <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-layoffs-london-studio-closure-1851289547&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-layoffs-london-studio-closure-1851289547">company-wide layoffs</a></span> in February and completely shut down <em>Singstar </em>developer London Studio. This came after a concentrated push for more live-service games despite Sony’s efforts in that area having <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/playstation-live-service-delayed-tlou-factions-1851007495&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-live-service-delayed-tlou-factions-1851007495">frequent troubles in development</a></span>, including delays and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-us-online-factions-multiplayer-ps5-naughty-dog-1851101434&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-us-online-factions-multiplayer-ps5-naughty-dog-1851101434">cancelations</a></span>. </p><p>If <em>Concord</em> and all the parts of it people take issue with are the end result of Sony putting millions of dollars into live-service games over the beloved single-player games and IP that have long been synonymous with PlayStation, it’s the video game equivalent of a hapless cashier getting reamed for company policy determined way above her pay grade. Perhaps that’s why the reveal of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-game-playstation-5-ps5-playroom-sequel-1851510119&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-game-playstation-5-ps5-playroom-sequel-1851510119"><em>Astro Bot</em></a></span><em> </em>went over so well, comparatively. The platformer is a sequel to a beloved game that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kratos-aloy-nathan-drake-parappa-playstation-1851512540&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kratos-aloy-nathan-drake-parappa-playstation-1851512540">pays tribute to the best parts of PlayStation history</a></span>, rather than something that portends to a more generic, mass-appeal future for the brand.</p><p>Ultimately, <em>Concord </em>may be better than this State of Play communicates. Marketing is just as capable of undermining a video game as it is generating hype. But unless Sony and Firewalk Studios are able to make a better second impression, this viciousness will likely follow it until it launches on PlayStation 5 and PC on August 23. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[How YouTube’s New Gaming Leak Culture Actually Works]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/how-youtube-leaks-work/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-youtube%E2%80%99s-new-gaming-leak-culture-actually-works.888480/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/how-youtube-leaks-work/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.404media.co/google-leak-reveals-thousands-of-privacy-incidents/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">404 Media</a>, which has allegedly obtained an internal Google database tracking six years of potential privacy and security issues, one employee has been responsible for several leaked Nintendo announcements in the past. But according to our sources, that’s just the tip of the iceberg in this new Google/YouTube leak culture. First, it should be stressed that 404 Media’s report is based on information spanning from 2013 – 2018, but is clearly still an issue today.</p>



<p>A couple of days ago, <a href="https://x.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1796298547647635940" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">I tweeted </a>that YouTube had investigated two occasions (that I know of) when employees breached their contractual agreements by accessing data on the backend. While only one of these investigations was purely gaming-related due to leaking announcements, it’s important to dive into the first instance and how it caused a substantial internal investigation that caused some people to lose their jobs.</p>



<p>The first investigation happened towards the latter end of 2022. The catalyst? A ‘Try not to make me laugh’ video by popular content creator KSI. Back then, KSI would do a weekly YouTube series called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSUFJmtWx-E&amp;ab_channel=JJOlatunji" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">‘Try not to make me laugh’</a> in which if he laughed, he would display an Amazon Gift Card on screen for one of his viewers to redeem. At first, he started at $100 per gift card per laugh and incrementally got higher and higher with each video. In the final video, KSI offered up $1000 per laugh, with the grand total of all the cards exceeding $10,000+ for his fans to redeem. The catch? They were all redeemed before the video went public. </p>



<div><p>The scandal resulted in KSI and his team pressing YouTube, which resulted in Google conducting an internal investigation. According to our sources, who wished to stay anonymous as they were not authorized to talk about the company’s internal processes, the investigation led to some people being fired, even some not privy to the scandal. “Your videos are not just watched for monetization approval,” said one source. “They are watched by employees all the time,” they continued. This included anything private, scheduled, or unlisted: showcases, game announcements, and other footage not intended to see the light of day.</p><p>Of the two I’m aware of, YouTube’s second investigation happened soon after the GTA 6 leak, which, admittingly, could have just been a wild coincidence. After all, it has now become common knowledge among those in the industry that many gaming leaks do come from unlisted, scheduled, or private YouTube videos – and maybe the investigation was already ongoing at this time. Nonetheless, the result probably resulted in disciplinary action for one or more people.</p></div>



<div><p>Whatever the case, though, these investigations have seemingly done nothing to stop it from happening again.</p><p>Sony’s recent State of Play was a big eye-opener for me and the most recent example I can give about how widespread this new YouTube leak culture is. Within around 18 hours of the State of Play being scheduled on YouTube, I had four different individuals send me the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/state-of-play-leaked-may/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">complete game list</a>. Some game names were slightly different from others, likely because of different regions and the rush to jot everything down to be the first, but they were all generally spot on. One such individual even told me that the information was sold to an undisclosed person for a small three-figure amount, who then told him to spread it to more people for validity. </p></div>



<div><p>It is unclear how this will be resolved. Still, repeat investigations are clearly not working, and simply not uploading the content to YouTube before an announcement is a marketing nightmare for publishers. For instance, it’s not ideal for your first glimpse of a game to be in 360p because of YouTube’s shoddy processing times. Then, there are other marketing needs, such as sending the content to marketing partners, content creators, the media, and more.</p><p>But yes, there you have it. That’s how a lot of information is leaked before a reveal, at least to my understanding anyway. After all, it isn’t a coincidence that precise bits of information leak before being revealed in the way that they have been. </p></div>



<p>Why people are simply not being fired for breaking the rules is also a mystery, but perhaps there are so many people who watch this behind-the-scenes content, that it could be impractical to lay that many people off.</p>



<p><em><strong>Datamining and searching for trademarks are also common ways for people to obtain information, and I can discuss them further in the future if requested. But I also want to point readers to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1c1fo93/schreier_an_explanation_of_rumorsreportingsourcing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit post from Jason Schreier</a>, which explains a lot of other ways of sourcing in detail. </strong></em></p>

<p data-characters="327" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you’ve been trying to log into <em>Destiny 2</em>, you’ve likely encountered a significant roadblock. This is due to a crucial server downtime, a necessary step to prepare for the highly anticipated release of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-exotic-armor-is-changing-destiny-2-the-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Final Shape</em></a>. So, if you’re eagerly awaiting to jump in, here’s how long <em>Destiny 2 </em>will be down.</p> <h2 id="h-destiny-2-server-downtime-for-the-final-shape-explained" data-injectable="false">Destiny 2 server downtime for The Final Shape, explained</h2> <p data-characters="217" data-current-count="217" data-injectable="false">Based on the <em>Destiny </em><a href="https://help.bungie.net/hc/en-us/articles/360049199271-Destiny-Server-and-Update-Status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Server and Update Status page</a>, <em>Destiny 2 </em>will be offline until <strong>June 4 at 10 a.m. PT/12 p.m. CT/1 p.m. ET</strong>. That means the server downtime will last around 24 hours, starting on June 3 at 9 a.m. PT.</p> <figure data-current-count="517" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="413" data-current-count="413" data-injectable="true">During this time, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/a-new-player-foray-into-destiny-2-preparing-for-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Destiny 2</em> players</a> won’t be able to log in or participate in activities. An ongoing <em>Destiny </em>maintenance period will also last for a few more hours, ending around 12 p.m. PT on June 4. You’ll still be able to play the game two hours prior, but you may encounter some sign-on issues until the maintenance has concluded. In this case, players may be placed in a queue while it is active.</p>
 <p data-characters="391" data-current-count="391" data-injectable="false">Once <em>Destiny 2’s </em>downtime is up, players can expect the launch of <em>The Final Shape</em>. The DLC drops at the same time and features <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-artifact-perks-coming-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new campaign</a> with an immeasurable number of unique challenges. Pre-loads are available, but be wary of its hefty storage space of more than 100 GB. Considering the size, it’s best to prepare during the downtime, just so you’re ready for launch.</p>

While the SBC is well worth its price in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-perform-the-griddy-ea-fc-24/">EA FC 24</a></em>, the stats on the new Flashback card could have been better. </p>

		<p>Retailer GAME has confirmed that it is ceasing its GAME Rewards and GAME Elite programmes from July 31st. This means after this date those who are part of the Rewards or Elite scheme will lose all points accrued, and will not be able to earn anymore points. Up until July 15th, points can still be earned by Rewards customers. Points will be redeemable up until July 31st.</p>
<p>In an email sent to customers, GAME wrote, <em>“As of 31 July 2024 (“Closure Date”) the GAME ‘Reward’ Programme (“GAME Reward”) and the GAME Elite Membership Scheme shall come to an end, after which GAME Reward and GAME Elite members will no longer be able to earn GAME Reward points on purchases made in GAME stores or online at game.co.uk or redeem any GAME Reward or GAME Elite points ( please see the GAME Reward and Elite closure FAQ’s at https://www.game.co.uk/reward for further information ) remaining on your GAME Reward account.</em></p>


<p><em>You will still be entitled to receive GAME Reward Points as per the terms and conditions on eligible purchases in GAME stores and online at GAME.co.uk but only until 23.59 on 15 July 2024 after which date purchases will not earn you any GAME Reward Points, but you can redeem any GAME Reward Points until the closure date. </em><em>We would strongly urge you to redeem your GAME Reward Points prior to the closure date on purchases in GAME stores or online to avoid disappointment. </em><em>After the closure date the GAME Reward Points will be reset to zero and the GAME Reward account will be closed. You will no longer be able to access it and you will no longer be able to redeem your GAME Reward Points.</em></p>
<p><em>The closure of GAME Elite will also mean the closure of monthly GAME Elite offers and also prize draws and promotions that Elite Members are eligible to enter.</em></p>

<p>This announcement follows on from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/17/game-trade-in-end/">GAME ending video game trade ins earlier this year</a>, marking a massive shift for the once dominant retailer. Over the years, GAME’s fortunes have taken hit after hit. In 2018, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/01/13/game-is-halving-the-rate-at-which-you-can-earn-reward-points/">Game halved the rate at which you could earn Reward Points</a>. Fraser Group took over the company, shuttering many of the stores and moving GAME retail spaces into Sports Direct stores.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/is-league-of-legends-on-xbox-game-pass-riots-way-of-fighting-future</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/is-league-of-legends-on-xbox-game-pass-riots-way-of-fighting-future<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Out of all the games that were added to Xbox Game Pass in 2022, it would probably be safe to say that&nbsp;<em>League of Legends</em>, <em>Valorant</em>, <em>Legends of Runeterra</em>, and <em>Teamfight Tactics</em>&nbsp;stand out the most. While you can point to virtually any other game in the Game Pass catalog and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/pentiment-review">conceive of a target audience</a>, the target audience for&nbsp;<em>Valorant </em>or <em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>on Xbox Game Pass is much less obvious. After all, as affordable as Xbox Game Pass may be, it's still never going to be cheaper than a game that is literally free. This brings up the question of why Riot Games is putting their games on Game Pass to begin with as it seems like a rather redundant move on their part.</p>

<p>Indeed,&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>has had a respectable following for more than a decade.&nbsp;<em>Valorant</em>&nbsp;has been out for more than two years. Generally speaking, Riot's games aren't particularly hardware intensive either as you can play <em>Legends of Runeterra </em>and <em>Teamfight Tactics&nbsp;</em>on your phone. All of these games are free to play too, so the barrier to entry is effectively limited to how much time you have (and how much you are willing to spend on microtransactions).&nbsp;</p>

<p>If anything, it would appear as though Riot is getting the short end of the stick by putting their games on Xbox Game Pass. For example, if you were to play&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>through Xbox Game Pass, you get access to every single champion that is currently in the game as well as day-one access to any upcoming new champions.</p>

<p>Considering that there are at least <a href="https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_champions">160 champions currently in&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_champions">League of Legends</a>,&nbsp;</em>and the cheapest paid champion costs about $2.25 USD, you are looking over $300 worth of champions for the cost of a single $15 monthly subscription. The caveat is that if you want to <a href="https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/11124399294867">buy a skin for a champion, you would need to buy the champion first</a>. Granted, these are all digital goods, so Riot isn't exactly spending any money by giving away these champions.</p>

<p>Of course, Microsoft could've simply offered Riot a mountain of money for all these perks. It's no secret that Microsoft's current goal is to grow the Xbox Game Pass subscriber base and this is the perfect way to gobble up a part of Riot's sizable audience. As for Riot, they might be getting more than cold hard cash, intentionally or otherwise. Sure, some new and returning players might spend some money on skins here and there, but the real benefit for Riot in this partnership with Xbox Game Pass is essentially brand loyalty. Think of it as a form of insurance against any would-be competitors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Take a look at <em>Valorant's </em>Xbox Game Pass perks. Once again, you get access to all existing Agents. The key takeaway though is that you also get day-one access to every new Agent as they're released and a 20% XP boost. <em>League of Legends'&nbsp;</em>perks has the same pattern. The same kind of perks are given for Teamfight Tactics,&nbsp;where you get access to four skins until April, at which point they are replaced by a monthly rotating skin.&nbsp;<em>Legends of Runeterra&nbsp;</em>is the odd one out in that no future content is being granted through Xbox Game Pass.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/valorant.jpg?itok=lnQkT_l5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/valorant.jpg?itok=pHYKRRL5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Let people play as <em>Valorant's </em>Agents to get them to care about <em>Valorant's </em>story, simple as that.</figcaption></figure><p>This would imply that Riot sees the way the wind is blowing when it comes to gaming subscription services in general, especially now that $70 games are the new norm. It's much easier to sell a free-to-play game if you frame it in terms of being able to save money and more importantly, time. Would the average gamer be willing to jump ship to a similar game if they have to grind away for unlocks or pay anything more than $15 per month? Maybe, but they might be less willing. Even if players do leave, Riot can try and pull them back with a new character, making every big update a potential threat to the competition.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Seeing as how virtually every major free-to-play game uses an identical progression system, it would be unsurprising if other games offered their own bonuses on Xbox Game Pass or PlayStation Plus. Hypothetically, let's say that Respawn sees that people quit <em>Apex Legends</em>&nbsp;because it's too much of an effort to unlock Legends. While there's a portion of their audience who is willing to spend real money to unlock Legends, people who quit because they want to spend their time elsewhere likely aren't coming back, which means they aren't going to spend money on the microtransactions that add up, namely cosmetics. Give them the cool stuff for "free" though, and they might form enough of an attachment to the actual game that they'll buy a skin here or there.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In any case, it would be interesting to see what comes of this partnership. The question is will other free-to-play game developers and publishers feel the same way. After all, Riot is indisputably one of the largest and thus most influential entities in the industry and if they think jumping on the game subscription service bandwagon is a good idea then that might very well be the case. Plus it's hard to complain about people getting more game in their game at an affordable price.</p>

It’s <a href="https://modretro.com/products/tetris">a new, fully licensed <em>Tetris</em> game</a> internally developed by Luckey’s team, which features “reimagined versions of the iconic Tetris theme song” and genuine Link Cable multiplayer. </p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->7</p><div><figcaption><em>Actual macro photos of a Chromatic screen.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Images: ModRetro</cite></p></div></div><p>Because yes, the Chromatic has a Link Cable port as well as a 3.5mm headphone jack and USB-C for “lagless” video out. It lasts 24 hours on three standard AA batteries, Luckey tells me. While it’ll probably ship with alkalines, there’ll be an optional lithium-ion pack, too — and he tells me you can even recharge your NiMH AA batteries over USB-C! </p><p>Speaker audio is mono, like the original Game Boys, with a “custom ultra-loud speaker module,” and ModRetro has also partnered with Koss to ship <a href="https://modretro.com/products/porta-pro?variant=47662601765166">color-matched retro Porta Pro headphones</a>.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Palmer Luckey, age 16, with modded GB Pocket.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Speaking of custom, Luckey tells me the whole design is in-house, including the custom screen — which is so bright because it’s based on displays used in aviation. He says ModRetro isn’t doing anything quite so exotic as manufacturing its own chips but that, in general, the team went all out instead of making business savvy decisions. “None of it makes any business sense at all.”</p><p>Compared to the Analogue Pocket, says Luckey, “we are actually authentic”:</p><div><blockquote><p>The color temps are actually right, the clock rate isn’t slightly off, the pixel structure isn’t totally wrong in a way that ruins subpixel aware sprites, etc.</p></blockquote></div><p>He sent me this image to illustrate:</p><div><figcaption><em>”Here is an example - notice how Lapras is garish yellow on Analogue instead of actually matching the GBC color temps, which we did with an all custom display,” writes Luckey.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Palmer Luckey</cite></p></div><p>The handheld isn’t the only thing the ModRetro team will be selling: you can buy original “Chromatic” cartridges with new games, too. Luckey’s <a href="https://modretro.com/blogs/blog/the-future-is-retro">promising a lot there</a>: “all-physical re-releases and remasters of classic Game Boy titles, entirely new IP from incredible indie developers, first-time launches of Game Boy games that were canceled before release, and even some titles that were canceled before the public ever found out about them.”</p><p>The Chromatic handheld doesn’t use ROMs, by the way, not even in a roundabout fashion like the Analogue Pocket. It’s cartridge only, says Luckey, unless you supply your own flashcart.</p><div><figcaption><em>Some of the games on offer.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: ModRetro</cite></p></div><p>Luckey says he’s not sure how long he’ll fund hardware manufacturing, hinting that quantities will be limited — though GameStop will carry an unknown number of them as well. “I am going to make as many as I need to fulfill preorders,” he tells me. “But this thing is too crazy to make forever.” </p><p>“I don’t see this as a way to make money, I see it as the way to make the world’s best tribute to the Game Boy, something that I’ll be proud of for a very long time.”</p><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/21578775/lego-nintendo-game-boy-fan-model-nick-lever-masters">You know me</a>: I’m getting one.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Ubisoft’s <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake</a> has had a rather troubled development cycle, but it seems like Ubisoft is gathering its resources to finally get the project done. Announced back in 2020, the game was originally being developed by former support studios Ubisoft Mumbai and Ubisoft Pune, but reactions to early trailers weren’t exactly positive. It seems Ubisoft brass weren’t impressed either, because the project was <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-ubisoft-montreal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">handed back to Ubisoft Montreal</a> and eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-fully-rebooted/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">completely rebooted</a>.</p>
<p>There have been recent hints that the new Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-not-far-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may actually be progressing</a>, and today it was announced that a new studio is joining the project – Ubisoft Toronto, a team best known for heading up all the recent entries in the Far Cry and Watch Dogs franchises.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Ubisoft Toronto is joining the development of the remake of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time!</p>
<p>We’re excited to rewind time and bring our studio’s creativity, expertise and updated tech to refresh this beloved classic with our partners at <a href="https://twitter.com/UbisoftMTL?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@UbisoftMTL</a>. <a href="https://t.co/kksyihIjKG">pic.twitter.com/kksyihIjKG</a></p>
<p>— Ubisoft Toronto (@UbisoftToronto) <a href="https://twitter.com/UbisoftToronto/status/1797629314059661635?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 3, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p><em>“Ubisoft Toronto is joining the development of the remake of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time! We’re excited to rewind time and bring our studio’s creativity, expertise and updated tech to refresh this beloved classic with our partners at Ubisoft Montreal.”</em></p>
<p>While Ubisoft Toronto typically focuses on open-world games, it seems unlikely that Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time will take that route. That said, according to recent insider reports, the new Sands of Time is <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-details/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">being rebuilt from the ground up</a>…</p>
<p><em>“Fans should forget everything they have heard or seen from the reveal trailer from years ago as the remake is being built completely from scratch. This means that the remake has been rewritten, recaptured in mocap, and more. Although stated otherwise earlier, previous work from Ubisoft Mumbai and Pune isn't being used for the rebooted remake.</em></p>
<p><em>Also, the remake's overhaul is said to offer a more "realistic approach", compared to what was shown in the announcement trailer. Aside from a complete graphical overhaul, animations, combat mechanics and parkour have also been overhauled for the rebooted Sands of Time Remake. Another interesting detail is that Yuri Lowenthal - the actor portraying the prince in the original trilogy and the initial remake - won't be reprising his role in the remake.”</em></p>
<p>Ubisoft has yet to specify a release date or platforms for the new Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. Hopefully, more information is revealed before too long. The franchise has been on the rise recently with the release of the acclaimed Metroidvania, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a>, and the early access launch of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-rogue-prince-of-persia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Rogue Prince of Persia</a>.</p>

  <p id="wR3HAC">Heads up, Chooms! The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/24151491/cyberpunk-edgerunners-mission-kit-cyberpunk-red-announcement">Cyberpunk Edgerunners Mission Kit</a>, the next expansion for Cyberpunk Red, is now available to pre-order. The expansion, inspired by the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23349865/cyberpunk-edgerunners-netflix-review-2077">popular anime</a>, is set to launch on June 24, and can be reserved as either a $14.99 PDF from <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/482282/preorder-cyberpunk-edgerunners-mission-kit?affiliate_id=3095954" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DriveThruRPG</a> or <a href="https://marketplace.roll20.net/browse/bundle/31687/cyberpunk-edgerunners-mission-kit">Roll20 digital kit</a>, or a $34.99 physical release pre-order from <a href="https://talsorianstore.com/collections/cyberpunk/products/cyberpunk-edgerunners-mission-kit">R. Talsorian Games</a>.</p>
<p id="Z4X8gn">The Mission Kit includes the Edgerunners Handbook, a lore book detailing the history of Night City, and biographies of the original Edgerunner crew from the anime. You’ll also find an abridged Rulebook and quickstart guide in addition to <em>The Jacket, </em>a one-shot adventure designed to get your crew right into the action. </p>
<p id="GbaIY6">Both versions of the Cyberpunk: Edgerunners Mission Kit include everything you need to play, including tokens and maps; however, the physical version also comes with a collection of six Edgerunners-themed dice, in addition to printed standees, maps, and tokens to supplement gameplay.</p>

<p id="seyEGg">While the <em>Edgerunners </em>rulebook contains everything you need to make your own characters, the Mission Kit also includes a collection of seven eclectic, pre-generated Edgerunners, complete with full illustrations by Hiroyuki Imaishi, director for the <em>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</em> anime.</p>

<p>Were you lucky enough to score a free copy of Content Warning during its launch promotion? If you were, then you managed to land one of this year’s most interesting multiplayer horror games without paying a single dime. It offers a ton of content, more than a few laughs, and many possibilities moving forward. But is Content Warning coming to PS5 and Xbox?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-content-warning-coming-to-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s">Is Content Warning Coming to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p>Landfall Games, the publisher behind Content Warning, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/content-warning-sells-2-2-million-copies-console-release-possibly-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently revealed</a> that the indie horror game sold a staggering 2.2 million copies and accumulated over 8.8 million players, meaning a lot of free copies went out on day one. In the same thread, they didn’t outright confirm a console release, but they allude to one.</p>



<p>When asked about Content Warning on PS5 or Xbox Series X|S, the studio said, “Never say never,” and left the eyes emoji to those asking about a console release. Again, this isn’t a guarantee. But the publisher and developers seem to want to launch their multiplayer horror game on consoles!</p>



<h6 id="h-related-how-to-get-more-views-in-content-warning">Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/content-warning-how-to-get-more-views-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Get More Views in Content Warning</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-how-many-people-can-play-content-warning">How Many People Can Play Content Warning?</h2>



<p>If you’re playing vanilla Content Warning—with zero mods installed—then you can have four people per game session playing and recording the horrors of the Old World. However, many user-made mods are available that increase the player count exponentially.</p>



<p>I’ve played in servers with twenty people, which led to absolute chaos. We were the monsters invading the underground, not the humans trying to survive. But it was also one of the most fun experiences I’ve had in the game.</p>



<p>That said, it’s unlikely that Content Warning mods will make their way to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. It’s likely too much of a hassle for an indie studio.</p>

Super Earth’s brightest decided the only measured and reasonable way to stamp out the colony was to inject masses of weaponized "dark fluid" deep into the planet’s crust, where it would merge to transform the world into a fledgling black hole.</p><p>Many in the community have taken to social media to celebrate the the birth of their new cosmic child, but others have been left pondering if their latest win will come back to bite them in the long run. Super Earth’s campaigns have an unpleasant habit of accelerating the arrival of an ever greater, previously hidden threat, after all, and some are even questioning whether the dark expanse is even a black hole at all.</p><p>Those unsettled players have pointed out the suspected black hole is missing certain elements seen in its real life counterparts, such as a ring of glowing debris known as an accretion disk or a photon ring. Others have theorised that, black hole or n, it may even be a portal through which a new enemy could emerge.</p><p>Its impossible for anything to emerge from a black hole’s event horizon in real life, of course, but the existence of legions of murder robots, instantaneous travel between star systems, and countless other sci-fi elements have shown that developer Arrowhead Studios and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-hail-joel-the-helldivers-2-developer-steering-the-galactic-war-like-a-dd-dungeon-master">its galaxy master Joel</a> aren't necessarily bound to realism.</p><p>The portal theory seems perfectly plausible in that regard, and even more so when considering the "dark fluid" used to create the black hole was a form of synthesised exotic matter recovered from a technologically advanced alien race called the Illuminate, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers?_gl=1*ypg2kz*_up*MQ..*_ga*MjA3NzA2NTY1NC4xNzE3NDI1Mjk2*_ga_736S6FVMCL*MTcxNzQyNTI5Ni4xLjAuMTcxNzQyNTI5Ni4wLjAuMA..">who featured in the original 2015 Helldivers title</a> but have yet to make an appearance in its sequel. Many in the Helldivers 2 community <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-helldivers-2-players-are-convinced-the-illuminate-are-coming">are adamant the Illuminate's reveal is imminent</a> after the appearance of mysterious blue beams sniping players out of nowhere (and a series of leaks revealing enemy models).</p><p>Joel only knows what will happen next, but for the time being Helldivers will likely be asked to return to Automaton controlled space to win back the planets lost last month. Super Earth scientists are working on a new and improved termicide formula in the meantime, because why learn from the mistakes of the past?</p><p>Anthony is a freelance contributor covering science and video gaming news for IGN.
