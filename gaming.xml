            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> boss Strauss Zelnick said the company is not tempted to put its game on subscription services like Xbox Game Pass on day one because "our decisions are rational".</p>
<p>Talking to our sister site <a href="http://gamesindustry.biz/">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Zelnick said that whilst he accepted "offering a frontline title with a premium price in a subscription service, day and date, will push consumers to that subscription service for at least a period of time", "it won't affect [Take-Two's] decisions [not to offer AAA games on subscription services on day one]".</p>

<p>With "15 immersive core" games on Take-Two's books for 2026 and 2027 - one of which is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>, of course - as well as one indie, five mobile games, and three remasters, Zelnick says it's his company's "job to outperform the industry, and the one way to do that is to generate big hits, and I think we have all the necessary elements to deliver that."</p>
<p>"There are modest tailwinds which are positive," he concludes. "It is our job to outperform the industry, and the only way to do that is to generate big hits, and I think we have all the necessary elements to deliver that."</p>
<p>Yesterday, we reported that Zelnick asked if <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-boss-asks-you-to-give-the-borderlands-movie-a-chance-as-a-lot-of-people-worked-really-hard-on-it">fans could please give the new Borderlands movie "a chance"</a> because "a lot of people worked really hard on it".</p>
<p>Zelnick was asked about the film's less-than-stellar early reviews during its Q1 earnings call, and whilst he called the "look and the feel" of the movie "terrific", Zelnick told investors that its performance "wouldn't have a financial impact" on Take-Two or, indeed, the Borderlands franchise itself.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

After dozens of hours of dealing with ugly fused weapons and broken gear, you finally get the sword of legend. But it’s still far from perfect. While it can’t break, it can lose its power and have to recharge. The Master Sword from the game’s opening prologue doesn’t have that same weakness, though, and players have spent months trying to find a way to get that version instead.  - Ethan Gach <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/zelda-totk-master-sword-unbreakable-glitch-prologue-1851613232&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-totk-master-sword-unbreakable-glitch-prologue-1851613232">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cce55fcd87374460c1431ab3e6264042" data-recommend-id="image://cce55fcd87374460c1431ab3e6264042" data-format="png" data-width="919" data-height="517" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A demonic warrior flashes her cool cosmetics.

		<p>We’re into the final weekend of the Olympics, and there’s always going to be that bittersweet ending to the two week spectacle of sports. All the years of build up and preparation for the athletes, so much joy for the medallists, no doubt mixed with a tinge of missed opportunity for those walking away with a silver, but that can be a massive drive to push on to the next world championship, the next four years to reach the 2028 Olympics in LA.</p>

		<p>QuakeCon 2024 has seen the announcement and launch of a brand new remaster of Doom and Doom II. A newly combined release of the two classic, genre-defining first person shooters, Doom + Doom II also includes a brand new episode called Legacy of Rust, created in collaboration by individuals from id Software, Nightdive Studios and MachineGames.</p>
<p>Doom + Doom II is out now across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, Xbox One, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, PS4, Nintendo Switch and PC – and obviously available via <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Game Pass</a>. It’s a free upgrade across all these platforms for owners of Doom or Doom II, who can still access previously owned versions of these games – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/07/26/doom-doom-ii-doom-3-ps4-switch-xbox-one-eternal-battlemode/">the last remasters arrived in 2019</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="DOOM + DOOM II | Official Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-4-xswoPRpo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Doom + Doom II has been remastered by Nightdive Studios using their powerful cross-platform KEX Engine. This has been the backbone for the studios proliferation of classic game remasters, and has been used for remasters of Doom 64, Quake and Quake II in the last few years.</p>
<p>This enhanced version of these games comes with a newly optimised renderer which pushes resolutions up to 4K and 120fps, depending on the platform and console. There’s also new accessibility options. Deathmatch and co-op play for up to 16 players are available cross-platform – they suggest using room codes to join up – with new rules for level wipes and restarts. Oh, and there’s 4-player split-screen support.</p>

<p>In a similar vein to previous KEX Engine releases, this remaster aims to be an all-encompassing collection, and so it includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>DOOM</li>
<li>DOOM II</li>
<li>Master Levels for DOOM II</li>
<li>TNT: Evilution</li>
<li>The Plutonia Experiment</li>
<li>No Rest for the Living</li>
<li>Sigil</li>
<li>Legacy of Rust (a new episode created in collaboration by individuals from id Software, Nightdive Studios and MachineGames)</li>
<li>A new Deathmatch map pack featuring 25 new maps</li>
</ul>
<p>The Deathmatch map pack includes community creations from from Luis “DX-Chain” Armacanqui, Luca Ciriaco, Ralph “Ralphis” Vickers, Matthew “RottKing” Cibulas, Colton “Arrowhead” Murchison, Andrew “Saar” Bouvé &amp; Joshua “tokyopunchout” Boyle. This new pack compliments the existing 18, bringing the total Deathmatch levels to 43.</p>
<p>All in all, it’s great to see this remaster made, considering some of the fussy awkwardness that surrounded the 2019 remasters – things like the 35fps frame limit, which was patched out months later, and the controversial Bethesda.net requirement, which was also removed, and doesn’t affect this new launch.</p>
<p>This is not the only Doom-y announcement to come out of QuakeCon 2024, and on the complete other end of the series’ timescale, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/09/doom-eternal-gets-official-pc-mod-support/">Doom Eternal now has official mod tools</a> via a PC mod beta. That should tide series fans over until the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/09/doom-the-dark-ages-announced-with-a-gory-trailer-and-its-coming-to-ps5/">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-campaign-leaked/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-black-ops-6-campaign-cutscenes-leak-online.949935/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-campaign-leaked/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>The entirety of Black Ops 6’s campaign has been leaked online over two months before the games official release.</p>



<p>The campaign has been uploaded to X (formerly Twitter) by user @Kivikou. According to our sources and rumours circulating the internet, the campaign cutscenes were extracted from the BETA build of Black Ops 6, which began to leak earlier this week. You can watch the cutscenes below with the catch that it does not have audio.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>According to our estimates, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-hundreds-of-people-playing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hundreds of people have already gained access to Black Ops 6</a> via jailbroken PlayStation 4 consoles. Some users have resorted to uploading the content online, with Activision beginning to DMCA the content and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-c-and-d/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issue cease-and-desists to the most prolific offenders</a>.</p>



<p>The campaign leak marks another huge blow to the developers behind Black Ops 6. So far, the entire BETA build, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-all-achievements-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game’s achievements</a>, and now the entirety of the campaign’s cutscenes.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 zombies are seemingly the only game mode that has yet to be compromised, but with data miners continuing to extract and find data, it could only be a matter of time before that game mode is also leaked.</p>



<p>Speaking with several Black Ops 6 developers, they are understandably upset and frustrated over the large amount of leaks, which is an unprecedented amount for Call of Duty. One developer told me about the situation, “It really sucks to see our big reveal ruined like this, we were all excited to show it off in a big and special way.” Black Ops 6 multiplayer is set to be officially&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-to-watch-codnext/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed at the end of August in a CODNext event</a>, which will be prior to the Black Ops 6 BETA.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is set to launch on October 25 on the PlaysTation4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, and PC.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-40k-boarding-actions-compendium-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warhammer-40k-boarding-actions-compendium-review.949926/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-40k-boarding-actions-compendium-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>First released as part of the <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-400000-kill-team-gallowfall-review">Kill Team Gallowdark</a></em> season, and then followed up in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-40k-arks-of-omen-abaddon-review">Arks of Omen</a> series of books for <em>Warhammer 40,000</em>, Boarding Actions takes the open battlefields of the 41st millennium and trades them for the close confines of inter-spaceship fighting. Initially, the rules for this version of the <em>40K</em> game were spread over the 5 Arks of Omen books, which released before the Leviathan box which kicked off 10th Edition, the current edition of the <em>Warhammer 40K</em> rules. The Boarding Actions rules have now been updated, and released in a collated version of their own book. In this article, we'll take a look at the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40K</em> Boarding Actions Compendium, see what it contains, and how Boarding Actions plays.</p>


<p>The <em>Warhammer 40K</em> Boarding Actions Compendium is a collection of all the Boarding Actions rules from the Arks of Omen books, updated for use with <em>Warhammer 40K 10th Edition</em>. The book contains:</p>
<ul><li>All the rules for Boarding Actions and the rules adaptions from the core <em>40K</em> rules needed to use the system</li>
<li>A huge amount of missions including balanced competitive missions, narrative missions, a linked campaign to play through, multiplayer missions, and the unique dark depths missions, where players select their own board half and link it with their opponent's selection</li>
<li>55 Detachment rules for mustering your <em>40K</em> force as Boarding Actions uses unique rules with limited unit selections (not everything fits in a space hulk). Most armies have at least 2 detachments options, some 3 and daemons have 5! My preference is the Adeptus Astartes Pilum Strike Team, where I can make the best use of my Raven Guard Phobos Marines</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/40k-boarding-actions-3.jpg?itok=nlvHJXhw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/40k-boarding-actions-3.jpg?itok=QRm1y9gH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>To use the Boarding Actions rules, you need a copy of the <em>Warhammer 40K</em> Boarding Actions Scenery set.</figcaption></figure><h2>What Do I Need To Use The Warhammer 40K Boarding Actions Compendium?</h2>
<p>To use the Warhammer 40K Boarding Actions Compendium, you will need:</p>
<ul><li><em>Warhammer 40K </em>Rulebook</li>
<li><em>Warhammer 40K</em> Boarding Actions Compendium (for the Boarding Actions rules, missions, and detachment rules for your force)</li>
<li>The Codex for your chosen faction and the miniatures for them</li>
<li>A set of the <em>Warhammer 40K</em> Boarding Actions Scenery (or 2 sets from the Kill Team Gallowdark Season)
<ul><li>If you want to use the Breaching Operations Missions, you will also need a set of the Killzone Upgrade Soulshackle</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Measuring tool, dice, and tokens</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/40k-boarding-actions-2.jpg?itok=ngLMQ2ST 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/40k-boarding-actions-2.jpg?itok=MyoXgPxT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Boarding Actions feature tight often point-blank combat.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Are The Boarding Actions Missions?</h2>
<p>Boarding Actions completely change the way that <em>40K</em> is played. You're limited to 500 points and the restrictions that your selected detachment gives you. For example, the Adeptus Sororitas Penitents and Pilgrims detachment can only take a Priest, Arco-Flagellants, and Repentia Squads.</p>
<p>There are also several new and slightly modified actions:</p>
<ul><li>Set overwatch, allowing a unit to fire after an enemy unit moves&nbsp;or when a hatch is opened</li>
<li>Set to defend, which adds one to a unit's hit rolls when in melee</li>
<li>Secure site, used to capture objectives</li>
<li>Operate hatchway, to open the door units in the scenery walls (nearby enemy models can resist opening and closing hatches, which results in a roll-off adding the strength of the two opposing fighters as they fight over the door)</li>
</ul><p>Boarding actions are fast-paced, tight, action-filled battles, that add a new challenge to creating and piloting your chosen army. I like that you get stuck in with the enemy, and the walls of the scenery gets rid of that sometimes oppressive turn 1 shooting phase that can decimate your army in open terrain.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/40k-boarding-actions-4.jpg?itok=kjcs3-XB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/40k-boarding-actions-4.jpg?itok=r3BzJmwK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Boarding Actions features restricted force selection lists, detailed in the Detachments rules for your chosen faction.</figcaption></figure><h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On The&nbsp;Warhammer 40K Boarding Actions Compendium?</h2>
<p>Boarding Actions themselves are a lot of fun and mainly being a&nbsp;<em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;player, it's a great progression into a different side of <em>40K</em>. I played a lot of the previous edition of <em>40K</em> with Boarding Actions, and having all the rules and missions, along with the updated detachments in a single book is a great step.&nbsp;The points and troop choice limits change up force selection and brings the focus into short punchy firepower and melee.</p>
<p>It's great to see each faction (except the Imperial and Chaos Knights as they don't fit) get a few different detachment options, this adds some variety in the way they play, as the 500-point and limited units does restrict the optimum or meta force within the detachment. The forces are all thematic, which makes for some great Boarding Actions games (Infestation Swarm vs Terminator Assault anyone?).</p>
<h2>Should I Buy Warhammer 40K Boarding Actions Compendium?</h2>
<p>To use the<em> 40K</em> Boarding Actions Compendium, you need to invest in the Boarding Actions Scenery Set, and the missions themselves take a lot more time than you may be used to for 500-point games to link all the walls together and get them set up according to the mission. The effort is worth it, but if you're looking for quick games, or don't want to invest in the scenery set, then Boarding Actions might not be for you.&nbsp;</p>

Boarding Actions themselves are a lot of fun and mainly being a&nbsp;Kill Team&nbsp;player, it's a great progression into a different side of 40K. I played a lot of the previous edition of 40K with Boarding Actions, and having all the rules and missions, along with the updated detachments in a single book is a great step.&nbsp;The points and troop choice limits change up force selection and brings the focus into short punchy firepower and melee.

                <p>Though wireless game controllers have been the norm for many years now, some specialty controllers like racing wheels haven't cut the cord. But there's at least one upcoming racing wheel that is giving wireless connectivity a try. Hori is releasing a new wireless edition of its Apex Racing Wheel, which <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HORI-Racing-Wheel-Apex-Playstation-5/dp/B09PX6GHJ7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">initially released as a wired wheel in 2022 for $120</a>. The wireless Hori Apex is officially licensed by Sony and is compatible with PS5, PS4, and PC.

If you do need to plug it in, it comes with 6.6ft charging cable so you can keep racing while you refuel the controller. For wireless connectivity, it uses a dongle that plugs directly into your PlayStation or PC, and it has an effective range of up to 32 feet.</p><p>Other features include paddle shifters to make shifting easier, full-size foot pedals, 270-degree rotation, and clamps to secure it to your table or desk. It also has regular inputs, including PlayStation face buttons, D-pad, and four additional face buttons instead of traditional triggers and shoulder buttons.</p><p>Despite releasing over two years ago, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HORI-Racing-Wheel-Apex-Playstation-5/dp/B09PX6GHJ7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wired Hori Apex</a> remains one of the most popular entry-level racing wheels for PlayStation. It currently holds a 4.3/5 user average, based on over 3,000 reviews, on Amazon.</p></div>                      </div><p>If you are looking for a more serious piece of kit, there are some solid (wired) options out there. Currently <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-motor-Feedback-Responsive-PlayStation/dp/B00Z0UWWYC?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><strong>on sale at Amazon for $230 (was $300), the</strong> </a><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-motor-Feedback-Responsive-PlayStation/dp/B00Z0UWWYC?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Logitech G29</a></strong> offers arguably the best performance for the price. It's currently on sale for $230 (was $300). Also compatible with PC, PS5, and PS4, the G29 has a premium design with durable materials and features built-in force feedback for added realism. The 900-degree wheel rotation is also one of its best features, as it allows you to feel like you're really swinging your digital vehicle around tight corners.</p><p>Alternatively, the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thrustmaster-T300-RS-Racing-Wheel-PlayStation/dp/B01M1L2NRL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gran Turismo-themed Thrustmaster T300 RS</a></strong> for PlayStation and PC is another standout wheel, but it holds a lofty $450 price tag. Great for fans of racing sims, the T300 RS contains a dual-belt system in its brushless motor and has proprietary magnetic technology for optimal wheel precision.</p><p>The $400 <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thrustmaster-Magnetic-Shifters-Information-playstation-5/dp/B08Z5CX6V2?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Thrustmaster T248P</a></strong> is another high-performance racing wheel, and this one places a greater emphasis on customization. It's newer than the T300 RS and it might be more appealing as it has a built-in race dashboard, 25 action buttons, magnetic paddle shifters, and you can even drive stick with an optional TH8S shifter.</p><p>On the budget side, the aforementioned Hori Apex wired model is a solid choice, but there's also the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thrustmaster-T80-Racing-Wheel-playstation-4/dp/B00JDYMQ9C?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Thrustmaster T80</a></strong> for $100 (was $110) that's worth checking out. Like all of the other racing wheels mentioned above, the T80 is officially licensed by Sony.</p><p>Nintendo Switch owners looking for a racing wheel for Mario Kart should <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hori-Nintendo-Switch-Mario-Racing-Wheel/dp/B01C6XAO7M?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">check out Hori's duo of officially licensed wheels with Mario Kart themes</a>.

                <p>Humble Choice is technically a membership program for $12/month, but in practice, you can take view it much like Humble's regular slate of game bundles. That's because once you claim the eight free games each month, they will remain in your Steam library even if you cancel your subscription.. August 2024's Humble Choice lineup includes several big name games like Sifu, High on Life, and Gotham Knights, as well as lesser-known gems like Diluvian Ultra and Astral Ascent. Once you <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-14555742%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fmembership&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fhumble-choice-august-2024-pc-game-subscription%2F1100-6525599%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sign up for $12/month Humble Choice membership</a>, you'll be able to instantly claim all eight games and add them to your Steam library.</p><p>Here's a look at the full Humble Choice lineup for August 2024. Considering all these games would <strong>regularly cost you $240</strong>, that's a remarkably good deal. Seven of the games have received verified or playable badges for Steam Deck from Valve, and Diluvian Ultra, based on Steam user reviews, works on Steam Deck after rebinding the controls.</p><h2>Humble Choice August 2024 Games</h2><ul><li>Sifu (Steam Deck Verified)</li><li>High on Life (Steam Deck Verified)</li><li>Gotham Knights (Steam Deck Playable)</li><li>Blacktail (Steam Deck Verified)</li><li>Astral Ascent (Steam Deck Verified)</li><li>Diluvian Ultra </li><li>Universe for Sale (Steam Deck Verified)</li><li>This Means Warp (Steam Deck Playable)</li></ul><p>As a bonus, you'll also get a 1-month trial of DC Universe Infinite, which will allow you to check out digital comics from the DC catalog.</p><p>Gotham Knights may not have pulled in the best reviews, but it's certainly a nice addition to this month's Humble Choice for those who have wanted to try it. Sifu is arguably the highlight of the bundle, as our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sifu-review-i-know-kung-fu/1900-6417823/" data-ref-id="1900-6417823">review</a> gave the martial arts brawler a 9/10 for its methodical and challenging combat, unique aging mechanic, and heaps of replayability. If you're a fan of Rick and Morty, Squanch Games' High On Life uses the same brand of zany humor. The colorful first-person shooter features talking guns as companions and an interconnected world that has some metroidvania elements.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4348349-humblechoice.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4348349" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4348349-humblechoice.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4348349"></a><figcaption>Humble Choice for August 2024</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4348349-humblechoice.jpg"></figure><p>While your subscription is active, you can access the Humble Vault. This is where you'll find 50 DRM-free indie games which rotate out each month. So if you decide to stay subscribed to Humble Choice, you'll have plenty of titles to keep you busy.

The new PS5 controller features shiny blue grips and buttons inspired by Astro’s signature blue accents, along with a pair of gawking blue eyes on the touch pad. It also sports some subtle, carved lines on both handles, giving the controller a bit of a sci-fi vibe.</p><p>The distinctions stop there, though. The limited edition <em>Astro Bot </em>model touts the same robust compatibility and battery life as your standard DualSense Wireless Controller, along with the same adaptive triggers, motion controls, and haptics. That being said, Team Asobi has supposedly added <em>a ton</em> of new interactions between the controller and the next <em>Astro Bot </em>game, allowing you to feel a wider variety of textures and surfaces while giving power-ups a more distinct feel. The original <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549072/astros-playroom-ps5-review-dualsense-controller"><em>Astro’s Playroom</em></a> felt like a glorified tech demo, and if <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/19/24180304/summer-game-fest-2024-best-games">our hands-on time with <em>Astro Bot</em></a><em> </em>is any indication, the sequel will follow suit.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/9/24216962/d23-2024-all-the-biggest-trailers-and-news"><h2>D23 2024: all the biggest trailers and news out of Disney’s biennial showcase</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/10/24217307/susan-wojcicki-youtube-ceo-google-exec-dies"><h2>Long-time Google exec Susan Wojcicki has died at 56</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/9/24216637/google-photos-collections-library-update-ios-android"><h2>Google Photos’ Library is dead — say hello to Collections</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/9/24217008/signal-blocked-venezuela-russia"><h2>Signal has been blocked by Venezuela and Russia</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/9/24216181/apple-eu-app-store-services-fee-external-links"><h2>Apple adds nearly endless 20 percent fee for developers in latest EU update</h2></a><hr></li></ol></div></div></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I’d not go that far, but a pack of foxes can quickly kill you if they show up at the wrong time, like after a fight or when you are low on ammo.</p><p>Another positive change is the reduction in how much rad damage you get per second when swimming around in the game’s water. Previously it was an incredibly high 250 rads a second, which basically meant you’d be dead any time you slipped into water. Now, <em>London’s</em> water only inflicts 169 rads a second, which is still enough that you should be careful, but not enough to instant kill you if you slip off a platform. </p><p>These all seem like good changes to me and I’m excited to jump back into <em>Fallout: London </em>soon. Hopefully, it will stop crashing on me, too. Here are the full patch notes for this update:</p><hr><h2 id="h16114"><a id=""></a>Quest Fixes:</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>“Broken Angel”</strong> —Fixed issue with how the player’s health is handled after the train crash, which disproportionately lowered the max HP of characters with already high health or endurance level, when it should have lowered the player’s <em>current</em> HP instead. </li><li>Since the early-game balance was accidentally built around this bug, we have made the effects of the “Lab Rat” and “Railway Spine” afflictions more serious (though it will still be slightly easier).</li><li><strong>“Charybdis” </strong>— Added The Ferryman to the PlayerFriendFaction to allow a few accidental hits.

<p>Fortnite continues to hold its ground as one of the biggest games in competitive esports. With massive prize pools and large-scale tournaments, the Battle Royale continues to reach high numbers within the esports world. But with so many competitors making up the esports scene, who is considered the best Fortnite player of all time?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-greatest-fortnite-player-of-all-time">The Greatest Fortnite Player Of All Time</h2>



<p>How does someone determine who is the best Fortnite esports player of all time? Many factors come into consideration, but the main two are:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Prize earnings</strong></li>



<li><strong>Placements</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>With various high-paying tournaments and many big events being held in the Fortnite ecosystem, many competitors have kept their names at the top of the list. But only <strong>one </strong>Fortnite player can be considered the greatest of all time.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-best-fortnite-player-ever">The Best Fortnite Player Ever</h2>



<p>The best Fortnite player of all time would be Kyle “<strong>Bugha</strong>” Giersdorf. With over $3 million in prize earnings, Bugha has continued to keep his name at the top ever since his World Cup victory back in 2019. The player certified himself as the Fortnite G.O.A.T. after his first-place back then, but continued to place high in various other FNCS events and more throughout the years later.</p>









<p>Bugha is a 3x FNCS champion, making him one of the top competitors within the series. The creator has been seen competing alongside other big competitors such as Clix, Mero and more.</p>



<p>The gamer continues to prove himself within the Fortnite world, competing at the 2022 Invitational, 2023 Grands and more. </p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-honorable-mentions">Honorable Mentions</h3>



<p>There are still quite a few other Fortnite competitors that are not too far behind Bugha when it comes to being the best Fortnite player of all time. </p>



<p><strong>Here are a few honourable mentions:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Clix</li>



<li>Arkham</li>



<li>EpikWhale</li>



<li>BenjyFishy</li>



<li>Mongraal</li>



<li>Queasy</li>



<li>Dukez</li>



<li>Mero</li>



<li>Edgey</li>



<li>Khanada</li>



<li>MrSavage</li>



<li>Th0masHD</li>



<li>Veno</li>



<li>Kami</li>



<li>Setty</li>
</ul>









<p>Fortnite continues to be one of the best esports, meaning, we could see a different face dethrone Bugha as the greatest someday. Who do you think it could be?</p>

                <p>This week has already been one of Fortnite's most eventful ever after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-battle-pass-and-paradigm-skin-mistakes-are-the-latest-of-many-shop-problems/1100-6525585/" data-ref-id="1100-6525585">the Paradigm goof in the item shop</a> and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-ends-exclusivity-for-future-battle-passes/1100-6525606/" data-ref-id="1100-6525606">changes to battle pass exclusivity</a>. And there's still more excitement to come. We have a big timer on the battle royale map counting down to something on Saturday, which will be followed by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/watch-a-d23-presentation-about-fortnite-x-disney-get-a-free-wolverine-themed-back-bling/1100-6525630/" data-ref-id="1100-6525630">a major presentation about the future of Disney's collaborations with Fortnite</a> from D23 later in the evening, With everything going on, it can be easy to forget that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fall-guys-invades-fortnites-battle-royale-modes/1100-6525545/" data-ref-id="1100-6525545">Fall Guys finally entered the Fortnite ecosystem</a> this week.</p><p>And to be fair, this is only the early stages of Fall Guys' integration into Fortnite--it would be more accurate to say that you can play Fall Guys-style mini-games in Fortnite, at least for now. The most noticeable aspect of this being the limited-timeFall Guys obstacle course in the sky above Classy Courts in the battle royale map. You drop near the Courts, interact with the bean statue, and play a Fall Guys course for loot.</p><p>But you're racing the clock, not the other players--the faster you get through it, the better your loot will be when you return to the island. When other players are around, you do get some classic Fall Guys shenanigans, but it's not the same as a direct competition against other people, like the real Fall Guys offers.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4348269-fortnitexfallguyskeyart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4348269" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4348269-fortnitexfallguyskeyart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4348269"></a><figcaption>The first phase of Fortnite x Fall Guys is underway.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4348269-fortnitexfallguyskeyart.jpg"></figure><p>Likewise, the creative maps that have been put together by Fall Guys developers at Mediatonic are approximations of Fall Guys games that have been re-imagined in a Fortnite way. Tumbly Towers, for example, is just another creative map where you have to climb a big towe--only now with traditional bean physics. The Fortnite version of Hex-a-Gone is a re-engineered version of the mini-game in which the platforms respawn after a few seconds (you're scored according to how many platforms you cause to disappear by walking on them) so as to make the rounds longer and allow them to be joinable mid-match.</p><p>All this stuff is <em>like</em> Fall Guys, but it's hardly a replacement for the real thing without the game-show structure. While I suspect Fall Guys will eventually be integrated all the way into Fortnite, Epic and Mediatonic will have to work out a couple of obstacles. And these obstacles are, frankly, so significant that it might take a while for all of this to come together.</p><p>The first issue is that these creative islands aren't going to cut it. It doesn't seem as though the current UEFN tools are able to support the multi-round structure of the game. Fall Guys needs to be a full additional mode on the same level as Fortnite Festival, Lego Fortnite and Rocket Racing, and that takes time. Since Epic usually holds its cards close to the vest, there's not enough information to speculate about a timeline on that, but we can hope it's saving it for the Chapter 6 launch, presumably coming in December.</p><p>That this first part of the Fall Guys rollout in Fortnite was delayed multiple times before it actually happened--this was supposed to be introduced much earlier in the summer--may not be the best sign that a full integration will happen in the next few months, though.</p><p>The other issue is what to do with Fall Guys cosmetics. Right now, nothing ports over between Fall Guys and Fortnite, and when you're playing in a Fall Guys map within Fortnite, it simply converts the skin you're wearing into a bean person. But Fall Guys has a massive number of its own cosmetics, and bringing those over isn't a simple prospect because Falls Guys cosmetics don't work like Fortnite ones do.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4348270-jonesybeanfallguysfortnite.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4348270" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4348270-jonesybeanfallguysfortnite.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4348270"></a><figcaption>Fortnite's Jonesy and his bean version</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4348270-jonesybeanfallguysfortnite.jpg"></figure><p>In Fall Guys, you choose your pants, shirt, hat, and more separately, whereas Fortnite uses head-to-toe skins that determine your entire appearance. Fall Guys in Fortnite would need its own section in the locker for customizing your bean. Some collaboration cosmetics, like Godzilla, are probably going to have to be left behind during this process, but as Epic has done with its drip feed of Rocket League's cross-game cosmetics, they wouldn't need to port everything all at once.</p><p>Despite the obstacles, it seems inevitable now that Fall Guys will end up as another Fortnite game-within-a-game someday. There are so many different sorts of passes in the game now that tossing the Fall Guys season pass in the mix probably wouldn't be that big a deal, and Epic and Mediatonic have absolutely nailed the gameplay feel of Fall Guys. The base is there, and ready to rock. Now, we just need the rest of it. Fingers crossed that it won't take too long.</p>
