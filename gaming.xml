            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-releasing-updated-dungeons-dragons-2024-srd-at-end-of-month<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast is releasing a <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> 2024 SRD. This updated document, officially titled the SRD 5.2, will allow creators to publish TTRPG content using the 2024 ruleset of the popular fantasy TTRPG.</p>

<h2>The Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024 SRD Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official post on <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/1949-coming-april-22-publish-your-own-creations-using#what-s-changing-from-srd-5-1-to-srd-5-2" rel="nofollow">D&amp;D Beyond</a>, Wizards of the Coast announced the publication of the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024</em> SRD. According to the post, the SRD will be released under a Creative Commons license and will coexist alongside the SRD 5.1 document for <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Fifth Edition.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dungeons-dragons-2024-vecna-artwork.jpg?itok=i0h-SmMo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dungeons-dragons-2024-vecna-artwork.jpg?itok=6h0LpIK7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The post then detailed what will be included in the SRD. Unlike the notorious OGL debacle, the SRD allows third-party developers to make material using the rules material without paying a fee to Wizards of the Coast. In addition, since both SRDs are in Creative Commons, it provides a legally binding promise that the essential rules of D&amp;D are free to use, change, and build upon forever.</p>

<p>With this SRD's publication you can, irrevocably and in perpetuity, create and publish material for both Fifth Edition Dungeons &amp; Dragons and Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024.</p>

<p>The post also confirms that Wizards of the Coast will be releasing a Conversion Guide for creators who want to update their work to be compatible with the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024</em> SRD.</p>

<p>Lastly, Wizards of the Coast confirmed the SRD will be routinely updated to include any and all errata for <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024</em>. The SRD will be updated accordingly to match these changes.</p>

<p>The <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024</em> SRD was initially announced in <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dungeons-dragons-2024-srd-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">May 2024</a>. This announcement was made alongside the updated core rulebooks as part of the fantasy TTRPG's 50th anniversary. These Core Rulebooks were overseen by industry leads <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/christopher-perkins-retires-from-wizards-of-coast-after-28-years-working-on-dungeons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Christopher Perkins</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/jeremy-crawford-game-director-of-dungeons-dragons-is-leaving-wizards-of-ghost" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Jeremy Crawford</a>. Both of them have recently announced their departure from Wizards of the Coast.</p>

<p>The <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> 2024 SRD will be released on April 22.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xboxs-stream-your-owned-games-to-console-feature-now-available-to-all-via-game-pass-ultimate.1166217/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/xboxs-stream-your-owned-games-to-console-feature-now-available-via-game-pass-ultimate<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Following months of Xbox Insider testing, all Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers can now stream a "select" number of their owned games to Xbox Series X/S or Xbox One consoles, without needing to install them first. It's one of several Xbox features launching in April.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft first discussed giving Xbox players the ability to stream their owned games back in 2019, but the feature suffered multiple delays. It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-subscribers-can-now-stream-select-games-from-their-own-library-via-cloud-gaming">finally arrived last November</a>, but was only available through a limited number of platforms - namely TVs and via browsers on supported devices such as tablets, smartphones, and Meta Quest headset. A month later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-insiders-can-now-play-select-games-they-own-on-their-console-using-cloud-streaming">streaming to Xbox consoles was introduced to Insider testing</a>, and it's now available to everyone - provided they have a Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription, at least.
</p>
<p>
The feature's arrival means all Ultimate members can now stream games outside of those included in the Game Pass library, but only if they appear on Microsoft's list of supported titles. At present, "100+" games are compatibile with the feature, and more are set to be added over time. Recent additions include Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage Tape 2, Wanderstop, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disney-epic-mickey-rebrushed">Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed</a> - with the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/play/gallery/buy-and-stream">full list available on the Xbox website</a>. 
</p>
<p>
To begin using the feature, Game Pass Ultimate subscribers should fire up their console and navigate to My games &amp; apps &gt; Full library &gt; Owned Games. All supported titles include a cloud badge on their game page, and streaming is started by selecting the game and choosing the Play with Cloud Gaming option. It's also possible to begin streaming directly from the Store app after purchasing a compatible game.
</p>
<p>
Alongside owned game streaming, April's Xbox update brings a number of other improvements and additions to console. Xbox's 'Free up space' screen, for instance, now highlights duplicate copies of games and games that players no longer have access to, and Microsoft has introduced new Game hubs to Xbox consoles too.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, Xbox remote play has seen changes, with Microsoft removing the feature from the Xbox app on mobile and instead requiring players to access it from their mobile device's browser, which the company insists will "make it easier for our teams to optimise the streaming experience and build new features". The change will also "soon" bring remote play to more devices, including Samsung Smart TVs, Amazon Fire TV devices, and Meta Quest headsets. 
</p>
<p>
And finally, Microsoft is updating its Xbox app on iOS and Android so players can buy games and add-on content, join Game Pass, and redeem Perks directly in-app. The changes will initially be available to beta users before launching for everyone via the Google Play Store on Android devices and the Apple Store on iOS. More <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/04/16/xbox-april-update-buy-games-xbx-app-stream-your-own-game-console/">details an be found in Microsoft's blog post</a>.

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-talos-principle-reawakened-launches-on-april-10-for-playstation-5-xbox-series-pc/">The Talos Principle: Reawakened</a> came with a new expansion for players to dig their puzzle teeth into called In the Beginning, on top of everything else in the remaster.</p>
<p>The 18 puzzles in the new expansion are some of the toughest in the entire Talos Principle series, which is a credit to developer Croteam and the Talos Principle community since 16 of those 18 puzzles were designed <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=31026X886738&amp;isjs=1&amp;jv=15.7.1&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwccftech.com%2Fhow-to%2Fthe-talos-principle-reawakened-in-the-beginning-eclipse-puzzle-guide%2F&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F2806640%2Fview%2F519709875052217858&amp;xs=1&amp;xtz=240&amp;xuuid=856e40b29b36265e272b3ed9bb5c7e57&amp;xjsf=other_click__auxclick%20%5B2%5D">in collaboration with members of the game's community</a>.</p>
<p>This guide will walk you through completing the Flying Cubes puzzle in the Egypt section of the In the Beginning expansion in The Talos Principle: Reawakened.</p>
<h2>The Talos Principle: Reawakened - In the Beginning - Flying Cubes Puzzle Guide</h2>
<p>Flying Cubes is a fun puzzle until it's suddenly not, and you're stuck trying to fit the last piece of it together so you can walk out of the puzzle area with your tetromino in tow. 3/4 of the puzzle is relatively easy for any Talos Principle veteran to solve. It's that last bit that takes a little extra finagling you might not immediately think of.</p>
<p>If you just want a hint, I'll say that crossing the beams is your friend here. If you want the solution, read on.</p>
<h3>Phase One</h3>
<p>As in many Talos Principle puzzles, you first need to acquire all the tools you need to solve the rest of the puzzle.</p>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>After entering the puzzle area, look immediately to your left and climb the ladder, where you'll find a jammer and a pressure switch. Grab the jammer, step on the switch, and watch a cube fly through the air onto another pressure switch. Now you understand where the puzzle gets its name and the final objective. You need to get four boxes to fly through the air, land on the four pressure switches, and open the tetromino gate.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Jammer in hand, walk off the ledge, fall back to the ground, and then head further into the rest of the puzzle area, where you'll see two blue barrier shields, one to your left and one in front of you. Use the jammer on the one to your left. Walk past the barrier you just jammed, and you'll see the other two items you need to solve the puzzle. One connector is just out in the open, and another is trapped behind a blue barrier shield.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Use the connector out in the open to free the trapped one by connecting the blue beam with the blue node that turns off the barrier trapping the other connector. Once the shield is down, grab the connector. For simplicity, from here on, I'll be saying C1 for connector 1 and C2 for connector two.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Place C1 on the pressure switch that sits immediately in front of the red laser and connect it to the red beam. Grab C2 and connect it to C1 and the other two red nodes in your immediate vicinity. One of those nodes will make your jammer redundant, as they keep the same shield barrier off. Now you can pick up the jammer and bring it to the other side of the barrier so that you have the jammer, C1, and C2 on the same side of the barrier.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Phase Two</h3>
<p>All right, at this point, you have all the tools you need for the puzzle in one place. As you read through the rest of this guide, you'll see that you can do these next parts in whatever order you want, but the way I'm going to lay it out is that you'll do the most confusing part first, so you can breeze through everything else.</p>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>You'll notice that the red nodes you have lasers connected to are both keeping shield barriers off. Take the jammer and walk it across the opposite side of the far shield barrier, the one that leads to a corner of the puzzle area, where you'll find two fans blocking your path to a box and a blue laser behind a window connecting to a blue node that keeps one of the fans operational. Use the jammer to redundantly keep the same shield barrier down that the red laser is already disabling. Make sure you're using it on the inside of the puzzle area with the fans and the box, so you can walk both C1 and C2 to where the jammer is, as you'll need them both for these next steps.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Pick up C1, connect it to the far red node, and place it on the opposite side of the wall where it would directly clash with the blue beam keeping one of the fans on.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Pick up C2 and connect it to where the blue beam is coming from and C1. When you put it down, you'll create a loop that cuts off the beam keeping one of the fans on.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab the jammer, and jam the other fan so you can grab the box with both fans turned off. Use the jammer and both connectors to bring the box to the main puzzle area by going through the same steps you used to get to the box in the first place. Then use the jammer to turn off the shield barrier at the top of the stairs.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Walk the box to the top of the stairs and place it directly in front of the fan before stepping on the pressure switch to the right of the fan to activate it. This will send the box flying, where it will land on one of the four pressure switches, which will open the gate to the tetromino.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Phase Three</h3>
<p>Grabbing that box and getting it to its pressure switch final destination took me the longest to figure out and is the most confusing part of this puzzle. Everything from here on out is pretty simple and also pretty easy to spot now that you've been around the whole of the puzzle area.</p>

<ul>
<li>Use the jammer to disable the shield barrier on the left side of the main puzzle area, where you went to grab C1 and C2. You can leave the jammer as is the for the rest of the puzzle.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>The last two boxes are sitting on top of elevated towers, and they're already ready to be launched by fans activated by blue and red laser nodes. Grab C1 and connect it to the blue laser and the blue node on the far right side of the puzzle to launch the first box.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab C1 and place it in front of the red beam on the pressure switch and connect C1 to the red laser. Grab C2 and connect it to C1 and the red node on the left side of the main puzzle area to launch the final box.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<p>With all four boxes on the elevated pressure switches, the gate to the tetromino will drop, and you can grab your prize.</p>

Casting pretense aside, he took his anti-vigilante stance to dictatorial levels by killing the police commissioner and trapping opposing political figures as well as the Punisher (Jon Bernthal) in an underground wine cellar, and placing the greatest city in the world under martial law. D’Onofrio took to X hours after the Season 1 finale was released to inform fans that shooting for the next season has already begun, and sharing a behind-the-scenes photo of Fisk in his cocaine-white power suit. In his <em>Variety</em> interview, he also revealed how Punisher escaping Fisk’s cage will affect the next season.</p><p>“I think that he does know that he’s gone. Eventually, he knows that he’s not there anymore. So far it’s a small part of the second season. We have to see what the one-off thing that they’re planning on doing with the Punisher, that should be interesting to see.” </p><p>The “one-off thing” he’s referring to is a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/jon-bernthal-punisher-special-marvel-disney-1236146371/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/jon-bernthal-punisher-special-marvel-disney-1236146371/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">standalone special presentation</a></span> centered around the Punisher, which Bernthal will be co-writing.

What we seemingly shouldn’t expect is for his captor to make an appearance, as D’Onofrio says it would be “news to me” if Kingpin appeared. <br></p><p>Then again, I’m sure Kevin Feige and the Marvel brain trust have taught their lead talent how to hide future plans behind lies. So don’t be surprised if Punisher and Kingpin finally square off when the<em> Punisher</em> special feature is released in 2026, around the time of the second season of <em>Daredevil: Born Again</em>. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Discord is experimenting with a new age-verification policy that would require users to prove their age to see material Discord considers harmful. The verification process is currently undergoing trial in the United Kingdom and Australia, though Discord didn't say how long the test period will last or when--or if--it will roll out in other countries.</p><p dir="ltr">The age verification process applies to all devices, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/discord-comes-to-xbox-for-everyone-today/1100-6507437/" data-ref-id="1100-6507437">Discord on Xbox</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/discord-on-ps5-how-to-link-accounts/1100-6511123/" data-ref-id="1100-6511123">PlayStation 5</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">When a user tries to interact with material that Discord flags with its sensitive media filter, such as potentially explicit images, or tries to change their sensitive media filter settings, a pop-up appears that tells them to verify their age before they can continue. Discord provides two ways to verify: a face scan using your device's camera or using a mobile device to scan an ID card, such as a driver's license. The process reportedly takes just a few minutes, and you receive a direct message from Discord once it's finished that tells you which age group you're in.</p><p dir="ltr">This system invites privacy concerns, though Discord said in an <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/30326565624343-How-to-Verify-Age-Group" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">FAQ section</a> about the new requirement that the data users provide for verification is not stored by Discord or its face-scan vendor. The face scan option is "on-device," which means the vendor doesn't collect or store biometric data. Age verification for Discord is a one-time thing. After the system places a user in a specific age group, that's where they stay until they choose to re-verify. Discord said users can choose to re-verify their age at any time if they believe the system placed them in the incorrect category or, presumably, once they get older and the category no longer applies.</p><p dir="ltr">If the verification process decides your age category is below the minimum required to have a Discord account, it'll automatically ban you. Banned users will have to file an appeal using Discord's underage appeals process to try reversing the ban.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/last-epoch-1-2-builds-best<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Last Epoch 1.2 Tombs of the Erased brings a sentinel rework, Weavers endgame Faction, revamped Monolith of Fate experience, and much more. This is Last Epoch’s biggest update yet and IGN has teamed up with the ARPG experts at Maxroll to prepare detailed guides on all of the new content along with excellent builds for leveling and endgame alike. Before we get to the builds, here’s all the new stuff coming in 1.2:</p><h2 data-cy="title2">New 1.2 Tombs of the Erased Content</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/16/01-new-content-woven-faction-1744819698558.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">Woven Faction</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the biggest changes in 1.2 is the new Woven Faction. They provide a deeper endgame experience by adding Woven Echoes to your Monolith of Fate. Begin interacting with them by finding a Cemetery of the Erased on your Echo Web, after completing the mini-boss at the end you can enter the Haven of Silk and speak to Masque to join the faction. Gain ranks with the Woven Faction by completing Woven Echoes to add points to your Weaver Tree then use these points to customize your endgame experience.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Champions &amp; Mini-bosses</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">As you explore the Echo Web, you may also find some fun new surprises in the form of Champions, and new weaver mini-bosses. The Champions are larger, more powerful versions of rares, immediately visible due to their angry red glow. Defeating them is tricky but if you persevere you’re sure to be duly rewarded. There are also several new mini-bosses you can encounter in 1.2, so keep an eye out for a scary-looking boss as you explore the Monolith of Fate.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Set Item Crafting and LP Changes</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Last Epoch has an in-depth <a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/resources/beginner-crafting-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crafting System</a> where you use Affix Shards, Glyphs, and Runes to heavily customize your items. This popular system is straighforward to understand and has a fair bit of depth to master. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In 1.2, crafting in Last Epoch gets even better. You can break Set items down to obtain crafting shards and then use those to craft set bonuses on your items. This gives you the best of both worlds where you have the power of a set bonus and the flexibility to craft your own gear with the affixes you need. EHG has also made a big change to how you use Unique items with Legendary Potential (LP) to craft Legendary items. In the past, when interacting with the Eternity Cache the modifiers added to your Legendary Items were chosen at random. So if you used a 1LP Unique, you get a Legendary with 1 random affix, if you use a 2LP Unique, you get a Legendary with 2 random affixes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, if you complete a Temporal Sanctum of level 2 or higher you can choose 1 affix to transfer to your Legendary! This means you get to pick what you want when using a 1 LP Unique, if you use an item with 2-4 LP, then you get to pick 1 affix and the remaining modifiers are chosen at random.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Uber Aberroth</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Last Epoch’s ultimate boss is getting even tougher with 1.2. In addition to the normal version of this encounter, there is a special Uber Aberroth encounter. Very little is known about this foe beyond the fact that he is the most dangerous being in Eterra. Challenge him at your own risk!</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1.2 Tombs of the Erased Leveling Builds</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Use Maxroll’s leveling builds to cruise through the campaign with ease. Season 2 introduces the ability to switch your Mastery so you can level with the most efficient build for the campaign, then respec your mastery upon reaching the endgame. Here are the best ways to level each of the game’s 5 classes, straight from Last Epoch’s top speed runner Terek!</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/16/primalist-build-1744820944042.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">Primalist</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The best way to level a Primalist is by playing Druid. This build has good damage, it’s very cozy as you can use transformations to spam your skills during the campaign, and gets quite tanky thanks to Werebear form.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/16/mage-build-1744820963651.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">Mage</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The Spellblade mastery seamlessly weaves blades and spells to decimate foes using Shatter Strike. You are reliant on spells in the early game but once you get Shatter Strike most of your time is spent rotating between Shatter Strike for damage and Mana Strike to recover your resources to continue dealing damage. Don’t be fooled by the Mage’s health, you can easily generate tons of Ward just by hitting enemies.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/16/sentinel-build-1744820980104.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">Sentinel</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Hot off the rework, Sentinel is stronger than ever. The most efficient way to level is by playing Paladin to get easy access to Resistances and Holy Aura for both offensive and defensive bonuses. Crusade your way through the campaign burning enemies in the holy fire of your Judgment!</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/16/acolyte-build-1744820998394.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">Acolyte</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">As an Acolyte you are a master of the undead and the profane. Embrace your inner darkness and become a Warlock to create rifts in reality which unleash a volley of Chaos Bolt. The Chthonic Fissure skill provides great persistent damage for clearing while your Summoned Infernal Shades melt bosses with their hellish assault.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/16/rogue-build-1744821018335.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">Rogue</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The Rogue levels with her trusty Falcon Companion, flying through levels with ease and grace. This Falconer build is easy to scale with great sustain thanks to the Melee Leech affix on gear. With a bit of investment into Health, Regen and Physical Resistance, this Rogue becomes a well-rounded beast of a build.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1.2 Tombs of the Erased Endgame Builds</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">After you complete the campaign, you enter Last Epoch’s endgame. Maxroll’s Last Epoch team has been extensively testing a wide variety of endgame builds to dominate in the Monolith of Fate. While all of these builds are powerful, you can use Maxroll’s tier lists to see how they compare across different kinds of content.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Heartseeker Marksman</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/build-guides/heartseeker-marksman-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heartseeker Marksman</a> uses a new skill which seeks enemy targets and triggers a spectacular display of Fire and Cold Projectiles that cover the entire screen. Watch your enemies evaporate as they get blasted by your Attacks and Spells!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The build revolves around dealing Damage with Heartseeker and proccing an insane amount of Dragonfire from Dragonsong. Heartseeker also triggers Burning Dagger for even more craziness. This Marksman has incredible mobility and utility thanks to Shift, Smoke Bomb, Shurikens, and unspecialized Decoy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pros</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Amazing DPS</p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Fast Clear Speed</p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Deals Damage While Moving</p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Insane Scaling with Gear and Uniques</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Cons</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Active Playstyle</p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Needs Uniques to Shine</p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Survivability Relies on Gear</p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Defensive Tools Require Timing</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Judgement Paladin</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/build-guides/judgement-paladin-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Judgement Paladin</a> creates Consecrated Ground with Judgement, to burn enemies with holy fire. Become the Judge and cleanse your foes of impurity, as they hopelessly try to break through your immense defenses. This build is a natural continuation of the Paladin Leveling Build, making it extremely easy to play as your first character of the season.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Judgement Paladin deals Fire Spell Damage Over Time with Consecrated Ground and generates Mana with Vengeance. Consecrated Ground also grants massive Healing, since multiple instances can stack on top of each other. Use Holy Aura and Symbols of Hope for great passive buffs. Healing Hands grants Ward and Healing, while acting as your Movement Skill.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pros</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Insane Tankiness</p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Exceptional Sustain</p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ High Single Target DPS</p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Amazing Scaling With Gear and Uniques</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Cons</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Limited AoE</p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Average Clear Speed</p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Needs Legendaries To Shine</p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Generator/Spender Playstyle</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Warpath Void Knight</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/build-guides/echo-warpath-void-knight-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Warpath Void Knight</a> uses Warpath to wipe the battlefield clean of enemies. Stay spinning to increase your Damage and AoE until Warpath almost covers the whole screen. Unleash the Spin-to-Win playstyle with this build!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Warpath Void Knight specializes into Warrior's Fury to reach amazing levels of Void Melee Damage and Area of Effect. Warpath costs more Mana every second, but thanks to the Void Well Passive and Mana stacking, you can stay spinning for a long time. The Void Well Passive is mandatory when you have Warrior's Fury allocated. Devouring Orb, Anomaly, Symbols of Hope, and Abyssal Echoes grant powerful buffs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pros</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Amazing AoE</p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Extreme Clear Speed</p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Very Simple Gameplay</p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Excellent Single Target DPS</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Cons</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Gear Dependent</p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Average Tankiness</p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Needs Legendaries To Shine</p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Requires Mana Investment</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Tornado Shaman</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Summon the fury of the storm with this <a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/build-guides/tornado-shaman-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tornado Shaman Guide</a> as you strike down foes from afar. This build invokes Tornados onto the battlefield that rapidly calls Storm Bolts down on enemies in an enormous area. Speed through monoliths and destroy bosses with this outstanding build.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Place down long-lasting Tornados on the battlefield that rapidly cast Storm Bolts thanks to Charged Storm for huge Lightning damage. Gathering Storm allows you to drastically increase the damage of those storm bolts while Summon Spriggan, Warcry, and Maelstrom offer you some amazing offensive and defensive bonuses. Since you are not casting Gathering Storm manually, you can equip an unspecialized Fury Leap for mobility.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pros</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Insane Tankiness</p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Exceptional Sustain</p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ High Single Target DPS</p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Amazing Scaling With Gear and Uniques</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Cons</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Limited AoE</p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Weaker Defensively While Moving</p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Optimal Play Requires Standing Still</p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Summon Spriggan Dies Often And Needs To Be Resummoned</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Stygian Coal Lich</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/build-guides/stygian-coal-lich-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stygian Coal Lich Guide</a> harnesses the power of undeath in the form of Stygian Beams.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-has-serious-potential-for-old-school-fun<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">After more than a decade in the shadows, the Ninja Gaiden series returns with not one but three releases this year: the surprise remaster of Ninja Gaiden 2 Black that’s already out, this fall’s Ninja Gaiden 4, and in between, the 2D action platformer that returns the series to its roots, Ninja Gaiden Ragebound. While the mere existence of this trio is a pleasant surprise, Ragebound is perhaps the biggest shock, as the series hasn’t been two-dimensional since the early ‘90s. It’s also being delivered by a developer (The Game Kitchen) and publisher (Dotemu) who are new to Ninja Gaiden. They aren’t new to pixel art or retro throwbacks, though, and Ragebound appears to be in good hands that have real love for the franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you know The Game Kitchen’s Blasphemous series, you’ll know they produce some of the best-looking pixel art today. Even though the Ragebound reveal trailer featured a lot of hand-drawn animation, everything I saw during my playtime was pixel art, from the title screen to cut scenes. I love the sense of depth they create in a forest area with layers of parallax scrolling, while fireflies drift about in the foreground, unconcerned with all the bloodshed happening right in front of them.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/16/sequence-10-00-05-45-08-still002-1744762607029.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">An early boss fight.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of bloodshed, defeated enemies provide a satisfying splatter of pixelated red spray. Some bad guys even have multiple death animations. I also appreciate how, while some enemy corpses will fly offscreen or just burst into goo, others remain littered in your wake. Your own blood will occasionally spill on the background. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For its part, meanwhile, Dotemu published TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge, Streets of Rage 4, Metal Slug Tactics, and the upcoming Marvel Cosmic Invasion. This is a team with a track record of reviving dormant game franchises and reinvigorating them with fresh ideas and often dazzling art. That seems to be the case again with Ninja Gaiden Ragebound. It looks like a supercharged 16-bit version of the NES trilogy and adds some gnarly new ninja tricks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One is the Guillotine Boost, which lets you bounce off enemies and projectiles with a spin attack. Not only will it deal damage, it extends your time in the air and therefore will help you cross wide areas with no ground beneath your feet. Game Kitchen has prepared many platforming challenges for you around this technique.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/16/sequence-10-00-10-01-08-still003-1744762662791.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Kumori, your demoness buddy.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll notice certain enemies have a glowing aura around them. These you can slash to load your hypercharge attack, which decimates large foes and obstacles with one hit. Hypercharges can be chained together if there are multiple glowing enemies nearby. So in many instances there is a preferable order in which bad guys should be defeated, adding one more layer for you to think about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just to be clear, Ragebound is a level-based action game, not a Metroidvania. You make your way through each area slashing enemies, platforming, and fighting a boss at the end -- like the large demon bat thing I encountered in one of the first areas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mercifully, checkpoints will prevent you from being sent back to the beginning should you be overcome. At the end of a stage you’re scored on your performance from D to S and will receive a summary of your completion time, number of kills, max combo, collectibles you found, and any challenges you completed. Challenges might be things like not taking damage or killing a certain amount of enemies with hypercharged attacks.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I want to mention the prologue that sets the scene for Ragebound because it’s awesome, but if you want to avoid any and all story spoilers you may want to skip ahead. *pauses* Okay, cast your mind back to that first cutscene that opened the original Ninja Gaiden back in 1989. Two ninja face each other under a full moon. They dash forward, leap into the air, and clash swords. Back on the ground, after a moment, the red ninja falls, and we learn this was Ryu Hayabusa’s father. Most of us had never seen anything so cinematic in a video game before. This event kicked off Ryu’s quest for revenge.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the prologue of Ragebound, we play as Ryu’s father in the moments leading up to his duel. It’s so cool! Right from the jump, fans will recognize updated versions of classic tunes, like that which underscored the moment Hayabusa San collapses to the ground.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When word gets back to Ryu of what happened to his father, he leaves for America and all the events we witnessed in Ninja Gaiden I-III. Back in his village, some kind of portal is opened that sends demons spilling into our world. With Ryu preoccupied, it’s up to one of his pupils, Kenji, to save the village and dispatch this demonic threat. So it would seem the events of Ragebound play out alongside the original game. A literal gaiden, or side story, then. Clever.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s cool to see Ryu's 3D costume rendered in pixel art.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Ryu is in one of his 3D Ninja Gaiden outfits here. He’ll obviously be changing into his original blue outfit for his trip to America, but it’s cool to see a 3D costume rendered in pixel art.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many gamers who came up in the ‘80s and early ‘90s still have PTSD from those damn birds that first appeared in level 3-1 of the original Ninja Gaiden. They were kind of an annoying combination of the medusa heads and fleamen from Castlevania. My friends, I regret to inform you: The buzzards are back. Thankfully, they still take just one hit and seem to be more manageable here, at least in the early stages.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the most interesting new additions to the classic Ninja Gaiden formula is Kumori, a demoness who will become your companion and has some useful tricks of her own. If you happen upon a Demon Altar, Kumori can commune with it and switch to the dark world, where hidden demonic entities are revealed and can be used to navigate environments and open whatever was blocking Kenji’s path. This isn’t a cooperative game, though, so Kenji will remain trapped in the altar while Kumori is galavanting about demon town. She also has special attacks that can help Kenji in combat.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/16/sequence-10-00-15-56-22-still005-1744762535242.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Two heads will make you deader than one.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I already encountered some really cool enemies in my short playtime, like a cyclops that spits giant eyeballs from its gut. I like the way it dissolves into a skeleton, too. In a nice touch, clever moments break up the action, like when a demon leaps out at you but is eaten by a dragon snake thing that comes out of nowhere. These are eye candy moments that could just be amusing, or they might introduce a monster you’ll run into later on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think old school Ninja Gaiden fans are bound to enjoy this return to form. Ragebound has great pixel art, fast-paced platforming action, and new ideas that elevate the source material. I’m looking forward to learning more about Kumori and seeing how her relationship with Kenji develops. From what I’ve played so far, this seems like another winning combination of beloved but neglected IP with passionate indie devs. Ninja Gaiden Ragebound is out this summer.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The last couple of years have seen several well-received Godzilla movies released, and parent company Toho is looking to grow that success beyond the silver screen. The Japanese studio has announced that it will invest $830 million in new games, anime, and other projects based on its IP, including Godzilla console games.</p><p>Toho plans to spend $490 million on content development alone, which will focus on a broad range of media as it pivots toward growing its brand overseas (via <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-14/-godzilla-studio-toho-to-invest-830-million-in-global-push" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>). In addition to an undefined number of Godzilla console games, the studio will also focus on animation, theme park attractions, and mobile games as part of its brand expansion strategy.</p><p>While Godzilla appeared in numerous video games over the decades, the last couple of years have seen the kaiju king relegated to crossovers and cameos. Games like Fall Guys have offered Godzilla cosmetics to players, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Call of Duty: Warzone</a> featured Godzilla as an environmental hazard and enemy as part of its Operation Monarch event.</p><p>Recently, Godzilla has starred in several mobile games--and a turn-based strategy game heavily inspired by Into the Breach in 2022 called Godzilla: Voxel Wars--but the last big game featuring the titan was 2014's Godzilla for the PS4, which was later released in Europe and the US in 2015. That game was met with negative reception upon release, and it has an average critic score of 38 on GameSpot sister site <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/godzilla/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metacritic</a>.</p><p>"Godzilla commits so many game design sins that they become impossible to count, but the greatest horror of them all is that such giant monsters could be so boring," Kevin VanOrd wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/godzilla-review/1900-6416191/">Godzilla review</a>, scoring the game 3/10.</p><p>While it'll be a long time before Godzilla stomps his way back onto consoles, the cinematic future of the King of the Monsters looks bright. As mentioned above, a sequel to the Oscar-winning Godzilla Minus One is in development, and Legendary Pictures' Monsterverse will see the Godzilla and King Kong franchises team up for a third time in a movie that is scheduled to be released on March 26, 2027.</p>

Unsurprisingly, the new RTX 5060 Ti is a hot commodity, with retailers already selling out, though new stock is likely to return soon. To help track availability, we’ve put together a short list of major retailers most likely to have the RTX 5060 Ti in stock. Even if the GPU is sold out, be sure to keep checking the links below periodically to see if it's back in stock.</p><h2>Nvidia RTX 5060 Ti Restock Tracker</h2><ul><li><a href="https://howl.link/5fgd1b8nxycoc?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17448205761114?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Check stock at Best Buy</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3YzAV2V" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Check stock at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=The+GeForce+RTX+5060+Ti+Launches+Today%2C+But+It%27s+Already+Selling+Out+Fast&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-04-16+09%3A19%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-04-16+10%3A49%3A05&amp;fnarticle_id=6530910&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dgeforce%2Brtx%2B5060%2BTi%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthe-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-launches-today-but-its-already-selling-out-fast%2F1100-6530910%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Check stock at Walmart</a></li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=The+GeForce+RTX+5060+Ti+Launches+Today%2C+But+It%27s+Already+Selling+Out+Fast&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-04-16+09%3A19%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-04-16+10%3A49%3A05&amp;fnarticle_id=6530910&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D225336X1707200%26xs%3D1%26xcust%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fpromotions.newegg.com%2Fnvidia%2F25-0017%2Findex.html&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthe-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-launches-today-but-its-already-selling-out-fast%2F1100-6530910%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Check stock at Newegg</a></li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=The+GeForce+RTX+5060+Ti+Launches+Today%2C+But+It%27s+Already+Selling+Out+Fast&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-04-16+09%3A19%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-04-16+10%3A49%3A05&amp;fnarticle_id=6530910&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-15324736%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.antonline.com%2Fnvidia%2Fgeforce-rtx50&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthe-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-launches-today-but-its-already-selling-out-fast%2F1100-6530910%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Check stock at Antonline</a></li></ul><p>Like other RTX 50-Series GPUS, the RTX 5060 lineup features Nvidia's new Blackwell architecture, offering DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, Nvidia Reflex 2 for added responsiveness, and full ray tracing with neural rendering. The end result is faster performance than its predecessor and the ability to upscale lower resolutions to 1440p and 4K resolutions. According to Nvidia, the RTX 5060 Ti offers double the performance of the old RTX 4060 Ti when DLSS 4 is enabled (it's worth noting that the RTX 5060 Ti's performance uplift over the 4060 Ti <em>without</em> DLSS 4 is closer to about 15% faster). You’ll find the GPUs to be much slimmer than the RTX 4060 lineup, too, thanks to AI technology that allows the hardware to hit better benchmarks without requiring the same raw horsepower.</p><p>A variety of 5060 Ti models (including overclocked variants) are available from third parties.

		<p>Bloober Team has released the first gameplay trailer for its upcoming survival horror Cronos: The New Dawn, naming this trailer ‘Don’t Let The Merge.’ You can see why from the trailer as enemies can absorb other enemies to become bigger threats, with more powerful attacks and increased speed. The trailer also shows how you will navigate different locations, including some areas where gravity doesn’t have much of a pull.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cronos: The New Dawn | Official Gameplay Trailer |  DON'T LET THEM MERGE" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZblwGH-C7eg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/17/bloober-team-reveal-cronos-the-new-dawn/">Announced last October</a>, the behind the scenes video explores Cronos: The New Dawn’s setting, a post-apocalyptic rendition of 1980s Poland. This is the home to a survival horror adventure with some hefty helpings of sci-fi and time travel. You’ll play as a time-hopping Traveller, going back through time rifts to try and extract people who didn’t survive the apocalypse. Some of the most notable inspirations include the Dead Space franchise and the movie Twelve Monkeys. The Traveller’s own suit takes its inspiration from older deep sea diving suits, alluding to the theme of diving through time to save people.</p>
<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is set to launch in 2025 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

But users won’t be able to play games within the app as initially promised. The feature was supposed to arrive in November, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/27/24307867/microsoft-google-xbox-game-store-android-purchase-games">but Bond blamed</a> a “temporary administrative stay” for holding it back.</p><p>Once Microsoft officially launches in-app game purchases, you’ll see a “Buy” button on game pages if you already have a form of payment saved. You’ll also be able to preorder games and set them to preinstall in your Xbox, as well as redeem Game Pass Ultimate perks. With this update, Xbox has done a complete reversal, as its app previously let users purchase games without remote play.</p><p>Though remote play will no longer be available in the app, Xbox notes that you can still access it from your mobile browser. Xbox is also bringing remote play to supported Samsung TVs, Amazon Fire TV devices, and Meta Quest headsets. </p><p>A few other updates are coming to Xbox as well, including the ability for Game Pass Ultimate subscribers to stream select games they own from Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One consoles, which means they won’t have to download games before they can play. Xbox recently added more titles to its “stream your own game” collection, including <em>Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed</em> and <em>Subnautica 2</em>.</p><p>There’s also a new game hub feature on Xbox that pulls up “relevant information” about a game, such as player stats, achievements, friends currently playing the game, events, and available add-ons.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And now, the Xbox support account on Twitter is just straight up confirming the game’s existence. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vg247.com/looks-like-xbox-support-account-giving-elder-scrolls-oblivion-remastereds-release-date-to-fans&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vg247.com/looks-like-xbox-support-account-giving-elder-scrolls-oblivion-remastereds-release-date-to-fans" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As spotted by <em>VG24/7</em></a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1912497749502681159&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1912497749502681159" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Verge</em>’s Tom Warren</a></span>, Twitter user Raven claimed that they had <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Ser_Raven18/status/1912267466237006276&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Ser_Raven18/status/1912267466237006276" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contacted the Xbox support account via DMs</a></span> and asked about the <em>Oblivion</em> remake. They then allegedly received a response that said this: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion </em>remastered is set to release on April 21, 2025. It is confirmed to be a day-one launch title on Xbox Game Pass which strongly suggests that it will be available for cloud gaming.</p></blockquote><p>When pushed for more evidence, as DM screenshots can be faked, the user shared a video showing the entire conversation and seemingly confirming that, yeah, the Xbox support account actually spilled the beans. Oops! </p><p>At first I wanted to chalk this up to a bot accidentally confirming info before it had been announced. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Ser_Raven18/status/1912510613634379868&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Ser_Raven18/status/1912510613634379868" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">But as pointed out by Raven on Twitter</a></span>, at least <em>one </em>of the messages seems to have come from a “live service agent” aka a human being. So maybe this is actually human error? Or a bot pretending to be a human made a very human-like whoopsie? </p><h2 id="h24137"><a id=""></a>We tried asking the Xbox support account for info</h2><p>After seeing the DMs, I decided to give it a shot myself and see what happened. I reached out to the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/XboxSupport&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/XboxSupport" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox support account</a></span> and asked about <em>Oblivion </em>as well, and after a lengthy wait, a live service agent sent me this reply: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Hello Zack, thank you for contacting Microsoft. Unfortunately, there is nothing officially announced regarding this matter. We will keep you updated using our social media channel.</p></blockquote><p>I didn’t give up that easy. Instead, I replied with “MENU” as I had done earlier. This had previously provided me with a bot and options to ask different questions about my Xbox account and games. However, this time, I didn’t get a menu. Instead a few minutes later another message from a live service agent popped up in my inbox. </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> At this time, there is no official information available regarding the release or availability of this title. We understand the excitement and interest, but as of now, nothing has been formally announced. We encourage you to keep an eye on Xbox’s official channels, including our website and social media platforms, for any future updates or announcements. As soon as there is confirmed information, it will be shared publicly through those outlets</p></blockquote><p>It seems the bot has been shut down and the live service agents running the account have been told to stop sharing details about a remaster that hasn’t even been announced yet. Anyway, it looks like we all might be playing <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em> remastered next week on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Game Pass.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
