                <p>Unlike Sony or Microsoft, Nintendo doesn't appear to be interested in bringing its games to anything other than a Nintendo console. That hasn't stopped fans from unofficially porting some of Nintendo's older games to PC. Now, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-64/" data-ref-id="5000-1330">Mario Kart 64</a> is the latest classic title to make the leap to PC.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/fan-made-mario-kart-64-pc-port-released-with-track-editor-and-ultrawide-support/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, the fan programming team known as Harbour Masters has shared its Mario Kart 64 port, which has been dubbed SpaghettiKart. Harbour Masters and its "vast number of contributors" reverse-engineered Mario Kart 64's original code and added modern graphics options including support for ultrawide screens, 4k resolution, and higher frame rates.</p><p>SpaghettiKart also has new features including the ability to create customized race courses and increasing the difficulty of the CPU drivers. Harbour Masters has previously created PC ports for Star Fox 64, The Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, and The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. These games have "clean codes" that don't borrow or use any of the original code from the original N64 games. However, these PC ports still require players to have legally-sourced ROMs in order to use them.</p><p>Earlier this year, a separate fan-created project brought <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-64-mod-brings-minecraft-to-the-mushroom-kingdom/1100-6531772/" data-ref-id="1100-6531772">Minecraft to Super Mario 64</a>, both for a PC emulator and it even works on Nintendo 64 consoles with some limitations. The most recent game in the Mario Kart series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mario-kart-world-review/1900-6418371/" data-ref-id="1900-6418371">Mario Kart World</a>, was released earlier this month as a launch title for Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

<figure><a title="System Shock 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1ec81a0ecb831/system-shock-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nightdive Studios</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nightdive Studios has announced that it has delayed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/system_shock_2_25th_anniversary_remaster">System Shock 2</a> on the Switch, with the game now targeting a console release within "the first two weeks of July".</p>
<p>In a statement released on social media, the remaster wizards stated that the team simply "encountered issues" that prevented it from releasing the game on its originally intended launch date of 26th June. If you happen to be playing on PC, get your chisel out, because this date is still locked in – it's just the console release that's affected.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067hujpqr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>It doesn't sound like we'll be waiting <em>too</em> long for the game, however, though it's important to keep in mind that the current July estimate is exactly that – an estimate – and is just as prone to a further delay should the team deem it necessary.</p>
<p>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster is an enhanced release of the original 1999 classic from co-developers Irrational Games and Looking Glass Studios. It was one of the first projects from creator Ken Levine and is considered a spiritual precursor to the <strong>Bioshock</strong> series.</p>
<p>A full-blown <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/system_shock">remake of the original System Shock</a> was released on PC and consoles, but skipped the Switch when it cropped up in 2024. We wouldn't be surprised, however, to see it ported over to the Switch 2 in the near future to take full advantage of the console's extra power.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/still-wakes-the-deep">Still Wakes The Deep</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> developers The Chinese Room have laid off a number of staff, seemingly as part of parent company Sumo Digital's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/layoffs-look-likely-at-sumo-digital-as-company-ditches-plans-to-work-on-its-own-ip">wider strategic decision in February 2025</a> to move away from original game creation and "focus exclusively on development services for partners".</p>
<p>As originally reported by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-still-wakes-the-deep-developer-the-chinese-room-is-making-layoffs">Game Developer</a>, several Chinese Room devs took to LinkedIn last week to post about leaving the studio.</p>
<p>VFX artist Jamie Berry <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7341430185805680640/">writes</a> that "the scourge of redundancy has struck". Technical producer Pascal Siddons <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/pascal-siddons-9aa255133_we-are-none-of-us-safe-from-the-headsmans-activity-7341109140871639040-X1eh/">adds</a> that "we are none of us safe from the headsman's axe when redundancy time comes around". 3D animator Bradly Adams and senior environment artist Adam Sharp <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7341127507061956608/">both</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7341437875885903873/">observe</a> less colourfully that "my current role and many others have been affected by recent events".</p>
<p>The Chinese Room have yet to give a comment on the situation, but Game Developer have confirmed with Sumo Group that several members of the company's Content &amp; Communications team have been affected by the company's recently announced change of direction. Sumo haven't shared a timeframe or any other details about these departures.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/bloodlines-2-developer-the-chinese-room-has-laid-off-employees-but-paradox-says-the-game-is-still-coming-in-october/">PCGamer</a>, meanwhile, have picked up a statement from Bloodlines 2 publishers Paradox Interactive, who insist that all this redundancy rigmarole will not affect the game's planned October release. "Development on Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is unaffected by the recent staffing changes at The Chinese Room; the game is still scheduled for an October release," a Paradox representative told the site. "We wish those affected the best of luck on their future endeavors."</p>
<p>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 has been delayed so often it may well be subject to some kind of ancient curse. Once in the hands of Hardsuit Labs, it was transferred to The Chinese Room in 2021, becoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bloodlines-2-is-more-spiritual-successor-than-sequel-to-a-a-competently-good-game-by-2004-standards-say-paradox">more "spiritual successor" than sequel</a> in the process. Still, this week's revelations are more about Sumo than vampires and their masquerades.</p>
<p>Founded back in 2003 and acquired by Tencent in 2021, Sumo have a long history of work-for-hire projects, including many spells as lead dev on games like the fairly smashing Sonic &amp; Sega All-Stars Racing. They had recently been experimenting with original games such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deathsprint-66">Deathsprint 66</a> via their own publishing label, Secret Mode, but the last couple of years have been rocky. Sumo <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/still-wakes-the-deep-warhammer-40000-boltgun-and-deathsprint-66-makers-to-lay-off-hundreds-off-staff">cut hundreds of staff</a> in June 2024 while closing Canadian studio Timbre Games (<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/timbre-games-is-going-indie-after-being-shuttered-by-sumo-group">who have since resurfaced as an indie</a>).</p>
<p>In February this year, the company <a href="https://www.sumogroupltd.com/news/2025/sumo-group-update/">announced</a> that "we must balance our creative ambitions and the commercial realities to ensure the long-term stability and success of our business", acknowledging that "unavoidably this transition will have an impact on our studios and people." Best of luck to all the everyday humans impacted by these rebalancings.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/layoffs-at-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-studio-as-paradox-promise-rpg-will-still-release-in-october]]></content:encoded>

<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds removes "unfair" and "stressful" items</p>

<figure><a title="Sega Knows You Hate Mario Kart's Blue Shells 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/28c400f32cfbd/sega-knows-you-hate-mario-karts-blue-shells-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Sega</em></figcaption></figure><p>A cornerstone of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart</a> experience is, for better or worse, the dreaded <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/random-mario-kart-world-players-take-heed-this-is-what-happens-when-you-throw-a-blue-shell-in-first-place">Blue Shell</a>.</p>
<p>Seen as a means of keeping the playing field (relatively) level, this item targets the player in first place, and has been the cause of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/02/mario_kart_8_deluxe_world_record_attempt_fittingly_destroyed_by_blue_shell">much frustration over the decades</a>—to the point where some people argue it's actually a <em>disadvantage</em> to be in first position for much of each Mario Kart race.</p>
<p>It would seem that Sega has been aware of this issue when designing its Mario Kart rival <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>, which is coming to Switch, Switch 2, PS4, PS5, PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S later this year.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/sonic-the-hedgehog/veteran-sonic-producer-says-sonic-racing-crossworlds-team-completely-removed-items-from-the-game-if-they-were-too-stressful-or-let-players-win-all-the-time/">GamesRadar+</a>, Sonic series producer Takashi Iizuka reveals that when developing the game, there was a focus on making the racing "balanced" and "fair", even going as far as to design the circuits <em>before</em> thinking about adding items to the mix.</p>
<p>"They wanted to make sure the racing itself without any items was fair and fun," says Iizuka. "The dev team really took things down to the base level, and wanted to have that fun, competitive racing mechanic."</p>

<p>Even when items were in place, Iizuka explains that a multitude of playtests took place in order to ensure that the experience remained fair. "Anything that was very stressful for players, anything that always allowed people to come back from behind and win all the time needed to be removed from the concept," he says, throwing some subtle shade on Mario Kart's most feared item.</p>
<p>If you're worried that Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is sounding too sterile and safe, don't be—Iizuka admits that the development team eventually hit a balance which was just "the right amount of chaotic" while remaining "fair to the racers."</p>
<p>We'll see if this balance is successful when the game launches on September 25th. The Switch 2 version is expected at a later date.</p>

            <p>Carcinisation comes for us all, in time. Today, it is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer 3</a>'s turn. The <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3455990749">crustacean nation mod</a> adds four legendary lords, heroes, 27 crabulous units, new spells, plus custom tech and building trees for a complete crab-paign experience. It would have been shellfish of me not to share, if not downright altruistic to avoid any and all crab puns.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I played a few turns as King Crab, who appears have to appropriated Greasus Goldtooth's crown and sceptre, and I'd be lying if I said it didn't suit him. You start on the eastern coast of the Empire, at war with a Marienburger lord named "Simon Crab-Hunter' and some Norscans. Your unique campaign mechanic here is a resource named Gleaming Shells, which you'll spend on commands similar to Karl Franz's - refresh army movement range ("scuttle onward"), make yourself immune to trespassing penalties, and so on. You also start with two units of crab knights, which are crabs riding bigger crabs.</p>
<p>The mod is by <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198023503085/myworkshopfiles/?appid=1142710">Pegaz</a>, who's made several others for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a>, such as some unique <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3412700662">Ogre Maneaters</a>. As with most custom faction mods, you'll need <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2859968660">Mixu's unlocker</a> to use it.</p>

<p>We're still awaiting the reveal of the final official faction set to join Norsca and Slaanesh for the next DLC, Tides Of Torment. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-warhammer-3-fans-reckon-theyve-already-guessed-which-faction-is-coming-next-in-tides-of-torment">The current favourite is the high elves</a>, specifically naval commander Sea Lord Aislinn. Preferably with massive <a href="https://www.warhammer.com/en-GB/shop/high-elf-realms-merwyrm-2025">Merwyrms</a> in tow, mainly so I can shout "That's not your wyrm, it's Merwrym!" at my stunned and jealous enemies. The reveal should be coming next month.</p>
<p>There's also a good chance we'll be hearing some news about the fabled Total Warty Thousand by the end of the year, say I. Although even if that doesn't end up happening, Creative Assembly have announced the announcement, announcedly, of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-anniversary-event-showing-off-new-games-this-december">new Total War games this December</a> as part of an anniversary showcase. I crab not wait. Pincer me, I'm dreaming. It's Lobster get excited about. I shell go sit in the corner and think about what I've done now.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-entire-crab-army-comes-to-total-war-warhammer-3-in-the-crustacean-nation-mod]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few hours ago, Fatshark announced the release of the first paid DLC for <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-darktide-patch-13-preview-and-qa-class-system-overhaul-xbox-specs-and-pc-performance-boost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warhammer 40K Darktide</a>. Priced at $11.99 for the Standard Edition and at $18.99 for the Deluxe Edition, the DLC provides access to a new class, the Adeptus Arbites, who can rely on a Cyber-Mastiff companion, which players can customize in name and looks. The Cyber-Mastiff has its own Passive target selection, which it will use to help players against anything that comes too close. The Cyber-Mastiff can also be commanded to attack a specific target, which will override any behavior of its own. To command the Cyber-Mastiff, double-tap the Tag Input on any enemy eligible to be Tagged.</p>
<p>Arbites have plenty of options to customize their playstyle, with Talent Tree sections like Elite Killing and Cyber-Mastiff Handling, Hybrid Combat and Supportive Utility, and Crowd Control and Melee. Those who don't enjoy having a companion can even grab the Lone-Wolf talent, which removes access to the Cyber-Mastiff but provides +15% Toughness Damage Reduction, +10% Attack Speed, +10% Damage, +1 increased Charges on your Blitz Abilities, and replenishes a charge of Blitz Ability every 60 seconds.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Darktide - Arbites Class | Release Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GVaGC0xXUVg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Alongside the Arbites DLC, Warhammer 40K Darktide was also updated with a free patch titled The Battle for Tertium. The core player experience has been overhauled to provide a clearer narrative focus on the Battle for Tertium. Players will now experience a linear campaign featuring new mission debriefs and embedded cinematics. This new progression path is designed to make it easier for new players to get started and gradually unlock features previously restricted by character level. Previously, each new player's experience was completely random. However, the Battle for Tertium narrative presents maps, enemies, and characters in a specific order, enabling players to discover all aspects of the game at a much better pace.</p>
<p>Fatshark has even introduced a new mission board system. Missions will no longer be tied to a specific difficulty, meaning you can select a mission and then choose your desired difficulty. This effectively increases the number of mission options available to players of all levels.</p>
<p>Additionally, the difficulty system in Warhammer 40K Darktide has been completely revamped. Rather than leveling up your characters, you now unlock new difficulties by completing missions. You must prove your skills at your current maximum difficulty to unlock access to the next difficulty. The studio believes it will motivate new players to master the game step by step and give veteran players confidence that their teammates have earned their place.</p>
<p>There's also a new Inferno in-game event running until July 7, and a new Havoc campaign. Lastly, the maximum number of Operatives was increased to 8, and the maximum number of weapon loadouts received the same treatment. Players will also hear around 900 new banter conversations between characters.</p>

<p>MVG says it's "decent" but needs improvement</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="GameCube Controller" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/46e951e621e03/gamecube-controller.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's online service has made GameCube games available for the Switch 2 and if you're wondering whether it's worth paying the extra money to experience these retro titles but aren't so sure after Nintendo's history with emulation of <em>other</em> legacy systems, this video might be worth a look.</p>
<p>Game developer and YouTuber <a href="https://youtu.be/A3ylCAr0dbs">Modern Vintage Gamer</a>, who has an extensive history in the field of video game emulation, has taken a look at the Switch Online's latest "classic" library and while he finds the experience to be "decent" enough, he can't help but feel there are some underlying issues "Nintendo desperately needs to fix" – drawing a comparison to Switch Online's emulation of Nintendo 64 games, and how the Japanese firm eventually <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/02/nintendo-appears-to-have-improved-switch-onlines-n64-emulation">got on top of these problems</a>.</p>
<p>While the initial first impressions of the GameCube library are "very good", there are apparently some "obvious" differences to the real experience – with the video below highlighting input lag issues, analog sensitivity and calibration, and online performance and networking also causing some problems. Of course, these aren't necessarily going to be a big deal to anyone who is simply seeking a quick nostalgic fix, but if you're a retro purist it may not live up to expectations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>MVG:</strong> "If you're a casual player you may not even realise some of these issues...but if you're a hardcore F-Zero gamer, you may be feeling a little more frustrated with how the game plays."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can get the full rundown in MVG's video below and check out more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ModernVintageGamer">Switch 2 videos on his YouTube channel</a> (he's worked on projects like the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/04/video_mvg_explains_how_the_original_shantae_game_was_ported_to_switch">Shantae port for Switch</a> as well). The tech experts at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/digital-foundry-is-happy-with-switch-2-but-feels-the-screen-is-problematic">Digital Foundry</a> have also shared an analysis of Nintendo's new hybrid system calling it a "satisfying upgrade" despite some "problematic" display issues.</p>

It's the only other modern side-scroller in the franchise, and it (thankfully) feels quite similar to Donkey Kong Country Returns in motion. Overall, there's more variety and playfulness on hand in Tropical Freeze's 63 levels. That may sound like a big drop in level count, but many of the levels take longer to complete, so the games feel roughly the same length in the end.</p><p>Like most of the Wii U's best games, Tropical Freeze got a second chance at life on Switch. It's not quite as challenging as its predecessor, so we'd actually recommend starting here if you're new to the series. Tropical Freeze also has more playable characters. Beyond Donkey and Diddy Kong, you can play as Cranky, Dixie, or Funky. Each character has their own unique moves and feels different enough to warrant multiple playthroughs. </p><p>Though Tropical Freeze is basically the same game on Switch and Wii U, the addition of Funky Kong essentially created an assist mode similar to Nabbit and Toadette in New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe. Funky Kong can double jump and hover, and his surfboard lets him stand on spikes.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>

DKC platformers above. Instead, this remake of the Game Boy Advance classic lets Donkey Kong return to his days as a villain. Essentially a spiritual successor to Donkey Kong on Game Boy--which itself is an homage to the classic arcade game--Mario vs. Donkey Kong is a puzzle-platformer that favors quick wits rather than reflexes.</p><p>After Donkey Kong steals a bunch of Mini-Mario toys, you have to get them back by completing a wide assortment of room-based challenges. Mario vs. Donkey Kong has more than 130 levels in all. Most levels are bite-sized and can be completed in a few minutes, but it also has some clever boss fights and cool optional challenges.</p><p>Just be aware that even though this is technically a platformer, Mario moves much slower than he does in the mainline Super Mario series. There's a weightiness to the movement system that emphasizes the methodical puzzle focus.</p><p>If Woot sells out of the $40 deal, you can get a region-free European import from Amazon for $44.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><p>As a reminder, these Switch games are also compatible with the Switch 2, and they all have the full game on the cartridge, just in case you aren't a fan of Nintendo's Game-Key Card system. All of Nintendo's first-party Switch 2 games also have the full game on the card, so you collectors don't have to worry about this with Donkey Kong Bananza either.</p><p>Donkey Kong Bananza preorders are available at multiple major retailers, including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Donkey-Kong-Bananza-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0F66KLYVH?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a>.

<figure><a title="Switch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cdfc4f3f7d5ae/switch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Many libraries offer services where you can experience and even borrow video games. Unfortunately, a 45-year-old Oakland man named Jamal Reed-Obafumi has been arrested after being accused of stealing "approximately $10,000 worth" of Nintendo Switch video games from Marin County Libraries, located in Northern California.</p>
<p>Marin County's Sheriff's Detectives arrested Reed-Obafumi last week after he was "connected to a string of at least seven different burglaries of Marin County Libraries". This took place between April and June 2025 across multiple branches.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067hujpqr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>The Sheriff's Office further notes how he has been "booked" into the Marin County Jail and is currently facing 12 felony charges, including multiple counts of burglary and committing a felony while out on bail. It's further noted how libraries "must be safeguarded for everyone to enjoy" as they are a pillar of the community.</p>
<p>According to GameSpot, the Marin County Library <a href="https://marinlibrary.bibliocommons.com/v2/search?query=Switch&amp;searchType=keyword&amp;f_FORMAT=VIDEO_GAME">reportedly has a catalog of over "200 Switch games available to borrow"</a>. It's not mentioned if any of the games have been recovered. This follows a story last week about more than 2,800 Switch 2 consoles being stolen from a semi-truck in Texas. You can find out more about this in our previous story.</p>

<p>This 11-year sponsorship marks the end of "one of the longest partnerships" in esports history, as detailed by Sports Illustrated. According to the same source, Aghren banned Marquez from all of his future events for "multiple inappropriate actions towards other creators, including multiple women" while intoxicated.</p>
<p>Cloud9 followed this with an "internal evaluation" and has now released the following statement about how it maintains a "zero-tolerance stance regarding harassment or any other form of inappropriate conduct" and would be immediately releasing Marquez.</p>

<p>Marquez responded to this in a post on social media acknowledging how he had "no one to blame" but himself, and never thought he could "hit this low" while apologising to "everyone" at the same time. He also mentioned how this will "probably" get him banned from future tournaments, although there's no official update about this right now.</p>
<p>"Beerio Kart" is described as a drinking game where players drink alcohol and race in Mario Kart. Aghren's event was unofficial and was not endorsed by Nintendo.</p>
<p>Marquez has won multiple major Smash Bros. tournaments over the years and is considered to be one of the greatest <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_smash_bros_melee">Super Smash Bros. Melee</a> players of all time after success with characters like Jigglypuff, Fox and Falco.</p>

That's a good sign for anyone looking to pick up a few chase cards standalone rather than ripping open more packs than your bank account can handle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Take <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wRB6b?object_uuid=fbfa278a-3e09-49ac-9b28-e9361fb86824&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lightning, Army of One</a>, for example. Her Borderless variant was sitting around $90, but has now dropped to around $50. Will it climb again? It’s hard to say, but we’ll keep an eye on it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest version of <a href="https://zdcs.link/92x2ZE?object_uuid=fbfa278a-3e09-49ac-9b28-e9361fb86824&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rhystic Study, dubbed ‘Stay with Me’</a> and featuring gorgeous full-art of Tidus and Yuna is also down to around $100, having been over $230 not long ago. It's one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-through-the-ages-most-expensive-cards">most popular cards from the "Through the Ages" collection</a>, so well worth keeping an eye on right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Borderless version of <a href="https://zdcs.link/QObj5n?object_uuid=fbfa278a-3e09-49ac-9b28-e9361fb86824&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cloud, Midgar Mercenary</a> is also down to around $50 now, a drop of around $60 from launch week. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/a5w6D5?object_uuid=fbfa278a-3e09-49ac-9b28-e9361fb86824&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vivi is also still <strong>rising</strong> in value this week</a>, but it’s still a sharp drop from the $100 market demand last time we looked at him. He can be found for around $55-60 right now, so keep an eye on this one. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, <a href="https://zdcs.link/z624d3?object_uuid=fbfa278a-3e09-49ac-9b28-e9361fb86824&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sephiroth, Fallen Hero’s Extended Art version</a> has crash-landed from around $100 to just $7 since the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-selling-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards">pre-release day pricing</a>, that's a big ol' drop, and a good example as why it's good to wait and see on how the market will fall post-release of a big set like this.</p><p id="climbers"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Climbers">Magic: The Gathering - Climbers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/23/climbers-june-23-mtg-3-1750680503265.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Wizards of the Coast / IGN</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As we covered recently, Final Fantasy’s cards have bizarrely given some syngizing Doctor Who cards a mega boost in value. For starters, Danny Pink’s ability to draw cards from counters makes him an ideal pickup for your Tidus Commander Deck, but the price has climbed steeply from <a href="https://zdcs.link/aAg8Jw?object_uuid=fbfa278a-3e09-49ac-9b28-e9361fb86824&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$4 to over $12 already</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up, Barbara Wright might not be the first card you think of when playing Final Fantasy cards, but her Read Ahead ability means she can manipulate Summons from the new set to get to the best effects more quickly. <a href="https://zdcs.link/a037rA?object_uuid=fbfa278a-3e09-49ac-9b28-e9361fb86824&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">She’s still going for around $4</a>, so she isn’t as pricey as Danny, but she was a dollar not long ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another Tidus synergy, <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRn7RE?object_uuid=fbfa278a-3e09-49ac-9b28-e9361fb86824&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tekuthal, Inquiry Dominus</a> is a Phyrexian Horror that, admittedly, wouldn’t look out of place in a Final Fantasy battle. He can double your proliferation of counters, which is ideal for Tidus’ deck. He’s gone from $6 not long ago to over $14 now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Aside from our Blitzball star, <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5w6D5?object_uuid=fbfa278a-3e09-49ac-9b28-e9361fb86824&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vivi Ornitier</a> is getting plenty of love from players (I packed one myself, hooray!). One card that works well with him is the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aoGJjl?object_uuid=fbfa278a-3e09-49ac-9b28-e9361fb86824&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Flame of Anor</a>, an instant with a trio of effects you can pick one of. If you control a Wizard (like our adorable friend), then you can pick two. It’s up to around $3, with the foil going for over $4. Not big numbers, sure, but not long ago it was a $2 card and it could climb yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve ever wanted to upset pals in a casual game of Commander, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QWY6rx?object_uuid=fbfa278a-3e09-49ac-9b28-e9361fb86824&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mesmeric Orb</a> can pair nicely with either Final Fantasy’s The Water Crystal or if someone at your table is playing the Mothman Fallout deck. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first of those combos will get your friends milling themselves endlessly, while the latter can spread so many Rad counters that it could end up being the shortest game of Commander in history. Mesmeric Orb just hit $24 and could climb higher, a $7 increase week-on-week.</p><p id="sealed-sets"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Sealed Sets">MTG Sealed Sets</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Everything else Final Fantasy is pretty hot right now, so if you manage to find anything in stock, it might be worth picking up ASAP to avoid disapointment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking for more TCG discussion and market watch?

In case you're not familiar with it, it's basically Mario Kart's take on the battle royale genre, where it's the last kart standing as racers are eliminated after each section of the course.</p>
<p>It's now almost been one month since the new entry hit the track and it's got us wondering how much success our community has had so far in this new mode. Have you won a race yet? Have you been on the cusp of greatness but denied by a blue shell at the last minute? <em>Vote in our poll and let us know in the comments below.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For well over 20 years the website Adventure Gamers was home to all kinds of writing and discussions about a genre that, while having enjoyed something of a renaissance in this "bring back all the old games" era we're living through now, also went through one hell of a drought in the 2000s.</p><p>Whether it was news, reviews or just being home to a popular forum, Adventure Gamers was for many a cozy little internet hangout, whether you were talking about the classics (Sierra and Lucasarts) or more modern series like Telltale's efforts. While the website still technically exists, I'm using past tense for a reason here, because in recent weeks the whole thing has basically gone to shit.</p><p>Earlier this month the site's forums, and its decades of history, were wiped without notice, along with AG's user reviews of games. While some of the content has been saved in web archives, to delete that past at all, let alone without warning, is an extremely shitty move from the site's owners.</p><figure></figure><p>Or, should I say new owners, because while there is scant public information about a recent sale,<a href="https://exagforumites.freeforums.net/thread/2/start" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> discussions among the community suggest that the site has recently been sold</a>, appears to be <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventuregames/comments/1lat2la/comment/mxnfu97/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publishing</a> AI-generated content (all bylines have been removed from the site’s articles) and that former writers have been<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventuregames/comments/1lat2la/adventure_gamers_is_a_gambling_site_now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> asking</a> to have their names removed from AG's masthead, to no avail.</p><p>No sooner had the forums and archives been deleted than the site began leaning hard into online betting, with four of the six menu items at the top of the page leading to stuff like "Online Casinos" and "Poker Sites".</p><figure></figure><p>Also the site's "About Us" page has <a href="https://adventuregamers.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently been edited to read</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About Us</strong></p><p>Adventure Gamers&nbsp;has long been recognized as the largest English-language website dedicated to the adventure game genre.

<p>Although there's still more to come, a new patch update has now been rolled out for Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 on Nintendo's new hardware. This also includes fixes for the Switch version. It's noted how this update "mostly includes fixes from PC hotfixes 1.01A and 1.01B.</p>
<p>As you can see, there are some softlock fixes, some crashes have been resolved, and there are some Switch and Switch 2-specific changes.

As the name indicates, the game is set during the Second Era of the world of Tamriel, which happens to be the same timeframe as The Elder Scrolls Online. The main storyline sees 1-4 players tasked with preventing the evil Order of the Black Worm from stealing the Amulet of Kings and unleashing a multi-dimensional disaster known as "The Planemeld."</p><p dir="ltr">The main campaign is designed to play out over three multi-hour sessions where players create their own character and build and customize them with unique skills to use in combat and exploration. Five of the major regions of Tamriel--Skyrim, Morrowind, Black Marsh, High Rock, and Cyrodiil--are explorable, and each offers its own unique side quests and activities. You can even join several factions, just like in the video games. The box comes with everything you need to play--including dice, play tokens, cards, character sheets, overland map boards, a set of modular hexagon exploration tiles, a rulebook, province quest books, and more.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elder-Scrolls-Betrayal-Valenwood-Expansion/dp/B0DZ3PTD1V?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Elder-Scrolls-Betrayal-Valenwood-Expansion\/dp\/B0DZ3PTD1V?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Elder-Scrolls-Betrayal-Valenwood-Expansion/dp/B0DZ3PTD1V?tag=gamespot-promos-20">The Elder Scrolls: Betrayal of the Second Era - Valenwood Expansion</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elder-Scrolls-Betrayal-Valenwood-Expansion/dp/B0DZ3PTD1V?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Elder-Scrolls-Betrayal-Valenwood-Expansion\/dp\/B0DZ3PTD1V?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Elder-Scrolls-Betrayal-Valenwood-Expansion/dp/B0DZ3PTD1V?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$50</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>The Elder Scrolls: Betrayal of the Second Era is a big game, but if you're looking to bolster it with even more content, you can grab the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elder-Scrolls-Betrayal-Valenwood-Expansion/dp/B0DZ3PTD1V?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Valenwood expansion</a>, which adds the titular province as an explorable region, new encounters, new character classes, and more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The developers of Spine want you to feel like John Wick inside Arkham Asylum in this stylish action game.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Tucked into a corner of Summer Games Fest, Spine is definitely the kind of game meant to turn heads and grab attention. There is a decidedly late-’90s arcade style to the third-person action title that compels players to grab a controller and see what is going on for themselves. While it’s still early, in my hands-on demo with Spine, I can safely say that it’s absolutely something I’m excited to see evolve as it develops.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Aesthetically, Spine fits the cyberpunk-Blade Runner mold of an overcrowded dystopian city with profuse neon-yet-dark corners everywhere. The player assumes the role of a street artist named Redline who, in the demo, has been accused of a crime she did not commit and quickly finds herself surrounded by thugs at a bar. Redline fights off the enemies with deadly force and keeps going while punching and shooting everything that gets in her way.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Spine Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Players familiar with Sifu will notice an immediate resemblance to that game in the form of the quick jabs, special attacks, and parry-driven finishing moves, but the developer shies away from that particular comparison. Instead, they insist it is a little bit more like Rocksteady’s Arkham series of Batman titles, with a heavy focus on reading tells more than predicting enemy movements.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Rather than comparing combat to Sifu, Spine's developers insist it is a little bit more like Rocksteady’s Arkham series.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless of inspiration, the true carnival-game feel of Spine comes from the flashy and over-the-top finishers that are earned by parrying enemy attacks. Not for the squeamish or meek at heart, Redline will often force enemies to swallow a bullet with a gun shoved between their teeth or spin around them like John Wick with a well-placed shot to the back of the skull. The camera zooms, spins, and pans around the finishers to showcase the most dramatic and cinematic angles for her gunkata before Redline quickly moves on to the next goon coming her way.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Parrying also works at enemies throwing things or shooting at her as well, allowing her to spot-dodge the incoming projectile with a quick lean or turn that feels immensely satisfying, regardless of the ease to pull off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Occasionally, Redline will pick up another weapon with limited ammo, such as a shotgun, and blow enemies away in one hit. These sections feel more like Hotline Miami than anything Batman has ever done, and sometimes even adopt that overhead camera angle to complete the allusion, intentional or otherwise.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There is some degree of Sega Genesis vibe going on with Spine that I cannot quite put my finger on, but it absolutely evokes an alternate reality where beat-‘em-ups became the biggest genre in the world in the ‘90s and iterated on that formula for decades. While there is a lot more to see before deciding where in that storied hierarchy Spine will land, I am more than interested in watching it get there.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/spine-is-a-sifu-meets-shooter-action-game-with-a-technofuturist-style]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ambrosia-sky-is-a-beautiful-intimate-clean-%E2%80%98em-up-combo-of-metroid-prime-and-powerwash-simulator.1226355/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sometimes, a story finds you at the right time, hits you in the right place, speaks to a part of you you’ve kept buried, deep down. When we find a connection with a piece of art, much of that connection is forged because of when we find it, not just what it has to say. I stumbled onto Ambrosia Sky at the right time, and it spoke to me. No game at Summer Game Fest hit me harder, but I like to think that Ambrosia Sky would have resonated with me no matter when I found it, which is a testament to how developer Soft Rains has crafted this world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Part of this is the conceit, which is unlike anything else I’ve seen in a video game. Ambrosia Sky follows Dalia, a deep-space disaster specialist known as a Scarab. Scarabs are mystical field scientists whose job revolves around the dead. They’re not soldiers; a Scarab can’t save you. Their job is to catalogue a space, restore it, and say goodbye to the dead. They’re a loose-knit organization of scientists with one purpose: they seek death to understand what kills us, so they can prevent it. They believe that in understanding death among the stars, they can find the key to preventing cellular death and decay. The Ambrosia Project is their attempt at finding immortality. Dalia doesn’t believe in the spiritual side of being a Scarab (for many, it’s a religion, not just a job), but she’s good at it and enjoys the work.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Ambrosia Sky - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But at the same time, this isn’t just a scientific exercise for Dalia. Ambrosia Sky sends her to the Cluster, an agricultural colony on Saturn’s rings. Once paramount in humanity’s voyage of discovery and expansion among the stars, it’s now little more than a relic of a previous age, a crucial but forgotten fixture of an age long past. Time has literally passed it by. But it’s where Dalia grew up and escaped from in her own search for something more. And now she’s returning to investigate a crisis that killed almost everyone she knew. It’s hardly a happy homecoming, and it’s forcing her to come to terms with both her own choices and the relationships she left behind, as well as her guilt for surviving what killed most of the people she knew.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>My goal was simple: find out what happened to Gerald Parker, and if he was dead, take a sample of his DNA to send back to the Ambrosia Project, then perform a “bioremediation” on the body.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a lot of setup, I know. But that’s what you have to understand to get where my demo started. I played two levels of Ambrosia Sky (one at SGF, one at home; both are accessible in the Steam demo available now), but I want to focus on the one I played at SGF. My goal was simple: find out what happened to Gerald Parker, and if he was dead, take a sample of his DNA to send back to the Ambrosia Project, then perform a “bioremediation” on the body. See, Sacarbs can only perform death rituals on people who have consented to having their DNA included in the project; even then, getting a viable sample is tricky. You’ll only get one if the person in question has been dead for less than 48 hours. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I entered the area armed with a chemical sprayer and a couple of upgrades built from the fungus Dalia was studying on the Cluster. One essential made my chemical sprayer into a flamethrower – perfect for cleaning out pesky contamination. The other essentially served as an electrical conduit, allowing me to power things like doors by connecting them to anything else that uses electricity. Handy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From the moment I entered, the environment felt hostile. I found bodies that had been overgrown by fungus, killed by a disease called clusterlung. Contamination was everywhere. Energized roots charged with electricity covered the walls, spread out like the limbs of an overgrown tree, short-circuiting any electronics they touched. The thick, bulbous roots of the exploder fungus, which does exactly what its name implies, wouldn’t hurt me unless I triggered it, but it did block my path. I had to be careful. Spraying indiscriminately risked a lot of things exploding. If I wasn’t careful where I stepped, I’d get zapped for my trouble. I even saw a small alien life form (Dalia muses that she was told all the aliens were wiped out before she was born) that can transform into a small turret and shoot at me. I had to stay alert.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/23/ambrosiasky-07-1750715723042.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">But there are other reasons to be careful, too. Dalia is a scientist first and foremost, and like any good scientist, she needs to take samples of the fungus here to understand what it is. That means harvesting it carefully. And that means detaching the fungal fruit (think a mushroom fruit vs. its roots) from the stalk safely, which means precision. I didn’t wanna use my sprayer on the fruit itself. I wanted to sever it from the stalk and then collect it. And the samples I got could be used to upgrade my sprayer later on.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The samples I got could be used to upgrade my sprayer later on.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As I cleaned and collected samples, I learned more about the cluster and the people who lived there. I read messages from Dalia’s former best friend, Maeve, and notes from Gerald. He sounds rude, perhaps condescending. But Dalia knew him. She was one of the only people he seemed to like. One terminal houses an ominous warning from an anonymous sender, sent to Dalia’s stepmother, Hale, who was in a leadership position on the Cluster. “It sleeps but does not dream,” they write. “If it dreams, its dream will end all of time.” What is it? The fungus? Is it true? Neither I nor Dalia know, but we push forward. We are patient. We are careful.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/23/ambrosiasky-05-1750715581561.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">I come across an unpowered door. Remembering my sprayer-as-electrical-conduit, I clean out the electrical contamination and connect from a monitor to the door, opening a room with the area’s gravity controls. I switch them off. That opens up the way forward. In zero-gravity, time seems to slow down. I can move more freely, access places blocked by the fungus, get into position, and more easily sever the explosive fruit from its stalk without burning everything down. It also allows me to get the most out of Dalia’s tether, which can pull me from place to place or snag fruit out of the air. It’s a nifty tool with the gravity off, but with it on? I’m zoomin’.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The farther I get, the more dire the messages on the terminals get. Gerald sends a message to his friend Lorrie telling her to stop the whispering at night. Lorrie tells him it’s not her, it’s the food they’re growing. “It knows we eat it,” she says. As things get worse, and the contamination spreads, I learn Lorrie asked Gerald to leave with her. He refused, and stayed to tend the crops alone.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/23/ambrosiasky-02-1750715753963.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Eventually, I find his unit. The door is open. It’s a small apartment with two floors. As I explore it, I see the remnants of a life. Little decorations, placed with care, that tell me so much in a sparsely furnished space. I find Gerald’s personal terminal. There’s a message from Dalia there that’s fifteen years old, explaining why she had to leave, thanking him for letting her hide in the fields. Dalia can scarcely believe that he saved it. But you never know how what you say or do will resonate with someone else.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At last, I meet Gerald. His body is slumped in a chair, overtaken by fungus. And the weight of what I’m doing comes back to me. I am retrieving a corpse, someone she knew. And when she greets him, there’s a sadness, an acceptance, in the writing that haunts me. She reads his Last Will, his consent to be part of the Ambrosia Project. He tells us he’s recording this because he has to, and that he doesn’t care what happens to his body because he’ll be dead. “Make moonshine or save humanity. It’s yours now,” he says. We see what happened to him as a series of beautifully illustrated panels that look like they were plucked from a comic book. And then Dalia performs his Death Rite, an organic act of cremation that spreads out from the panels and his body, until everything is covered, and then falls away. It looks like a time-lapse of a tree sprouting leaves after a long winter. It’s beautiful, in a way. Rebirth. Dalia tells Gerald she was able to do this last thing for him. And then she collects his DNA, and I have to leave.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/23/ambrosiasky-04-1750715768447.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">I could tell you about the trip back, about how the fungus sprouted at random and hindered my progress and I saw another little alien slug. But my mind, and Dalia’s, I like to think, was still in that room, with Gerald. I knew the way back, but it wasn’t where I was.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As I played Ambrosia Sky, the words “thoughtful” and “intimate” came to mind often. It’s a game about a crisis on an agricultural colony, yes, but the stakes are deeply personal, and every part of its design feels grounded in who Dalia is, the work she does, and her personal history. The more I spoke to Soft Rains studio head Joel Burgess and art director Adam Volker during and after my demo, the more I realized how intentional all of it was, and how much work it’s taken to create. The title, Ambrosia Sky, evokes ancient myth. Ambrosia, the food of the gods. In this case, the mushrooms that would allow us to sustain life beyond Earth. Even the title tells part of the story.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/23/ambrosiasky-02-1750715794218.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Burgess told me that he hopes players don’t notice all the work it has taken to put it all together, at least at first. “You want that work to feel invisible. But I hope we make a world and a game that people want to think about, want to spend time in, that lives in their brains well beyond the time that it lives on their screens, to where they then do appreciate the depth, the extra effort that we've put in to make sure that systems work and interact with each other, as well as the characters and their motivations in the world and the setting, and things that exist well beyond the frame of this game,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Based on my time with Ambrosia Sky, I think they may have succeeded. I played a lot of games at Summer Game Fest. But few of them stuck with me like Ambrosia Sky, and none hit me quite as hard in such a short time. I am excited to see what else Soft Rains has in store for us on the Cluster, but one thing is clear: their ambition is great. Like the humanity of Ambrosia Sky, they reach skyward, pursuing a lofty ideal. And I can’t wait to see what else they have to show us among the stars.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/ambrosia-sky-is-a-beautiful-intimate-clean-em-up-combo-of-metroid-prime-and-powerwash-simulator]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Previously unseen concept art purportedly showing character designs from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/warner-bros-games-montreal">Warner Bros. Games Montreal</a>'s cancelled <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/batman-arkham-knight">Batman: Arkham Knight</a> follow-up Project Sabbath has surfaced online, showing further glimpses of a beardy Bruce Wayne, Damian Wayne, and more.
</p>
<p>
Whispers of Project Sabbath's existence first emerged back in 2016, with Batman: Arkham Oranges developer Warner Bros. Games Montreal said to be at the helm. Along the way, however, Project Sabbath was ditched in favour of what would ultimately become the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gotham-knights-review-batman-minus-batman-is-scrappy-but-riddled-with-charm">rather middling Gotham Knights</a>, and much of what we know about the cancelled game has been gleaned through various bits of concept art that've emerged over the years.
</p>
<p>
In 2019, for instance, concept art from Project Sabbath - which would supposedly see Bruce Wayne's son Damian donning the famous cowl and cape - popped up on 4chan, showing off various elements including an older Bruce Wayne, a rundown Gotham City, Gorilla Grodd, and more. All that was accompanied by claims the game would have used <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor">Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor</a>'s acclaimed Nemesis System. Additional concept art then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-arkham-knight-canned-sequel-apparently-shown-via-concept-art">emerged two years later</a>, offering closer looks at both Bruce and Damien.
</p>
<p>
And now, yet more Project Sabbath concept art has emerged, this time from character artist Rodrigue Pralier, who worked at Warner Bros. Games Montreal circa 2014/2015. Although the Artstation page originally featuring the concepts has now been removed, the images have been <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/arkhamvideos.bsky.social/post/3ls75vje3d22d">saved for posterity on social media</a>, revealing a further look at Damian Wayne and his beardy pa Bruce, alongside Killer Croc, The Huntress, and more.

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gotham-knights">Gotham Knights</a> - the title WB Games Montreal switched its attention to after ditching Project Sabbath - did, of course, fail to generate much enthusiasm among critics and fans, and it was followed in 2024 by Arkham Knight studio Rocksteady's Suicide: Kill the Justice League. That proved to be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-fails-to-meet-warner-bros-expectations">another Batman-adjacent flop</a> in a year that also saw Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions underperform and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-to-shut-down-until-2024-with-no-refunds-for-paying-players">limp return of Warner's now-cancelled MultiVersus</a>.
</p>
<p>
At the start of this year - following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gotham-knights-developer-warner-bros-games-montreal-slashes-99-jobs">several rounds</a> of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-developer-rocksteady-hit-by-end-of-year-layoffs">layoffs</a> across its studios - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/warner-bros-games">Warner Bros. Games</a> boss David Haddad <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-boss-david-haddad-departs-following-rocky-period-for-publisher">departed the company</a>. Just a month later Warner Bros. announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-reportedly-cancels-wonder-woman-closes-monolith-and-other-studios">cancelling Monolith Productions' long-in-the-works Wonder Woman game</a>, closing the studio, and shutting down Player First Games and Warner Bros. Games San Diego too. Since then, it's announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-restructures-leadership-team-following-new-focus-on-game-of-thrones-dc-harry-potter-and-mortal-kombat">drastic shift in leadership</a> that'll see it refocusing on several core brands, including Mortal Kombat, Harry Potter, DC, and Game of Thrones.

                <p>Hytale has been canceled by Riot Games and Hypixel Studios a decade after the project first started development.</p><p>Hypixel Studios' co-founder Aaron Donaghey, better known by the Hytale community as Noxy, broke the news in a <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/6/a-difficult-update-about-hytale" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post on Hytale's website</a>. "Today, I shared some incredibly tough news with the Hypixel Studios team: we’re ending development on <em>Hytale</em> and beginning the process of winding down Hypixel Studios over the next few months," Noxy wrote. "This is not the outcome any of us - at Hypixel or at Riot - wanted. But after years of pushing forward, adapting, and exploring every possible path, it became clear we couldn’t bring Hytale to life in a way that truly delivered on its promise."</p><p>Hytale is a standalone game project that sprouted from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypixel" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hypixel</a>, the popular <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft</a> server from which Hytale's development team gets its name. It was planned to be a Minecraft-like sandbox game that was more modder-friendly, incorporated more RPG elements, and featured numerous minigames for players to try out alongside the basic sandbox experience. To better understand the project's ambitions, you should watch this developer diary that Riot Games released in 2021.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWW28OCIkNE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GWW28OCIkNE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Noxy's post about Hytale's cancellation essentially admits that this was all too ambitious for the studio. That can be seen in the project's lengthy development timeline. The project has roots going all the way <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-is-a-brand-new-game-from-giants-of-the-minecraft-community" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">back to 2015</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/riot-has-bought-the-developer-behind-a-minecraft-l/1100-6476132/" data-ref-id="1100-6476132">Riot Games acquired Hypixel</a> in 2020, yet no release was in sight.</p><p>Noxy admits that "it became clear we’d need a lot more time to get it to a place where it could support the ambitious vision for the game," even after a complete overhaul of the game engine being used to make <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hytale/" data-ref-id="5000-507834">Hytale</a>. Rather than reducing the scope or adjusting the development timeline to make the project a reality, Hypixel Studios and Riot decided to cancel the game entirely.</p><p>Hypixel Studios will be shut down as a result, although Noxy says Hypixel's developers are being "supported with generous severance and resources to help them find what’s next." As for the Hypixel server that Hytale is based on, Noxy's message explains that it is run separately from Hypixel Studios and will not be impacted by Hytale's cancellation.</p>

As spotted <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lscg5aodzt2a">by @Wario64</a>, Valve has started selling the device <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fsteamdeck%2F" rel="sponsored">on its online store</a> again after it was out of stock in the US and Canada for over a week.</p><p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/steam-deck-oled-out-of-stock">Valve cited</a> “recent supply chain constraints” for the Steam Deck OLED’s unavailability, adding that it expects the device to come back in stock by the end of the summer. It looks like Valve may have resolved its supply chain issues — at least for now — as the 512GB Steam Deck OLED is currently on sale for $549, while the 1TB version is available for $649.</p><p>Both devices come with a 7.4-inch HDR OLED display, up to a 90Hz refresh rate, a carrying case, and battery life ranging from three to 12 hours, depending on content. The 1TB version adds a “premium anti-glare etched glass” display, a removable liner with the carrying case, and an exclusive startup screen and virtual keyboard theme. However, neither model includes the Steam Deck Docking Station, which is available separately for $79 (there <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/30/23776368/jsaux-rgb-dock-steam-deck-rog-ally-aya-neo">are plenty</a> of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/23/23843324/gulikit-steam-deck-rog-ally-dock-super-nintendo-snes-xbox-elite-gamepad">third-party</a> options out there, too.)</p><p>But if you’re still holding out for a Switch 2, the $450 console has been popping up intermittently at retailers like Walmart, Target, and Best Buy.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/691604/steam-deck-oled-valve-in-stock]]></content:encoded>
