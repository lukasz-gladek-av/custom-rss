			<p>Three and a half months ago, Ubisoft briefly <a href="https://wccftech.com/far-cry-tv-show-fx-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted</a> the announcement of a Far Cry TV series adaptation on its official website before quickly removing it. Usually, this kind of mistake happens a few hours before the news is supposed to go live, but everything went silent afterward, prompting fans to wonder whether this project was still going forward.</p>



<p>That seems to be the case now. The blog post <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-gb/article/7sST77RTZF7s9GKsxETUy4/far-cry-tv-series-ordered-by-fx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is once again live</a> and has stayed that way for a few hours. The details are largely the same: FX has placed an order for the series, which will follow an anthology format, where each season will feature a different setting and cast of characters. This is, after all, the same formula that has always been used in the Far Cry games, so it appears fitting.</p>



<p>It's also one that Noah Hawley, one of the two producers, is very familiar with, having successfully created the award-winning series Fargo. Hawley, who's also known for Legion and most recently for Alien: Earth, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>What I love about the Far Cry game franchise is it's an anthology. Each game is a variation of a theme, the same way each season of Fargo is a variation on a theme. To create a big action show that can change from year to year, while always exploring the nature of humanity through this complex and chaotic lens is a dream come true. I'm excited to partner with Rob and bring our shared irreverent, ambitious sensibility to the screen.</em></p>



<p>Rob is the other producer, Rob Mac, whose birth name is Rob McElhenney. He's primarily famous as the creator of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Mythic Quest, and Welcome to Wrexham, the latter being a documentary series focused on the Welsh football club Wrexham A.F.C. that he co-owns with Ryan Reynolds. In a statement, Rob Mac added:</p>



<p><em>Getting to work alongside Noah Hawley is a dream realized. Ubisoft has been remarkably generous, entrusting us with one of the most iconic video-game worlds ever created. And through it all, my FX family continues to lift me up with their constant belief and support.</em></p>



<p>The Far Cry series will also be executive produced by Emilia Serrano for 26 Keys, Nick Frenkel for 3 Arts, Jackie Cohn for More Better Productions, John Campisi, and Gerard Guillemot, Margaret Boykin and Austin Dill for Ubisoft Film &amp; Television.</p>



<p>This FX adaptation joins a growing list of upcoming TV shows based on game IPs, including the likes of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-tv-crystal-dynamics-amazon-mgm-sophie-turner-lara-croft-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tomb Raider</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-live-action-tv-series-officially-greenlit-by-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin's Creed</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/life-is-strange-tv-series-amazon-charlie-covell-kaos-writer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Life is Strange</a>, Beyond: Two Souls, <a href="https://wccftech.com/life-is-strange-disco-elysium-amazon-series-fallout-walton-goggins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Disco Elysium</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-show-begins-filming-march-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-tv-series-in-development-at-prime-video-with-fast-and-furious-9-writer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mass Effect</a>, Pacific Drive, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/wolfenstein-tv-show-amazon-fallout-producer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wolfenstein</a>, in addition to ongoing successful series like <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-show-will-have-a-shorter-season-2-but-season-3-will-be-larger-and-there-may-even-be-season-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-season-2-lands-december-17-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/twisted-metal-tv-series-anthony-mackie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twisted Metal</a>.</p>



<p>Far Cry is one of the three big IPs that Ubisoft is focusing on with the new Vantage Studios subsidiary, which just <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-announces-imminent-closing-transaction-with-tencent-minority-stakeholder-vantage-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received</a> a significant cash infusion from Tencent. <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-2026-27-lineup-ghost-recon-far-cry-assassins-creed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to rumors</a>, Ubisoft is busy with two projects based on the first-person shooter series: a full-fledged sequel and an extraction shooter.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/charlie-cox-says-clair-obscur-expedition-33-nominations-should-be-credited-to-motion-actor/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/charlie-cox-says-clair-obscur-expedition-33-nominations-for-gustave-should-be-credited-to-the-motion-actor.1363765/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>British actor Charlie Cox was among those who received a nomination for their work on the game Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 at Geoff Keighley's The Game Awards.</p>



<p>Cox, a renowned film and TV actor whose credits include Stardust, Boardwalk Empire, The Theory of Everything, Daredevil, Kin, and Treason, was featured for the first time in a videogame in the role of Gustave, a resourceful engineer with a mechanical arm. In a reaction to the nomination news, though, he noted that most of the credits for Gustave should really go to the motion actor instead of himself.</p>



<p>At a recent panel hosted during the Mexican convention LaConve 64 in Monterrey, as <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@posta.entretenimiento/video/7575433617237642517" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recorded by Posta Entretenimiento</a>, Charlie Cox said:</p>



<p><em>Yes, I'm thrilled for this nomination. I have said this before, and I think it is important to say that there's an amazing French actor by the name of Maxence Cazorla who did almost all of the motion capture for that role. So, any nomination or any credit I get, I really have to give to him, because I really believe that the performance of that character is down to him, and my voice was just part of that process.</em></p>



<p>This isn't the first time the actor has shrugged off the accolades that came his way for the role of Gustave in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Charlie Cox previously admitted that he's not a gamer, did not play the game, and only spent about four hours in the studio doing the voiceover after his agent signed him up for it, which now made him feel like a 'total fraud' when people praised him.</p>



<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 <a href="https://wccftech.com/golden-joysticks-awards-2025-winners-full-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has already won seven prizes at the Golden Joystick Awards</a>, including two for the performers (Jennifer English for Maelle and Ben Starr for Verso). It's set to win many more at The Game Awards and elsewhere throughout the award season.</p>



<p>As for Charlie Cox, fans are already wondering if he'll be in the already announced movie adaptation. He might have some competition from Glen Powell, though, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollywood-star-glen-powell-loves-clair-obscur-expedition-33/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> he played and loved the game.</p>
