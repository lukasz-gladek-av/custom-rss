			<p>Turtle Beach are becoming the one-stop shop for peripherals right now. While they’ve built their own legacy over the years, they’re now also buying up other manufacturers like PDP, with brands like Victrix and Roccat all now falling under the same umbrella. While expansion is the key here, they’ve not forgotten what they built the brand on originally, and with the Stealth 500 they’re setting out their stall for this year’s gaming audio crown. They might just win it too.</p>
<p><iframe title="Stealth 500 Xbox Product Video | Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nvmGAtWxPx0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In recent years, the Stealth headset lineup has iterated, rather than reinvented. The general form and design stayed the same for years, while they steadily updated batteries and connectivity. Not so with this year’s release, as the all-new Stealth 500 boasts a complete redesign, bringing it bang up-to-date.</p>


<p>Now, the old Stealth headsets weren’t ugly per se, but they were definitely showing their age. The first thing you’ll notice with the new Stealth 500 is how sleek and modern it looks, fashioned wholly out of black materials, it is almost as stealthy as its name implies. The build is mostly plastic, with a rigid plastic headband, but it has the added benefit of making this one very light headset. I’ve worn this thing for whole days and never had a moment of weariness, and that’s a huge boon if you live with your headset on.</p>
<p>One of the new features for Turtle Beach is a floating headband. Taking a swift glance over at Steelseries’ homework, they’ve decided this is the best way to do headbands, and frankly, I’d have to agree. It conforms to your head shape, you can barely tell it’s there, and there are three settings to adjust it for different sized heads. It’s absolutely spot on.</p>

<p>There’s a host of controls on the left earpiece, with a master volume dial and a chat volume one below it. These are slightly plasticky, but they’re not too cheap-feeling. You’ve then got a USB-C port for charging, and a series of buttons, letting you access power, Bluetooth and Mode settings without any issues.</p>
<p>You can connect via the 2.4Ghz wireless dongle – still USB-A if you were wondering – or over Bluetooth. Our version was branded as being for PlayStation, but it also played happily with my PC, Nintendo Switch and my Samsung Z Flip 6. For most people, it’ll slot easily into your setup.</p>
<p>You’ve got an easy level of control via the Swarm II app, available on both desktop and mobile. This handles all your firmware updates – it’s likely the first thing it’ll do when you hook it all up – as well as letting you customise your EQ settings and various other features. It’s mostly seamless and straightforward (though the updating process threw up a few errors along the way), and given that you’re unlikely to be more than a few feet from your mobile at any one time, it just adds to the ease of use.</p>
<p>As standard there are four EQ settings, but you can create you own profiles as well, utilising a 10-band EQ to get things sounding exactly the way you want them. I normally like the Turtle Beach Signature Sound, but here it felt a little muddy and lacking definition, but I was soon able to dial in more top end to bring out the detail. This was more apparent when listening to music via mobile than while gaming on PS5, and it feels as though the Stealth 500 loses a little definition over Bluetooth that isn’t the case via the wireless connection. Still, you can definitely remedy it via the EQ.</p>

<p>The Swarm II app also give you detailed control over the microphone setup, including noise gate and mic monitoring. The mic itself swings down from the main body of the left earpiece – retaining an old Stealth design aspect – and it angles slightly towards your mouth, though without any ability to further customise its position. It definitely does the job during online play, though it’s not as precise as the microphones you’ll find on more expensive headsets.</p>
<p>Gaming is of course the primary order of the day though, and Star Wars Outlaws sounded utterly fantastic via the Stealth 500, with the soundtrack swelling powerfully at the right moments, while there was more than enough detail for the stellar voice acting to cut through. Hopping back into Overwatch 2, the 40mm drivers did an excellent job of delivering other player’s positions to me, and the familiar push and pull of the gameplay was given a nice spark by the Stealth 500’s audio delivery.</p>
<p>The Turtle Beach Stealth 500 is priced at £79.99, putting it primarily up against Sony’s Pulse 3D and Microsoft’s own Wireless Headset – this has been out of stock for a while, so a refresh might be coming. It benefits over Sony’s offering by including Bluetooth, and some might prefer the more standard styling. I’m a big fan of the Microsoft Wireless Headset, but the Stealth 500 pips it for comfort, thanks to its floating headband.</p>

			<p>Polish game developer Bloober Team redeemed itself in the eyes of many fans with the successful launch of the Silent Hill 2 remake. Many were skeptical that the studio wouldn't mess up such a big and long-awaited project, especially given their track record of solid but not quite great horror games (Layers of Fear, Observer, Blair Witch, and The Medium).</p>
<p>However, the Silent Hill 2 remake received global acclaim from the press and fans alike. Here on Wccftech, series fanatic Chris Wray <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rated it 9 out of 10</a>:</p>
<p><em>Silent Hill 2 is the best game Bloober Team has made. A faithful reimagining of the original, bringing it to the modern day without losing what made the original the best horror game ever, using modern game mechanics to improve where they could, and expanding on what was already an engrossing world. Without any shadow of a doubt, a resounding success, one that will likely come as a surprise to many.</em></p>
<p>The game is also sitting at 95% positive user reviews on Steam, and its sales have <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-becomes-million-seller/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassed one million units</a> in the first three days since launch.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, during the Xbox Partner Preview broadcast, Bloober Team <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-is-bloober-teams-next-survival-horror-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> their next game, the intriguing survival horror Cronos: The New Dawn. This game is set in their home country of Poland, albeit in an alternative universe where a cataclysmic event brought humanity to its knees. As the Traveler, an agent for the enigmatic Collective, players are tasked with scouring the wastelands of the future in search of time rifts that will transport them back to the 1980s, where they can find key people from the past who perished in the apocalypse, extract their essence with the so-called Harvester, and bring them into the future.</p>
<p>What Silent Hill fans really want to know, though, is whether they'll also consider making more games in KONAMI's prized horror franchise. Thankfully, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-dev-bloober-team-open-to-making-more-silent-hill-games" target="_blank" rel="noopener">speaking to IGN</a>, Bloober's Wojciech Piejko left the door open and then some:</p>
<p><em>I think we are always open. If we like the opportunity, we'll take it. There are opportunities that you have to seize. Like Silent Hill 2, you can remake the legend. So yeah, I do believe that everything's possible.</em></p>

<p>Unknown 9: Awakening by Reflector Entertainment and published by Bandai Namco has peaked at just 285 players on Steam. </p>



<p>The game launched at just a 62 on review aggregator <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/unknown-9-awakening/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Metacritic</a> and has received a “Mostly Negative” aggregated review rating on Steam. What’s worse, most of the Steam reviews point out that they received the game for free as part of an AMD product promotion.</p>



<p>“Wow, just wow. I got this game for free with an AMD GPU purchase, and even then, I feel like I want a game refund,” says one review. </p>



<p>Most reviews indicate that the game is highly dated, with poor visual graphics, stuttering issues, and poor FPS, even on brand-new top-of-the-line PCs. Some of those who purchased the game also point out its steep price, which will set you back $50 for what’s described as a relatively small game. </p>



<p>The game description reads, “You are Haroona, a Quaestor born with the ability to venture into a mysterious dimension that overlaps our own, known only as the Fold. On her quest for powerful hidden knowledge, Haroona will learn to master her unique connection to the Fold, which allows her to channel its powers into our world… But such power does not go unnoticed and Haroona quickly becomes the target of a splinter faction calling themselves the Ascendants, who want to use the Fold to alter the course of human history.”</p>



<p>The game launched on October 18th, 2024, for the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, and PC. </p>

		<p>Sony has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvels-spider-man-2">Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</a> will be coming to PC on 20th January 2025. The game will be available via Steam and the Epic Games Store.</p>
<p><iframe title="Marvel's Spider-Man 2 - Announce Trailer | PC Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wOJaeD0Si04?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In development by Nixxes, in partnership with Insomniac, the game will have a broad suite of PC-specific features, in keeping with the dedicated porting team’s previous work. While full specifics will be confirmed at a later date, this will include mouse and keyboard controls, ultra-widescreen support, enhanced ray-tracing options and more.</p>
<p>We can expect the base system requirements to take a pretty big jump up when compared to the PC ports of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/10/marvels-spider-man-remastered-pc-review/">Spider-Man Remastered</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/02/insomniacs-marvels-spider-man-is-coming-to-pc-in-august/">Miles Morales</a> in 2022. Both of those games were designed with the PS4 as the base platform and with ray-tracing on top to enhance the game for the PS5, but Spider-Man 2 is a full PS5 game, taking advantage of the console more broadly with faster modes of travel in the form of the Web Wings, helping you zip around town much more quickly.</p>
<p>Spider-Man 2 on PC will also roll in all of the updates made to the original PS5 release post-launch, which includes <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/19/marvels-spider-man-2-update-1-002-003-patch-notes-ps5/">a New Game+ mode</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/22/marvels-spider-man-2-update-brings-back-classic-suits-and-more/">new suits an colour variant</a>, enhanced photo mode features, and more. The full list of additions includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>14 new suits</li>
<li>New Game+</li>
<li>Ultimate Levels</li>
<li>New Symbiote Suit Styles</li>
<li>Time of Day options</li>
<li>Post-Game Achievements</li>
<li>Action Figure Mode in Photo Mode</li>
<li>Screen Reader and Audio Descriptions</li>
</ul>
<p>Insomniac has, however, now confirmed that there are no plans for additional story content for Spider-Man 2. Given the leaked plans from the Insomniac hack late last year, it would seem they prioritised an interquel a bit like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/06/spider-man-miles-morales-review-ps5/">Miles Morales</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Marvel's Spider-Man 2 Review –&nbsp;Another PS5 essential" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xzYZFUah5wM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Spider-Man 2 is a fantastic sequel to the PS4 smash hit, building on everything that the original did and making great use of the PlayStation 5 hardware. It proved to be popular with PS5 owners too, selling 2.5 million copies within the first 24 hours. Bringing it to PC was inevitable, given Sony’s broader strategy, and it’s sure to be pretty popular there as well (though there will now also be an inevitable PSN requirement and public griping about this).</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/16/marvels-spider-man-2-review/">Spider-Man 2 review</a>, Dom said, “Spider-Man 2 is a fantastic sequel, building on the excellent foundations of its forebear while delivering a story that drives these beloved characters forward.”</p>

<p>A trend of gambling-inspired games has surfaced in the wake of poker-like deckbuilding roguelike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a>. The recipe? Take a standard game of chance you might find in any casino and mash an uncountable number of bells and whistles and gizmos and weirdnesses into it, then slather it in a "one more turn" roguelike dressing, and make it as tactile and punchy as humanly possible. The ongoing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/event-brands/steam-next-fest">Steam Next Fest</a> has no shortage of these gambley gimmickers, but <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2667120/Ballionaire/">here's one demo</a> that stood out. Ballionaire is a colourful pachinko-inspired roguelike, but you choose where the wacky widgets will go.</p>

<p>It's more straightforward than the chaos of that trailer makes out. You drop a ball from the top of the board and watch as it bounces its way down through the pins. You earn cash for each little bumper or bonkable doohickey the ball hits along the way. Some of these bumpers (called "triggers") will have special features. An axe will chop your ball in half, allowing it to fall in multiple directions, activating even more gadgets. A teleporter will zap your ball back to the top of the board, letting it fall all over again. You can get different types of ball, designed after the classical elements, such as fire, water, and chicken egg (placing an egg carton somewhere will catch the eggs for passive, eggy income). </p>
<p>It only gets wackier as you go from level to level, seeking bigger payouts to appease the gods. You could install a little patch of cacti, which earn money when <em>not</em> bonked, and then try and keep the ball away from them by surrounding the plants with other bumpers. Or you could get culinary, putting a tomato, some bread, and a block of cheese in a neat little cluster, which your ball will collect as it bonks each. Placing a frying pan underneath that will combine all these into a meal for extra dollars, before a big open mouth at the bottom of the board can scoff everything up.</p><p>Try the demo. Go on. Steam Next Fest is almost over (it ends on Monday) and this is a frivilous and fun hour of ball bonking (ahem). It's not the first time pachinko has served as inspiration for a video game, mind. Both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peggle">Peggle</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peglin">Peglin</a> owe something to the poppy pinging of the traditional Japanese gambling machine.</p>
<p>As for the recent upswell of gambling-themed games, there's reason to be thoughtful about this, and there are already enough questionable practices in the games industry when it comes to psychological tactics of free-to-play games and MMOs. But at least the developer of Balatro, for one, has considered such concerns, even <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-wont-be-seeing-the-balatro-ip-used-by-casinos-or-gambling-companies-the-developer-has-forbidden-it-in-his-will">writing into his will that the game should not be co-opted by the gambling industry</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead was published on October 17 by Saber Interactive – but it was developed over several years by Stormind Games, an Italian studio. As an expansion to an established cinematic universe, The Road Ahead promised a nail-biting experience fraught with tension that was irrevocably linked to the core recipe of A Quiet Place.</p>



<p>What the team ultimately delivered is a relatively watered-down and linear walkthrough of an attractive world that’s far too easy to survive in for something post-apocalyptic and ideally quite harrowing. </p>



<p>Read on to check out my full A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead review.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-light-on-the-survival">Light on the Survival</h2>



<p>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead starts nicely and progresses at a balanced pace. It alternates between the present-day apocalypse and flashback sequences that help to set the scene and build the world. It’s possible to enjoy The Road Ahead without ever having seen one of the movies, but if you’re here, <strong>you’ve probably seen one of the movies</strong>.</p>



<p>The story isn’t overwhelmingly immersive and it’s mostly predictable, but it’s good enough to keep things steaming along. It becomes fraught very early on, and some fundamental twists will make the player feel much more invested in what’s happening to Alex Taylor, the title’s protagonist.</p>



<p>As a ‘survival horror’ game, The Road Ahead is light on survival and moderate on horror.</p>



<p>There are plenty of jumpscares to claw your way past, and the need to stay silent <strong>all the time </strong>can feel quite intense. It’s a helpful way of slowing down the game, though – which only comes in at around six hours if you’re able to progress without being killed too much by the fearsome creatures.</p>



<p>The survival elements are thin to none, though. Despite being in an apocalyptic setting, there’s nothing to ‘loot’ despite a few basic resources, and there are almost no offensive abilities at all in the game. It also holds your hand – more so if you play on ‘easy’. On the lowest difficulty setting, the game becomes an utter cakewalk, which is kind of the point.</p>



<p>It became irritating and immersion-breaking to see how much the game guides you. If you press a button, your objectives are revealed, if you hold another, the creatures hunting you are illuminated, if you can interact with something, it’s highlighted and painted yellow, if something can be knocked over to make a noise, it’s painted red.</p>



<p>I’ll admit that in the interest of time, I didn’t play the game on a harder difficulty, so perhaps you can give it a try and let me know how it goes.</p>



<h2 id="h-hardly-innovative">Hardly Innovative</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Those darn painted surfaces take away any sense of freedom.</figcaption></figure>







<p>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead allows players to make use of a microphone monitoring mechanic. If they make a noise in real life, they’ll be detected by the creatures in the game.</p>



<p>Of course, that meant I was free to re-enact the scene from the first A Quiet Place movie where John Krasinski’s character sacrifices himself. Spoiler Alert: I died hard. </p>



<p>It also means that a single cough or a belch is enough to bring a world of pain down upon you. I quickly became tired of the feature, even if the thresholds can be tweaked so it’s not so sensitive. I remember a similar feature being present in 2013’s Dead Rising 3, which allowed you to shout into a microphone to gain the attention of zombies.</p>



<p>I have a two-year-old son, there’s no way on Earth I’m going to get far with my microphone being monitored.</p>



<p>Aside from a few puzzles and tough-to-navigate areas, The Road Ahead isn’t too taxing a game. It looks great on the surface and the sound cues (however repetitive) and ambient, environmental soundtrack are good enough, plus the voice acting is stellar, but I feel like it could have been much better done as a whole.</p>



<p>I honestly feel like it would be superb as a VR title, and it would have delivered much better on the horror aspect of the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-verdict-wait">Verdict: Wait</h2>



<p>If you’re a fan of A Quiet Place, you’ll like the world-building and the universe you’re exploring – even if your adventure doesn’t go too far off a defined trail. The creatures are well-designed and authentic, and the intensity is certainly there until you get settled, but the story isn’t meaty enough to truly immerse a player.</p>



<p>Once you’ve locked down the game’s core mechanics, it becomes all too easy to survive. Most of the time, you’ll be crab-walking around a closed area trying to avoid a creature that will kill you with a single hit if you rustle a bush or step on an empty can. </p>



<p>Ultimately, I don’t think A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is worth the $29.99 price tag, and it might be a better idea to wait for a sale, particularly if you’re not interested in the franchise.</p>

<p>Just over a year ago, YouTube shut down Premium Lite, a subscription plan that was available in a handful of countries. It offered the same benefits as YouTube Premium but it was cheaper. It wasn’t long before YouTube shut down the subscription tier, focusing entirely on the core YouTube Premium service.</p>



<p>Now, it has been revealed that the tech titan is preparing to test Premium Lite in all-new markets. This time around, the more affordable subscription will show limited ads, prompting many users to question the point of paying.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-premium-lite-now-with-ads">Premium Lite, Now With Ads</h2>



<p>In a write-up <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/youtube-premium-lite-return-3491130/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by Android Authority</a>, it was confirmed that Google is testing Premium Lite in Australia, Germany, and Thailand. It’s a change from the all-European market that the service was previously tested in, and it should promise more diversity during the trial.</p>



<p>On Reddit, a user shared a comparison image that outlined the difference between Premium Lite and Premium.</p>



<p>If you’re a core Premium subscriber at $22.99 AUSD per month, you’ll be able to download and play videos offline and in the background, and you’ll have access to YouTube Music Premium. If you’re a Lite subscriber at just $11.99 AUSD a month, you’ll get limited ads and no other visible benefits. </p>



<p>Google highlighted that ads in Premium Lite ‘may appear’ on licensed music content, Shorts, and when you search on the platform.</p>



<p>From a consumer standpoint,  it’s tough to see why anyone would subscribe to Premium Lite <strong>other than </strong>for the reason that it eradicates most ads. Aside from that, you get no added benefits for that monthly investment.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/spider-man-2-additional-story-dlc-plans/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98no-plans-for-additional-story-content%E2%80%99-for-spider-man-2-insomniac-confirms.1014099/</guid>

<p>In a blog post outlining the arrival of Spider-Man 2 on PC, it was confirmed by Insomniac Games that the title will get <strong>no additional story content. </strong>The release of Spider-Man 2 on PC, which is happening on January 30, will bring an all-new audience of players to the game and they’ll soak up everything added thus far, but there are no plans to add any more story content.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-shut-down">Shut Down</h2>



<p>It has been a year since Spider-Man 2 was released, and for most of that time, fans of the web-slinging, open-world game have been asking Insomniac when the DLC is coming.</p>



<p>That question was definitively answered recently by the developer.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>While we have no additional story content planned for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, we’re delighted to bring all of our previously released&nbsp;post-launch content to the PC version, including New Game+, new suits and color variants, Photo Mode features, and more.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It then goes on to explain that this isn’t the end of the road for Spider-Man 2, as costume collaborations are on the way.</p>



<p>The first Marvel Spider-Man title was released in 2018 on PlayStation 4, and that game received an expansion not long after launch, dubbed ‘The City That Never Sleeps’. Eventually, Insomniac published a spin-off – Spider-Man: Miles Morales. There are no indications that any content like this will be made available for Spider-Man 2.</p>



<p>Recently, it was suggested that Insomniac is now leaning more heavily into the development of Wolverine and that reportedly, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/insomniac-gearing-up-to-show-more-from-wolverine-its-claimed/">a new teaser or trailer</a> will be revealed before the year is out.</p>



<p>Are you disappointed that Spider-Man 2 will have no additional story DLC released? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

You take a game all about building with blocks and you transfer it over to a toy brand that is all about building with bricks and you have a winning combination. While there are a lot of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-lego-minecraft-sets">great LEGO Minecraft sets</a> available, some of them are actually about to be retired.</p><p>One of these sets that the <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/categories/last-chance-to-buy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LEGO website has as "Retiring soon"</a> is the Minecraft Pumpkin Farm that happens to still be on sale at Amazon this October. This set is an excellent option for Halloween, seeing as it's literally a pumpkin house in a swamp with a witch minifigure. Although we don't know exactly when this set will be retired, it almost certainly won't be around at all this time next year. </p><h2>LEGO Minecraft: The Pumpkin Farm on Amazon</h2><div catalogid="3b6051f6-a7cf-45ed-ad86-250d966f7594" id="209462"><div id="209462" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>LEGO Minecraft The Pumpkin Farm</h3></p></div><p>Although this is a fairly small set that is for ages 8 and up, there are a lot of small details that make it worthwhile. The pumpkin house is certainly the main attraction, but there is also a witch, a frog, a potion, and a carved pumpkin. You also get a minifigure of Steve, who is seemingly trying to escape with a treasure chest farther into the swamp. At only 257 pieces, this is a fairly easy build that can be done quickly and doubles as great Halloween decoration.</p><p>The discount itself isn't all that impressive, with the price <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0BSRFFXZB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dropping lower than it currently is now just last week</a>. However, the fact that it is still on sale this close to Halloween makes it worth pointing out. Coupled with the fact that it's set to retire soon, that makes it a great time to pick this set up before it's potentially gone forever.</p><h3>Are Any Other Halloween LEGO Sets on Sale?</h3><p>Now that we are more than halfway through October, now isn't necessarily the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-time-to-buy-lego-sets">best time to find LEGO discounts</a> on Halloween-themed sets. Many of our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-halloween-lego-sets">favorite Halloween LEGO sets</a> aren't on sale right now. That being said, there are a couple of price reductions worth mentioning that we've gathered below.</p></div></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Oct 18, 2024 10:50 pm</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>While Mega Man games might vary in gameplay quality, every entry in the series has superb art. Take Mega Man X Dive, for example, which started a smartphone game before jumping to Steam in 2023. While you might expect a mobile spinoff to cut corners, its art direction is just as strong as any other game starring the Blue Bomber, and its nature as a cross-over title means it's packed with awesome-looking characters and remixed designs from across the entire franchise. If you'd like to see the hard work of the illustrators and designers who helped bring it to life, you can preorder the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1772943800?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mega Man X Dive: Official Complete Works</a> book for $50 ahead of its release on March 25, 2025.</p><h2>Mega Man X Dive: Official Complete Works</h2><p><strong>$50</strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4378219-mega-man-x-dive.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4378219" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4378219-mega-man-x-dive.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4378219"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4378219-mega-man-x-dive.jpg"></figure><p>This is a 256-page hardcover book that contains character designs, rough concepts, key art, and plenty of creator commentary. There's even a series of interviews with the developers, so you can find out how characters X, Zero, and Axl were designed for the leap to mobile, alongside newcomers like RiCO, iCO, and ViA. The English cover hasn't been released, but since Udon is publishing this, it's highly likely that it'll be the same as the Japanese edition.</p><hr><p>Curiously, Mega Man artbooks like this fetch a very high price on Amazon--the hardcover <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mega-Man-Official-Complete-Works/dp/1772940747?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mega Man: Complete Works</a> is an eye-watering $200 and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mega-Man-Zero-Official-Complete/dp/177294100X?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mega Man Zero: Official Complete Works</a> is $140--presumably due to low print runs and limited stock, so it's smart to lock in a preorder of the X Dive Complete Works if you're a Mega Man fan. As a reminder, you won't be charged until the book ships.</p><p>If you're on the hunt for more Mega Man reading material, there are some other great books to check out. You can watch the Capcom hero confront the horrors of adulthood in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1772943789?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mr. Mega Man</a> manga series, and there are quite a few other manga series as well with a more classical story direction--like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mega-Man-Mastermix-Robot-Rebellion/dp/1772940941?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mega Man Mastermix: Robot Rebellion</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/">Mega Man: Gigamix</a>--that hews closer to the NES and SNES games.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-asmongold-twitch-youtube-rehabilitation<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This week, the internet got a front-row seat to one person’s (too) long-in-coming epiphany about how much of an asshole they’ve been. Following some truly heinous comments about Palestiniains, Asmongold demonstrated what appeared to be authentic contrition, but <a href="https://aftermath.site/asmongold-apology-palestine-hasan-piker-twitch-youtube" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is it too little, too late</a>? And how does a popular content creator end up here in the first place? What about this line of work leads to so many outrageously bad, sometimes harmful takes? On the latest episode of Aftermath Hours, we discuss that.</p><p>This time around, we’re joined by a <em>very </em>special guest, <a href="https://aftermath.site/products" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Aftermath Discord’s</a> own head moderator <a href="https://x.com/appleciderwitch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nico “Apple Cider” Deyo</a> (who is also a longtime freelance games journalist), to discuss the trials and tribulations of Asmongold. Then we move on to the <a href="https://aftermath.site/waypoint-vice-remap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weird zombie version of Waypoint</a>, a beloved video game site, that Vice recently dredged up. It’s bad! Lastly, we learn about <a href="https://aftermath.site/i-hate-double-jump" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new thing</a> Riley hates (Photo modes? For some reason?).</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can keep being journalists – rather than full-time content creators – and maintain our sanity.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I think that someone who is better at doing this – though he also has his share of L takes – is [Charlie “Moistcr1tikal” White]. He loves to position himself similarly, where he’s like “I’m going to come into this bigger conversation and be the performatively rational one.”</p><p><strong>Nico: </strong>It’s hard for me because a lot of these content creators we’re talking about tend to be white dudes, and they can kind of get away with that because they’re given a level of expertise and authority when they are literally just normal guys you could bump into at the bus station or a deli, but they have a camera in front of them.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s one of the things with this whole streamer relationship or the YouTuber relationship that makes me feel crazy sometimes. There is nothing that has made Asmongold or Moistcr1tikal a better thinker or a more aware person. They just have a platform and they just have a camera. It’s so frustrating, because I’m like, you’re coming into this conversation because it’s engagement and not because you actually care about this in your real life.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> In part because no single person could authentically care about the number of things that you need to care about to be a react streamer.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nico:</strong> Exactly! Talking for hours on a livestream is a very hard ask. I truly understand that. But it’s also one of the things about that particular platform that breeds that [idea] of “I need to constantly be on. I need to constantly be talking about things – and not thinking about things.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Yeah, people come to you for the reaction. We were discussing the idea of authenticity earlier, and that’s one of the things that I think people tend to correlate with this notion of authenticity: They’re seeing you react for the first time. But that also means that there’s not a ton of room for preparation, and when you’re discussing important topics or news or what have you, it’s good to prep! You should prep! You might mess something up otherwise, or propagate misinformation, or not handle things with the seriousness they deserve – as I think Asmongold did earlier this week. In addition to saying something awful, he was also flippant about it.&nbsp;</p><p>To his credit, in his apology video, I think he really realized that he fucked up in that regard. I do think in this case he probably means it. I’m not sure he’s squared the ideas in his mind of this kind of thing doing harm alongside his anti-DEI videos. I think he thinks these things are separate. But there are moments in his video where he really does seem emotional about it, and as Riley was saying earlier, we need to give people a chance, at least, to say they’re sorry and do better. Because otherwise we’re just living in a punitive society where all we do is say “Nope, you are beyond repair and should be banished eternally.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> I guess the question to me a lot is: What are the consequences? I think Nico’s point that there’s him as a guy and him as a streamer, and if you are irresponsibly wielding your platform to say bad things that hurt people, you should lose that platform. That’s a reasonable consequence. But you should still have friends in your real life.</p><p><strong>Nico: </strong>You should still have friends, absolutely. I think he needs more friends – better real friends in his life that can pull him back. Because we’ve seen flame outs like this at a much smaller level, at a much more personal level, and had to tell people “Hey, you are doing some really awful stuff right now to either yourself or the people around you. Let’s put down the phone.” He deserves that.&nbsp;</p><p>But if you constantly use your platform and your position to hurt others, if you really care about rehabilitation or restorative justice or anything in that vein, you have to be pulled back and cut off from the things that are instruments of material harm. And I think a lot of these people get into content creation because it’s fun, and then it becomes a job, and then the job becomes a lifestyle, and the lifestyle then becomes X, Y, and Z. And I think if you’re going to make a very serious commitment to your mental health and your life – your actual, real life – you have a real responsibility to yourself to pull yourself from the situation that is aiding and abetting you in doing this. Putting away the things you are using to hurt other people.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s hard to talk around, but I think some of these guys have gotten in so deep with the way content creation works; I think a lot of content creation grips people that do have mental health issues – who are workaholics, who are supplementing income in that way, and it just kind of snowballs. But it’s also platforms gamifying workaholism with metrics, and that’s very easy to loop yourself into. It’s very easy to get into that workaholic mindset because there are financial incentives. It’s one thing to walk away from smoking or drinking or whatever, but this a job – a job with no rules and very few guardrails and potentially tons of money and potentially adoration. That is a very hard thing to walk away from or remember feeling bad about.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Have we ever seen anyone turn it around? I think I’ve seen that in my own communities in terms of reconciliation processes, which is a value I hold, but the practice is often not as successful.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Turned it around in this night and day way? Not anyone I can think of. But there are a lot of content creators who have gradually moved in a better direction over time in terms of their viewpoints and their understanding of their own responsibilities. A lot of this comes with just, like, these people start young. And even though they don’t necessarily get the life experience a lot of us get out in the real world, they still do grow up, have more experiences, meet more people, mellow out a little bit, and recognize that some of the things they did when they were younger or some of the values they held were not super great.&nbsp;</p><p>Another member of OTK, Nick [Polom], hangs out with Hasan [Piker] a lot now and seems to have much better politics than he used to. He used to be kind of an edgelord. I think these people grow on their own terms, maybe sometimes in less pronounced ways. They don’t necessarily grow in these big spurts. But they do change. It’s just that in a lot of cases they’re incentivized not to, so when they do, it’s kind of the exception that proves the rule.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Yeah, that’s kind of true of all of us. I make this joke a lot, but I’m really glad that when I was young – and especially when I was first coming out as trans – we didn’t really have the internet. Sometimes I’m like “Phew, everything I thought is lost to the ages.” I do feel a lot of compassion for what it means to have this public platform so young. Everybody grows and changes. It’s not like everybody has a secret edgelord past, but we grow and our politics grow, and hopefully we become better people in whatever spirit that is. It’s gotta be so hard, if you’re being rewarded for [refusing to change] as a young person. How do you pivot? What does it mean? Do you get calcified?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Today, at New York Comic Con on the Marvel stage, Insomniac Games announced that Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is coming to PC on January 30, 2025. The porting is being done by Nixxes Software, which also worked on the previous installments. Julian Huijbregts, Community Manager at Nixxes, stated:</p>
<p><em>Bringing Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered and Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales to a new audience on PC together with Insomniac and Marvel Games has been a great experience for us at Nixxes. We are excited to continue this collaboration and bring Marvel's Spider-Man 2 to PC with a suite of enhanced features, including enhanced ray-tracing options, to take full advantage of a variety of setups and configurations. Stay tuned for more details on features and recommended specs closer to launch!</em></p>
<p>Eric Monacelli, Executive Producer for Marvel Games, said:</p>
<p><em>Showcasing our characters to as many fans as possible, in the coolest ways possible, are some of the reasons they are so beloved. In that spirit, we’re excited that our Spider Heroes, their friends, and their Super Villains are coming to PC in the critically acclaimed Marvel’s Spider-Man 2. Collaborating with Insomniac Games and PlayStation produced a timeless Super Hero video game classic that, thanks to Nixxes and the support of all teams involved, players can now experience on PC with thrilling enhanced features.</em></p>
<p>Mike Fitzgerald, Core Technology Director at Insomniac, added:</p>
<p><em>Our amazing partners at Nixxes have once again done an incredible job bringing the world of Marvel’s Spider-Man to PC players. Our team put a lot of love into this game, and we’re excited that it will soon be enjoyed by a whole new audience with keyboard and mouse controls, ultra widescreen support, and numerous graphical options that make it feel at home on their platform.</em></p>
<p>The developers didn't actually announce the PC features of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 yet, but we can likely expect the usual bevy of features seen in Miles Morales: NVIDIA DLSS (and Frame Generation), AMD FSR (and Frame Generation), Intel XeSS, and improved ray tracing effects compared to the PlayStation 5 version.</p>

<p>By the way, if you were still hoping the game would get some sort of story DLC akin to The City That Never Sleeps, that's not happening. The official blog post says there is no story content coming to Marvel's Spider-Man 2; however, the PC version will already launch with New Game+, new suits and color variants, and the Photo Mode features that were added through updates.</p>
