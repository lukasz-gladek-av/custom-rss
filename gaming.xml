            <p>Bound by Duty, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-darktide">Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</a>’s first big update in months, has just gone live. On top of expanding the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-darktides-nightmares-and-visions-update-adds-in-a-sprinkle-of-left-4-dead-and-you-can-try-it-out-now">Mortis Trials arena mode</a> and adding a selection of new heretic mincing tools, it makes significant skill tree changes to three of Darktide’s five playable classes – the Veteran, Psyker, and Zealot – aimed at "increased flexibility and player agency". Including, it seems, the flexibility to blow up your own head more effectively.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Here be <a href="https://forums.fatsharkgames.com/t/bound-by-duty-free-update-out-now/112661">patch notes</a>, and a more general (i.e. less stat-soaked) <a href="https://www.playdarktide.com/news/bound-by-duty-update">overview</a>. I’ve just had a quick look at the new trees in-game and they do appear to be structured more openly, at least at the lower levels, so you may not need to commit to a playstyle – tanky berserker versus swift dagger stabbist on Zealot, for example – quite so early on.</p>
<p>As for specific skill buffs, I can’t judge yet who the big winners and losers of this patch are, but by far the <em>funniest</em> talent rework has to go to the Psyker’s Crystalline Will. It still prevents you from downing yourself if you overload on psychic sauce, but a massive buff to the accompanying warp eruption sounds like it could make for a serious offensive tool. Expect mic’d up Psykers to change their tune from "Oh no, I’m exploding" to "Oh <em>yes</em>, I’m exploding".</p>
<p>Less fortunate are the space rozzers of the Adeptus Arbites, who’ve been made squishier following their arrival (accompanied by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/darktides-new-arbites-class-is-overrunning-the-far-future-with-exploding-immortal-dogs">packs of EMP dogbombs</a>) earlier this year. They and the three reworked classes have all had full skill point refunds, so make sure to reinvest them before deploying.</p><p>Mortis Trials, meanwhile, gets a frigid new arena, plus a handful of new perks to unlock as you survive successive waves of Nurgle’s lads. Veterans, those lucky devils, also get a class-exclusive Power Falchion sword, and those who spec as ranged specialists should get even more of a kick out of the new Boltgun and Bolt Pistol variants. These, the Bolt Pistol Mk VI Godwyn‑Branx and Boltgun Mk III Locke, are tuned to make their exploding bullets more explodey – evidently, between these, that tweaked Psyker skill, and the Arbites’ remote-detonated pets, someone at Fatshark just really likes seeing things go boom.</p>
<p>As a piece of Imperium cannon fodder who typically prefers the flow of conventional missions to the more static defence play of Mortis Trials, I’m slightly saddened that Bound by Duty doesn’t offer a fresh taste of the former. Not least because almost all of the post-launch missions have been excellent, with more ambitious set-pieces and more intriguing, lore-massaging vox banter. But then, I barely played anyone besides Ogryn after his own rework in March, so maybe another round of skill touch-ups can have a similarly rejuvenating effect. I’ll be playing this week to find out.</p>

"I’m talking about word salad type of situation.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> came out, developer Gearbox has released a PC-focused patch that tackles crashes, among a few other things. But players are wondering what the studio intends to do about the looter shooter’s balance, especially at a time when builds that let you one-shot bosses are doing the rounds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox has now indicated that in the short-term, it plans to buff underperforming gear and skills rather than nerf overpowered builds. Indeed, those instakill builds you've seen online are safe, for now. But, Gearbox insisted, they will get nerfed eventually.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Confirmation comes from Borderlands 4 creative director Graeme Timmins, who <a href="https://x.com/ProdigyXL/status/1970315557460398462" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took to social media</a> to acknowledge the debate about what he called “builds that use unintended interactions and/or the knife.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the statement:</p><blockquote>“We’ve seen the discourse about builds that use unintended interactions and/or the knife. We’re not going to act on those immediately, instead, we’re looking at our first round of buffs. Those will get addressed but we’re going to start with underperforming gear/skills first.”</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what’s all this talk about a knife? As IGN has reported, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/abuse-it-while-you-can-borderlands-4-has-an-infinite-damage-build-so-broken-it-kills-bosses-in-seconds">Borderlands 4 players have discovered an infinite damage build so broken it kills bosses in seconds — even on the hardest difficulty levels</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To make this build work you need the Vampiric Vivisecting Throwing Knife with the Penetrator Augment. Land a hit with this knife and subsequent damage to the target are automatic critical hits for five seconds. Add bleed stacking and each tick of the bleed effect registers as a critical hit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players have come up with eye-catching builds around the knife that essentially makes a Borderlands 4 boss fight a trivial experience, and thus farming for the game’s best loot a lot easier. For example, <a href="https://maxroll.gg/borderlands-4/build-guides/vex-leveling-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Vex</u></a>’s Bloodletter passive makes your gun and skill critical hits have a chance to apply bleed, which counts as gun damage and is based on the initial damage dealt. Add Vex's Contamination passive, which causes critical hits to increase status effect application chance up to 100% and thus ensuring the bleed re-procs infinitely, and you’ve got exponential damage. So, throw the knife, land one big shot on the boss, and watch the numbers get bigger and bigger as the bleed ticks it down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The news that Gearbox is focusing on buffs over nerfs right now is being celebrated by the community. <a href="https://x.com/MoxsyOG/status/1970370340640498072" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Borderlands 4 content creator Moxsy</a> called it “such a huge W.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Massive nerfs hitting Wonderlands &amp; BL3 on launch caused huge outrage and frustration in the community. Love to see this direction,” Moxsy said in a post on social media.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question now is what steps Gearbox will take to nerf the knife. Will it change how it works completely, or apply slight changes to tone it down?</p><div id="borderlands-4-all-vault-hunter-skill-trees-ranked" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3><h3>Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s no timeframe for Borderlands 4’s next patch, but we know some more of what the studio is working on. PC performance improvements are a “top priority,” the studio has said. A Field of View (FOV) slider is on the way to the console versions, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands 4 console players are also keen for a patch to address <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-tech-experts-say-resetting-the-game-every-hour-should-really-not-be-an-expected-solution-for-players-patch-cannot-come-soon-enough"><u>some glaring technical problems</u></a>. Last week, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.patreon.com/digitalfoundry" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Digital Foundry</u></a> confirmed a gradual worsening of framerate with continuous playtime, even on PlayStation 5 Pro and Xbox Series X. As revealed in <a href="https://youtu.be/kRWW6qwjFBA?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a new video published to YouTube</u></a>, Digital Foundry found performance starts dipping after around 30 minutes to an hour, which it called "too intrusive on the overall experience, too regular an interruption." Even after a completely fresh boot, the game is still prone to framerate drops.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox development chief Randy Pitchford has acknowledged the problem on social media, promising incoming improvements. As a workaround, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-performance-gets-worse-the-longer-you-play-on-console-randy-pitchford-suggests-quitting-the-game-and-restarting-as-a-workaround"><u>Pitchford suggested console players quit Borderlands 4 and restart</u></a>. Digital Foundry’s Tom Morgan confirmed this does restore performance, but criticized the situation, saying “resetting the game every hour should really not be an expected solution for players.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-cricket-jumping-lets-players-skip-huge-chunks-of-the-map-gearbox-dev-says-ive-got-my-eye-on-this">Timmins has said he’s got his eye on “cricket jumping,”</a> which lets Borderlands 4 players leap across huge chunks of the map.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are delving into Borderlands 4, don't go without updated hourly <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/borderlands-4/Borderlands_4_SHiFT_Codes"><u>SHiFT codes list</u></a>.

                <p>Nearly two years ago, Hideo Kojima and director Jordan Peele revealed their upcoming horror game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/od/" data-ref-id="5000-612205">OD</a>. Since then, Kojima was largely focused on finishing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/" data-ref-id="5000-577622">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>. Now, Kojima Productions has shared a fresh look at OD during the Beyond the Strand event. And from the preview, it looks like Kojima is evoking <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/p-t-game-revealed-on-ps4-is-actually-next-silent-h/1100-6421683/" data-ref-id="1100-6421683">P.T.</a>, the playable trailer for his canceled game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hills/" data-ref-id="5000-306236">Silent Hills</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHCqxLtwy5g" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eHCqxLtwy5g" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The new video redacts some of the backstory text that sets up the game, which makes it difficult to understand what's supposed to be happening. Stephen King's It star Sophia Lillis plays the game's leading character, but most of the action takes place from a first-person perspective. Near the beginning of the clip, Lillis' character receives a card through the door with enigmatic instructions.</p><p>Lillis' character goes on to light a few candles, and that's where the creep factor rapidly expands. By the time someone--or something--enters the room behind Lillis' character, she's too frightened to run before it lays its hands upon her.</p><p>Udo Kier and Hunter Schafer will co-star in the game alongside Lillis, but details about their characters have yet to be disclosed. However, <a href="https://twitter.com/KojiPro2015_EN/status/1970349454239957011" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kojima Productions did confirm</a> that the hyper-realistic character models and the game itself were created with Unreal Engine.</p><p>OD doesn't currently have a release date, but it will be published by Xbox Game Studios. While that doesn't necessarily rule out a PS5 release, that is yet to be confirmed. Resident Evil 2 and Devil May Cry director Hideki Kamiya recently shared his wish for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-2-director-wants-hideo-kojima-to-make-new-p-t-like-game/1100-6534599/" data-ref-id="1100-6534599">Kojima to make a P.T.-like game</a>, and it appears that he got his wish.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/physint/">Physint</a> is one of veteran game developer Hideo Kojima's next projects, and a first look at the PlayStation exclusive was revealed during the Kojima Productions anniversary livestream. Celebrating its 10th anniversary, Kojima Productions unveiled the official poster for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-says-physint-was-inspired-by-fans-asking-him-to-make-another-metal-gear-game/1100-6520955/">stealth-action game</a>, which is aiming to be a spiritual successor to Kojima's Metal Gear Solid franchise.</p><p>While the poster only provides a glimpse of the game's protagonist--who is cloaked in shadows--it also revealed the "here comes the feeling" tagline for this project. Kojima teased that Physint will offer the "next stage of tactical espionage action," and it will feature graphics that will "break the barrier" between movies and games.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4573051-physint.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4573051" data-ratio="1" data-width="1080" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4573051-physint.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4573051"></a><figcaption>Physint</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4573051-physint.jpg"></figure><p>Three of the actors who will appear in the game were also revealed: Charlee Fraser (Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga), Don Lee (Marvel's Eternals), and Minami Hamabe (Godzilla: Minus One) will all be in the game as various characters. To tease just how advanced the visuals will be, Kojima showed off Hamabe's CG-rendered character facial model, which revealed an impressive amount of realistic detail.</p><p>Just don't expect Physint to be out for a long time, as the game is currently still in a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojimas-physint-is-still-in-conceptual-stage/1100-6533807/">conceptual stage of development</a>. With Kojima Productions primarily focused on OD--which was also shown off during the livestream with a creepy trailer--and Kojima has previously said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-says-stealth-action-game-physint-isnt-coming-any-time-soon/1100-6531630/">it may be "five or six years" away</a>.</p><p>In addition to the work he's doing on these games, Kojima is also busy expanding the world of Death Stranding through multimedia projects, like an upcoming live-action movie and a <a href="http://https//www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-anime-trailer-shows-off-brutal-stylized-violence-in-kojimas-world/1100-6534931/" rel="nofollow ">Death Stranding anime</a>.</p>

<figure><a title="ShadowCast 3 / Covert Dock 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f10fb3758b790/shadowcast-3-covert-dock-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Genki - Human Things</em></figcaption></figure><p>Accessory manufacturer Genki (which got into a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/nintendo-and-accessory-maker-genki-reach-settlement-in-switch-2-lawsuit">wee bit of trouble with Nintendo</a> recently) has teased two upcoming products: the <strong>ShadowCast 3</strong> and the <strong>Covert Dock 3</strong>.</p>
<p>The ShadowCast 3 is the next iteration of – you guessed it – the <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/shadowcast-2?_pos=1&amp;_sid=d19e4fee4&amp;_ss=r">ShadowCast 2</a>, which allowed users to connect their Switch to a laptop or iPad for accessible gaming and capture on the go. It came with its limitations, with a recommended capture quality of 1080p60 for the best results. As such, while we can't confirm for definite right now, it seems reasonable to assume the ShadowCast 3 will allow for 4K capture at 60fps – perfect for the Switch 2, then.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Covert Dock 3 is the new iteration of... oh, <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/covert-dock-2?_pos=3&amp;_sid=6f92cbe00&amp;_ss=r">you get it</a>. This thing is pretty nifty and would essentially bundle a 4K HDMI dock into a portable console charger, allowing you to connect your Switch in its handheld configuration to a TV without the need for a full-size dock. Sadly, the second version isn't compatible with the Switch 2, so that's presumably where the Covert Dock 3 comes into play.</p>

<p>Genki has released a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/humanthings/trilogy">Kickstarter</a> page for the two products which will go live within days at this point. Price has not yet been confirmed, but an initial image at least gives us a good glimpse at what each product will look like. The Covert Dock 3 is on the left and looks remarkably similar to the Dock 2, albeit with a new colour scheme, while the ShadowCast 3 on the right is a pretty significant departure from the previous version.</p>
<p>We'll keep an eye out for more details on these new products and let you know as soon as we hear more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Less than two months after the launch of Mafia: The Old Country, a major member of that game's cast has confirmed to have heard that publisher Take-Two Interactive has greenlit a new installment. </p>



<p>As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN-0baTto-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> by YouTuber Mafia Game Videos, actress Carina Conti, who played Enzo Favara's beloved Isabella Torrisi in the recently released game, said as much <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/7doMj5TEtMA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a recent livestream with Bubbly Nuggets</a>. Of course, we should take the news with a grain of salt, but it is possible she may know about it.</p>



<p>Mafia: The Old Country had a seemingly successful launch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-sold-over-800k-copies-in-first-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">selling over 800K units in its first week on the market</a>. Sure, it did not make big waves, but it also did not need to. The game was developed over just three years as a linear, smaller, and less costly title that retailed at $49.99. This tells us it shouldn't take long for the game to break even and become profitable; we should know more after the next Take-Two quarterly financial report, which will be shared in November. </p>



<p>I largely enjoyed my time with Mafia: The Old Country, albeit with some reservations, as you can read <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mafia-the-old-country-a-fine-sicilian-mafia-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in my review</a>:</p>



<p><em>Mafia: The Old Country aims squarely at being a narrative experience, and largely succeeds in that while also providing solid gameplay. It is a bit of a shame that we don't get to explore Sicily in this game, but if you're into Mafia narratives, this is among the best you can find in games, and the price isn't so high to boot.</em></p>



<p>Did you buy the game yet? If so, what did you think? Let us know in the comments section below. </p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a> continues to make a noise in China, this time through a nationwide McDonald's collaboration designed to coincide with this year's Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>
<p>On the elaborate and specially designed menu are, according to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DO6aKmMEojo/?img_index=2">China Insider</a> and <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.com.cn/news/20250919-Wukong">the McDonald's China website</a>, a huge black double beef "mooncake" (the Mid-Autumn Festival is also sometimes called the Mooncake Festival), a crispy chicken burger "mooncake", shrimp nuggets, which sound weird, curly fries and themed McFlurries. There's even a weird black-cased dessert thing, with a gooey yellow and white filling. Apparently this is a sesame lava pie, whatever that is, but to me it looks like a crusted, elongated Cadbury's Creme Egg. </p>

<p>But better yet! There will also be coinciding merch pop-ups in the biggest Chinese cities where people can buy exclusive Black Myth: Wukong x McDonald's merch. The most elaborate of these pieces is a dressing gown (it might be a wearable fleece thing - it's a bit unclear) which is black with ornate Wukong-related design-work and comes with a matching headband, which, admittedly, I rather like. There's a horrid white dressing gown with McDonald's logos and burgers on, too.</p>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>The collaboration starts today in China, so hurry on over, and runs in thousands of restaurants until 21st October. And I know what you're thinking: lucky bastards - why do they get black burgers and dressing gowns and not us, in the West? Well we can't have it because we didn't give Black Myth: Wukong Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2024, that's why. Don't, Bertie, don't.</p><p>Maybe a better question is why, a year after release, Black Myth: Wukong is still being celebrated in China. Well don't forget there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-black-myth-game-announced-by-game-science-following-wukong-success">a follow-up game called Black Myth: Zhong Koi</a> in development, which like Wukong, takes another iconic figure from Chinese folklore - the evil spirit-killing deity Zhong Koi - and spins a game around him.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ananta-really-looks-like-anime-gta-in-new-gameplay-trailer-from-tgs-2025.1305117/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>For TGS 2025, NetEase Games and Naked Rain (a studio with offices in Hangzhou and Montreal) have shared a new gameplay trailer of ANANTA, an intriguing and very much anime GTA-looking open world game.</p>



<p>In development as a free-to-play game for PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices, ANANTA aims to immerse players in a living, breathing metropolis where every alleyway is filled with stories waiting to be discovered. The map is dotted with interactive hotspots where players can trigger events such as petting cats in parks and gang clashes. Players can snoop on passersby's phones or defy traffic laws with reckless street racing. Naked Rain also promises 'intelligent and lifelike behavior' from the NPCs that populate the city. Interiors will be accessible across three vertical layers: rooftops, mid-levels, and ground floors.</p>



<p>To move around the city, players may use public transportation, such as subways and buses, as well as cars, taxis, and helicopters. There are also special traversal techniques like 'swinging' (which sounds a lot like Spider-Man's signature traversal method) to get around quickly. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>ANANTA features plenty of combat, too. Naked Rain said that there is a high degree of environmental interactivity, allowing players to use items like golf clubs or trash bins as weapons to defeat enemies. In addition to their own gear, players can take enemy weapons during battle to experience different combat styles. Combat itself includes action staples like dodging and blocking.</p>



<p>In terms of narrative, players will step into the role of the new captain of a special task force, navigate city streets, forge alliances, and unravel mysterious threats to daily life. By seamlessly switching between diverse roles, they'll experience multifaceted urban lives—each with unique personal stories. They will get to protect justice as a cop, infiltrate the Internet as a hacker, race through alleys as a delivery man, or chase fame as a live-streamer.</p>



<p>There's no word yet on any release window, but we'll make sure to report the info once available. Meanwhile, you can pre-register on the <a href="https://www.anantagame.com/501/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official website</a>.</p>

            <p>
Dear Hideo Kojima, you'd better give us a proper update on your new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear">Metal Gear</a>-style <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/metal-gear-solid-creator-hideo-kojima-is-working-on-a-brand-new-action-espionage-game-that-is-also-a-movie">action-espionage game-movie</a> wotsit <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/physint">Physint</a> soon, because for every hour that passes, I think of another unbearable title pun. </p>
<p>I'm not very Physinterested in Physint right now, a game defined by what it Physisn't. Perhaps I'd be more Physinto it if Kojima Productions would share a proper outline and explore the Physintricacies. But this is Hideo Kojima, a man of *grunts, strains* Sphysint-like enigma. Still, at least we now know that Don Lee from Train To Busan is in the stealthy film-o-game, together with Charlee Fraser from Furiosa and Minami Hamabe from Godzilla Minus One.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
In a livestream last night, Kojima discussed working with 3Lateral to model each performer's face. He shared some early renders of Hamabe in-engine. Yep, sure looks like a face.
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Push Square / Kojima Productions</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
He also shared some concept art from Physint, which certainly underlines the Metal Gear connections. There is a man in a flapping coat with a high collar. Or half a flapping coat, anyway. I can't work out where the coat ends and his utility belt ends. He's got a lot of weird harness wrapped around his right shoulder. Doubtless, this is Tactical.
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Kojima Productions</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Also, a rifle with a scope and a stock and a silencer. We can expect a mix of sneaky and open firefights, I expect. Behind the man there are tall forbidding buildings with a lonely bird visible against slate clouds. Hang on, the lonely bird is just a stray coffee grain on my laptop screen. Let me wipe it away. Ah, now I feel sad about the missing bird.
</p>
<p>
Is this sadness the Feeling referred to by the caption "Here Comes the Feeling"? Probably not. When will the Feeling actually arrive? In at least "another five or six years", Kojima <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojimas-next-espionage-game-physint-wont-be-out-for-a-few-years-yet">commented in May</a>.</p>
<p>Physint is at least actually "in development", now, following the release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> on console. Kojima decided to make a new game in the vein of Metal Gear following a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kojima-says-he-decided-to-make-physint-for-metal-gear-fans-after-illness-in-2020">recent illness</a>. Here's hoping the next trailer or livestream at least features more legible Tactical apparel. Physint, reveal thyself!

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> developer Pocketpair has revealed a new farming spin-off game, titled (of course) Palfarm.</p>
<p>As you'd expect, the game will see players teaming up with their Pals to sew seeds, mine for ore, and befriend townsfolk. And it looks like there's a spot of romance too.</p>
<p>There's also combat, as evil Pals can raid your farm - defeat them to obtain further resources. "After all, combat is a form of harvesting in its own way," reads the Steam page. Gruesome.</p>

<p>It's mostly a spin on the popular gameplay seen in the likes of Stardew Valley, which has proven exceptionally popular over the past decade.</p>
<p>Yet this reveal comes just shortly after Nintendo's latest Direct where it revealed its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ever-wanted-to-play-a-pokemon-animal-crossing-meets-minecraft-pokemon-pokopia-might-be-just-that-game">new Pokémon life sim game Pokopia</a> in which players join 'mon to farm crops and gradually build an attractive little environment.</p>
<p>Both games are part of a long-established genre, but the timing doesn't help to shake the feeling Pocketpair is once again following in the footsteps of Nintendo.</p>
<p>Palfarm is yet to receive a release date, but is available to wishlist now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4031890/Palworld_Palfarm/">Steam</a>. It's unclear if it will also be released on console.</p>
<p>Nintendo's lawsuit against Pocketpair for copyright infringement remains ongoing, as Nintendo was recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-nintendos-potentially-industry-changing-new-monster-battling-patent-enforceable-we-asked-some-lawyers">granted a new patent around summoning monsters</a>. It's also argued that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-argues-mods-dont-count-as-proper-games-as-pokemon-v-palworld-lawsuit-continues">mods don't count as proper games</a>, countering Pocketpair's defence.</p>
<p>Pocketpair, meanwhile, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pocketpair-to-fix-jank-in-hugely-successful-pokemon-alike-palworld-as-it-pushes-past-nintendos-controversial-lawsuit-towards-full-10-release-in-2026">continuing development of Palworld towards a 1.0 release</a> next year, fixing "jank" it wishes to properly address to set the full release up for success.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kojima-productions/">Hideo Kojima</a> is a busy man, Death Stranding 2 is hardly out of the door,&nbsp; he’s working on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/23/kojima-productions-new-od-knock-teaser-is-pretty-creepy/">OD, which is currently an Xbox exclusive</a>, and also Physint, which is currently a PlayStation exclusive. However, that doesn’t really mean these days and both titles may eventually end up on both formats.</p>
<p>Physint, a “next-generation action espionage game”, was announced in 2024. Kojima said it would go into full production after Death Stranding 2, but it is a long way off with Kojima <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/kojima-says-in-an-interview-with-a-french-magazine-that-the-death-stranding-movie-is-planned-for-2027-and-that-physint-will-take-him-5-or-6-years.1192278/">stating in May this year t</a>hat “It’ll take me another five or six years.”</p>


<p>Physint presumably means “Physical Interaction” but the logo is a little odd, the Y is clearly separate from the rest of the text. Kojima never does anything without a purpose, so it will be interesting to see what theories fans can come up with.</p>
<p>During a Kojima Productions 10th Anniversary livestream, which you can watch below, key artwork for Physint was revealed along with the first actors. Charlee Fraser, Ma Dong-seok and Minami Hamabe are all confirmed for the game, and I would suggest Ma Dong-seok, aka Don Lee, is the most recognisable, having starred in The Eternals, Train to Busan, and gamers will have met him as Samson in Death Stranding 2.</p>
<p>The SAG-AFTRA strike affected casting, so the main character has yet to be revealed, although that is “coming soon”.&nbsp; Looking at the artwork, some have suggested it might be Robert Patterson, but it looks rather more like Eddie Redmayne to me.</p>



<p>When the title was announced <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/31/hideo-kojima-is-making-a-new-action-espionage-game-after-death-stranding-2/">Kojima said</a> “I cannot tell you so much now… but we plan to bring together cutting-edge technology and talent from around the world to create it. Of course, it is an interactive game, but it is also a movie at the same time in terms of look, story, theme, cast, acting, fashion and sound. With this title, we hope to transcend the barriers between film and video games.”</p>
<p>It has been revealed that 3Lateral are creating new technology to capture the likeness of the actors.</p>
<p>So, only six years to wait and I guess we’re all going to have to buy a new console to play it on as the PS6 should be out by then.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/23/gamesir-g7-pro-controller-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gamesir-g7-pro-controller-review-%E2%80%93-beating-microsoft-at-their-own-game.1305102/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>GameSir are my favourite controller manufacturer right now. The Chinese company have steadily built their reputation, year-on-year, and are now crafting controllers that are capable of besting Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo, all while charging less. The GameSir G7 Pro continues that growth, but here they’ve aimed very specifically at the official Xbox Elite controller. Once again, GameSir have made a controller that is so good, and such incredible value, that other manufacturers should be ashamed to show their faces in public.</p>
<p>The GameSir G7 Pro isn’t so much inspired by the Xbox Elite Controller Series 2 as it is GameSir peering over Microsoft’s shoulder, and thoroughly stealing their test answers. If you were glancing from across the room, you’d likely swear that it was an official Xbox release, especially as it’s designed for Xbox and PC, and comes with the Xbox button proudly sitting at the centre of the faceplate. Microsoft can’t be too upset about it, as they’ve certified the G7 Pro for their console.</p>



<p>The key thing, as has been the case with GameSir’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/05/gamesir-super-nova-controller-review/">Super Nova</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/28/gamesir-cyclone-2-controller-review/">Cyclone 2</a>, is that they’ve packed in every single bit of tech you could want in a modern pro controller, while Microsoft’s official controllers are now lagging behind. In the box, you’re getting the G7 Pro, a colour-matched charging stand, a USB-C cable, and a selection of different D-pads to choose from, all with an RRP of £89.99.</p>
<p>Available in three different colourways, our review unit came in the understated Mech White colour, with a pure white body, silver hardware and grey rubberised grips. If you’re looking for something truly eye-catching though, you should check out the blue and gold Wuchang edition, which looks absolutely amazing, though you’re going to pay an extra £20 for it.</p>

<p>It’s a smart-looking controller then, and in your hands it feels absolutely rock solid. There’s a pleasing amount of heft, but at 272g it’s far easier on your hands and wrists than the fully loaded 345g of the Elite Series 2. The rubberised grips are comfortable and provide a decent level of grip, with the G7 performing well, even through the hot, sweaty days from the tail end of the summer.</p>
<p>The GameSir G7 Pro is absolutely stacked with features. You’ve got three different connection options, with 2.4GHz USB wireless, Bluetooth and wired modes for PC, while Xbox players have to opt for a wired connection. Mobile players can also grab the G7 Pro via Bluetooth, giving you a controller that’s capable of fulfilling a number of roles in a multi-platform home. There’s an easy-to-use toggle on the back of the controller for switching between wireless and Bluetooth, and it’s all very straightforward and user friendly.</p>

<p>The headline inclusions are Mag-Res TMR analogue sticks, which give you an even smoother experience than Hall Effect sticks, while retaining the drift-proof design that should really be the industry standard. They feel lovely under your thumbs, with a lightness to their movement that makes them feel effortless in use. They’re precise and utterly reliable, whether you’re playing competitive shooters like Overwatch 2 or involved in precision combat in Elden Ring: Nightreign. They are so good, you’ll wonder what’s going on with other controllers.</p>
<p>Alongside the sticks, you’re getting mechanical switches across the majority of other inputs. The four central face buttons, the D-pad, and the additional shoulder bumper buttons that sit alongside the regular shoulder buttons and triggers are all mechanical, emitting a glorious click with every press. They feel precise, and most importantly, fast.</p>
<p>As with the Cyclone 2, the trigger lockout shortens their movement, engaging a mechanical button instead, which can be the difference in a head-to-head battle between adding to your killstreak and embarrassment and defeat. It’s one of the best developments in controller tech, and the G7’s implementation is the best I’ve come across yet.</p>
<p>Turning the controller over, there’s just a bevy of controls, switches and toggles, but the two that are most important are the large back buttons that sit comfortably underneath your middle fingers. They feel responsive, but their smooth surface feels a little disconcerting next to the rubberised grip and mildly textured plastics that sit back there as well.</p>

<p>What’s particularly good about these pro buttons is the fact that they also come with their own lockout switch, which resolutely locks them in place, and prevents any accidental button presses. It’s so solid that you could utterly forget they’re there, were it not for the slightly odd quality of the surface.</p>
<p>Additional features include a 3.5mm headphone jack, which also features a microphone mute button, allowing you to mute the microphone if you’ve plugged in a headset that doesn’t have its own mute function. It’s a handy thing to jab at when someone in your house is asking you a question, but it’s mildly unnecessary, and the red LED inside it will bleed through to the right analogue stick when it’s activated. File it under ‘nice to have’.</p>
<p>In terms of competition, you’ve got to look to Microsoft’s Elite Series 2, though both renditions are more expensive, with the Core model losing out to the G7 Pro in terms of features and customisation options, while costing £125. The full-fat version takes things up to a stonking £170, but there’s more customisation there. Both Elite’s also let you tune the thumbstick tension too, but there continue to be a steady stream complaints over production quality with the line in terms of reliability, and the G7 Pro’s TMR sticks will likely outlast any of Microsoft’s current lineup.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/palworld-palfarm-farming-game-spin-off/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/palworld-palfarm-is-a-farming-game-spin-off-with-online-co-op.1305099/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, PocketPair has unveiled <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4031890/Palworld_Palfarm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Palworld: Palfarm</a>, a Palworld spin-off dedicated to farming. In the game, each Pal uses its special abilities to help support your farm: those skilled at sowing will plant seeds, those skilled at watering will water the crops daily, and those skilled at harvesting will help with the harvest or assist with crafting.</p>



<p>Palworld: Palfarm is set on an island, home to many unique Pals and residents. Players can gradually deepen their relationships with the Pals and the island's people through daily conversations, working together, and occasionally giving gifts. The Pals might even play matchmaker for you with someone you're interested in. Your bond with a Pal or resident can even grow into a special relationship.</p>



<p>The game will also include some combat. There aren't just nice Pals to help you with the farm; some nasty ones raid farms or lurk underground waiting to pounce on unsuspecting farmers. Defeating them will provide resources to develop the farm further. There is even a marketplace on the island, run by residents and Pals, where players can buy and sell crops and crafted goods. Players may find rare items there. According to rumors, a forbidden black market is also hidden on the island's far side. There, players can trade all sorts of things, including guns and suspicious fertilizer. Finally, Palworld: Palfarm also supports online co-op multiplayer, allowing multiple people to work on the same farm.</p>



<p>The game doesn't have a release window yet. However, the Steam page already lists the very basic minimum requirements for the PC version:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 10 or later (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>CPU:</strong> i5-3570K 3.4 GHz 4 Core</li>



<li><strong>Memory:</strong> 16 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>GPU:</strong> GeForce GTX 1050 (2GB)</li>

<p>Palworld: Palfarm wasn't today's only announcement from PocketPair. The Japanese studio also <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1970293300939628571" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled</a> a collaboration with ULTRAKILL, the retro FPS from Arsi Patala. Gear and weapons from the cult-hit ULTRAKILL will land on Palworld soon.</p>



<p>As a reminder, the developer recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/palword-launch-2026-pocketpair-polishing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that its massively successful debut game will launch out of early access next year.</p>

			<p>During his studio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-productions-10th-anniversary-future-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10th anniversary event</a> at Tokyo Game Show 2025, Hideo Kojima shared updates on upcoming projects, starting with OD, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-od-xbox-horror-game-still-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">survived Microsoft's most recent cancellations</a>. </p>



<p>The horror game published by Xbox Game Studios received a brand new trailer featuring Sophia Lillis, who we've long known will play one of the characters alongside Udo Kier and Hunter Schafer. It does feel quite spooky, that's for sure, though it tells us close to nothing about how it'll actually play. A couple of months ago, Kojima just <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-disappointed-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mused</a> that OD will probably be the type of game that some players love with a passion and others hate right away. We'll have to wait some more time to understand exactly what he means.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The tenth anniversary livestream then went on to reveal the <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-death-stranding-animated-movie-is-in-the-works-with-raised-by-wolves-creator-aaron-guzikowski-writing-the-script/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously announced</a> new animation film project, Death Stranding Mosquito. It will be produced by ABC ANIMATION, featuring a screenplay by Aaron Guzikowski (Contraband, Prisoners, The Red Road, Papillon, and Raised by Wolves). Death Stranding Mosquito will be directed by Hiroshi Miyamoto. Obviously, this is a separate project from the live action Death Stranding film, which will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-death-stranding-movie-has-found-a-writer-and-director-in-a-quiet-place-day-ones-michael-sarnoski/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">written and directed by Michael Sarnoski</a>.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Last but not least, Kojima shared a few details about PHYSINT, the new tactical espionage action game <a href="https://wccftech.com/physint-kojima-new-stealth-ip-playstation-transcend-film-video-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made in partnership with Sony</a>. First of all, a key art was shared, presumably teasing a protagonist who looks a lot like Eddie Redmayne (despite previous rumors that the game would feature Robert Pattinson). That remains unconfirmed, but we did get confirmation of three actors: Charlee Fraser (Anyone But You, Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga), Ma Dong-seok (also known as Don Lee, previously featured in Train to Busan, Eternals, and Death Stranding 2: On the Beach), and Minami Hamabe (Godzilla Minus One). </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Kojima revealed that the recent SAG-AFTRA strike affected the project's development, delaying the casting process. That said, news on the main character's identity will come soon. Additionally, it was confirmed that 3Lateral, the team behind the MetaHuman technology (<a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-3lateral-agog-labs-unreal-engine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired by Epic Games in 2019</a>), is developing new technology to capture Minami Hamabe's likeness accurately. As a reminder, PHYSINT is still <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojimas-physint-conceptual-phase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the conceptual phase</a> and may therefore be five to six years away.</p>

Indeed, the legendary developer is working on the concepts by himself right now, making characters and thinking about casting. “It is just the start,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After a video message of support from Herman Hulst, CEO, Studio Business Group, Sony Interactive Entertainment, Kojima described Physint as the next stage tactical espionage action game. Kojima is of course famous for creating the Metal Gear franchise while at Konami.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The tech underpinning Physint is even more advanced than that powering Kojima’s Death Stranding games and upcoming Xbox Game Studios exclusive OD (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-reveals-first-trailer-for-xbox-game-studios-title-od">whose debut trailer was revealed at the show</a>), he said, because it’s due out later in the future. No release date or even release window was mentioned, but from what Kojima said, it’s OD next for Kojima Productions, then Physint, so it may be some time before we see anything meaningful on the project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kojima did tease the main character of the game via the first poster for Physint, below. It doesn’t tell us much, as it’s hard to make out even their face. We don’t know who’s playing the main character, either (expect a casting announcement at some point in the future, Kojima said). We do have the tagline "here comes the feeling," although who knows what that means at this stage?</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/23/physint-main-1758606021690.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The debut poster for Physint. Image credit: Kojima Productions.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Kojima did confirm three actors set to appear in Physint, however, each of whom delivered a video message expressing their excitement. Charlee Fraser, who played Mary Jabassa in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/furiosa-a-mad-max-saga">Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga</a>, is in the game, although we don’t know which character she’s playing. Also in the game are Don Lee, who played Gilgamesh in the Marvel movie <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/eternals">Eternals</a>, and Japanese actress Minami Hamabe, who played Noriko Ōishi in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/godzilla-minus-one">Godzilla Minus One</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kojima ended his Physint segment with a shot of Hamabe in CG form, showing off just how realistic the visuals are expected to be. We still don't know which game engine Kojima Productions is using for Physint.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In May, Kojima said Physint was still "another five or six years" away from release, suggesting a launch in 2030 at the earliest, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/could-hideo-kojimas-return-to-action-espionage-be-one-of-the-first-ps6-games">potentially on PlayStation 6</a>. Kojima told Le Film Francais that his aspirations to direct a movie were on hold at least until he had finished developing his first action espionage game since he <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/19/why-hideo-kojima-left-konami#:~:text=Konami's%20change%20in%20focus%20from,Solid%20V%3A%20The%20Phantom%20Pain."><u>very publicly parted ways with Konami in 2015</u></a>.

It's called Death Stranding: Mosquito and, per Kojima and animation director Hiroshi Miyamoto's own words, it follows the story of a guy who sucks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We got a look at a snippet of animation from Mosquito, showing a man with something stuck to his face that has a weird tentacle thing coming out of it. He's in the water at the beginning of the clip, swimming and approaching something human-shaped that's difficult to make out. But in the second part of the clip, he's on land, in the Timefall, fighting a guy in a porter suit, still with the gooey thing on his face.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's it! Who is this guy, and what does all this mean? No idea! We do find out from a follow-up conversation with Kojima and Miyamoto that the word "Mosquito" refers to the main character, who can suck...something. Not blood! Just something. We'll find out later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was also revealed that Mosquito is being animated with hand-drawn lines that are then digitally used to assemble the animation itself. And Studio Easter, which worked on Dandadan, is doing the film's backgrounds. Additionally, Aaron Guzikowksi (Prisoners, Raised by Wolves) will write the scenario script.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn't the only Death Stranding film we're getting. We also got <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-movie-will-tell-a-story-you-havent-seen-in-that-world-director-confirms">new information today</a> about the upcoming A24 Death Stranding movie.

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Tonight, as part of the Kojima Productions 10th Anniversary livestream, called Beyond the Strand, we got a new update on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> franchise. The stream promised to be "a celebratory event" that will include "special guest appearances as well as offer a glimpse into future projects," and it certainly lived up to that promise.</p>
<p>The stream began with a quick recap of Kojima Industries' history so far, from inception through to the announcement and launch of Death Stranding, Death Stranding 2, and the reveals of both OD (2023) and Physint (2024). Towards the end of the project, Guillermo del Toro, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a>, George Miller and Mamoru Oshii took to the stage to talk about the future of entertainment, gaming, and art. Notably, all of the speakers talk about going 'off-screen' with storytelling.</p>
<p>Then John Hanke, founder of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokemon Go</a> developer Niantic and now boss of Niantic Spatial (an 'AI-led geospatial business platform'), joined Kojima on-stage to present a section devoted to how Kojima plans to 'move beyond the screen,' where the Japanese developer envisions "going to the top of a mountain, and even finding entertainment there".</p>
<p>There's no real hint as to what this project will be beyond a fluffy teaser trailer that seems to be Pokemon Go-meets-Death Stranding. "Kojima Productions and Niantic Spatial Team Up to Redefine Immersive Entertainment" reads a blurb on the trailer, as people wonder around interacting with virtual bonsai trees, golden aura, and other weird environmental aspects. It all looks like stuff from the chiral network in the Death Stranding games, so I imagine our job - as porters via our phones or smart glasses, per the trailer - will be to connect things up.</p>
<p>You can see the latest trailer for Death Stranding x Niantic as part of the livestream below.</p>

<p>This seems like very early concept-level blue sky thinking. It's worth noting that Niantic Spatial isn't quite Pokemon Go developer Niantic: the company was split into a games and geospatial division earlier this year, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-will-be-sold-to-monopoly-go-maker-scopely-niantic-confirms">the gaming development arm going over to Monopoly Go maker Scopely in a deal worth $3.5bn.</a>
</p><p>Niantic Spatial focuses on a refreshed version of Niantic's original core interest - creating a digital map of the planet, now using geospatial AI. The newly-rebranded company has secured $250m of capital investment ($50m from Scopely and $200m from Niantic's own balance sheet), and this is the first game-related project we've seen from the company.</p>
<p>"We're in the midst of seismic changes in technology, with AI evolving rapidly," Niantic founder John Hanke wrote when talking about the goal of the Spatial platform. "Existing maps were built for people to read and navigate but now there is a need for a new kind of map that makes the world intelligible for machines, for everything from smart glasses to humanoid robots, so they can understand and navigate the physical world.
</p>
<p>It seems Kojima wants to leverage this tech, and paste a Death Stranding experience on the top of this evolving tech that is as-yet-untested in a gaming environment.</p>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> received a warm reception when it launched earlier this year, with Eurogamer calling it a "busier, louder, and more emotionally resplendent take on this singular hiking sim" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review">our four star review</a>.
</p>
<p>We're also expecting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-animated-movie-with-original-story-on-the-way-with-raised-by-wolves-writer-attached">a Death Stranding animated movie</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-casually-reveals-a-death-stranding-anime-is-in-the-works">an entirely different Death Stranding anime</a> with an original story, too.
</p>
<p>"I love the world of Death Stranding, it's so creatively freeing, so beautifully dark and yet hopeful; I'm so excited and honoured that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a>, whose work I've long admired, has invited me to dwell within his creation, to birth new stories into this fertile, mind-bending universe," says Raised by Wolves creator Aaron Guzikowski, who is penning the script for the animated feature.</p><p>It's clear the series has some life in it yet, and even with games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/od">OD</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/physint">Physint</a> on the way from Kojima Studios, the storied developer is a long way from giving up on this particular baby, just yet.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Kojima Productions has released a brand new teaser for its upcoming Xbox title OD, with the new teaser called OD Knock which is really rather creepy. Much of it is seen from a first person perspective, with the character walking into a room and lighting candles. It sounds fine but there is one candle in the shape of a baby and when it is lit you hear a baby cry. Another candle in the shape of a head bleeds when lit, plus there is the picture of the eye on the window that is watching everything unfold. That’s all before whatever is knocking on the door enters the room.</p>
<p><iframe title="OD - KNOCK Teaser Trailer - [ESRB] 4K" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eHCqxLtwy5g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The trailer does not give much away about what OD is, except it looks like it will be some kind of psychological horror with occult vibes. What we know is that it is being touted as &nbsp;a game, a movie and something completely new as well. it uses Unreal Engine, 3Lateral and Metahuman technology. Jordan Peele, the director of movies like Nope and Get Out, is collaborating with Kojima Productions so there will be some creepiness and messages within the story. OD will star Sophia Lillis, Hunter Schafer, and Udo Kier.</p>
<p>There is no release date yet for OD, but the game is now in full production following the release of Death Stranding 2. OD is an Xbox exclusive.</p>

<figure><a title="Zelda: Ocarina of Time" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/22378a2e0cf02/zelda-ocarina-of-time.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Lego released its first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda</a>-themed Lego set last year after ongoing rumours, which <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/01/lego-zelda-deku-tree-set-rumours-resurface-online">turned out to be accurate</a>. Now, in an update, there's a new rumour doing the rounds about the next set in this particular series.</p>
<p>Instead of a hybrid set bringing together two different games, this next one is rumoured to be based solely on Link's N64 outing, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_ocarina_of_time">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a>. According to a story from <a href="https://youtu.be/b04dj4jMGgI?t=285">BrickTap</a> (<a href="https://www.brickfanatics.com/lego-legend-of-zelda-ganondorf-rumoured-2026/">via Brick Fanatics</a>), it will be a Ganondorf Diorama.</p>
<p>The product name, "which may not be final" as <a href="https://www.brickfanatics.com/lego-legend-of-zelda-ganondorf-rumoured-2026/">highlighted by the same source</a>, is supposedly '77093 Ocarina of Time Ganondorf Diorama'. It will apparently contain 1003 pieces and is expected to be much cheaper than the Great Deku Tree 2-in-1 set as a result (which contains 2500 pieces). As for the launch, it's believed to be arriving in March of next year.</p>
<p>Again, this is strictly a rumour for now, but there would definitely be plenty of potential for a Ganondorf Diorama or at least something similar. He obviously has a huge role and plenty of scenes in Ocarina of Time, so it will be interesting to see what comes of this, if it is the real deal. The Zelda series' 40th anniversary is also taking place next year, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/round-up-everything-announced-for-super-marios-40th-anniversary">and much like Mario</a>, big celebrations are expected.</p>
<p>If you haven't taken a look at the Great Deku Tree set just yet, be sure to read (or watch) our review. The 2-in-1 build allows you to create the Great Deku Tree from Ocarina of Time and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a>. At the time of its release, we called it a striking addition to Lego's growing line of Nintendo sets, awarding it eight out of ten stars.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Hideo Kojima first announced he was teaming up with Xbox for a new game in 2022, before a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23993035/hideo-kojima-od-xbox">teaser revealed</a> the <em>OD </em>name and some cast last year. We’re now getting a better look at exactly what <em>OD </em>is, in a new three-minute teaser trailer that holds true to Kojima’s promise that the game will be unique and immersive.</p><p>The trailer begins with Sophia Lillis’ character opening a red door, and then lighting candles — some of which look like <em>Death Stranding</em> babies. With rain pouring down outside and mysterious knocking sounds, it’s clear <em>OD</em> will very much lean into horror for its gameplay as Lillis’ character shakes in fear.</p><p>The trailer also shows off some of the early Unreal Engine work that Kojima Productions is undertaking for <em>OD</em>, alongside Microsoft’s assistance. Xbox chief Phil Spencer confirmed on stage at Kojima Productions’ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8uF8VQVT7I">10th Anniversary livestream</a> that development of the game is “well underway,” and that Microsoft is helping with the visuals and technical work.</p><p>“<em>OD </em>is bold, it’s unique, and it’s unmistakably from this studio,“ says Spencer. ”We’re deeply supporting the production, it’s our technical work on Unreal that we’re doing with the team, both with the flashy [elements] you see on the screen, but also a lot of the behind the scenes work.”</p><p><em>OD</em> is billed as something of a cross between a game and a movie, with a promise of exploring concepts that test “your fear threshold.” Unreal Engine will drive the experience of <em>OD</em>, instead of the Sony-owned Decima engine that powers both <em>Death Stranding</em> titles. Kojima had high praise for Unreal Engine at the 10th anniversary event, saying “the technology is one step higher than <em>Death Stranding 2</em>.”</p><p>While we know Jordan Peele is somehow involved in <em>OD</em>, Kojima did note today that the filmmaker is working on another part of the overall <em>OD</em> experience. That might be why the game is subtitled <em>OD Knock</em>, to differentiate it from whatever Peele is working on.</p><p>We still don’t know exactly when <em>OD </em>will arrive, despite promises that development is well underway. “Kojima is innovating in gameplay, story, and player engagement,” says Spencer. “We’re collaborating closely, and we’re very excited for what’s next.”</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/783409/od-kojima-xbox-game-trailer#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/783409/od-kojima-xbox-game-trailer]]></content:encoded>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Johnny Gioeli:</strong> "Everyone- the news is out that the case agasinst SEGA was dismissed. I want you to understand that the reason for the dismissal was based on time, not on ownership. The song remains in "limbo".</p>
<p>Just 2 weeks ago, I was contacted by Epic Games to potentially use Live &amp; Learn... and the amazing part is SEGA had them call ME for the rights to use the song. So- there you have it. The most epic song remains in the "abyss of ownership".</p>
<p>The song is mine. I wrote it with June, I sing it, I created the melody, I recorded my vocals in my studio, and they do not own it.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone for your endless support and love. Life isn't always fair... but we all move forward in love and music. - Johnny</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the original court documents, Gioeli received no compensation, and judgement is in favour of Sega, with the action dismissed in its entirety. If we hear any significant updates or developments, we'll let you know.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Released back in July for the Switch 2, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> lets you go bananas as Nintendo’s giant ape character Donkey Kong. Players can explore and find goodies by freely punching, smashing and digging their way through bizarre and colorful open-world levels. The game’s quirkiness and fruit-obsession extends to the varied sound effects — many of which were made by the staff themselves. Apparently, a lot of biting and eating was involved…</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a recently published interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202509/50508" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Famitsu</u></a>, Donkey Kong Bananza’s producer Kenta Motokura explained: “The noise you hear when digging is actually the sound of someone eating watermelon. The sound team actually bought watermelons and recorded those sounds.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, apparently this was not exactly a relaxing snack break: “Since they couldn’t do many takes, the recording sessions were apparently very tense,” one of the game’s directors, Wataru Tanaka, revealed.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://www.ndw.jp/dkbananza-interview-250820/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Nintendo Dream Web</u></a>, sound director Naoto Kubo went into even more detail about the level of dedication that went into capturing and manipulating foley sounds to create Donkey Kong Bananza’s satisfying noises.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He noted that the team “recorded a huge variety of (real-life) sounds,” which were then adjusted and readjusted before being added into the game. “We spent years creating things like rock destruction sounds, investing that much time and effort in meticulous adjustments,” Kubo explained, adding that the in-house sound team created all the effects you hear in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Donkey Kong Bananza employs a variety of sound effects depending on what you are making Donkey Kong interact with. The sound when you punch watermelons in-game was actually made by smashing actual watermelons. However, Kubo recalled that this was a tough one to get right.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“By the time I got around to recording them, summer was already over,” he explained. “There just weren’t any good watermelons left,” adding that he was able to capture the watermelon smashing sound the following year. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Donkey Kong Bananza: DK Island and Emerald Rush DLC Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For the sound effect when you interact with an apple, the team “kept biting into all sorts of things and recording it,” Kubo explained. This included apples, cookies, celery and even hard candies (ouch!). However, in the end they decided that the sound of biting into a real apple was the best. On the other hand, the sound effects for the in-game gold were produced by experimenting with metals brought from a DIY store.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other effects were created using a mixture of sounds. The team mixed some of the watermelon-smashing recordings into the sound that plays when you break a hamburger patty in Donkey Kong Bananza, because, as Kubo said, “You don’t get a very good sound when you actually bite into a hamburger patty.” The satisfying “boing” sound that rocks make when you smash through them was likewise created by mixing in a cicada chirp.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more in-depth insider info about Donkey Kong Banaza’s development, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/our-big-bananas-interview-with-the-developers-of-donkey-kong-bananza"><u>our interview</u></a> with Motokura and Takahashi, and find out why the game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-review"><u>scored 10/10 in our review</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.
