Even though it doesn’t have many proper applications, this niche movement option is a great tool to have under your belt.</p><h2 id="h84103"><a id=""></a>How to Perform Super Movement</h2><figure id="" data-id="3009c67360201d05cb63d2edee59f747" data-recommend-id="image://3009c67360201d05cb63d2edee59f747" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hit flies upward toward Great Ape Baby, trailing next to his Super Galick Gun super attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Hit flies upward toward Great Ape Baby, trailing next to his Super Galick Gun super attack." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3009c67360201d05cb63d2edee59f747" data-recommend-id="image://3009c67360201d05cb63d2edee59f747" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hit flies upward toward Great Ape Baby, trailing next to his Super Galick Gun super attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Super Movement is a technique that’s only available in the Sparking! state. That means you’ll need to charge your Ki to its maximum and beyond at the cost of a skill count. <strong>Once you’ve entered Sparking!, use a Dragon Dash (RT+A for Xbox and R2+Cross for PlayStation) and then press the Guard button (RB or R1).</strong> Your character will quickly start vanishing left and right with little recovery time. Keep on pressing the button and they’ll look like they’re flickering across the stage.</p><p>You’ll mainly want to use this to dodge supers or Ultimate Blasts. With the right timing, you can even avoid supers with the most annoyingly perfect tracking. It won’t be as useful against obscenely large attacks such as a Spirit Bomb though.</p><p>Not everyone on the roster can use Super Movement. Larger characters like Toppo and Broly, in addition to giants like Great Ape Vegeta and Janemba, simply don’t have access to the technique. The lines do get a bit blurred when it comes to different forms, as Jiren normally can’t use Super Movement, but his Full Power version can. I was lucky to figure that out while unlocking his <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-jiren-endings-guide-1851680142&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-jiren-endings-guide-1851680142">confusing endings</a></span>, but figuring it out for most other characters will just be trial and error.</p><h2 id="h84104"><a id=""></a>Don’t Mash – Use Super Movement Sparingly</h2><p>The biggest piece of advice I can give regarding this technique is to not overdo it. Yes, I completely agree that spamming it and seeing your character zip across the screen looks awesome! Unfortunately, there are some pretty big downsides to doing this:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Super Movement drains your Ki, typically around a quarter of a bar. With the Ki gauge already depleting in Sparking! and Super Movement costing a bar with just a few uses, it’s easy to waste your limited time in this high-powered state.</li><li>Your character won’t be moving around randomly – there is a pattern. Super Movement has you quickly swaying from side to side. This doesn’t mean the opponent will be able to easily hit you, but it is possible to dodge and then zip right back into a rush super or beam attack.</li><li>The technique will typically track toward your opponent. It’s pretty great for quickly converting from one direction back to the enemy, but sometimes it’s too quick for the camera to keep up. This is especially notable when using Super Movement with the stick pushed to the side, as the camera will struggle to stay focused on you.</li></ul><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-rush-super-landing-guide-1851673589&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-rush-super-landing-guide-1851673589"><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em>’s Rush Supers Can Be A Super-Rush Once Mastered</a></span></p><p><strong>As cool as it looks, I strongly suggest performing Super Movement only once or maybe twice at a time.</strong> It only takes one well-timed use to dodge a super or ultimate blast. The only reason to spam it a little is if you’re dashing straight to your opponent and want to freak them out a bit. It can look pretty intimidating when someone is zigzagging at high speeds in your direction.</p><h2 id="h84105"><a id=""></a>Consider Some Ability Items</h2><figure id="" data-id="e918ec1386b894e4e9fe390100f3862b" data-recommend-id="image://e918ec1386b894e4e9fe390100f3862b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Ability Items tab in the Shop menu, with The Secret to Super Movements item highlighted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Ability Items tab in the Shop menu, with The Secret to Super Movements item highlighted." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e918ec1386b894e4e9fe390100f3862b" data-recommend-id="image://e918ec1386b894e4e9fe390100f3862b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Ability Items tab in the Shop menu, with The Secret to Super Movements item highlighted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Being careful with Super Movement isn’t the only tip we’re sharing. If you need extra leeway to work around Super Movement’s limitations, or maybe just want to flex with it more, you might want to consider making room for some choice Ability Items.</p><p>The primary issue we want to treat with these is how much the technique drains your Ki. In addition to general Ability Items that help conserve Ki, some specifically work with Super Movement. Here are the ones to look out for:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>The Secret to Super Movements – Reduces the cost of Super Movements for the Sparking! Gauge.</li><li>The Secret to Dragon Dashes – Reduces the Ki needed for Dragon Dashes.</li><li>Style of the Strong – Sparking! Mode lasts longer.</li><li>Dragon Heart - Increases Skill Count after dodging a Blast or Ultimate Blast with a High-Speed Movement.</li></ul><p>Super Movement is certainly one of the more niche mechanics in <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em>, with plenty writing it off as being useless. While many are rightfully sad that spamming can be detrimental, you can benefit from mastering this. It’s still obscure enough that you can scare or confuse the hell out of someone online using it. Plus, I can confidently say that nothing has felt as cool as dodging a beam super and flying alongside it to deliver a beat down. It gives big power level energy and we should all be here for it. </p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

WoW Tokens are available for $20, and these can be re-sold through WoW's in-game auction house in exchange for gold. That gold can then be exchanged for $15 worth of Battle.net balance after Blizzard's $5 cut. With the Battle.net balance, you can buy anything from the Battle.net store, including Avowed when it releases in February 2025.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1583465677" data-promo-id="0"

A total of five WoW Tokens would be necessary to buy the least-expensive version of Avowed, for a total of about 1.4 million gold.</p><p>This is a pretty roundabout method of buying a game like Avowed, but it is possible, at least in theory.</p><p>Avowed launching on Battle.net caught some people by surprise, but it isn't totally strange, as Microsoft now owns Battle.net by way of its purchase of Activision Blizzard. The game's $70 standard edition and $90 digital premium edition (which comes with five-day early access) will both be available on Battle.net.</p><p>Alternatively, Avowed will launch on Xbox Game Pass for Ultimate subscribers. Avowed was originally set to launch in 2024 before being delayed to 2025. The delay wasn't for quality reasons, however, but came down to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-says-avowed-was-delayed-due-to-scheduling-not-quality/1100-6527757/" data-ref-id="1100-6527757">scheduling it to help Game Pass</a>.</p>

Its </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://embracer.com/summary/interim-report-q2-fy-24-25/#press-release">interim report</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> shows the Entertainment/Services and Games divisions—and the latter's individual PC/Console, tabletop, and mobile sub-segments—had downturns across the board.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">PC/Console games had the biggest decline: net sales fell to 2.12 billion SEK ($193.2 million), down 46 percent year-over-year. CEO Lars Wingefors contributed that decline to the lack of new releases: whereas 2023-2024's second quarter had </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Payday 3 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Remnant II, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">the 2024-2025 quarter mainly saw a re-release of the original </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Epic Mickey </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and the 1.0 launch of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Satisfactory</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Wingefors, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Epic Mickey: Rebrushed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> had "slower than expected" digital sales, despite its positive reception, while </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Satisfactory </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">reportedly performed above expectations and saw a "solid inflow" of new players. The Entertainment/Services division also had a sizable tumble of 35 percent, which was attributed to "few new releases."</span></p><p>Embracer cited 'few new releases' as reason for declines in its PC/Console game sub-segment.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Mobile games had less of a fall at 1.36 billion SEK ($123.9 million) in net sales, which translates to a roughly 8 percent decline compared to 2023-2024's Q2. Wingefors believes the improved market conditions that drove player activity and improved revenue growth for this quarter will continue through the fiscal year's second half.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the interim report, Wingefors also commented on Embracer's recent </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/embracer-divests-mobile-studio-easybrain-in-1-2-billion-deal">$1.2 billion sale</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of mobile developer Easybrain, which he hopes will "put us in a much stronger position to drive value, both in the short- and long-term."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite a 5 percent dip in net sales, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/former-embracer-coo-asmodee-should-be-great-at-handling-900-million-debt">Asmodee</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (or the tabletop sub-segment) was commended for having a "strong execution" between July and September. Asmodee's decrease in publishing partners was said to be balanced out by a growth in the games published during the quarter.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Looking ahead, Embracer expects growth in earnings for Entertainment/Services during the third quarter, along with lower earnings for the larger 2024-2025 fiscal year. Growth in the Entertainment division is expected to come from the Lord of the Rings: War of the Rohirrim anime film, which bows on December 13.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As for the losses, that can be owed to adjusted expectations for the first half of the fiscal year, and several PC/Console games that have already been (or are expected to be) delayed, such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hyper Light Breaker</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Some of these titles will come out during the second half of the fiscal year, while others are expected for the 2025-2026 period.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking of losses, Embracer's report also shows it now has 128 game projects in development (-36.3 percent year-over-year), and employs 6,250 game developers (-41.3 percent year-over-year).

That includes “40,000 groups with names that included hateful words, with the most prominent being ‘1488,’ ‘shekel,’ and ‘white power’.” Warner’s letter highlights how the apparent preponderance of hateful content on Steam is in violation of the platform’s own <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fonline_conduct%2F">online conduct policy</a>, which explicitly prohibits “encouraging real-world violence” and posting or uploading “illegal or inappropriate content.”</p><p>“It is reasonable to question how committed Valve is to effectively implement and enforce Valve’s own, self-created Conduct Policy for its users,” the letter reads.</p><p>Content moderation has long been an issue for Steam. Valve only implemented <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/20/17882276/valve-steam-discussion-board-comments-content-moderation-review-change">moderation of its video game discussion boards in 2018</a> after previously leaving the responsibility to the developers themselves. Warner’s letter is the third sent by Congress to Valve over the last <a href="https://www.hassan.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/senators_hassan_calls_on_largest_gaming_company_to_address_online_extremism.pdf">three</a> <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2023-03-28%20Letter%20to%20Valve%20re%20policies%20on%20extremist%20content.pdf">years</a> asking the company to answer for the extremist content that has proliferated on Steam. So far, Valve has not publicly responded to these letters. And though Warner’s letter threatens Valve with “more intense scrutiny from the federal government” if it fails to take meaningful action against hate content,<strong> </strong>First Amendment protections prevent the government from punishing companies for hosting legal —&nbsp;albeit hateful — speech.</p><p>Warner’s letter to Valve concludes with a list of questions about the company’s current enforcement practices, the size of its moderation team, and what steps it’ll take in the future to limit hateful content. Warner has asked for a response no later than December 13th. Valve has not responded to <em>The Verge</em>’s request for comment.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Today, Techland announced that Dying Light 2: Stay Human has been updated to take advantage of the new PS5 Pro console <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> last week by Sony. The visual improvements empowered by ray tracing and/or higher graphics settings apply to all four presets:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Balanced:</strong> Upscaled 4K at 60 FPS. Now with increased base resolution (1512p), improved Global Illumination, Screen Space Reflections and Sub Surface Scattering Quality.</p>

<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Performance:</strong>&nbsp;Upscaled 4K with VRR, up to 120 FPS. Now with increased base resolution (1440p), better Contact Shadows, Global Illumination, Screen Space Reflections, Spot Shadows, Sub Surface Scattering Quality and Fog Quality.</p>

<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Quality:</strong>&nbsp;Upscaled 4K at 30 FPS with Ray Tracing. Now with increased base resolution (1440p), better Contact Shadows, Global Illumination and Sub Surface Scattering Quality.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It's the perfect time for new PS5 Pro owners to check out the game even if they don't own it. Sony has announced that Dying Light 2: Stay Human is part of the new PlayStation Plus lineup and will be available for PS Plus Extra and Premium subscribers starting Tuesday, November 19.</p>
<p>The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-2-stay-human-apocalypse-divided/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched </a>in February 2022 to an eight out of ten score here on Wccftech. Here's the final quote from reviewer Nathan Birch:</p>
<p><em>Dying Light 2: Stay Human is another exhilarating parkour and zombie-pummeling playground from Techland, although at times, the seams holding it all together are a bit obvious. Given the game’s glitches, minor gameplay annoyances, and crudely bisected story and world, reports of behind-the-scenes issues feel all-too-plausible. That said, the foundation here is rock solid, and Techland has proven they’re capable long-term builders, so I’m confident Dying Light 2’s embers can be stoked to a full flame in time.</em></p>
<div>
<p>Since then, Techland has improved the game with nearly twenty big patches in various areas, even adding <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-2-reloaded-edition-qa-franchise-director-talks-firearms-10-new-hours-of-gameplay-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">firearms</a>. While there are no more story DLCs planned due to the developer's focus on <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-qa-techland-on-the-games-origins-the-return-of-kyle-crane-vehicles-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dying Light: The Beast</a>, more patches will still be <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-2-will-still-be-supported-albeit-without-story-dlcs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> for the game in the future.</p>

Thunderful Group, which develops and publishes the acclaimed SteamWorld series alongside several other titles, has announced it's laying off between 80 and 100 employees as part of its second round of "restructuring" in less than a year - saying it sees "no other alternatives in order to ensure the Group's long-term sustainability and resilience".
</p>
<p>
Thunderful came into being in 2017 after the merger of Swedish indie developers Image &amp; Form and Zoink, and has since expanded to including several other publishers and developers, including Cloud Gardens studio Coatsink and Somerville developer Jumpship. In January, the company announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/thunderful-group-to-implement-restructuring-programme-affecting-around-20-percent-of-staff">laying off around 20 percent of its staff</a> as part of a "restructuring programme" management believed would "strengthen the Group's long-term competitive position", but it now seems Thunderful failed to achieve its initial goal.
</p>
<p>
In an <a href="https://thunderfulgroup.com/news-room/press-releases/2024-11-14-thunderful-group-implements-strategic-restructuring-program-doubling-down-on-third-party-game-publishing-and-scaling-back-internal-development-resulting-in-write-downs-of-220-240-msek">statement shared on its website</a>, Thunderful - which also divested its distribution business earlier this year - confirmed it was undertaking a further round of restructuring as it looks to scale back internal development and 'double down' on third-party game publishing.

<p>
"Whilst significant reductions in cost levels were achieved this year," it explained, "revenue targets have not been met and the Group is still struggling with negative cash flow." As a result, the company has made the decision to lay off a "large portion of the development team", impacting between 80 and 100 employees. Thunderful says its shift from in-house development to external publishing will "reduce the Group's fixed costs and allow for greater flexibility, enabling faster, diverse game releases by leveraging external talent and resources in a balanced manner, while still retaining some internal development capacity."
</p><p>
"It is regrettable to announce a second restructuring of Thunderful in less than a year," Thunderful Group CEO Martin Walfisz added, "but we unfortunately see no other alternatives in order to ensure the Group's long-term sustainability and resilience... We have many talented and dedicated employees, and it is with great regret that we are forced to part ways."
</p>
<p>
Back in February, Thunderful <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steamworld-build-underperformed-says-publisher-thunderful">admitted</a> last year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/steamworld-build">SteamWorld Build</a> - the first new game in the SteamWorld series since 2019 - "fell slightly short of expectations", and that it was putting the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steamworld-headhunter-is-a-brand-new-co-op-action-adventure-from-image-and-form">previously announced SteamWorld Headhunter</a> "on hold". Its most recent title, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/steamworld-heist-2">SteamWorld Heist 2</a>, arrived this August, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steamworld-heist-2-review">earning itself three out of five stars</a> in Eurogamer's review. "The core of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/steamworld-heist">SteamWorld Heist</a> still burns brightly in this turn-based tactics sequel," Katharine Castle wrote, "but its bid to go bigger and better is a risk that hasn't quite paid off."

can pay 1,100 CoD Points ($10) for a standard battle pass or $30 for the extra-premium BlackCell bundle. Call of Duty's battle pass tiers include tons of fancy cosmetic items, XP tokens, and CoD Points to earn back.</p><p dir="ltr">In the past, the standard pass has always felt like a good deal, because you'd invest 1,100 CoD Points to purchase the pass, and if you complete all the tiers, you'd earn a total of 1,400 CoD Points back throughout all the tier rewards. That extra 300 CoD Points (just over $2) could be saved or put towards a shop bundle.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 6's battle pass now only includes 1,100 CoD Points to earn back. While that still leaves you with enough CoD Points to earn back your initial investment, it's still a bummer to now be rewarded with fewer, and some people might feel less incentivized to buy.</p><p dir="ltr">You can find all the highlights of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-1-battle-pass-includes-dlc-weapons-sev-operator-and-new-blackcell/2900-5944/#29">Season 1 battle pass here</a>. This pass includes the campaign's Sevati "Sev" Dumas as a playable operator, several weapon blueprints, and even Gobblegums for Zombies.</p><p dir="ltr">On a more positive note, any of the double XP tokens you might have left over from last year's Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone have now been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/your-modern-warfare-3-double-xp-tokens-are-now-in-call-of-duty-black-ops-6/1100-6527774/">carried over to Black Ops 6</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/strinova-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher iDreamSky has announced the release date for free-to-play anime shooter&nbsp;<em>Strinova</em>, which was one of the most popular demos during the most recent Steam Next Fest event.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1282270/view/6492596291873275919" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on Steam</a>,&nbsp;<em>Strinova&nbsp;</em>will launch on PC on November 21st, which means we're less than a week away from its release at time of writing. The release is set for 4pm Pacific, so depending on your time zone, you may have to wait until the following day to check it out.</p>

<p>More specifically,&nbsp;<em>Strinova&nbsp;</em>managed to secure the top spot on the Next Fest's Daily Active Demo Players board, as well as reaching the top three in the Trending Upcoming Games list. Suffice it to say people are excited for this one.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/strinova-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=ZRpp0jxu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/strinova-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=q5OGLwBK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you've ever wished&nbsp;<em>Paper Mario&nbsp;</em>was a third-person anime shooter,&nbsp;<em>Strinova&nbsp;</em>is for you.</figcaption></figure><p>It must be said that&nbsp;<em>Strinova&nbsp;</em>has some pretty unique mechanics going for it, if nothing else. Essentially, it's a blend of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/genshin-impact" rel="nofollow"><em>Genshin Impact</em></a>-style anime visuals, arena shooter combat, and a singular gimmick that might help it stand out from the crowd.</p>

<p>With the touch of a button, your&nbsp;<em>Strinova&nbsp;</em>character can switch from 3D to 2D, allowing them to squeeze through passages, swim through ceilings, and zip up walls. You can also glide while you're in 2D form.</p>

<p>The catch is that you won't be able to fire your weapon while you're 2D, so it's kind of like moving through ink in&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/splatoon-3" rel="nofollow"><em>Splatoon 3</em></a>; you'll need to switch back to 3D in order to fire at enemies, but obviously, that will also make you a bigger target.</p>




<p><em>Strinova&nbsp;</em>will be completely free to play, and it'll boast a variety of gameplay modes, including stalwarts like Team Deathmatch. More modes and features will be added over time, too.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether this one can stand out in the crowded marketplace of free-to-play multiplayer shooters, but if you'd like to find out,&nbsp;<em>Strinova&nbsp;</em>will launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1282270/Strinova/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> on November 21st (or 22nd, depending on where you are in the world).</p>

After fans unlocked the scene in question, some weren’t thrilled at how it seems to rewrite the history of the series.

After the credits roll, we see illustrations of several key moments in the <em>Dragon Age </em>series. This includes Loghain betraying the Grey Wardens in <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>, Bartrand stealing the lyrium idol in <em>Dragon Age II</em>, and Corypheus tearing The Breach into the sky in <em>Inquisition</em>. However, the difference is these scenes are depicted with cloaked figures called the Executors. The implication is that the Executors have been pulling the strings of the <em>Dragon Age </em>universe all along, and some fans have taken this to mean that this faction has been controlling the villains of each game to do their bidding.</p><p>Epler took to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/eplerjc.bsky.social/post/3laxp3bf6mk2o&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/eplerjc.bsky.social/post/3laxp3bf6mk2o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bluesky</a></span> to clear this misconception up using the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://rot13.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://rot13.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ROT13 cipher</a></span> to hide spoilers from those who haven’t beaten the game yet. But his translated message explains that while the Executors have perhaps nudged history over the decades, Loghain, Bartrand, and Corypheus were all acting of their own free will.</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>“[T]he word choice of balanced, whispered, guided is VERY DELIBERATE,” Epler’s deciphered message reads. “No one was forced or coerced or controlled into making any choices.</p><p>It’s extremely important that ultimately everyone made their own choices. they still own the consequences of these decisions, because <em>Dragon Age</em> is still a series about people making decisions of their own free will and those decisions having consequences”</p></blockquote><p>It’s unclear just how the Executors “guided” past <em>Dragon Age </em>villains, nor do we have a concrete sense of what they hoped to gain by pushing history in those directions. Right now, the running theory is they may be involved with the Forgotten Ones, elven gods who were long removed from the contemporary pantheon elves worshipped before the events of <em>The Veilguard</em>. Whatever the truth is, <em>The Veilguard</em>’s post-credits scene heavily implies they will play a major role in the next <em>Dragon Age </em>game, but that’s probably several years away as BioWare shifts focus to the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-teaser-n7-day-andromeda-1850999958&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-teaser-n7-day-andromeda-1850999958">upcoming fifth <em>Mass Effect</em></a></span>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Professor and PhD Edward Castronova argues that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>currency stability</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>price rationality</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>proper resource distribution</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are the three pillars that will help you create a sustainable economy [2]. Let’s examine each of them in more detail.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To illustrate key principles of economic design, we will sometimes refer to "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Budget Adventure</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">"—a fictional game whose developers didn’t really care about the economy and just made things up randomly.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Pillar 1. Currency Stability">Pillar 1. Currency Stability</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Your in-game currency is the lifeblood of the economic system. If the blood circulates irregularly, the body cannot function properly. The same thing happens with a game economy: unstable currency leads to chaos and player dissatisfaction.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For the currency to be stable, it must fulfill three main functions:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ol data-testid="basic-list-ordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Medium of exchange</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> — it should be used for transactions. Imagine a game where a player can easily propose: "I’ll give you 50 gold for that helmet." This is important because it allows players to trade goods without barriers, even if their items are not directly comparable in value (e.g., trading a horse for a staff).</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Unit of account</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> — the currency should allow for the valuation of goods and services. This simplifies the process of trade and makes meaningful discussions about the value of different items in the game possible. A player should be able to ask, "How much is my house worth in golden dragons?" A stable currency gives players and developers a clear understanding of how much each item is worth in the game world.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Store of value</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> — players should be able to save currency with confidence that its value will be preserved. This allows them to set aside earned funds, making the game world more persistent and reliable. Players need to know that even if they take a break from the game, they will be able to use their savings when they return.</span></p></div></li></ol></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In "Budget Adventure," the currency fluctuates so wildly that players never know how much their loot is worth. One day a sword costs 100 gold, and the next day it’s 10,000. Player "PoorPlanner" decides to save 10,000 gold to buy a legendary sword. After many days of farming, he finally collects the required sum, but by the time of purchase, the sword’s price has soared to 500,000 gold. Now he’s running around with a carrot instead of a sword.</span></p><div data-component="blockquote"><blockquote><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Take a real example: in Diablo 2, by the end of the game, gold had become so devalued that players stopped using it and switched to a more stable item — the Stone of Jordan. This item completely replaced gold as the main currency, and all game items were valued in quantities of Stone of Jordan. [2]</span></p></blockquote></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Without reliable currency, the game economy becomes chaotic, and players spend more time negotiating the value of goods than on the core gameplay, which can diminish the enjoyment of the game.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Pillar 2. Price Rationality">Pillar 2. Price Rationality</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rational pricing is the foundation of player trust in your economy. Prices should reflect the real value of items and adapt to changes in supply and demand. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Armor should be expensive, and cabbage should be cheap.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, sometimes the system can break down:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Prices may be too low, creating shortages due to high demand.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Or they may be too high, resulting in a surplus due to low demand.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s also crucial to monitor the balance between production and consumption. If rare items appear too frequently, their value drops. On the other hand, if a common item becomes scarce, its price can skyrocket.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another thing the developers of "Budget Adventure" love to do is place merchants selling goods at </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>fixed prices in infinite quantities</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Such an action helps developers fix prices, but it removes players from trading in basic goods.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Pillar 3. Proper Distribution">Pillar 3. Proper Distribution</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s important that the right items go to the right players. You don’t want a mage to get armor and a warrior to get a staff, with neither being able to use these items. This causes frustration.</span></p><p>For some strange reason, players are always dissatisfied..</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In addition, players should receive appropriate rewards for their efforts. If in your game a strong player receives the same rewards as a novice, this will lead to frustration and player churn. Proper reward distribution is a balance between effort and reward that keeps players engaged and motivated.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Principles of proper distribution:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ol data-testid="basic-list-ordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>All players start on equal footing.</span></span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Players who put in more effort receive greater rewards.</span></span></p></div></li></ol></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you can balance all three aspects, you have a good chance of building an effective and sustainable game economy.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now that we’ve covered the basic principles of economic design, let’s move on to the next important aspect — the flow of resources in the game. This involves understanding how resources move and are distributed among players and systems within the game. This determines how efficient and engaging the gameplay will be.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Chapter 2: Resource Flow in the Game">Chapter 2: Resource Flow in the Game</h3><div data-component="blockquote"><blockquote><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The best moments usually occur when a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile."</span><br><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi</span></span></p></blockquote></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The movement of resources within a game is a key aspect that influences balance and player engagement. The main concepts that help manage this process include creating emotional swings and properly distributing content over time.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But how do you distribute resources correctly to keep the player from getting bored and constantly in the flow state described by Csikszentmihalyi?</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Create Emotional Swings">Create Emotional Swings</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Creating emotional swings is one of the key elements of retaining players. But to understand how it works, let’s turn to the science of the brain—neurobiology.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our brain, the result of millions of years of evolution, constantly seeks balance between stimulation and satisfaction. Two neurotransmitters play a central role in this process: dopamine and endorphins.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dopamine</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is the "anticipation hormone" that motivates us to keep going in hopes of a reward. It is activated during moments of expectation, whether it's waiting for a new level, a rare item, or defeating a tough boss. In an evolutionary context, dopamine was crucial for survival. Imagine our ancestors: searching for food, avoiding predators—these activities required constant effort and activity. Dopamine in such situations "turned on" motivation and maintained interest in seeking rewards, even when they were just beyond the horizon.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Endorphins</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, on the other hand, are released when the reward is received, causing feelings of joy and satisfaction. It’s like an internal "prize" for achieving a goal. Endorphins also have a pain-relieving effect, which literally helps us "forget" the difficulties we faced on the way to success. In games, as in life, endorphins encourage us to return to what brings pleasure and fulfillment.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now, understanding how these neurotransmitters work, it becomes clear why emotional swings are not just about playing with resources, but about the science of keeping the player in a constant state of seeking and satisfaction. It’s important not only to reward the player but also to skillfully create moments of anticipation, so dopamine drives them to new achievements, while endorphins reinforce success and the desire to continue.</span></p><div data-component="blockquote"><blockquote><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Imagine a player named </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>BeautyQueen278</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> stuck on level 189 of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Candy Crush Saga</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Every time BeautyQueen278 gets close to the final combination, but the candies don’t quite line up, her brain is literally bathed in dopamine: "Just one more try, I’m almost there!" It feels like victory is just around the corner. At this point, she’s ready to buy a booster... but here’s the interesting thing: this balance between frustration and anticipation is what keeps her playing. Finally, on the 11th attempt, BeautyQueen278 beats the level, and her brain is flooded with endorphins. She’s so happy she could soar like the candies on the screen. But you know what makes the difference here? BeautyQueen278 is not only given the victory but also a small gift—another life after so many attempts. This is the perfect balance: you’ve won, but they give you just enough resources to keep you playing without feeling totally drained.</span></p></blockquote></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Players should experience two or three different emotions in a single session. This helps maintain interest and motivation. If players experience frustration several times in a row, they may lose interest in the game. Properly managing emotions through resource distribution and level design is key to success.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Spread Content Over Time">Spread Content Over Time</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Spreading content over time is another important aspect of maintaining player interest. At the beginning of the game, you should generously distribute content to grab players' attention and give them the chance to feel successful. In the first few sessions, players should receive rewards quickly and easily. This allows them to familiarize themselves with the game’s resources and become accustomed to them.</span></p><div data-component="blockquote"><blockquote><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Imagine a puzzle game where the player has just started. On the first day, they face an incredibly difficult level and, despite their best efforts, cannot pass it. Instead of giving the player a chance to progress quickly early on, the developers decided that a level with unbeatable puzzles was a great idea. Player "PuzzleNoob" spends an entire day trying to beat the first level and ultimately decides it’s easier to delete the game than waste their nerves.</span></p></blockquote></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As progress is made, the pace should slow down, requiring players to put in more effort to earn rewards. This helps create a sense of scarcity, encouraging players to invest more into the game. For example, if players begin to struggle with passing levels, they may turn to boosters or other paid upgrades if it fits within the game’s monetization strategy.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Sources and Spend Points: Managing Resource Flow">Sources and Spend Points: Managing Resource Flow</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now, let's move on to the key concepts of resource distribution—</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>spend points</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>sources</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> [3].</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s like managing finances in your personal banking app. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sources</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—where the player earns resources.

[9]</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Imagine a new card is added to a strategic card game. The game’s main resource is called "Mana." Even the weakest effects cost at least 1 Mana to use.</span></p><pre data-component="code-block"><span data-testid="content-text">Here’s the card: 
"Get Lost You All" - Cost: 0 Mana. 
Action: You win the game.</span></pre><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This card breaks the game for obvious reasons. In most strategy games, the joy comes from interactive gameplay and meaningful choices. This card destroys all of that. When someone draws "Get Lost You All," they have no interesting decision about which card to play—it’s always the winning choice. Just draw it and win.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With this card in the game, deck-building ceases to matter. Moreover, the only likely competitive strategy would become playing as many cards as possible to increase the chance of drawing "Get Lost" before the opponent.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Let’s look at another example.</span></p><pre data-component="code-block"><span data-testid="content-text">Consider this math problem and select the correct answer below:

&lt;li&gt;x = -1 +/- √3&lt;/li&gt;

It’s a multiple-choice question where your choice doesn’t matter.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is what happens when all cards and strategies in a game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>have equal strength</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Every card you decide to include in your deck, every strategy you choose, is a choice. If all choices are equal, the choice, ultimately, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>doesn’t matter</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Earlier, I provided two opposing examples: in one, player choices determined everything, while in the other — nothing. There’s no balance here, and as a result, the game turns either into a chaotic ride or a dull déjà vu. To create an engaging experience, it's important to understand that balance isn’t about perfect power distribution but about finding that “golden mean.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Вesigner Mila Pilipenko notes, “Balance is a process, not a final result.” I completely agree with this thought, because during development, everything can change, from the storyline to the core mechanics (and, honestly, that’s something no one wishes for).</span></p><div data-component="blockquote"><blockquote><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Balance is a process, not a final result.</span></p></blockquote></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now that we understand balance is not static equilibrium but a living mechanism, let’s move on. It’s time to define the game’s core values.

From classic value theory and common sense, we know that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>time</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is the primary resource for everyone. Your task is to translate all in-game values into units of time.</span></p><div data-component="blockquote"><blockquote><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Example: Imagine a game where players need to complete 300 levels. If an average player completes 10 levels a day, we can assume that the entire game will take about a month to finish. Thus, every value in the game should be expressed in terms of the time required to achieve it. This not only helps balance the game but also makes it more predictable for analysis.</span></p></blockquote></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As a developer, knowing the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>time equivalent</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for each of your mechanics and resources gives you a powerful tool.

The answer lies in player psychology and behavior. Using virtual currency reduces the psychological barriers associated with spending real money.

Let’s dive in.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">LiveOps is a system of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Live Operations</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (abbreviated LiveOps) that supports the game’s lifecycle post-launch. I liked how Mila Pilipenko, former Lead Game Designer at Playrix, described LiveOps as essentially a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>calendar</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. A calendar of events and promotions tied to various holidays or significant dates, these events aim to offer players something unique and temporary that they won’t see in everyday gameplay. Whether it's exclusive gameplay, skins, weapons, or characters, it’s always limited seasonal content that eventually disappears.</span></p><p>This in-game calendar has more happening than my personal one!</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">How does it work? Imagine a player roaming familiar locations and completing routine quests for months (or even years). Even with constant new content, routine inevitably takes hold. Then, BOOM! A new event with special prizes, just for you, ending in only 7 days. The “need to grind” feeling kicks in, and players start engaging actively. This translates to more time spent in the game and, naturally, increased purchases. Everyone wins: players enjoy fresh content, and developers celebrate profits.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Research shows that such events not only draw back old players but also boost community engagement overall.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Borrowing from Casinos: The Dark Side of Game Monetization">Borrowing from Casinos: The Dark Side of Game Monetization</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now let’s address a more delicate topic—borrowing casino mechanics. Gambling is forbidden or taboo in many countries. However, mechanics like loot boxes, gacha, or roulette are powerful tools and have long been a staple in top games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Why? Because it </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>works</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Leading games earn billions of dollars from these mechanics. Let’s look at some figures for 2024 (according to AppMagic):</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Honor of Kings</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: $12.3 billion from in-app purchases (IAP).</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>PUBG Mobile</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: $8.5 billion from in-app purchases (IAP).</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Genshin Impact</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: $4.4 billion from in-app purchases (IAP).</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Brawl Stars</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: $1.76 billion from in-app purchases (IAP).</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All of these games use loot boxes and other casino mechanics, and in some, they are the core of monetization. For example, in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Brawl Stars</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, without gacha (loot boxes), you can’t unlock new characters, meaning you can’t fully play without spinning for chests.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Players love the thrill and uncertainty. Every time they open a chest or spin the gacha, they get a dopamine rush, dreaming of a legendary reward. It’s not just a random prize—it’s a whole psychological ritual. The anticipation of a reward, rarity of the drop, and time limits increase engagement. Every gamer has a little hamster inside, trembling with excitement for unique loot.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But there’s a flip side. Studies show a consistent correlation between loot boxes and problematic gambling [23]. A study commissioned by the UK Department for Culture, Media, and Sport noted that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>15 studies</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> confirmed a link between loot box spending and signs of problematic gambling. This issue raises concerns, and in some countries, such as Belgium and the Netherlands, loot boxes are already banned by law.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game developers I’ve spoken with feel that casino work is undignified. I exist in game dev to create new worlds, captivate players, give valuable experiences, and help people grow and improve.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But the truth is, this monetization model will continue to thrive because it’s incredibly effective.

It needs to operate independently.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Imagine telling a farmer his carrots must cost 5 silver, and an immortality potion 5000 gold.

I remember how my university professor, Igor Vereninov, told us about the problem of solving binary trees. It’s a mathematical structure where each branch contains branches and nodes that can be solved in two ways: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>top-down</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (starting from the root) or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>bottom-up</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (starting from the leaf nodes).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you start from the tree’s “leaves” (i.e., the lowest elements) and try to work your way up, the complexity of the task grows exponentially with the tree size, as does the chance of error.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Why does this happen? Because each branch depends on the nodes above, and the nodes depend on the root.

Examples include </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rise of Kingdoms</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lords Mobile</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game of War</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and the recent hit </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Whiteout Survival</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Today, many developers are already incorporating 4X elements into their games, even if they’re not strictly strategy titles. Here are some core mechanics they borrow:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Base development</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: a powerful tool to enhance player return.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Farming</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: a farm-clicking mechanic has always been popular on mobile platforms.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Social interactions</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: alliances, cooperation, diplomacy, and, of course, PvP.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Combat</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>territory expansion</span></span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Interestingly, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>genre blending</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has become another significant trend in mobile gaming. Games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Top War</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Puzzles &amp; Survival</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> add popular mechanics like match-3 or merging objects, making them more accessible to a broader audience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the future, we will likely see more games moving away from single-genre titles, such as pure action or pure arcade, incorporating more mechanics from adjacent genres to create mega-games (similar to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>mega-apps</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which combine messaging, social media, shopping, and more).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The question for you: If 4X is the peak of mobile genres, what will be the next step in its evolution? What do you think about the future of mobile gaming? Share your thoughts in the comments.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Avoid Pay-to-Win">Avoid Pay-to-Win</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There’s a trap many developers fall into when creating monetization for their games. Suppose you design a system full of paywalls, preventing players from fully accessing the game. This forces players to pay to gain an advantage over others. Just like that, you’ve created a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>pay-to-win</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> game—a model players despise.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Instead, purchasable items should be </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>bonuses</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and, more importantly, players should be able to finish the game without needing to pay. This makes in-game purchases a luxury, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>not a requirement</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. After all, players should pay not because they’re </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>forced</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to, but because they </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>want</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to support the game and enjoy additional content.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the end, remember that excessive focus on monetization can make you forget the main purpose of creating games. Why are we in this business? First and foremost, to provide an exceptional experience for players.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Major game studios, which once produced fantastic games remembered by players decades later, sometimes devolve into bureaucracy and business, forgetting their original purpose. They turn games into lifeless, dull copies of the original. You download such a game—the graphics are beautiful, there are no bugs, and the story progresses along familiar lines, but something feels </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>off</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. You may not realize it right away, but subconsciously, you sense: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>the game has no soul</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It’s just another product on the conveyor belt, created to maximize profits but not to give players a truly engaging and memorable experience. The goal is to create something that touches players, that they’ll discuss with friends and want to relive.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3><div data-component="blockquote"><blockquote><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It’s not just about ‘games,’ for me, personally, it never has been. It’s about creating something—something much larger than yourself."</span><br><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shigeru Miyamoto</span></span></p></blockquote></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The idea of a living economy in games is that it can’t be imposed. As a developer, you might say, “We don’t care, we’re just making a fantasy game.” But the problem is, with a well-built and lively game economy, the game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>feels much deeper</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to the community.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When we talk about monetization, economics, and balance, it’s important to remember that behind every chart and every entry in analytics lies a real person choosing to give you not only their money but their most precious asset—their time.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">By creating a game, you are essentially offering people a piece of your soul. Your job is to make that fragment bring joy to players and enable you to keep creating. And let’s not forget: the world of games is vast and diverse, and your unique perspective makes it even more fascinating.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Do you think your work is done? Far from it. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game worlds live on their own</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Players will continue to discover new facets of what you’ve created. They’ll debate, share experiences, and return time and again. And you? You’ll simply smile, watching as your creation comes alive for millions and brings you a stable income.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Thank you for journeying down this long road with me. I hope your future games will bring not only profit but joy to millions of players. You’re giving them moments that will stay with them for years. And that’s worth far more than any amount of money.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="References">References</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">[1] Newzoo.com (2024).

I just got back from drinking a coffee, during which I relaxed on the couch and watched a 34-minute documentary about the making of the excellent <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>.</p><p>Made by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ArchipelDocumentaries" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ever-wonderful team at Archipel</a>, it focuses on the three people you'd most want an Atlus making-of documentary to focus on: Katsura Hashino, Shoji Meguro and artist Shigenori Soejima. Visiting Atlus' HQ just ahead of the game's release and interviewing everyone extensively, it focuses on the team's decision to take a break from <em>Persona</em>, and how they went about adapting their tried-and-tested formula for a new setting and a new era. </p><p>It's <em>really </em>good. The whole thing is in Japanese, of course, but it's got official subtitles throughout (not the dogshit auto-generated ones), so just make sure you have captions enabled before watching. </p><p>Oh, and if you were wondering/worried, "This video does not include any spoilers from the game's storyline".</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="A Metaphor in Fantasy - Katsura Hashino, Shigenori Soejima &amp; Shoji Meguro" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-eFkMJzc6ow?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
