		<p>Tower survivor roguelite Monsters Are Coming! Rock &amp; Road has been given a release date by Ludogram and Raw Fury, with the game coming on November 20th. There is a demo available on Steam, which will remain available even after the game is launched.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monsters are Coming! Rock &amp; Road | Date Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7kVZpnNukOU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Monsters Are Coming! Rock &amp; Road you need to defend a moving city from an endless army of monsters that want to tear the city down. To fight back, you need to gather resources like wood, stone, and gold to use to invest in defences, upgrades, and abilities to take on threats from small monsters to big bosses.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/26/monsters-are-coming-preview-tower-survivor-mash-up/">Monsters are Coming! so it’s time to get this addictive Tower-Survivor rolling</a></h2>
<p>In our preview of Monsters Are Coming! Rock &amp; Road, Stefan wrote, <em>“Monsters are Coming! Rock &amp; Road, to use its full title once more, is absolutely the kind of game I can see myself losing hours and hours to. Tower defence and bullet heaven survival games are already so satisfying in their own right, and their progeny promises much the same. I’m definitely very keen to play more, with Ludogram currently holding a closed beta test to refine it even further.”</em></p>

<p>Monsters Are Coming! Rock &amp; Road will be released for PC and Xbox Series X|S. Additionally, it has been verified for Steam Deck and the Xbox ROG Ally.</p>

		<p>The Adepta Sororitas are coming to dish out the Emperor’s justice in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/warhammer-40000-boltgun-2">Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun 2</a>, with the boomer shooter sequel letting you choose between the returning Space Marine Malum Caedo, and new character Nyra Veyrath, one of the Sisters of Battle.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun 2 - Sister of Battle Extended Cut Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-MAMOJqgiaM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Sisters of Battle are more than capable of holding their own in battle, despite having nowhere near the augmentations of the Adeptus Astartes – it’s all mad religious fervour and zeal powering their combat prowess.</p>
<p>In Boltgun 2, Nyra doesn’t have the same level of armour as a Space Marine, but she’s much more agile and can use speed, precision and just setting everything on fire to get ahead.</p>


<p>Boltgun 2 will follow on directly from the end of the first game, giving you a new branching single-player campaign to rampage through, blasting heretics, Chaos Space Marines, demons and everyone else that gets in your way. There’s new Blooletters, demonic Juggernauts and more on the way. The new campaign will visit new worlds, going from the heights of a hive city to the mangrove swamps of a jungle.</p>
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun launched in 2023 and was a great slice of old school FPS action, blended with the increasingly popular Warhammer 40,000 universe. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/23/warhammer-40k-boltgun-review/">our Boltgun review</a>, Dom said, “Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun is a brisk, brutal boomer shooter and another great reason for a visit to Games Workshop’s science fiction theatre.”</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/simon-the-sorcerer-origins</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mini-review-simon-the-sorcerer-origins-switch-a-faithful-return-to-a-classic-adventure-series.1337410/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>Simon says spells</p>
<p><strong>Version Reviewed:</strong> North American</p>
</section><section><p>If you're an adventure game fan of a certain age, you’ll have a place in your heart for <strong>Simon the Sorcerer</strong>. Part of the first major wave of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-point-and-click-adventure-games-for-nintendo-switch">point-and-click adventures</a> back in the late '80s and early '90s, Simon offered a goofy British counterpart to <strong>Monkey Island</strong>’s swashbuckling comedy.</p>
<p>The series now returns with a faithfully written prequel that will delight long-time fans. Telling the tale of the titular conjurer's beginnings as a magical chosen one, we follow Simon as he gets lost in a fantastical world, learns to wield magic, and meets his long-term antagonist, Sordid.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/simon_the_sorcerer_origins">Simon the Sorcerer Origins</a> has all the charm of its predecessors and even brings back <strong>Red Dwarf</strong> actor Chris Barrie, who voiced Simon in the first two games. The dialogue is funny, cynical, and very British. Rick Astley even pops up on the soundtrack for nostalgia-tinged opening credits sequence.</p>
<p>Our sarcastic hero is constantly breaking the fourth wall. At one point, a waypoint appears on your map, only to come crashing down into the actual environment. Elsewhere, Simon frequently looks straight at the player to comment on the ridiculously contrived situations the developers have put him in.</p>
<p>Those situations follow the tried-and-true point-and-click formula of hunting down items and finding ways to use or combine them to fulfil an ever-increasing set of goals. Your bottomless wizard hat stores things of all shapes and sizes. How you use these items in puzzle-solving is seldom straightforward, staying true to the genre’s tradition of clever frustration.</p>
<p>While obtuse solutions are expected of '90s-inspired adventure titles, the logic-stretching still frustrates on occasion. Areas are large enough that it can become a chore to wander through environments, trying all your inventory on everything around you.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a user-friendly interface and control scheme make cycling between interactable objects a breeze. Gone is the tedious pixel hunting of yesteryear; now you can flick between points of interest with the shoulder buttons, or reveal everything in the area with a push of the shoulder button.</p>
<p>There's an alternate control system for those who want a bit more of the original's cursor manipulation. Additionally, undocked mode makes full use of the touchscreen. A hint system would have been a good quality-of-life feature, but Simon will occasionally comment on potential solutions.</p>
<p>The hand-drawn artwork is charming, if occasionally clunky. The aesthetic recalls <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/return_to_monkey_island">Return to Monkey Island</a> in its stylised interpretation of the ScummVM-powered heyday. Animation can feel stiff at times, and when the camera zooms in too close, the art does not always hold up under scrutiny.</p>
<p>That being said, Simon the Sorcerer: Origins is a solid return for a beloved series, and the developers at Smallthing Studios seem more than capable of carrying on these magical adventures.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/simon-the-sorcerer-origins]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-far-behind-battlefield-6-pre-order-sales/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-is-reportedly-%E2%80%9Cfar-behind%E2%80%9D-battlefield-6-in-pre-orders-leading-up-to-launch.1337407/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-trails-far-behind-battlefield-6-on-steam-preorders">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>, based on data provided by <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/">Alinea Analytics</a>, shows that in the lead-up to launch, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 trails "<em>far behind</em>" the numbers that <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> was able to pull.</p>



<p>Setting the parameters here: this is based on data from Steam pre-order sales for Battlefield 6 and Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, 18 days ahead of their respective launches. Within that 18-day lead-up period, Battlefield 6 was able to sell close to a million copies in pre-orders. Black Ops 7 has only managed 200K pre-order copies sold.</p>



<p>These numbers start to look even worse when placed beside a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-weeks-from-release-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-isnt-in-steams-top-150-wishlisted-games-is-it-time-for-activison-to-worry">Eurogamer</a> report that spotted Black Ops 7 in the 173rd spot for Steam wishlists. It more or less paints a picture of a player base that isn't exactly looking forward to this year's entry in the long-running annual shooter franchise.</p>



<p>Of course, a few caveats, including the fact that not everyone buying Black Ops 7 on PC will do so through Steam, and that this only accounts for PC players, which says nothing of what pre-orders will be on consoles. There's also the fact that Black Ops 7 will be available on <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-removed-10-discount-on-call-of-duty-add-ons-cod-points-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-subscribers/">Xbox Game Pass for Ultimate tier subscribers,</a> which, there may be less of since the recent price increase, but that still represents a subset of players who won't pre-order because they don't need to, they know they'll play Black Ops 7 right at launch.</p>



<p>It's also difficult to really count Call of Duty out. Battlefield 6 has made some impressive strides, like how its concurrent player count on Steam has yet to fall below <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2807960/charts/#max">300K according to SteamDB</a>, the fact that it <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-sold-over-7-million-units-3-days-biggest-franchise-launch/">sold 7 million copies in just three days</a> (according to Alinea Analytics in this report, Battlefield 6 has now passed 10 million copies), and how at least in the EU, Battlefield 6 <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-eu-launch-sales-beat-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-eu-launch-sales/">beat out the launch sales for last year's Black Ops 6</a>.</p>



<p>But even that comes with a caveat because last year was the first time Call of Duty was available through Xbox Game Pass. So once again, it's difficult to say that the current fighting shape of Battlefield 6 is enough to topple Call of Duty in its peak form.</p>



<p>Particularly because it can easily be argued that Call of Duty is not in peak form, with the game in an <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-addresses-call-of-duty-identity-concerns-black-ops-6-carry-forward-black-ops-7/">ongoing identity crisis</a>. EA and Battlefield Studios are trying to take every advantage they can, and the fact that Battlefield 6 currently has an edge in pre-order sales with the PC shooter player base is definitely a point in favor of Battlefield, but empires like Call of Duty aren't toppled overnight.</p>



<p>"<em>Call of Duty has an entrenched global audience across consoles and PC - including more casual gamers - that purchases the game each</em> <em>year out of habit and brand loyalty</em>," Rhys Elliot, head of market analysis at Alinea Analytics told GI.Biz. "<em>Its causal player base dwarfs Battlefield's, and its integration with Warzone ensures that millions of players are constantly exposed to marketing, in-game promotions, and social tie-ins that convert attention into purchases.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Even if Black Ops 7 feels less</em> <em>exciting to us and the enthusiast media, the sheer reach of Call of Duty's ecosystem - through cross-promotion, platform partnerships, and content cycles - guarantees massive sales volume once the game launches</em>."</p>



<p>And of course, that'll be the ultimate test. When we have sales numbers for November 2025 and player engagement figures from the usual suspects (Newzoo, Circana, Alinea Analytics, GSD, etc.), will Battlefield 6 stand above Black Ops 7 in regional or global charts? That'll likely depend more on what players continue to see out of Battlefield, than what Call of Duty brings to the table.</p>



<p>Today, Battlefield 6 launched its Season 1 update, which included new weapons, vehicles, a new Conquest map, the launch of its first battle pass, and, most importantly, Battlefield REDSEC, the battle royale mode tied to Battlefield 6. This 100-player mode is EA and Battlefield Studios' response to Call of Duty: Warzone.</p>



<p>So far, it's off to a strong start with over <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2807960/charts/#48h">500K concurrent players on Steam</a>. If things continue to go well, then even if Battlefield 6 isn't able to beat out Black Ops 7 on the charts where it matters, it will have gained a win on perhaps the more important battle, the one within players minds that'll now clearly ring out: there's something else besides Call of Duty that's worth playing and buying going forward.</p>



<p>That said, to match the launch of REDSEC, Activision made Black Ops 6 multiplayer and zombies free for players to try out. The modes you'll usually have to pay for will be free until November 3.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dont-nod-netflix-major-ip-game-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/don%E2%80%99t-nod-bringing-a-%E2%80%9Cmajor-ip%E2%80%9D-to-gaming-for-netflix.1337404/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Don’t Nod, the studio behind Life is Strange, is working with Netflix on a new narrative-driven game. Furthermore, the title is said to be of a ‘major existing IP’.</p>



<p>If you’ve played any big narrative games this past decade, chances are a Don’t Nod title was one of them. From the recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lost-records-bloom-and-rage-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</a> to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/life-is-strange-20-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the iconic Life is Strang</a>e series, the French developer/publisher has quickly become one to watch. Now, in its half-year sales report, the company has a new collaboration: Netflix.</p>



<h2 id="h-netflix-and-don-t-nod-working-on-a-new-existing-franchise-based-game">Netflix and Don’t Nod Working on a New Existing Franchise-Based Game</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Don’t Nod announced its half-year results for 2025 in <a href="https://www.dontnod-bourse.com/en/financial-information/press-releases/?ID=ACTUS-0-94850" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a new press release</a>. The company reported that it more than tripled revenue, releasing games like Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage. While the title didn’t meet sales expectations, upcoming projects like The Lonesome Guild and Aphelion hope to turn the tide. However, the biggest news comes with the announcement of a collaboration with Netflix. The company stated that the narrative-driven project is in development at its Montreal studio. It will be published by Netflix and be based on a ‘major IP’. </p>



<p>As to what that IP may be, there are certainly a few possibilities. Personally, with the style of Lost Records, Stranger Things is a no-brainer for Don’t Nod. Given how it fits the mystery/sci-fi genre it mastered with Life is Strange, it’ll feel right at home. However, Netflix is home to many major franchises like Bridgerton, Outer Banks, Bird Box, and Wednesday, so there are plenty of options. It’ll be exciting to see how it turns out, as I’m both a fan of Don’t Nod’s work and Netflix’s catalog. </p>



<p>What franchise do you want Don’t Nod to adapt for Netflix? Do you have a favorite title of the company? Enjoy Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage?

<section><p>The N64 game's unconventional three-day time limit added an emotional touch to the storytelling that wouldn't have been possible with a more traditional narrative structure.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask celebrated its 25-year anniversary on October 26, 2025. Below, we examine how it leveraged its unconventional time-travel element to tell some memorable stories.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Even a series as storied as The Legend of Zelda has produced a black sheep or two in its long history, but perhaps no installment is as divisive as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/" data-ref-id="5000-1271">Majora's Mask</a>. The second Zelda title released for the Nintendo 64 and the follow-up to the universally acclaimed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/" data-ref-id="5000-1272">Ocarina of Time</a>, Majora's Mask retained much of its predecessor's mechanics and assets, but it reframed them with a recurring three-day structure that proved to be controversial among fans at the time. But while this unconventional time loop contributed to the game's divisive reputation, it also gives it a unique identity among the series, and is the reason the game remains so moving more than two decades later.</p><p dir="ltr">Although Majora's Mask revolves heavily around time travel, it was not the first Zelda game to explore the concept. Time also plays a central role in Ocarina of Time, embodied in the eponymous instrument that allows Link to access the inner chamber of the Temple of Time and retrieve the Master Sword. Once he pulls the sword from its pedestal, he can freely trek back and forth between two distinct ages: his idyllic childhood, and the dark future that awaits Hyrule.</p><p dir="ltr">Majora's Mask, however, takes a much more fluid approach to time travel than its predecessor, giving Link a greater degree of control over the flow of time itself. Whereas Ocarina of Time had him repeatedly traveling between past and future to ultimately thwart Ganon, Majora's Mask sees Link reliving the same three days as he attempts to stop the moon from careening into the world of Termina. Should time run out before he can complete his mission, he'll have to use the Ocarina of Time to turn back the clock to the first day, buying himself another 72 hours to fulfill his quest--while also undoing all of the work he had accomplished.</p><p dir="ltr">This strict time limit imbues the adventure with a sense of urgency. Fail to clear a temple before the end of the third day and you'll have no choice but to rewind the clock and begin the entire cycle anew, resetting not only your supplies, but the progress you'd made. Puzzles you had completed would be undone, quests would be reset, and characters you had met would lose all memory of the encounter. Not everything reverted with the clock; some key items--and the insights you gained along the way--carried over, but you effectively started from square one every time you rewound back to the first day. This gives the game a distinct flavor compared to Ocarina of Time, twisting its familiar gameplay loop into a unique shape that sets it apart from the rest of the series.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTv_p5hEu0A" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fTv_p5hEu0A" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">But as much as the time-travel mechanic changes the complexion of the gameplay, its biggest impact can be felt in the storytelling. Nintendo leveraged Majora's Mask's time loop brilliantly when crafting the game's narrative, utilizing the repeating three-day structure to explore more personal, human stories that couldn't be conveyed through a traditional linear narrative.</p><p dir="ltr">Because the game adheres to a strict time limit, every non-playable character Link encounters in Termina follows a particular routine, which reinforces the perception that they are all going about their lives, whether or not you are around to witness them. The postman diligently makes his rounds every morning and afternoon; the traveling performers hang about the inn by day and rehearse in the square by night; and certain shops only open at specific times. These routines offer an intimate look into the lives of the various denizens of Clock Town, which in turn strengthens your attachment to them.</p><p dir="ltr">Importantly, these routines are not immutable. By interacting with certain characters at specific moments, you could change their trajectory for the remainder of that cycle. Without Link's intervention, for instance, the elderly woman from the bomb shop is destined to be robbed on the night of the first day, preventing the store from stocking the larger bomb bag she's carrying. By learning where and when the crime will occur, however, Link can be in the right place at the right time to drive off the thief, ensuring the item is delivered (and earning a rare mask for his troubles). Depending on how you go about apprehending the criminal, you can even inadvertently blow him up, which not only destroys the bomb bag he'd stolen, but also prevents you from completing a related side quest later on in the cycle.</p><p dir="ltr">This loop--reliving the same three days and witnessing every possible fate that could befall the characters you meet--adds emotional depth to the game's many side quests, and it leads to some of the most poignant moments the series has ever conjured. The plight of Anju and Kafei, the betrothed couple who are separated by mysterious circumstances just before their wedding day, receives the most attention and praise thanks to its complexity, an extensive and emotional mystery that takes several three-day cycles to fully unravel. But the most heartrending side story revolves around Cremia and her younger sister Romani, the owners of the ranch to the south of Clock Town.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4592849-9437972220-WiiUV.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4592849" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4592849-9437972220-WiiUV.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4592849"></a><figcaption>The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4592849-9437972220-WiiUV.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Despite its proximity to the city, you're unable to enter the ranch until the third day, as the main road leading into it has been blocked off by a giant boulder. By the time the boulder is removed and the trail is finally reopened, you find both Cremia and Romani mysteriously sullen; neither speaks much, and from the few words they do say, you can vaguely glean that some kind of tragedy had befallen the ranch and its livestock.</p><p dir="ltr">What happened to the pair remains a mystery until later in the game, when you obtain the Goron mask and are permitted to use the explosive Powder Keg, which allows you to destroy the boulder early and enter the ranch on the first day. At this point, you learn the pair are dealing with two interconnected dilemmas. Cremia mentions ongoing harassment from the rival ranch down the road, while young Romani enlists your aid to defend the ranch's cows from a mysterious pack of "ghosts" that invade at night. The ensuing story is one of the more fraught and involved sequences in the game, spanning all three days and requiring deft playing to aid the pair during their respective quests.</p><p dir="ltr">Even if you do manage to successfully resolve Cremia and Romani's dilemmas, however, there is still a sense of sadness lingering over the ranch come the third day. With the townsfolk planning to shelter in place there later that night, Cremia confides in Link that she is fully aware that not even the ranch is safe from the destruction the moon will wreak, and resignedly accepts the fate that awaits everyone. Romani, however, is too young to comprehend the coming apocalypse. Rather than tell her of what will happen, Cremia offers Romani her first chance to have a Chateau Romani--the ranch's specialty milk drink that is exclusively reserved for adults. And on the night of the third day, just as the pair are set to retire for the final time before the moon falls, Cremia tells Link that they'll both see him tomorrow, never letting on to Romani that the world is about to end.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a heartrending scene, especially after all the trials you've endured with the pair, and is a poignant example of why Majora's Mask remains such a captivating experience even 25 years on from its original release. Although the game's unique time loop may have been divisive among fans at the time, it allowed Nintendo to explore themes and stories it couldn't as powerfully convey with a traditional linear narrative, making Majora's Mask one of the most emotionally resonant--and enduring--games the company has ever released.</p>

<p>Lunar Software has been working on Routine since 2013 though the game disappeared from the public eye for a long time, getting <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/09/routine-sci-fi-horror-game-re-revealed-with-a-creepy-new-trailer/">&nbsp;re-revealed in 2022. </a>Routine is a first person sci-fi horror game set on an abandoned lunar base featuring plenty of retro analogue technology as you go face to face with a terrifying threat. Here’s a little bit of bullet pointed blurb from Lunar Software:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigate a retro-analogue future</strong>&nbsp;– Roam through contrasting sectors of the Lunar station, from abandoned malls to deteriorating living quarters.</li>
<li><strong>Immersive design and gameplay&nbsp;</strong>– Full body awareness, diegetic audio, and a minimal UI create a gripping and atmospheric experience.</li>
<li><strong>Explore using tools</strong>&nbsp;– The Cosmonaut Assistance Tool (C.A.T.) is vital, and players must use it to access critical terminals, navigate the environment and identify clues.</li>
<li><strong>Survive the unknown&nbsp;</strong>– Run, hide, or attempt to defend against threats, using the C.A.T. as a last resort.</li>
</ul>

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> Season 1 has just launched, the next few months promising three phases of added content to the hit first person shooter. Titled Rogue Operations, it brings three new weapons, a new map, a new close quarters and a new mode called Strikepoint. There’s also a battle pass, and this is all launching alongside the new REDSEC free-to-play battle royale.</p>
<p><iframe title="Battlefield 6 Season 1 Official Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Umw-SKuh0LY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The new map is Blackwell Fields, which brings us one of the largest maps in the game, set in the arid biome of Southern California. It brings plenty of vehicular action – with the Traverser Mark 2 armoured truck –&nbsp;lots of long range sniping opportunity, and will go a good step toward addressing one of the main complaints of the launch line up of maps.</p>
<p>Alongside this is Strikepoint, which is a squad-based elimination mode, pitting two teams of 4 against one another as they battle over a single capture point.</p>
<p>Of course, then there’s tons of cosmetics and unlocks through the themed battle pass, which has 100 tiers (some free, many premium), 6 paths to choose and 10 prestige tiers for the most dedicated players. That comes alongside a big batch of new weekly missions in the game (sadly many of them locked to the battle royale modes) to help boost your standard progressions and levelling.</p>

<p>Two more content updates are coming in the next 6 weeks, with California Resistance launching on 18th November and Winter Offensive launching on 9th December. The first of these brings a new map set in the SoCal suburbs and a new Sabotage game mode, while Winter Offensive will redress one of the New York maps to be all wintry. And then it’s on to 2026 and Season 2.</p>

		<p>Ice Pick Lodge and Hooded Horse have revealed Darkwood 2 during the ID@Xbox showcase, with the game confirmed for PC and Game Pass, though a release date is not yet confirmed. Darkwood 2 is going to be set a few years after Darkwood. You can check out the announcement trailer to get an idea of what to expect from the sequel.</p>
<p><iframe title="Darkwood 2 - Announcement Trailer | Survival Horror Game" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CR99LP_nays?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The description for Darkwood 2 says, <em>“In the aftermath of the Soviet Union’s collapse, the dying Aral Sea has become the site of an anomaly – an eerie forest that swallows everything in its path. No one knows where it came from, or why – retribution, perhaps, for humanity’s abuse of nature. All around lie the ruins of a vanished world – deserted villages, rusting ships marooned in sand, derelict oil rigs, power stations, and factories on the verge of collapse. A secret biological lab sits in silence on a remote island as roving gangs of looters, bikers, and former soldiers control the remaining population through fear. Nomads travel through these lands with no rest or respite, day or night – even walls can’t guarantee safety. As the world loses its humanity, and as the so-called corruption of the forest spreads, one can’t help but wonder – is it really better to remain human? Or would it be best to give in?”</em></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/05/14/darkwood-review/">Darkwood Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Darkwood review, Steve said, <em>“Darkwood is one of the most terrifying games I’ve ever played as it challenges you to explore and survive a dark and twisted world. Unravelling the mysteries of the night time horrors will consume you even before you try the permadeath mode. This comes highly recommended, but remember to wear your brown trousers.”</em></p>

<p>Paws for thought</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The Switch eShop is home to its fair share of cosy cat games, but in how many of them is the cat a cute little postie? Do we hear 'gap in the market'?</p>
<p><strong>Catto's Post Office</strong> is coming to fill that exact niche. This one arrived on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2908050/Cattos_Post_Office/">Steam</a> back in August, and publisher Cult Games has today announced that it is pouncing onto the eShop on <strong>2nd December</strong>.</p>
<p>We'll make this clear right from the jump: Catto's Post Office is a <em>little</em> game. Sitting at around one hour in length, this isn't going to be the kind of every-evening cosy experience that you might get from others in the genre, but it sure as hell looks cute.</p>
<p>In it, you play as Catto the Postcat, going about a day's work delivering mail to a quaint little village. Catto has a tiny hat and a postbag. He also wears a sweet little button-up shirt. <em>Still</em> not sold? There's a dedicated meow button, <em>and</em> you can knock over pots. What's not to like?</p>
<p>Here's a look at the game's key features and a few screenshots from the publisher:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>● Charming Open World: Explore a vibrant cat-themed town with buildings you can enter, such as a bakery, a florist, and a café. Admire the whimsical theming, such as pawprints on doors and cat-shaped rubber duckies, and see what easter eggs you can discover. (For example, there are only cat-friendly plants and flowers in town!)</em><br>
<strong>●</strong> Deliver Packages and Make Friends: Make deliveries around town and meet eccentric kitty residents as you go. Assist your new feline friends by completing silly tasks and unravel funny conversations with multiple dialogue choices.<br>
<em>● Everybody Wants to Be a Cat: Meow whenever you want! Hide inside boxes! Knock over plant pots, cans, and even more besides! Did we mention you can meow whenever you want? Seriously, meow whenever you want. (Meow.)</em><br>
<em>● A Wholesome Narrative Adventure: It’s Catto’s birthday and nobody’s remembered - oh no! Be whiskered away by this heartwarming tale about a hardworking Postcat who learns just how valued he is by the friends he helps every day.</em><br>
<em>● Short and Sweet: Taking only 1 hour to complete, this is the perfect snackable experience to snuggle up with for a cozy evening this winter!</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It looks like it sticks to the cosy formula that we all know so well, and we're far from being short of cat games, but come on, it sure sounds like a cute way to spend an evening in the run-up to the holidays.</p>
<p><em>Will you be adding Catto's Post Office to your Switch cat catalogue in December? Let us know in the comments.</em></p></section></article><div><p>Jim came to Nintendo Life in 2022 and, despite his insistence that The Minish Cap is the best Zelda game and his unwavering love for the Star Wars prequels (yes, really), he has continued to write news and features on the site ever since.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/authors/JimNorman"><span></span> Author Profile</a></li><li><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jimnormann.bsky.social"><span></span> Bluesky</a></li><li><a onclick="return replyTo('JimNorman');" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/#"> Reply</a></li></ul>

			<p>With each passing month, artificial intelligence creeps into more industries. That does not exclude the gaming industry, which has long used artificial intelligence to populate its virtual worlds. Still, the generative AI that is taking root everywhere offers much more power, and also much greater risk, compared to what gaming developers were used to. Big companies like <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-video-game-division-hit-significant-cuts-amid-mass-14000-layoff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-is-pushing-employees-to-use-ai-for-everything-including-producing-code-requiring-manual-fixing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA</a> are already laying off (or thinking about laying off) employees to invest further into artificial intelligence.</p>



<p>What do the actual developers think about this artificial intelligence revolution? Their takes, as you would expect, are quite varied. The creator of Super Smash Bros., Masahiro Sakurai, <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-smash-bros-creator-development-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thinks generative AI can help make large-scale development manageable</a>. Hideo Kojima, the man behind the Metal Gear and Death Stranding franchises, wants to use the technology to deal with more basic tasks while he can concentrate on the creative parts of game development and <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-sees-creating-together-with-ai-way-stay-one-step-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continue to 'stay ahead'</a>.</p>



<p>Richard Pillosu, co-founder of Spanish indie developer Epictellers Entertainment, shared a similar, albeit more clear-cut opinion <a href="https://wccftech.com/theres-no-point-using-ai-for-any-creative-endeavor-says-game-developer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview with Wccftech</a>, stating that there is no point in using AI in any creative endeavor. </p>



<p>In my <a href="https://wccftech.com/icarus-qa-dayz-creator-talks-console-edition-support-survival-genre-evolution/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent chat with DayZ creator Dean Hall</a> about his studio's survival game ICARUS, I once again inquired about the stance that Hall and the RocketWerkz team have adopted regarding artificial intelligence. The game designer likened the widespread fears surrounding AI to adults 'losing their mind' when Google's search engine and Wikipedia emerged between the late 1990s and early 2000s. Then, he added that artificial intelligence is here to stay regardless of what people do. At RocketWerkz, they haven't found a need to use it with ICARUS, although Hall said they are using AI as a coding support tool for other projects. The designer reckons there's still some way to go before a more active use case makes sense, but did not seem averse to the idea. Here's the full quote:</p>



<p><em>I'm part of that micro-generation that first had the Internet at school. It just sort of came in, and all the adults lost their minds over Wikipedia coming out and Google and it's going to be the end of information. It feels a little bit like that. I think that regardless of what we do, AI is here. So really, then, it's about a matter of how do we deal with what the impact of that is. We handcraft our maps and a lot of stuff. We like to say games are played, not made. For us, there's not really a lot of stuff that we use AI on for ICARUS because the whole idea of it is we want to sit down and handcraft an experience. That's not a judgment against AI. It's more, that's what we really wanted to do. </em></p>



<p><em>We wanted to sit down and sketch a big map out on a whiteboard and then see it come to life. Our lead world builder actually worked at Bethesda for a while and just loves worldbuilding. We do utilize AI for some of our other projects as a coding support tool. We get an AI model, expose it to our codebase, and that means you can ask it questions, which is really helpful because one person can't easily have the whole codebase in their head so that we can expose the codebase to it and then ask it questions. As to getting it actually to do work, I don't think we are necessarily quite there yet.</em></p>



<p>While actual game developers share their thoughts about AI usage in the industry, Elon Musk has thrown the gauntlet and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xai-will-release-great-full-scale-ai-generated-game-late-2026-musk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promised</a> that the xAI division would release a full-scale AI-generated game before the end of next year. It's a highly ambitious goal, but then again, the technology is advancing at an unprecedented rate.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Earlier this week, the Department of Homeland Security posted a <em>Halo</em> meme as an ICE recruitment ad, likening immigrants to violent aliens. Microsoft has declined to comment on the twisted rhetoric, but some of the franchise’s former developers voiced their thoughts.</p> <p>The meme <a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-halo-ice-pokemon-video-dhs-2000639308">posted on X on October 27</a> shows Master Chief and a fellow Spartan in a Warthog with a call to “DESTROY THE FLOOD.” It was a reference to an alien species that serves as one of the sci-fi shooter’s main antagonists; an infectious superorganism that consumes and destroys everything it touches. “Finishing this fight,” wrote DHS above the recruitment ad.</p>

 <p>In an interview <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/halo-ice-developers-react?utm_campaign=email-half-post&amp;r=155iz&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">with <em>Game File</em></a>, <em>Halo c</em>o-creator Marcus Lehto called the post “absolutely abhorrent” and added, “It really makes me sick seeing<em> Halo</em> co-opted like this.” Franchise veteran&nbsp;Jamie Griesemer, who was lead designer on both <em>Halo 2</em> and <em>Halo 3</em>, was similarly outraged.</p>

 <p>“Using <em>Halo</em> imagery in a call to ‘destroy’ people because of their immigration status goes way too far, and ought to offend every <em>Halo</em> fan, regardless of political orientation,” he told <em>Game File</em>. “I personally find it despicable. The Flood are evil space zombie parasites and are not an allegory to any group of people.“</p>

 <p>Pushing back against some fans claiming the original <em>Halo</em> games were a post-9/11 parable for fighting an army of invading religious zealots, Griesemer said it wasn’t an allegory for any specific religion or political movement. “The Prophets are not Popes, the Grunts are not Wahhabis, and the Flood are definitely not illegal immigrants,” he told <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/halo-ice-developers-react?utm_campaign=email-half-post&amp;r=155iz&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email"><em>Game File</em></a>. “The Master Chief is not a Christ figure and Cortana is not the Virgin Mary, I guess?”</p> <p><em>Halo</em>‘s collision with the Trump administration’s anti-immigration crackdown, <a href="https://news.wttw.com/2025/10/28/chicago-s-children-are-getting-caught-chaos-immigration-crackdowns">which includes “lawless” ICE raids in cities like Chicago</a>, comes as Microsoft is trying to get fans hyped for a remake of the original game coming next year that will also serve as the franchise’s debut on PlayStation. At the same time, the tech giant is pledging support for Trump’s White House demolition and the building of a new ballroom as it seemingly tries to curry favor for government contracts and regulatory approvals related to its spiraling AI investments.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6s-new-map-is-very-bad-2000639647</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6%E2%80%98s-new-map-is-very-bad.1337338/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-update-redsec-season-1-download-free-ea-ps5-steam-2000639598">On October 28,<em> Battlefield 6</em>‘s latest update</a>&nbsp;added Blackwell Fields, a new map, to the online FPS. This should be an exciting time for fans. However, Blackwell Fields is a very small, mostly empty map that isn’t much fun to play. And the community isn’t happy about it.</p> <p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6s-first-new-map-review-season-1-blackwell-fields-eastwood-update-2000638228">I got a chance to go hands-on with Blackwell Fields</a> before it was added to the game as part of today’s larger season one update, which also added a new battle royale mode and battle pass system. And after playing a few matches on it back then, I was worried. Now having checked it out in the full game and watched others play it, I’m here to report that Blackwell Fields is one of <em>BF6</em>‘s worst maps yet.</p>

  <p>It’s an odd duck of a map that feels too big and empty when you’re running around on foot, but feels too small when you’re trying to use vehicles. Snipers are king on this map and will quickly take you out the moment you spawn. Blackwell Fields also lacks a lot of interesting spaces in which to fight, mostly just being an oil field with some hills to use as cover. Not great. Flying around the map is a pain, too, as it’s so small you’ll quickly hit the out-of-bounds and be forced to turn around. (Assuming you don’t just get shot down instantly, more on that in a moment.) And to top it all off, it’s just kind of a bleh-looking map with no real distinctive features or interesting visual theming. Brownish hills, some oil drills, a few dirt roads, and a handful of buildings. Enjoy!</p>

 <p>On the <em>Battlefield</em> subreddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oi8psv/man_this_is_the_worst_map_in_bf_history_i_cant/">reactions</a> to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oi63vz/these_boundaries_make_this_map_unnecessarily_small/">the new map</a> have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oi73om/blackwell_fields_is_another_clusterfuck_lane/">ranged from “This isn’t good”</a> to “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oi8c4u/the_new_map_doesnt_bring_me_confidence_to_the/">This is very, very bad.</a>” Players aren’t happy with how small the map is and its oddly constrictive boundaries. People are also already tired of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oi6sfk/a_quick_glance_at_the_new_map/">getting sniped over and over again</a> when spawning on squadmates, as the map lacks substantial cover.</p>

   <p>But perhaps the worst part of Blackwell Fields is that the main team bases are too damn close to each other. Players are reporting that when trying to take off in a jet at their own base, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oi882b/pax_armata_jets_can_be_locked_on_without_taking/">the other team’s AA guns</a>, located in the opposite base, can be used to destroy the aircraft. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oi7tgc/blackwell_fields_enemy_base_aa_shoots_you_while/">Helis aren’t safe from this issue, either</a>. For many, it means that aircraft are effectively worthless on the map in its current state. Yikes! Further upsetting players is the fact that the new free battle royale spin-off, Redsec, features a massive map. But the paid game got such a tiny new map.</p> <p>Can Blackwell Fields be saved? Maybe. Opening it up would help, for sure, and maybe adding some more cover would, too. But really, I think EA should have just released the other new map arriving later this season, Eastwood, which is bigger and better in every way than Blackwell Fields. Unfortunately, unless something changes, that map won’t be added until a later update in November.</p>

Send your clones on procedurally generated missions and build them into cybernetic gods in mere minutes as you cut your way through hundreds of blood-thirsty mutants, drug-addled <a title="Companies > crim [24 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">crim</a>inals and mechanized soldiers. Gather resources for permanent upgrades, recruit allies, make alliances, research forbidden technologies and do your best to prepare for inevitable catastrophe.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>You play as Morgan Lee—leader of a ragtag band of resistance fighters on a prison planet Sigma. Used to house the most dangerous criminals from all known star systems, Sigma is now locked into an endless quarantine after discovery of the Substance—an ever-adapting mass of rogue nano-bots infected by a malicious alien life form. A generation later, the planet is controlled by several factions fighting for domination.</p><p>In the beginning of the game, Sigma is shaken by an unprecedented event—a catastrophic breach of the Substance inside the planet’s only mega-city, housing not only convicts, but also management of various corporations operating on the planet. Everyone is a prisoner now. As the situation escalates and technical systems that control life on Sigma begin to fail, it’s every faction for themselves.</p><p><strong>Gameplay Structure</strong></p><p>In <em>KIBORG</em> the clock is always ticking. Each mission you undertake costs you a day, regardless of its results, and every week or so, new calamity strikes. You must choose your actions carefully, balancing risks and rewards. With your every decision, with each victory and each loss, the story is moving forward. There is no “game over” screen to see and no previous save to load. You must learn to live with the consequences of your actions.</p><p><strong>Roguelite</strong></p><p>Missions are, for the most part, procedurally generated. You never know what enemies and challenges you’ll face. With dozens of enemy types, hundreds of combat modifiers and a plethora of non-combat encounters, no mission is the same.</p><p><strong>Better Killing Through Tech</strong></p><p>Vasiliy uses a piece of future tech called The Cradle to send his clones on each mission. Even if a clone dies, Vasiliy stays unharmed. Clones are equipped with nano-skeleton, that can absorb tech from the fallen enemies and transform it into a variety of cybernetic implants. There are seven implant slots and eight possible implants for each slot. It results in thousands of possible combinations where no build is the same. And all these combinations are visual—they won’t only change how Vasiliy fights, but also how he looks—something that almost no <a title="Genres > Roguelite [299 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/roguelite">rogue-lite</a> has done before. And as if it wasn’t enough, there are also hundreds of augmentations—invisible micro-implants that take no slot—to fine-tune your build!</p><p><strong>Combat</strong></p><p>When fists start flying, Vasiliy isn’t limited to cyber-tech only. The hand-to-hand combat is as deep, as it is brutal, with a wide variety of defensive and offensive options. Dodge, block and parry enemy strikes, mix different combos and special attacks, use your environment to devastate your enemies. Swing various melee weapons to gain a bloody edge over your opponents or just shoot them in the face with one of the many powerful firearms. But manage your resources carefully: ammo is scarce, melee weapons can break easily, defensive options drain your stamina while special strikes cost energy that you recharge with basic attacks.</p><p><strong>Take a Moment to Rest</strong></p><p>Your base is your fortress, a haven between missions. Chat with your allies (all with strong, eclectic personalities), listen in to their conversations or to news broadcasts, meditate in the garden, admire your collection of trophies, train in <a title="Genres > Virtual Reality [206 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/virtual-reality">virtual reality</a>. Or craft power upgrades to help you in combat.</p><p>Because in <em>KIBORG</em>, the clock is always ticking.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Switch Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Kiborg - Nintendo Switch Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kbfT2hgBvjs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/kiborg-coming-to-switch-on-december-9]]></content:encoded>

<p>Don’t Nod has traditionally developed its own original choice-driven stories, so this marks the first time it will work on an existing IP. &nbsp;This game will undoubtedly be based on one of Netflix’s original properties, so your guess is as good as ours as to what it could be. <em>Stranger Things</em>? <em>Wednesday</em>? <em>Beef</em>? An interactive fourth season of <em>Glow</em>? Please let it be that last one.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, this Netflix partnership isn't the only new project Don't Nod has in the works. It revealed an intriguing sci-fi game called Aphelion during this summer's Xbox Showcase, and you can learn more about it <a href="https://gameinformer.com/xbox-games-showcase/2025/06/08/aphelion-is-a-sci-fi-game-game-about-crashing-on-an-alien-planet">here</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/10/28/life-is-strange-developer-dont-nod-partners-with-netflix-for-game-adaptation-of-a-major]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Developer poncle has released a new update for Vampire Survivors that adds Balatro characters, weapons, and more, alongside additional Castlevania content and online co-op. It's out today for PlayStation, Xbox, PC via Steam, and mobile devices, and will hit Nintendo Switch and Epic Games Store versions of the game this Friday, on October 31.&nbsp;</p><p>Courtesy of an official partnership between poncle and LocalThunk and PlayStack, the Ante Chamber update is free for all players on all platforms, and it brings four new characters to the game: Jimbo, Canio, Chicot, and Perkeo. Plus, it adds four new weapons and evolutions in the form of Infernolatro, Gros Michel, Fibonacci Seltzer, and the Celestial Booster, and you can use these new weapons on the new stage available in this update, The Ante Chamber.&nbsp;</p><p>"Enter the Ante Chamber, an extradimensional analogue of Balatro's user interface," a press release reads. "Battle buffoonish foes on a facsimile of Jimbo's home turf accompanies by a new ally, the Outer Saboteur, a silly little sidekick that steals your coins to throw them at enemies."&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gB0begpTOdQ"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gB0begpTOdQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Elsewhere in the Ante Chamber Update are "Survarots," which are a new form of power creep that is currently being tested through Secretino in the base Vampire Survivors game, but something that all Ante Chamber characters can use. The press release describes Survarots as "vaguely similar to Arcana cards but are themed after characters from Vampire Survivors and provide different types of bonuses." The Ante Chamber features Survarots as a sort of preview before this power creep makes its way to the base game.&nbsp;</p><p>Update 1.14 also includes more content for last year's Ode to Castlevania expansion. This expansion is getting 16 new characters, with poncle promising these ones are even more obscure than the last drop of characters, a new adventure ("the biggest poncle's ever made"), 16 new weapons and weapon unions, and 12 new music tracks. This extra content is free to players who already own the Ode to Castlevania DLC, which you can purchase for $3.99. You can find more details about this expansion <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3210350/Vampire_Survivors_Ode_to_Castlevania/">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KW3ZFbMPD2I"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KW3ZFbMPD2I" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Another big aspect of today's update is online co-op, which allows players to to roam freely wherever they want without being tethered to their co-op partner on the screen. To start an online session, select "Online" from the main menu and choose to host or join a game.

		<p>There is a new action RPG coming to town with ChillyRoom announcing Loulan: The Cursed Sand, which is set to come to PC and PS5, though a release date is yet to be set. Players take on the role of a skeletal warrior that has a sand form, which in turn provides some sand based combat powers to take on the various enemies that will be attacking him.</p>

<p>Loulan: The Cursed Sand is set in China along the ancient Silk Road where the lost kingdom of Loulan is located with its ruins piercing the sand. The story focuses on the skeletal warrior, a fallen Royal Guard, who has returned to the fallen kingdom to find his love who is also the princess. The description from the development team about Loulan: The Cursed Sand says:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Cursed Warrior of Dual Forms:&nbsp;</strong>Control the skeletal warrior “The&nbsp;Cursed Sand”, freely switching between bone and sand forms to experience entirely different combat styles and story interactions.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Realistic Melee Combat Against Many:&nbsp;</strong>Engage in grounded, one-against-many melee battles from a dynamic top-down perspective, where terrain design, enemy composition, and combat mechanics intertwine to test your skill and strategy.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Diverse and Creative Sand Abilities:&nbsp;</strong>Learn and wield unique sand abilities to solve puzzles, explore intricate levels, and experiment with multiple combat styles and tactical approaches.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Formidable Elites and Bosses:&nbsp;</strong>Face thrilling one-on-one encounters with powerful elite enemies and colossal bosses that challenge your mastery and reflexes.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Ancient Western Fantasy World:&nbsp;</strong>Explore a mysterious world inspired by the lost Kingdom of Loulan along the Silk Road, featuring diverse regions and atmospheric, handcrafted levels.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>ChillyRoom has stated that it is working on planning the localisation of Loulan: The Cursed Sand into different languages, and will have more details when those plans are finalised.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Pathea Games, the studio known for games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/my-time-at-portia-review-dont-make-me-leave/">My Time at Portia</a>, My Time at Sandrock, and the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/my-time-at-evershine-is-first-confirmed-game-for-nintendo-switch-2/">My Time at Evershine</a> has just shadow-dropped something you'd be more likely to expect from <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/knockout-city-dodgeball-is-life/">Velan Studios after its game Knockout City</a>, or even <a href="https://wccftech.com/rocket-league-bans-bots/">Psyonix</a> as a spin-off from Rocket League with Superball, a new free-to-play 3v3 arcade hero football game that's out now on PC and Xbox Series X/S.</p>



<p>Announced during the ID@Xbox and IGN Showcase, Superball is described as a mash between Rocket League, something that's made extremely obvious with its giant ball and arena style, and Overwatch with its hero character elements.</p>



<p>You play as one of 17 characters that each slot into one of three categories: goalkeepers, midfielders, and forwards. Goalkeepers are your slower, bulky characters that can protect their net with shield abilities while also sporting a massive long-distance shot.</p>



<p>Midfielders are your agile two-way players who can help out on offense and defense, and finally forwards are your offensive-focused powerhouses built to score goals and not much else.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>After years of iteration, sleepless nights and many Chongqing hot summers, our team at Pathea is thrilled to finally bring Superball to players</em>," said lead producer Guo Yuheng in a press release. "<em>We're incredibly grateful to our community for their patience and for sticking with us on this journey. What started as a PvP mech combat game evolved into something much bigger and polished, when a football-inspired side mode captured the team's imagination. We can't wait to see everyone jump into the arenas, unleash their favorite heroes, and help shape the future of Superball together with us</em>."</p>



<p>Superball began its life as 'Super Buckyball Tournament,' and has been in the works since 2019 under that name before becoming 'Superball' in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1059110/view/4264427597941058609">July 2024</a>. After multiple delays along the way and player beta and alpha tests in the meantime, it's finally here for players on PC and Xbox Series to dive into. There's no word yet as to whether it'll come to PlayStation and Nintendo consoles, but that's likely always a possibility at some point in the future.</p>



<p>Alongside its standard 3v3 mode, players will also be able to check out four extra modes called Slam Dunk, Dodgeball, Icebreaker, and Divine Path. As it's a free-to-play live service game, it's also launching with a Season 1 battle pass, but a bit of a wrinkle in the game's F2P structure is that you'll only get 72 hours from when you sign up with the majority of the game's heroes.</p>



<p>After that, you have to unlock the rest of the characters by grinding for them, after using your single voucher to unlock whichever character you preferred in your 72-hour window to try them all out.</p>



<p>Superball is also available on Xbox Game Pass, though considering it's a free-to-play game, that's a fairly moot point. </p>
