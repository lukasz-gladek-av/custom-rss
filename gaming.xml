            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/acquire-60th-anniversary-edition-board-game-review.1117704/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/acquire-60th-anniversary-edition-board-game-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">1964 was a busy year. President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act, The Beatles made their way to New York City, and the Olympics were held in Tokyo. But for our purposes, it also marked the wide release of the board game Acquire. Now, more than 60 years and multiple editions later, Renegade Games has the reins on this historic hotel-building powerhouse, releasing both a premium 60th Anniversary Edition in 2024 and its retail counterpart in 2023. While these new versions may have a fresh coat of paint, they still maintain the same wonderful gameplay that has kept it around for six decades and landed it on our list of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-classic-board-games">best classic board games</a>.</p><div id="215711" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="578d7190-f9d3-4f11-9bcb-7e0a0d6f6c4e"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Acquire 60th Anniversary Edition</h3></p></div><div catalogid="578d7190-f9d3-4f11-9bcb-7e0a0d6f6c4e" id="159919"><div id="159919" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Acquire</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Acquire plays with two to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-6-player-board-games">six players</a>, where everyone lays tiles, establishes hotel chains, and purchases shares of stock – all with the hopes of getting big returns on their investments. While the theme may not sound the most enthralling compared to other games on your local game store’s shelves, there’s a reason Acquire has been around for more than 60 years. It’s easy to teach and has a deceptive amount of strategy involved – so much so that it was even featured at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rdQlj9BVA" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>World Series of Board Gaming</u></a> tournament last year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On your turn, players will pull a tile – each with a grid coordinate printed on it – and place it on the board in its corresponding spot. When a tile is placed and creates a minimum of two adjacently connected ones, a hotel is formed, and its founder gets a share of its stock. The larger a hotel chain grows, the more expensive each share of stock becomes, but also, the greater the payout when that hotel gets acquired and absorbed into a bigger hotel. So, buying low and selling high is the name of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These latest versions from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/producer/renegade">Renegade Games</a> offer a new variant rule known as Tycoon Mode, which makes it easier for players who aren’t in the lead to stage a comeback. In the traditional Classic Mode, only the first- and second-place owners of a hotel chain – the two who own the most stock – get the payout when it’s acquired. Tycoon Mode expands this benefit to the third player as well. While I prefer the classic option, I appreciate this variant’s inclusion to help ease new players into the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unique to the 60th Anniversary Edition are a set of special power cards that tweak the gameplay further. These cards provide powerful bonuses, such as playing four tiles at once or buying three stocks for free. While these cards dramatically change the game, I found them to be too powerful and game-altering for my tastes. After a single playthrough with them, I haven’t gone back and have no real desire to. However, like Tycoon Mode, they are optional, so they're worth trying out to see if they suit your style.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regarding the differences between the main retail release and the 60th Anniversary Edition, the $50 price difference comes with enough tweaks and adjustments to make the premium edition worth considering. Gameplay and core components (tiles, board, and cards) remain the same – with the exception of the power cards – so the main differences lie in the components.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are three main upgrades in the premium version that make the investment worthwhile: a drawstring bag for tile selection, a removable insert for organizing share cards and hotel miniatures, and replacing paper money with sturdy poker chips.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the surface, these may not seem like major upgrades – or worth the additional cost – but the improved organizer and drawstring bag significantly enhance the experience. Storing and blindly grabbing tiles from a bag eliminates the need to manually flip over tiles during setup, making the game flow much smoother. If you opt for the base edition, I highly recommend finding a bag to use.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another helpful addition exclusive to the Anniversary Edition is the redesigned plastic organizer, which stores share cards in their own separate container with a plastic lid. This allows the cards, which are held upright in grooves alongside their corresponding hotel miniatures, to be placed more conveniently. In contrast, the base edition’s organizer is the size of the entire game box, which, while functional, takes up more table space. Most players would likely prefer having the cards placed separately on the table.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last exclusive upgrade is purely cosmetic: replacing paper money with poker chips. Personally, I detest paper money in board games and believe it should have stayed in the 1960s. A significant portion of the Anniversary Edition’s increased price comes from this component upgrade, but what an upgrade it is. The chips have a nice weight to them, are neatly stored in their own container, and help keep the game organized. Plus, they’re simply more satisfying to handle than flimsy paper bills – there’s just something about that clinky sound.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Where to Buy</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Acquire: 60th Anniversary Edition (MSRP $99.99)</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/zj4Xqe?object_uuid=dc6ebc17-4e83-48b4-ad84-26212523dd94&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0D7MSX6PR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a> | <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3ReLK?object_uuid=dc6ebc17-4e83-48b4-ad84-26212523dd94&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Atomic Empire</a> | <a href="https://zdcs.link/QpXYp4?object_uuid=dc6ebc17-4e83-48b4-ad84-26212523dd94&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Walmart</a></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Standard Edition (MSRP $49.99)</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/7XxGD?object_uuid=dc6ebc17-4e83-48b4-ad84-26212523dd94&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a> | <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKO4n8?object_uuid=dc6ebc17-4e83-48b4-ad84-26212523dd94&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Atomic Empire</a> | <a href="https://zdcs.link/znXYgx?object_uuid=dc6ebc17-4e83-48b4-ad84-26212523dd94&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Walmart</a></li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">See More Strategy Board Games:</h3></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Feb 24, 2025 7:25 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Acquire is one of those games I can always fall back on for game nights, knowing it will be a great time. We even have it on our list of the best classic board games. The Renegade releases were my first foray into the game, but it quickly became apparent why it has endured for so long. It’s easy to learn, quick to set up (especially with the Anniversary Edition), and offers a low barrier to entry while maintaining a high skill ceiling. This is especially true thanks to the new Tycoon Mode and power cards, which make it more accessible for younger and newer players.
Whether you get the base version or the more expensive Anniversary Edition, Acquire is an easy recommendation for any board game collection.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/jump-ship-preview-its-sea-of-thieves-meets-left-4-dead-and-its-even-more-polished-and-fun-than-last-year<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">It was almost exactly one year ago that I walked into a meeting during the Game Developer’s Conference and first got introduced to Jump Ship, a four-player sci-fi PvE shooter that blends mechanics from Sea of Thieves, Left 4 Dead, and FTL into something I thought was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/jump-ship-plays-like-a-mix-of-sea-of-thieves-left-4-dead-and-ftl">extremely special</a>. I recently had a chance to play the latest build with a few of the developers, and let’s just say that if any indie game can break out big in what’s already an absolutely stacked year of releases, I’d bet my money on Jump Ship. As it heads towards an Early Access launch this Summer, it’s more polished and more fun than ever.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you aren’t familiar with Jump Ship already, it’s a non-grindy space romp for up to four players — and I specifically didn’t say multiplayer because the team at Keepsake Games told me they’re responding to feedback and building on what they hope will be a clever way for solo players to enjoy Jump Ship. In short, if you want to treat it like a single-player game, there will be narratively constructed AI assistants to help you man the ship. You get a taste of this in the Prologue, which serves as one part tutorial — introducing you to gameplay mechanics like shooting, flying in your space suit, manning and piloting the ship, and ship combat — and one part lore-builder. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Jump Ship - Closed Beta Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, Jump Ship now has a much-appreciated story behind its core PvE gameplay. A malicious virus has infected machines throughout the galaxy, and it’s up to you and your fellow Atirans to get to the root of it at the heart of the galaxy and stop it. You’ll run through procedurally generated chains of missions in each sector in order to get there. Some take 10 minutes, others might take an hour. You’ll know roughly what to expect going in, as each one of your branching choices on the Jump Map is color-coded to let you know how much danger you’re voluntarily wading into. But of course, the greater the danger, the greater the reward… </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Jump Ship now has a much-appreciated story behind its core PvE gameplay.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Aiding you is a non-infected AI you discover in the Prologue called Iris, who acts as something of a narrator on your missions. It’s a welcome bit of structure around the solid foundation of gameplay Jump Ship brings to the table. As is the Hangar, which is the sort-of base of operations from which you can cash in your in-game currency to buy and customize your outfits, look at the greater Galaxy Map, and even engage in a bit of soccer in your downtime. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But back to that core four-player gameplay. Boy oh boy is it fun! As you embark on your mission, things naturally won’t always go according to plan. Your ship will get attacked en route to your destination, requiring one of you to pilot the ship and fire the meager pilot’s chair weapons, while another sits down at the ship’s proper weapon station to wield the 360-degree-pivoting cannon at any annoying targets. Meanwhile, the other two of you might be mag-booted to the ship’s hull outside, taking shots at passing ships. That is, until an enemy vessel damages your ship, requiring one or more of you to run inside, grab a fire extinguisher, crawl into a vent, and put out the flames. After all, you’ve gotta keep that pineapple pizza-maker in full working order!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When you do get where you’re going, all four of you disembark and make your way on foot inside the structure that houses the loot you’re after. These evil, infected robots will keep coming and they won’t play nice, so teamwork is essential at each step of the mission. Your grappling hook helps zip you around areas both on the ground and in outer space much quicker, and once you’ve got the big loot, one of you has got to get it back aboard the ship while the others protect your defenseless, arms-full self.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Both my demo last year and my latest one just the other day were short. On the one hand, it proves that Jump Ship is a blast in short bursts, and thus you don’t have to quit your job in order to keep up with it. On the other hand, though, I haven’t seen enough of the larger mission structure and the procedurally generated variety to know if it will deliver on its endlessly replayable promise. But everything I’ve seen so far absolutely screams potential hit. Jump Ship has all the right ingredients to become something special, and I can’t wait to play a lot more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

            <title><![CDATA[Mecha Break: The Final Preview]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/mecha-break-the-final-preview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mecha-break-the-final-preview.1117689/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mecha-break-the-final-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The upcoming free-to-play online shooter Mecha Break really does well to evoke the exciting, breakneck sense of action from classic Japanese anime like Gundam Wing or Macross Plus. Focusing on the dizzying combat and thrills of piloting giant robots tearing through environments and enemy steel, it so far looks to deliver on its potential of over-the-top mechs duking it out in stylish fashion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ahead of the open beta, I got to dive into several hours of a near-final build of Mecha Break, seeing its opening storyline set on a post-cataclysmic Earth and a suite of multiplayer skirmishes that range from familiar match types to a surprisingly ambitious take on a squad-based Mecha extraction shooter on a large-scale map. So far, Mecha Break offers an impressive suite of mechs and modes for its upcoming debut.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mecha BREAK Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Set in a far future where an ecological disaster has torn Earth apart, you play as a pilot in an organization known as S.H.A.D.O.W., which fights rival mech pilots and works to stop the spread of a crystalline virus that infects both organic life and even mechs. By engaging in strike missions and amassing more resources to upgrade and unlock new mecha, you can help the war effort and improve humanity's chances of survival.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For anyone who's watched any mecha action series or tried their hand at building Gunpla over the last 30 years, Mecha Break's influences are obvious – and the lead developer was clear about what type of game he wanted. During our chat at the preview session, Kris Kwok, CEO of Amazing Seasun Games and executive producer of Mecha Break, stated that the team aimed to capture the experience of watching a classic mecha anime with giant robots weaving through missile fire and landing a slick finishing shot.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I've had a wonderful childhood experience watching a TV station in Hong Kong, which introduced me to Japanese anime. My favorites were Gundam and Macross, and they are my biggest influences on Mecha Break," said the CEO of Amazing Seasun Games. "I've always wanted to make a multiplayer game like this, and I drew upon a lot of military tactics to offer different types of experiences for players – you have strikers with light or heavy armor, and you have a sniper role, or mechs that fly and move swiftly through the environment. Our core design philosophy was to have a roster of mechs that all capture the experience of piloting giant machines of war, regardless of your role in a match."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The opening missions are the most story-driven moments of Mecha Break, but considering there are no present plans for a dedicated campaign, it was a little disappointing to see it's not much of a focus. However, the existing plot did well in framing the multiplayer engagements, and you'll even be able to have your custom pilot explore the massive hangar to talk with other characters and observe your mechs. The heart of the gameplay is the multiplayer engagements, and as seen in last year's beta, Mecha Break features the traditional 6v6 multiplayer match types such as territory control, guiding payloads, and a twist on capture the flag, which involves delivering fuel to a rocket ship while avoiding enemy fire.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But what elevates these engagements is the awesome suite of mechs that lean into the hero-style archetypes. Aquila is the long-range heavy sniper that can hover in mid-air to time a shot, Falcon is the agile, flight-focused mech that can rain down missiles, and Tricera is the heavily armored mech that can tear through enemies with its twin Gatling guns. I was impressed by how well-designed and visually striking each mech was, and I had some fun decking out the robots with custom decals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mecha Break is gorgeous to see in action, and I was very pleasantly surprised with the current state of its level of craft and polish. Since last year's beta, the developers have taken in feedback to fine-tune the player interface and balance between mechanisms. Considering how fast and exciting the matches can get, seeing how well-layered they are is impressive. It's also a multiplayer game that's not focused on racking up kills, but on helping the team achieve objectives and offering support. Still, I definitely had my moments where I became an absolute menace in the air as Falcon, only for the team's sniper to adapt to my tricks and pick me off from afar.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The pacing of Mecha Break is incredibly fast, and yet I sometimes found myself forgetting about capturing objectives because I was so swept up in the action and the dizzying pace. In some cases, I spent so much time focusing on enemy movements and attacks that I missed clear opportunities to help the team's larger goals. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">One mode that was more recently added is Mashmak, which is Mecha Break's take on an extraction shooter. In this large-scale mode with several other players, a squad of 3 will hot drop onto a random spot on the map and take out AI mechs and elite foes to collect forces, all the while facing off against other players and even the environment as tornadoes and deadly swells rip through the environment. By upgrading your mech with mods and other gear – such as a glider that I missed out on using – your team will have been able to boost up and eventually provide you coordinate and pick your battles.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's an impressive concept for sure, and I appreciate just how expansive the mode is – especially when piloting mechs – but given that it's a much slower-paced mode, it felt at times felt like the matches took a little while to properly get going, even with the AI mechs to battle. I also felt generally underpowered when facing some battalions of enemies, which prompted my team to move on to other places to avoid wasting time. Still, I see the potential of this mode, and storms in game really do well shake up the match and instill some tension.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It took some time for the developers to properly get Mashmak into shape, but they stated they found a nice balance for the experience by offering variety.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"It took some trial and error to get this right, as we were never happy with how it initially turned out – our first prototype was not that positive," Kwok recalled. "So we had to rework everything, and sometime later we had a better version of it, but it still was not there. So after iterations, we finally brought Mashmak together and it was very important to offer variety within these matches. The auxiliary weapon systems you can collect, the [hazardous weather] storms, and the boss enemies you can find really do add a lot to these matches, especially on a large map to explore with a team."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So far, Mecha Break's fast action and stellar selection of mechs present a fun and thrilling package for its online multiplayer. As a live service game, it'll definitely offer a lot of options right out of the gate, but I do have some lingering worries about how the in-game store will be set up, which is a normal worry to have these days. Mecha Break's combat and style is in great shape, and it'll certainly make for a solid option for fans looking to get their next mecha action game fix.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/delta-force-devs-discuss-the-creation-of-its-new-campaign-black-hawk-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The free-to-play first-person shooter Delta Force recently launched a co-op campaign mode called Black Hawk Down, which is inspired by the film of the same name and reimagines the campaign of 2003’s Delta Force: Black Hawk Down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rebuilt from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5, the campaign takes you through the streets of Mogadishu with a level of immersion that wasn’t possible in the original 22 years ago. It’s also designed to present a legitimate challenge. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can technically beat it solo, but it will be very difficult — you won’t face fewer enemies or easier firefights. The developers recommend building a squad of four with a good spread of character classes, relying on teamwork to successfully fight your way through the campaign’s seven chapters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more details on the campaign, you can read <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/delta-force-launches-its-new-campaign-black-hawk-down">this article</a>. To celebrate its release, we got a chance to talk to studio head Leo Yao and game director Shadow Guo about the decision to reboot the classic campaign, why they’re not charging any money for it, and more.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>First things first: Why did you want to reboot the classic Delta Force campaign? What excited you about this opportunity? </strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Leo:</strong> Delta Force was a childhood favorite for me and many developers from Team Jade – the 2003 Delta Force game was just so iconic. We also love the 2001 movie so much, and both have been huge inspirations for us. The opportunity to revisit such a beloved story and bring it to today’s audience was something we couldn’t pass up. It wasn’t just about recreating the nostalgia, though; it was about expanding on it with love and respect. With today’s technology and tools, we felt like we could breathe new life into the experience while paying homage to the original. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Were there other options for setting or time period that you considered, or was the Mogadishu operation always the focus? </strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Shadow:</strong> It was love at first sight with the OG Black Hawk Down game for me, and our team has always been drawn to the Mogadishu operation. So we never seriously considered other options because we felt Black Hawk Down aligned perfectly with our vision for rebooting the Delta Force campaign. It’s a story that combines high-stakes drama, tactical depth, and a display of resilience, which are core to the Delta Force identity. It’s an iconic setting that not only respects the roots of the franchise but also provides a rich canvas for the gameplay experience we want to deliver to players. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Was there ever a time you considered not having a campaign at all? Why is it important to offer this to players? </strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Leo:</strong> We were on the fence before Gamescom 2023, where we revealed the game to the world. During the event, we had the chance to meet a lot of players who shared their memories and hopes for the franchise. Their passion really moved us, and it became clear just how much a campaign meant to them. While we always wanted to include a campaign, their enthusiasm gave us the final push we needed to commit fully. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>It’s clear that a lot of time and effort went into creating this campaign. What made you decide to offer it for free? </strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Leo:</strong> That is exactly why — we poured our hearts and souls into this campaign, and we want players to enjoy it without any barriers. It’s also about building goodwill with the community and showing our commitment to providing value and respect for their support. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Shadow:</strong> The campaign’s difficulty means it’s not for everyone, but we want to give the choice to players. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>With the campaign itself being free, will there be a battle pass or microtransactions?</strong> </h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Shadow:</strong> No, there won't be any battle pass or any microtransactions in the campaign. Our goal is to offer a free and accessible experience to all players. For those who would like to support the game further, we will offer a selection of optional campaign-related bundles that players can purchase and use in the game’s multiplayer mode. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Obviously, technology has developed considerably in the 22 years since the original game was released. What were you able to do now that wouldn’t have been possible back in 2003? </strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Shadow:</strong> It’s quite amazing to think that the OG Black Hawk Down is already 22 years old. One of the biggest improvements is in the graphics. We were able to create a living, dynamic Mogadishu with tons of details for players to explore and immerse into. We’ve also implemented a class system that adds more strategic depth to the game, giving players more freedom in how they approach missions. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>You’ve recommended that players form a squad of four to complete the campaign in co-op. It’s playable solo, but very difficult. What went into that decision?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Shadow:</strong> From the very start of development, we knew we wanted to stay true to the spirit of both Black Hawk Down classics, where teamwork and camaraderie played a huge role. We didn’t want the game to feel like just another shooter where you go in guns blazing as a lone wolf. The campaign is designed around the idea of brotherhood and working together to overcome challenges just like how Delta Force was challenged in 1993. We strongly believe that the best experience is one where players coordinate as a team, supporting one another through difficult missions. Playing solo is certainly possible, but it’s much more challenging, and we wanted to encourage players to collaborate in co-op for a more rewarding experience. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Are there rewards that players can expect for completing the campaign? If so, what are they?</strong> </h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Leo</strong>: Yes, we wanted to make sure that players feel a real sense of accomplishment after completing the campaign, hence the difficulty. In addition to the fun and satisfaction of finishing challenging missions, there will be some cosmetic rewards available. These items can be used in multiplayer modes and reflect your performance and progress throughout the campaign. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>How did you approach the chapter structure of the campaign, and how important was it that you diversify gameplay between those chapters? </strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Shadow:</strong> Just like in the original Delta Force games, we wanted to create a campaign structure that feels dynamic and keeps players engaged throughout. We’ve designed a variety of mission types, each emphasizing different aspects of gameplay. Without spoiling too much — one mission may involve escorting vehicles, where you’ll need to protect and navigate through hostile areas while exploring maze-like indoor areas to identify and eliminate threats; another could be a last-man-standing-style defense scenario, where you have to hold a position against waves of enemies. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>What goes into balancing the different character classes and how they interact with each other? </strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Shadow</strong>: The class system in Delta Force is key to fostering teamwork and providing players with varied gameplay options. We wanted to create distinct roles for each class, making sure they complement each other during missions. For example, the Sniper class is perfect for long-range engagements, making use of sniper rifles and providing intel for the team. The Assault class is more frontline-oriented, excelling in close-quarter combat and heavy fire support. The Support class is essential for keeping the team alive with medical supplies and equipment. Each class has its strengths and weaknesses, and it’s important that players work together to cover each other’s gaps. The interaction between these roles is what makes teamwork so critical to success. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>How important do you think narrative and storytelling are to a campaign mode in a shooter? How do you go about including that storytelling while still keeping the action intense and pace fast? </strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Leo:</strong> Storytelling is essential to giving the player a deeper connection to the game and making the action feel more meaningful. The good news is that we already have a great story to work with. As for narration: We use a combination of cinematics and gameplay to tell the story. For cinematics, about 60% of the cinematics are faithful remakes from the original, while the remaining 40% introduce original scenes inspired by historical events. But we don’t just rely on cutscenes — we also use the gameplay itself as a way to tell the story. For example, as you progress through the missions, you’ll encounter challenges that showcase the weight of war. This allows us to keep the action fast-paced while still delivering an emotional and immersive story that resonates with players. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Are there any other things you’d like to say to players?</strong> </h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Leo:</strong> We’re really excited for players to try the game! This is our first attempt at a new Delta Force campaign, and we’ve put a lot of work into making it as engaging and fun as possible. We hope that you’ll enjoy the experience as much as we’ve enjoyed creating it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Shadow</strong>: Absolutely! We’re really grateful for the support from the community and encourage players to share their thoughts with us. We’re always looking to improve, and your feedback will help us make the game better for everyone. We hope you enjoy the game, and we look forward to hearing what you think.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-flying-heroes-are-terrorizing-players-after-mid-season-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">NetEase Games rolled out its Season 1 mid-season update for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> last week, and with it has come a reign of terror from the hero shooter’s growing list of flying heroes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of the popular competitive multiplayer game hopped in to check out the update after it went live Friday, February 21. It came with headlines such as new characters The Thing and Human Torch, alongside a new Central Park map, an army of balance tweaks, and more to keep fans of the Marvel spinoff game entertained while work on Season 2 continues. Players have found plenty to love so far, but for every change the community welcomes, there is one thing hogging all of the attention: the sky.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals matches for players of all skill levels have been plagued with flying heroes, specifically the likes of Iron Man, Storm, and Human Torch, since the update went live a few days ago. Characters previously seen as minor aerial annoyances have graduated into all-around menaces thanks to a few new key elements. The emergence of a legion of aerial hero experts is far from enough to break the experience, but it has seen players diverting their attention from objectives as they work to deal with this new trend.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s one obvious culprit behind the community’s newfound fear of flying heroes: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-players-are-already-worried-human-torch-is-op-days-before-mid-season-update">Human Torch</a>. As with any major content drop, new heroes are going to attract attention from those looking to try out new content for themselves. Marvel Rivals’ mid-season update adds a whopping two new heroes into the mix, so it’s no surprise to see one of each on either team in both casual and competitive modes. In the case of Fantastic Four’s Johnny Storm, that means almost always having to worry about one friendly and one enemy Human Torch for every match. It's a lot on its own, but Marvel Rivals has more than just one hothead to worry about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week’s update also <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/balancepost/20250213/41667_1211717.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>introduced buffs</u></a> to the already popular Iron Man and his Unibeam ability. These are nothing to scoff at, as NetEase moved to increase its damage from 120/s to 140/s, while also pumping up its Armor Overdrive damage by 10/s. Iron Man lives in the air regardless of map choice, and with buffs enticing players to hop into matches as Tony Stark more often, it’s leaving those on the ground with no choice but to counter-pick or start praying.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Storm, meanwhile, was hit with several small nerfs to her kit but remains a secret weapon for players with the skill to effectively use her in battle. She’s been slowly crawling her way up Marvel Rivals’ Hero Hot List following balance tweaks earlier in Season 1, meaning players are still being pulled in by the X-Men hero’s weather-based abilities.</p><div id="marvel-rivals-tier-list-best-heroes" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3><h3>Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In theory, your average 12v12 Marvel Rivals game could have all three of these heroes pop up on both teams, giving players six flying characters to watch out for. Toss in those with flying abilities like Scarlet Witch and Doctor Strange as well as high mobility names like Spider-Man and matches can quickly become a nightmare for anyone unable to land their shots. It's making for an especially brutal time for melee heroes like Wolverine as they do their best to find opportunities to sneak in a few swings. Those who favor Marvel Rivals' Strategist support role are running into their own issues as they aim at their teammates in need of healing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As NetEase continues to roll out more updates and playable heroes from across Marvel canon, the balance between the land and sky will surely shift. Still, players are looking for new strategies to combat their fear of flying characters, including picking hit-scan heroes like Punisher and Hela. Another thing keeping fans grounded during these trying times are copious amounts of memes about their struggles.</p><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">A team of melee heroes fighting off a horde of flying heroes <a href="https://t.co/X9xo8rIhjy" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/X9xo8rIhjy</a></p>— Lucas Evan Fryman (@LucasFryman) <a href="https://twitter.com/LucasFryman/status/1893178482374406245?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 22, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="qme" dir="ltr"> <a href="https://t.co/qe8QvwoeXC" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/qe8QvwoeXC</a></p>— MarvelPlays (@PlaysMarvel) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlaysMarvel/status/1893105609915990060?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 22, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Why is no one talking abt how hard it is as a support to heal them😭 esp with sue… maybe we buff her range soon😭🙏</p>— Su 🤍 🇹🇷 (@marieannfred1) <a href="https://twitter.com/marieannfred1/status/1893110722394988922?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 22, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals launched in December and instantely became <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-is-a-smash-hit-with-10-million-players-in-just-3-days">a huge hit</a> for Marvel and NetEase.

"First and foremost, thank you for all the warm messages and wishes. The development of our game is progressing steadily, and we're facing no financial issues. The Blood of Dawnwalker's production is fully funded, and we work alongside our partners and friends from Bandai Namco, our game's global publisher, to bring the first chapter of the Dawnwalker saga to life. The vast majority of Rebel Wolves' ownership rests in the hands of Konrad Tomaszkiewicz and other studio co-owners, all of whom are employed by Rebel Wolves. NetEase is Rebel Wolves' minority shareholder."</p><p>Rebel Wolves hasn't announced a release date for The Blood of Dawnwalker, but the studio has shared some details about the game itself. The story will be set in the 14th century in a small fictional European country that has been taken over by vampires. The leading character is Coen, a half-human/half-vampire hybrid who has 30 days and nights to save his family. That ticking clock means that even minor activities in Blood of Dawnwalker <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-3-directors-vampire-game-might-be-a-literal-time-suck/1100-6529556/" data-ref-id="1100-6529556">may suck away the time</a> Coen needs to finish his story.</p><p>The Blood of Dawnwalker's gameplay reveal will be unveiled this summer. It will eventually be released on hit PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p><em>Neon White </em>designer <a href="https://x.com/torahhorse/status/709458086524682241" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ben Esposito once joked</a> “in game design, ‘environmental storytelling’ is the art of placing skulls near a toilet.” I have yet to see a toilet in <em>Avowed</em>, but there are a lot of dead bodies placed in specific and often funny situations, and it has become one of my favorite recurring bits in the game.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Avowed</em> is dense. Unlike many other games in its genre, which can often feel bloated, dull and empty, every inch of the Living Lands begs to be explored. Each ruin and corpse feels boutique, and every moment feels like it’s touched by the hand of a real person with clarity and intent. I have rarely seen an RPG executed with such meticulous attention to detail. Few things feel recycled, and every nook and cranny has a little story to tell.</p><figure><figcaption>You find this guy in a cave covered with vines. Credit: Obsidian.</figcaption></figure><p>This attention to detail in world design helps set the mood for the Living Lands. Any RPG can throw a bunch of spiders and bears at you with increasing difficulty and claim that as a win, but <em>Avowed</em> goes out of its way to drive home that this is a place of peril and malice. The people here should not be here, and nature is actively trying to kill people trying to settle it. This partially explains why you will find a dead body roughly every 20 minutes, with an elaborately constructed note next to it about the specific reasons that person is now a corpse.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>This note appears next to a dead guy in a bear cave. Credit: Obsidian</figcaption></figure><p>A pyromancer cackling and exploding only to leave a smoking skeleton. A man dead in a bear cave with a hazing note explaining how he has to return with a “bear egg.” A cartographer’s body crushed under a big wall. Every skeleton is a beautiful painting.</p><figure><figcaption>More like the Dead Guy Lands. Credit: Obsidian.</figcaption></figure><p>In less expert hands, relying on this device too often could be considered a hack move. But <em>Avowed </em>leans into “skeleton storytelling” so aggressively that it becomes a running bit unto itself. You constantly read notes about people pushed to their breaking point, with fatal consequences. Others notes are comically foolhardy and boastful. I have lost count of the number of times I have read a series of logs where the person claims that there is no way they are going to die in the exact fashion that they died.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Found next to a dead body by a wall with some footprints on it. Credit: Obsidian.</figcaption></figure><p>So much of modern AAA gaming feels disposable and empty. At times it feels like companies are in a pissing match to see who can make the most elaborate and expensive adult daycare with nothing substantial in it. What makes <em>Avowed </em>so atypical is the care and detail in every single inch of the map, often done with density and humor that I did not think was possible to do at this scale. It turns out a great way to do that is to fill your world with a whole bunch of well-considered skeletons.</p><figure><figcaption>Damn that drink was strong as hell.

Last year, Annapurna Interactive’s entire staff <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2024/9/12/24243317/annapurna-interactive-staff-reportedly-resigns">resigned en masse</a> after negotiations to spin off the respected indie game publisher into its own independent entity broke down. Since then, those employees have formed their own company and even have a new crop of games to manage since it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338274/annapurna-interactive-new-company-take-two-private-division">took over publishing duties for Take-Two’s former indie label Private Division</a>. But where does that leave Annapurna?</p><p>After the resignations, the company issued a statement assuring players that its games would still be published as normal. With this showcase (which you can watch in full <a href="https://youtu.be/5XTSFLFV7e8?si=mTgy-svDE5xaefi4">here</a>), we will get more details on what to expect from Annapurna in the first half of 2025. </p><div><p id="to-a-t"><h2><em>To a T</em></h2></p></div><p><em>To a T </em>is the latest release from <em>Katamari Damacy</em> creator <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/17/21025916/keita-takahashi-interview-wattam-katamari">Keita Takahashi</a>, and damn, if it ain’t adorable <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/16/21021203/wattam-review-ps4-pc-katamari">like most of his games</a>. The game tells the story of Teen, a young person with a… we’ll say “unique” posture, and it’s up to you to help them navigate the challenges that come with being born stuck in a permanent “T” pose.

The roguelike card game  tasks players with putting together high-scoring poker hands using luck, skill, and powerful joker cards that act like supernatural wildcards. <em>Balatro</em>—available now on consoles, PC, and mobile devices—isn’t a game about gambling and doesn’t include any violence or real money transactions.

The American equivalent would essentially be the ESRB  changing a game’s rating from E to M. Now, finally, PEGI has realized how silly it was to rate <em>Balatro </em>18+. </p><p>On February 24, Balatro creator and developer LocalThunk confirmed that after his publisher had appealed to PEGI, <em>Balatro’s </em>rating had been lowered from the adults only 18+ to the more sensible 12+, which is similar to an ESRB T rating. </p><p>“This is a good step from PEGI - bringing nuance to their ratings criteria that used to be 18+ or nothing.

However, the board says that it will provide 12+ ratings to games, like <em>Balatro</em>, that don’t simulate gambling in a casino or betting hall. </p><p>“PEGI acknowledges the finding of the Complaints Board appeals panel in regards to amending the classifications of these games,” said the board. </p><p>“The PEGI system continuously evolves in line with cultural expectations and the guidance of independent experts who support our assessment process. PEGI strives to apply ratings criteria fairly, consistently, and transparently to ensure that audiences understand the type of content that is present in games.”</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That’s why we’re releasing into Early Access this summer—to work directly with our players, listen to their feedback, and combine it with our vision.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Coffee Stain Publishing:</p><blockquote><p><em>Jump Ship</em> is a mission based co-op FPS in which players can transition seamlessly from crewing their very own space ship to on-foot exploration and space walks. The goal of each mission is to survive with the crew’s ship intact and make the next jump, picking up valuable resources, blueprints and weapons along the way. While one crewmate is piloting the ship, another might be putting out fires or fixing radiation leaks on the deck, while the rest of the group boards enemy vessels or battle through volatile space stations to make off with precious supplies.</p><p>In <em>Jump Ship</em>, the galaxy is filled with handcrafted celestial settings, from vast asteroid rings dominating the horizon to distant, luminescent nebulas radiating kaleidoscopic light. The scenery changes with each jump, as players go from boarding and pillaging a rival corvette-class ship to salvaging shipwrecks floating in vacuum or exploring an abandoned research facility.</p><p>However, deep space hides many other, more celestial threats, as solar flares and meteor showers regularly threaten to end players’ spacefaring journeys in an instant.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

Balatro, the highly-acclaimed card-based roguelike from developer Local Thunk, is now available via Xbox Game Pass. It arrives alongside a new bit of free DLC featuring collaobrations from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a>, Civilization 7, Fallout, and more.
</p>
<p>
As announced during Microsoft's latest ID@Xbox showcase, Balatro can be enjoyed by Game Pass subscribers right now - and its arrival brings a fresh set of cosmetic card skins featuring fan-favourite characters from across a range of titles.
</p>
<p>
Friends of Jimbo Pack 4, as the DLC is known, has more of a blockbuster focus compared to Balatro's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatros-back-with-another-collaboration-card-pack-featuring-the-likes-of-cyberpunk-2077-and-stardew-valley">previous, predominantly indie-themed collaborations</a>. Now, players can adorn the back of their decks with the likes of Vault Boy from the Fallout series, Assassin's Creed's Ezio Auditore da Firenze, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bugsnax">Bugsnax</a> protagonist The Journalist, and Dead by Daylight's The Hillbilly.

<p>
Other games represented in Friends of Jimbo Pack 4 include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, Rust, and Slay the Princess. Critical Role's Percival Fredrickstein von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III is in there too. And if that appeals, the DLC is available right now on all platforms.
</p>
<p>
Balatro first launched on Xbox alongside versions for PC, PlayStation and Nintendo Switch a year ago. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-out-on-mobile-later-this-month">smartphone edition for iPhone and Android devices</a> followed last September. 
</p>
<p>
It's fair to say Balatro has been a smash hit, with more than five million copies sold of its roguish poker-inspired cardplay, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/meeting-the-people-of-pegi-talking-age-ratings-gambling-and-why-their-famous-voice-only-got-200">despite its controversial 18+ age rating</a> - which is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-wins-formal-appeal-to-reclassify-poker-game-as-pegi-12">finally getting overturned in the EU</a>, and replaced by a PEGI 12 rating instead. 
</p>
<p>
Since its release, Balatro has added further cards via updates that have included crossovers with major gaming franchises such as The Witcher, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/among-us">Among Us</a> and Vampire Survivor. 
</p>
<p>
Here on Eurogamer, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-50-best-games-of-2024-ranked">Balatro was one of our favourite games of 2024</a>. "It's a work of marvellous depth and winning simplicity, and rightly one of the best and most memorable games you'll play this year," our Katharine wrote.
