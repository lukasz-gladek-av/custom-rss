              <p>Sure, Jedi and giant space battles are cool and an important part of the<em> Star Wars</em> franchise. But as I’ve said before, <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-games-dont-always-need-to-include-jedi-1840696384">not every <em>Star Wars</em> game needs to include lightsabers and Force powers</a>. Thankfully, later this year, we are getting <em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</em>, a very different kind of <em>Star Wars</em> game that is promising a fast-paced racing experience similar to past games like S<em>tar Wars: Racer’s Revenge.</em> If that sounds like something you want to know more about, well, just keep on scrolling down to learn even more about <em>Galactic Racer</em>.</p> <h2>What is <em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</em>?</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/former-burnout-devs-star-wars-racing-game-galactic-racer-2000652809">Announced during the 2025 Game Awards</a>, <em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</em> is a high-speed arcade-like racing game that will feature a full single-player story featuring new and old characters and plenty of different race tracks to speed around on.</p> <h2>When is <em>Galactic Racer</em> launching?</h2> <p><em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</em> doesn’t have a specific release date yet, but it is scheduled to launch sometime in 2026.</p>

 <h2>What platforms will it be available on?</h2> <p>PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>  <h2>Is there podracing in this game?</h2> <p>Yes! Fans were a bit nervous that <em>Galactic Racer</em> might not feature podracing when its first teaser trailer didn’t feature any podracers.<a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-galactic-racer-racing-game-podracing-confirmed-2000665131"> But the devs have since confirmed that yes</a>, it will include podracing, and a new trailer even shows it off. But it should also be clear that this isn’t exclusively a podracing game, but a <em>Star Wars</em> racing game that will let players mix and match different types of speeders and other vehicles together.</p> <h2>Is it true that some former <em>Burnout</em> devs are making this?</h2> <p>Yup. Fuse Games is a studio formed by a bunch of developers who previously worked at Criterion on games like<em> Burnout Paradise</em> and <em>Need for Speed: Most Wanted.&nbsp;</em><a href="https://kotaku.com/former-burnout-devs-star-wars-racing-game-galactic-racer-2000652809">So these folks know speed and racing</a>.</p>

 <h2>Is <em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</em> an open-world game?</h2> <p>No! <em>Galactic Racer</em> isn’t an open-world racing game like <em>Forza Horizon</em> or<em> Burnout Paradise</em>. Instead, it is a track-based racer similar to older <em>Burnout</em> titles.</p> <h2>Is there multiplayer in the game?</h2> <p>Yes. <a href="https://www.pcgames.de/Star-Wars-Galactic-Racer-Spiel-75467/News/star-wars-galactic-racer-tga-1488889/">Fuse Games says 12 people will be able to race together online</a>. There will also be some sort of online ranking system.</p>

 <h2>When is <em>Galactic Racer</em> set in the <em>Star Wars</em> timeline?</h2> <p><em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</em> is set after the events of <em>Return of the Jedi.</em> But beyond that, the creators behind the game don’t seem to be too worried about <em>Galactic Racer</em>‘s placement in the grander <em>Star Wars</em> canon. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-star-wars-galactic-racer-interview-why-its-not-open-world-how-its-story-mode-works-and-when-its-set">Here’s what Fuse Games CEO and founder Matt Webster told <em>IGN</em></a>:</p> <blockquote><p>“I don’t think it really matters. As you say, you’re on Jakku after the events of <em>Return of the Jedi,</em> the galactic civil war is over, and that’s where sport becomes a more interesting opportunity. I don’t think we’re ever specific about timeline beyond that.”</p></blockquote> <h2>Wait, was that Sebulba from <em>The Phantom Menace</em>?</h2> <p>Yes, it was. But he is older now and sports a cool beard. Maybe he’s learned his lesson after cheating against Anakin and other racers all those years ago. But I doubt it…</p>  <h2>Will <em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</em> include a battle pass or seasons?</h2> <p>When asked about seasons in the previously mentioned <em>IGN</em> interview, Webster bluntly said “No” and said the game is a “premium” release.</p>

 <p>“We have our campaign, and we have arcade mode, and we have multiplayer, and it’s a self-contained thing,” said the CEO. “But what we also recognize is that the landscape of <em>Star Wars</em> evolves and changes over time and so do games as they go. So we see an opportunity for us to tap into more<em> Star Wars</em> or new<em> Star Wars</em> over time, but in terms of us outlining what we think post-launch is going to look like, [seasons are] not something that we see. The only reason I say a blind no to it is, in my head, season pass is connected to free-to-play games, and that’s not what we are making.”</p> <h2>Will you be able to walk around on foot in <em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</em>?</h2> <p>Yes! Your main character in the game’s campaign is named Shade, and they will be able to walk around a social hub area and interact with NPCs while also being able to upgrade their vehicles.</p> <h2>This is cool and all, but I wish we’d get a big <em>KOTOR</em>-like RPG <em>Star Wars</em> game again…</h2> <p>Good news, that’s also a thing that is happening. <a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-we-know-about-star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-release-date-trailer-2000653076">You can learn more about it here!</a></p>

        <p>Though not a particularly hotheaded one</p>

    </div>


  

    

</header>
  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
The time is upon us! The time to once again become radical, as from the ashes of developers Radical Entertainment and Hothead Games a sort of but not really new studio has been born: New Radical Games. It does seem like Hothead drew the short straw here name wise. But given that Radical were known for the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/simpsons-hit-run">The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run</a> and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prototype">Prototype</a> games, and Hothead made, uh, The Baconing, the choice feels apt.
</p>
<p>
This, as spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/simpsons-hit-run-and-prototype-studio-radical-entertainment-is-back-as-new-radical-games/">VGC</a>, was revealed not so much with a bang, but more of a snazzy, seemingly new <a href="https://www.newradical.ca/">website</a> that is adorned with imagery of the old Radical's games like the aforementioned beloved Simpsons game, alongside references to Prototype and a couple of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crash-bandicoot">Crash Bandicoot</a> games they made too.
</p>
<p>
Heading up this somewhat new venture as CEO is Ian Wilkinson, one of the original Radical's co-founders, and also the former president of Hothead Games before they shut down in December 2024. Over on Wilkinson's <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ian-wilkinson-28658912/">LinkedIn</a>, it says he's been CEO and president of New Radical Games since the same time period, but with the website seemingly being quite new, it's unclear how long they've actually been around for (a <a href="https://www.newradical.ca/post/welcome-to-new-radical-website">blog post</a> on the site is dated from April 11, 2025, so, it's at least that old). Joining him around the top as COO is Tim Bennison, previously Capcom Vancouver's studio director, but since 2020 also worked at Hothead, also as COO.
</p>
<p>
In terms of what they'll actually be making, well, New Radical Games' website says they can do things like work for hire full game development, co-dev, porting, and remastering. This certainly doesn't sound like they've got anything original in the pipeline, and I truly wouldn't place any bets on anything Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run right now given how <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/matt-selman-simpsons-hit-and-run-remake">complicated it sounds like it would be to wrangle even a remake</a>. At least this might explain that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prototype-remaster-speculation-kicks-into-super-gear-after-a-surprise-steam-update-adds-to-its-credits">odd Prototype update from last year</a>?

            <title><![CDATA[Discord Delays Controversial Age-Verification Rollout After Backlash: ‘We’ve Made Mistakes’]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/discord-delays-controversial-age-verification-requirements-2000673309</link>
            <guid>1445245</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Discord hears you. It gets your concerns. It wants to win back your trust. That’s the message from cofounder and CTO Stanislav Vishnevskiy, who announced the <a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-will-force-you-to-scan-your-face-or-id-to-unlock-all-of-its-features-2000666884">company’s controversial new age-verification requirements will be delayed</a>, but not reversed, as it works to try to better explain what’s happening to its millions of users. “We’ve made mistakes,” he wrote.</p> <p>Vishnevskiy says he’s just like you, getting off work and hopping on voice chat with friends while playing games like <em>Baby Steps</em> and <em>Arc Raiders</em>. Leveraging his gamer cred, the executive tried to quell the recent backlash while making clear that nothing is fundamentally changing about the age-verification rollout coming, other than the timing and optics. For Discord, the issue appears to be a failure to properly communicate the policy rather than the policy itself.</p>

 <p>“In hindsight, we should have provided more detail about our intentions and how the process works,” he <a href="https://discord.com/blog/getting-global-age-assurance-right-what-we-got-wrong-and-whats-changing">wrote in today’s update</a>. “The way this landed, many of you walked away thinking we’re requiring face scans and ID uploads from everyone just to use Discord. That’s not what’s happening, but the fact that so many people believe it tells us we failed at our most basic job: clearly explaining what we’re doing and why.”</p> <p>Vishnevskiy continued, “We know many of you believe the right answer is not to do this at all. We hear you.” He then went on to insinuate that Discord’s hands are tied as new regulation rolls out across more countries and U.S. states. The company promises more transparency about its vendors and processes, but otherwise nothing about the age-verification rollout is fundamentally changing other than the timing.</p>

 <p>Here’s how the newly delayed rollout will work as outlined <a href="https://discord.com/blog/getting-global-age-assurance-right-what-we-got-wrong-and-whats-changing">on Discord’s website</a>.</p> <blockquote><p><strong>We’re delaying our global rollout to the second half of 2026.</strong>&nbsp;Where we have legal obligations, we will continue to meet them, but we will only expand globally after we’ve done the following:</p></blockquote> <ol role="list"> <li> <blockquote><p><strong>Adding more verification options.</strong>&nbsp;We already had alternatives in development, including credit card verification. We’ll complete and expand those before scaling globally so you have more options you’re comfortable with.</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p><strong>Vendor transparency.</strong>&nbsp;We’ll document every verification vendor and their practices on our website, and make it clear in the product who each vendor is. We’ve also set a new requirement: any partner offering facial age estimation must perform it entirely on-device. If they don’t meet that bar, we won’t work with them.</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p><strong>A new spoiler channel option.</strong>&nbsp;We know many communities use age-restricted channels not for adult content, but for topics people prefer to engage with on their own terms: spoilers, politics, and heavier conversations. We’re building a dedicated spoiler channel option so communities don’t have to age-gate their server just to give members that choice.</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p><strong>A technical blog post before global launch.</strong>&nbsp;We’ll publish a detailed post explaining how our automatic age determination systems work, including the signal categories and privacy constraints. So you can evaluate our approach for yourselves.</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p><strong>Age assurance data in our transparency reports.</strong>&nbsp;We’ll include how many users were asked to verify, what methods they used, and how often our automated systems handled it without any user action.</p></blockquote> </li> </ol> <p>The apologetic backpedaling comes after weeks of Discord users pushing back on new requirements that would require some users to submit photos and IDs to the gaming chat platform if its AI tools decide you’re not over the age of 18 and you try to access “adult” content servers. A prior “<a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-age-verification-hack-persona-2000672570">experiment</a>” with this new policy that was implemented in the UK became a lightning rod for some frustrated users when it was revealed that one of the vendors involved in the process, a firm called Persona, was backed by funds from surveillance company Palantir cofounder Peter Thiel.</p>

 <p>Discord later said it cut ties with the vendor and that it has new safeguards in place to prevent user data from being hacked as it accidentally was last fall. But the bubbling cauldron of AI surveillance, data security concerns, and Discord’s reportedly impending IPO has left even some of its most hardcore users skeptical.</p>

<h2 id="h-history-of-the-elder-scrolls-online">History of The Elder Scrolls Online</h2>



<p>The Elder Scrolls Online has been active for over 12 years, first launching on PC in April 2014. It launched on current-generation consoles in 2021. In 2025, the developers discussed enabling cross-play across multiple platforms, noting they were working on technical changes to make it possible. After full comments here.</p>



<p>The game has actually been in development since 2007, nearly 20 years ago. As fans of the franchise continue to await Elder Scrolls 6, TES Online provides a steady experience. Speaking of the sixth Elder Scrolls game, don’t expect it anytime soon. However, we do know the game will be powered by Creation Engine 3, as Todd Howard recently shared.</p>











<p>Even though The Elder Scrolls 6 is a long way away, at least one Elder Scrolls game is coming to the Nintendo Switch 2 very soon. </p>



<p>During a Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase earlier in the month, Bethesda confirmed Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered for Nintendo Switch 2 as part of its growing third-party lineup. That game will be coming out in 2026. Learn more here.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Hasbro shareholders who filed a lawsuit last month against the company, alleging its management was overprinting Magic: The Gathering Cards, breaching its fiduciary duty, and deceiving consumers, have decided to drop the suit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A notice of voluntary dismissal filed last week (and spotted by <a href="https://rhodeislandcurrent.com/2026/02/23/hasbro-shareholders-drop-suit-alleging-toymaker-overprinted-magic-the-gathering-card-sets/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rhode Island Current</a>) shows Joseph Crocono and Ultain McGlone dropping the case without prejudice, suggesting they may attempt to file again at a later date. There are no further details in the notice as to the reason the lawsuit was dropped.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Magic: The Gathering - "Prints Charming" Secret Lair Drop</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The lawsuit, filed in January, alleged breaches of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, gross mismanagement, abuse of control, and violations of the Exchange Act on the part of Hasbro management. Its primary claim revolved around the idea that leadership was steering the company poorly by overprinting card sets, thereby devaluing the existing ones and putting the company on track to financial ruin. In particular, it named the culprit as Universes Beyond and Secret Lair, alleging that the company was teeing up the crossover sets to release any time the other segments of its business were struggling and the company needed cash to make up for the shortfall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And indeed, Hasbro subsidiary Wizards of the Coast has been printing more sets in recent years than in the past, though its revenue has been increasing along with it. In fact, upon its last earnings call, it was revealed that Magic just had its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-just-had-its-most-successful-year-everagain">most successful year ever</a>, in no small part thanks to the very sets that the lawsuit claims were at issue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, the lawsuit claimed that Hasbro management essentially faked being out of stock of the controversial, extremely expensive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-players-are-up-in-arms-over-999-dollar-anniversary-set">Magic 30th Anniversary Set</a> in order to encourage demand, sharing testimonies from former company leadership claiming that they had opted to "pause" sales to give the appearance of the product being out of stock. With the lawsuit dismissed, the merit of this anecdote in particular remains up in the air. It is worth noting that in the weeks since the lawsuit, Wizards of the Coast has put out another <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gatherings-newest-product-says-the-quiet-part-out-loud">controversial, weirdly-priced card offering</a> in its "Prints Charming" Secret Lair set, which consists of five identical listings, all at different prices.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Magic: The Gathering is gearing up for its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-preview">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles set</a>, which releases on March 6.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Embark Studios has published full patch notes for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders"><u>Arc Raiders</u></a> update 1.17.0, revealing a wave of nerfs for PvP and PvE players hopping into Shrouded Sky.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The finer details for the new Arc Raiders patch were published on <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/shrouded-sky-patch-notes-1-17-0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>the extraction shooter’s official website</u></a> today. It comes with the promise that players will be met with more than just <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-shrouded-sky-trailer-teases-hurricane-map-condition-and-windy-gameplay-hazards"><u>Hurricanes</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/embark-shows-off-arc-raiders-shrouded-sky-update-with-first-look-at-two-new-threatsand-beards"><u>new Arc threats</u></a> when they log in to check out the new February content drop.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">PvP players should know three of the most useful multiplayer weapons – the Stitcher, Kettle, and Venator – have all suffered from reductions to their base damage. The Stitcher and Venator pistols have also had their headshot multipliers reduced. These are targeted nerfs from Embark that will have a noticeable impact on PvP lobbies, while buffs for the Jupiter and Aphelion will likely make them more useful across the board.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">PvE players will likely appreciate the update’s improvements for the two energy weapons, but they didn’t make it out of Shrouded Sky without also facing nerfs. Let’s rip the Band-Aid off: the Deadline, Trailblazer, Wolfpack, and Showstopper will now be much more difficult to craft.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As each piece of equipment can be extremely useful when taking down Arc, Embark is asking players to gather at least one more Arc resource to build them. That’s not so bad in the case of the Vita Spray, which only requires an additional Tick Pod. The Wolfpack and its flurry of aerial homing explosives, on the other hand, now asks Raiders for one Rocketeer Driver per craft. The Rocketeer resource is quite rare and notoriously difficult to farm, making this one of the more substantial crafting adjustments and a steep ask for PvE fans.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Arc Raiders - Shrouded Sky Update Images</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We knew Shrouded Sky would be one of Embark’s biggest updates so far, but the version 1.17.0 patch notes reveal more highlights following its launch earlier today. For example, players can now interact with topside pianos, adding to the growing list of playable instruments. Raiders will also notice that troublesome feats can now be rerolled three times per day, while PvP feats have been removed entirely. The patch notes also sign off with a message from the team regarding its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-promises-significant-changes-after-players-report-widespread-issues-with-cheaters">ongoing anti-cheat initiative</a>, confirming it plans to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-says-players-who-used-recent-exploits-will-face-warnings-and-suspensions-starting-this-week">continue punishing cheaters</a> and exploiters following today’s fixes for a few additional glitches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The launch of Shrouded Sky now puts Embark halfway through its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-roadmap-promises-a-new-map-more-arcs-and-even-a-little-love-for-scrappy-by-april-2026"><u>four-month roadmap</u></a> for Arc Raiders in 2026. The next update, Flashpoint, is expected to bring more threats and a Scrappy changes in late March, with Riven Tides set to add a new map and a new large Arc in April.

In 1.13.1 we reverted that fix, but something else made it into the update that shouldn't have. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of you have reported a "shadow buff" to the weapons, and after investigating it we found that 1.13.1 had inadvertently impacted our weapon input buffers. Where you previously would have to time your inputs to the intended cadence of a weapon to reach its full potential, you could now instead spam-click the button, effectively bypassing any skill requirement to learn the weapon's cadence. We want to keep some of that skill expression, but we also recognize that what we had previously didn't feel very responsive. To address that and land in some sort of middle ground, we have since added more levers for us to control the weapon input buffering window on a gun-to-gun basis, and we've adjusted the semi-automatic weapons accordingly. The weapons should now still be more responsive to fire when spam-clicking, but the players who choose to pace their shots will see better results.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to these changes, we've also been looking into the balance between our low tier and high tier weapons. A lot of you have expressed concerns that some low tier weapons outperform our higher tier weapons at significantly reduced cost, and we're hoping to shift that balance a bit while still keeping some of that flexibility to punch above your weight if you are skilled enough. We're starting by reducing the overall TTK of the Stitcher and Kettle, and increasing the maneuverability of the Aphelion and Jupiter. We're also taking a second stab at the Venator, which still seems to be dominating a lot of our PvP encounters.</p><strong>Stitcher</strong><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Dev Note: </strong>The Stitcher has played its role well as a close quarter weapon that rewards thoughtful positioning, but we've found that its fast TTK can sometimes lead to situations where you're ambushed and killed before you have much time to react. As many of you have pointed out, the high headshot damage is a large contributor to this problem. The TTK is often fine when the weapon is aimed at the center of mass, but when you get close enough to land the majority of the shots in your target's head, we see TTK numbers that are much faster than other weapons. These changes aim to bring that headshot TTK a bit closer to the body shot TTK by both reducing the full-spray accuracy of the weapon, and reducing the headshot multiplier.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Reduced Headshot Multiplier from 2.5 to 1.75</li><li>Reduced Base Damage from 7 to 6.5</li><li>Increased Per Shot Dispersion by around 50% (Making it bloom faster)</li></ul><strong>Kettle</strong><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Dev Note: </strong>The Kettle has been in a bit of a weird place. Its high damage output was intended to be used in a more medium range setting at a more deliberate pace, but we see many of you bringing it up in close quarters and effectively turning into an SMG. We want to distinguish it more from the Stitcher, but we also see that you enjoy the versatility of this weapon. So we're reducing the base damage to bring its TTK more in line, but we're keeping the high headshot multiplier to see if we can push players to go for more headshots.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Reduced Base Damage from 10 to 8.5</li></ul><strong>Venator</strong><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Dev Note:</strong> Since the last nerfs to the Venator in 1.3.0, we've kept an eye on our data to see how it performs. During this time many of you have raised concerns that it's still dominating in PVP, and our data has shown that it is one of the highest performing weapons in the game right now. For a weapon of this tier we want it to perform well, but maybe not this well. We're looking at an overall nerf to its damage to bring down its TTK, and if that doesn't work we might need to look into its ammo consumption and cost efficiency.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Reduced Headshot Multiplier from 2.5 to 2</li><li>Reduced Base Damage from 9 to 8</li></ul><strong>Jupiter</strong><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Dev Note: </strong>In PVP, the Jupiter does the most headshot damage in the game, but it's quite difficult to hit headshots with it at longer ranges. You're also quite vulnerable when you use it in closer ranges since missing one shot will make you a sitting target until you either reload or swap weapons. We're increasing how much you zoom when you use ADS to give you a better view of the targets you're trying to hit, and we're reducing its equip and unequip time to make it easier to swap to a secondary weapon to follow up on your shot.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Improved ADS Magnification from ~1.9x to ~2.2x</li><li>Improved Equip Time from 1.2s to 1.05s</li><li>Improved Unequip Time from 0.9s to 0.75s</li></ul><strong>Aphelion</strong><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Dev Note: </strong>We weren't quite happy with the previous balancing of the Aphelion. It was intended to be a more PVP focused legendary weapon, but it couldn't quite keep up with the pacing of many of our other PVP weapons. We've made some changes to make it feel less bulky and a bit more nimble to use, to make it more viable in PVP.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Reduced Base Reload Time from 4.5s to 3.5s</li><li>Reduced Time Between Shots from 0.9s to 0.7s</li><li>Reduced Vertical Recoil by ca 50%</li><li>Improved ADS Settle Speed by ca 35%</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Item and

Our defenses operate on multiple levels: some checks are simple and definitive, while others are behavioral and data-driven and evolve over time. We also leverage broad gameplay telemetry and machine learning techniques to spot patterns that aren’t obvious at first glance. These methods take longer to develop, must adapt as game systems change, and don’t always offer instant certainty the way blunt software detections can.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve recently taken action against different exploits and we are further tightening our rules and stepping up enforcement. Serious infractions now carry stricter consequences. Strong detections will receive permanent bans right off the bat, while others will receive a temporary suspension and a single chance to correct the behavior. Recent updates to Family Sharing have strengthened our ability to curb misconduct and streamlined the removal of bad actors from the game. We are preparing to launch a systematic manual review of ban appeals. The game is young and the volume of telemetry is enormous, but this process ensures every case is handled with care as we continue to learn quickly and invest heavily in the precision of our enforcement tools.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Our dedicated anti-cheat team works tirelessly to keep the game fair. It’s an ongoing fight, and we’re committed to it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">//Ossen<br>And the ARC Raiders Team</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance writer with IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>One of the original team who pushed for the creation of the first Xbox, Seamus Blackley,&nbsp; has suggested that the new CEO, Asha Sharma, has been appointed to see the gradual wind down of the brand – because it’s nothing to do with AI.</p>
<p>“Xbox, like a lot of businesses that aren’t the core AI business, is being sunsetted,” Blackley told <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/what-an-xbox-founder-thinks-of-the-new-xbox-ceo-seamus-blackley-interview/">Gamesbeat</a>. “They don’t say that, but that’s what’s happening. I expect that the new CEO, Asha Sharma, her job is going to be as a palliative care doctor who slides Xbox gently into the night.”</p>


<p>“It just seems really true. I imagine asking somebody if it made sense to put a major motion picture studio into the hands of somebody who didn’t like movies, or a major record label into the hands of somebody who’d never seen a live show. Why would you do that?” he adds.</p>
<p>“The job of all these people is to just gently usher all of these business units into the new world of AI,” he continues. “That’s what you’re seeing here. Whether or not you agree with it, whether you agree with AI having the potential to do that, whether AI will be successful, is a separate matter. But that’s what we’re seeing.”</p>
<p>He also had some views on how the gaming community would react to Sharma’s appointment, first stating the gamers are very tolerant of non-gamers telling them what to believe, but then make it’s clear he is joking, “No, they’re not tolerant of any of these things. That’s the wall she’s about to discover.”</p>

<p>Seamus Blackley is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/seamus-blackley-25733/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currently</a> CEO of Pacific Light &amp; Hologram, a “technology start-up working in stealth mode to realise fully immersive 3D experience.” He also taught the world how to make Sourdough bread using ancient yeast and historical baking methods during the COVID pandemic.</p>
<p>You can read the full interview over on <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/what-an-xbox-founder-thinks-of-the-new-xbox-ceo-seamus-blackley-interview/">Gamesbeat</a>, it’s well worth a read. You can also <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/24/hero-to-net-zero-what-is-phil-spencers-legacy-at-xbox/">read our thoughts about outgoing CEO. Phil Spencer’s legacy here.</a></p>
<p>Do you think Xbox will continue as a brand or get sidelined by Microsoft as the chase AI? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/24/death-stranding-2-pc-specs-revealed-along-with-performance-enhancing-options/</link>
            <guid>1445155</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony has announced the requirements for the PC version of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>, some free DLC, and the performance options for the game.</p>
<p>“Death Stranding 2 for PC offers a range of Graphics Presets from Low to Very High, catering to both budget gaming PC’s and high-end systems,” say Nixxes, who are handling the port. “We’ve also added a Portable preset, aimed at handheld gaming devices, for those Porters who want to “keep on keeping on” while on the go.”</p>



<p>The performance-enhancing options are a special Chinese herb that has been used for millennia, which guarantees at least three extra inches to satisfy…. wait, wrong press release.</p>
<p><em>“The PC edition of Death Stranding 2 launches with support for NVIDIA DLSS 4, AMD FSR 4 and Intel XESS 2. Both upscaling and frame generation options are available for all technologies.”</em></p>

<p><em>“For the first time on PC, you’ll find Pico as an option in Upscale Settings. This “Progressive Image Compositor” is developed by Guerrilla for the Decima engine and is the same upscaling technology that’s used for Death Stranding 2 on PS5. Pico upscaling can be used with all supported graphics cards and can be combined with the various options for frame generation offered in the game.”</em></p>
<p><em>“All upscaling options can be used in combination with Dynamic Resolution Scaling, or with an upscaling quality setting of choice to improve performance. Native AA options are also available for maximum fidelity.”</em></p>
<p>You will also be able to play on ultra-wide screens if you have one, with all of the cut scenes in 21:9 aspect ratio and gameplay in 32:9 ratio.&nbsp; If you do not have an ultra-wide screen monitor you can still play in those resolutions but with some black bars at the top and bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>This mode will also be coming to the PS5 version of the game, and PS5 players will also get the Porter Suit: Link and Patch: Link for free when the game launches on PC.</p>

<p>I reviewed the PS5 version of Death Stranding 2<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/23/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review/"> scoring it 8/10.</a> “Despite repeating huge chunks of Death Stranding 1, almost beat for beat, Kojima pulls it out of the bag in the end,” said I. “The core gameplay loop remains satisfying enough to get you through to the good stuff, but I can’t help but feel disappointed just how similar this game is to its predecessor.”</p>

            <guid>1445152</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Ed Skrein</strong>, who you might recognize as the main antagonist in the first <strong>Deadpool</strong> movie or as the antagonist in Zack Snyder's ridiculous <strong>Rebel Moon</strong> films has been tapped by <strong>Amazon</strong> and <strong>PlayStation Productions </strong>to play <strong>Baldur</strong> in the upcoming <strong>God of War TV series</strong>.</p>



<p>Skrein is the latest to join the cast, taking up one of the last major characters whose casting had yet to be revealed. We know who is playing <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-show-amazon-prime-ryan-hurst-kratos-cast/">Kratos</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/callum-vinson-will-play-atreus-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-show/">Atreus</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-adds-to-god-of-war-tv-cast-with-alastair-duncan-returning-as-mimir-and-two-new-picks-for-brok-and-sindri/">Brok, Sindri, Mimir</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/severances-olafur-darri-olafsson-tapped-to-play-thor-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/">Thor</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-series-max-parker-heimdall-thor-mimir/">Heimdall</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/warm-bodies-star-teresa-palmer-tapped-to-play-sif-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/">Sif</a>,</strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/broadway-legend-mandy-patinkin-will-play-odin-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/">Odin</a></strong>, and we now know who will be stepping into Baldur's numb feet.</p>



<p>Announced in a new report from <a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/god-of-war-live-action-series-cast-ed-skrein-baldur-1236671517/">Variety</a>, Baldur's casting just leaves <strong>Freya</strong> as the only major character for whom we don't know the casting. Skrein's involvement also keeps the trend of Alastair Duncan (Mimir) and Ryan Hurst (Kratos) as the only actors who were involved in <strong>God of War (2018)</strong> and/or <strong>God of War Ragnarok</strong> that are also involved in this upcoming series. Alastair Duncan is also the only member of the cast to be reprising his role, since Hurst has gone from playing Thor in Ragnarok to playing Kratos in this live-action series.</p>



<p>The show is expected to <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-show-begins-filming-march-2026/">start filming next month</a>, so we'll hopefully have confirmation of who will be stepping into the role of Freya soon. While the rest of the casting choices suggest we shouldn't be expecting <strong>Danielle Bisutti</strong> to be reprising her role, her performance in both games was excellent, and it would certainly go a long way with fans of the games to see her continue with the character she clearly knows so well.</p>



<p>Here's the full cast list so far for Amazon's God of War TV series, led by <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/first-god-of-war-tv-series-details/">Ronald D. Moore</a>:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Ryan Hurst - Kratos</li>



<li>Callum Vinson - Atreus</li>



<li>Alastair Duncan - Mimir</li>



<li>Danny Woodburn - Brok</li>



<li>Jeff Gulka - Sindri</li>



<li>Teresa Palmer - Sif</li>



<li>Ólafur Darri Ólafsson - Thor</li>



<li>Max Parker - Heimdall</li>



<li>Mandy Patinkin - Odin</li>



<li>Ed Skrein - Baldur</li>
</ul>

No other platforms have been listed for the game yet, but I'd be very surprised indeed if we don't see a PC release.</p><p>Insomniac's <em>Wolverine </em>game will share continuity with <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/marvels-spider-man" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5ac0af43-332e-4175-a13f-13885dcdef7e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">both</a> of the studio's <em>Spider-Man </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/marvels-spider-man-2" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4c20da9d-d5d8-4520-b5d4-5d7b0be42289" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">outings</a>, but it'll be a standalone story, so you won't need to have played through either of Peter Parker's adventures in order to enjoy this one.</p><figure role="group">

<p>As the name suggests, the game will cast you as Wolverine, and while it's not an origin story, you won't need to know anything about the character's comic book exploits to play this one.</p><p>The story will revolve around Wolverine searching for "answers about his past", which is a pretty bog-standard setting to plonk Wolverine into, and he'll need to use "brutal claw combat, violent rage and relentless determination" to reach his goal.</p><p>From the gameplay segments we've seen so far, Wolverine will be battling both in his traditional yellow X-Men attire and in a more downhome plaid shirt outfit, and the combat will be suitably brutal as well, with plenty of blood to go around.</p><p>Strangely enough, it shares at least one thing with IO Interactive's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/007-first-light-delayed-may-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e0d84f2a-3cf3-41a8-9a3a-eb43f66bc545" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">upcoming <em>007 First Light</em></a> in that it'll be a globetrotting adventure for our hero as well, taking him to locations as diverse as Tokyo, Canada, and Madripoor, to name but a few.</p>
<p>News of <em>Wolverine</em>'s release date comes hot on the heels of news that Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-shutting-down-bluepoint-games-in-march" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="97877112-5514-4226-8057-9d99ef1d61c1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">will close <em>Demon's Souls </em>and <em>Shadow of the Colossus </em>studio Bluepoint</a>, suggesting that there might be a little more riding on Insomniac's latest than just the studio's reputation.</p><p><em>Marvel's Wolverine </em>launches <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/marvels-wolverine/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">exclusively for PlayStation 5</a> on September 15th (although, again, I'd be very surprised if there's not a PC port of the game waiting somewhere down the line).

            <p>
Remember how literally only two weeks ago, PlayStation held one of their "Look at the State of the Place, You've Made Such a Mess!" presentations? There were plenty of announcements that landed with suitable aplomb, like a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/castlevania-belmonts-curse-sees-dead-cells-devs-bring-back-vampire-whippage-and-konami-say-its-just-the-start-of-a-revival">new Castlevania</a>, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-first-person-walk-around-a-foggy-scottish-town-in-the-90s-silent-hill-townfall-is-certainly-serious-about-instilling-dread">proper look at Silent Hill: Townfall</a>, and a reveal of remakes of the OG three God of War Games. So it strikes me as perhaps a bit odd, and funny, that today Insomniac Games have, with quite little fanfare, confirmed the release date of their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvels-wolverine">Wolverine</a> joint.
</p>
<p>
I'm serious, the studio has literally just released a six second video across its socials which literally just shows the date for four of those. Oh, it's September 15th, this year, sorry, forgot that's the important bits, though for us in PC land this means next to nothing as the game will be a PS5 exclusive at launch. But given that all three of Insomniac's Spider-Man games eventually made their way to PC, we probably safely assume Wolverine will do much the same.

In terms of when that might be, well, I can make a guess. The first Spider-Man game came out before Sony started their PC porting strategy, but for the second smaller entry, Miles Morales, it took two years to make the jump, and for the full-on sequel the wait was about a year and a half.
</p><p>
It is worth considering the fact that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> is getting a PC release next month, less than a year after its PS5 launch, but Kojima Productions aren't owned by Sony like Insomniac are, so that might make a difference. All of this is to say, we should expect to wait at least roughly a year, if not a bit more.
</p>
<p>
Since its announcement, we honestly haven't seen all that much of the action game in, well, action, apart from a short gameplay trailer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvels-wolverine-at-long-last-gets-a-borderline-uncomfortably-bloody-gameplay-trailer-and-a-ps5-release-window">shown last year</a>. I expect it'll be a good few months before we see anything lengthier, perhaps in a summer showcase, but hey ho, marketing has to do its thing! And I'm sure it'll continue to do its thing when it's our turn to play.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Steam’s tri-yearly Next Fest, a week-long “celebration” featuring hundreds of new demos from triple-A and indie publishers alike, isn’t quite hitting the same as it used to for the community, due to the ever-growing influx of “slop” and “games that use generative AI and flip assets.” </span></p> <p><span>While this has been an issue for the last handful of Next Fests, Steam users on </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1rd10ws/the_next_fest_has_too_much_ai_slop_and_asset/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>Reddit</span></a><span> are reporting that this time around, they’ve had enough, and are opting to sort through the new games by popularity. For the indie devs banking on the free publicity that Next Fest provides, this seems like an awfully counterproductive use of the event as a whole.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">There are a zillion demos in this Steam Next Fest, and I'm going to be very real…I don't feel very compelled to check out demos with AI art capsules</p> <p>— Bucky | Palworld (@Bucky_cm) <a href="https://twitter.com/Bucky_cm/status/2026122068023226447?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 24, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Of course, the issue here has been exacerbated by the misuse of Valve’s AI disclosure section on Steam. While developers on the Steam storefront are required to admit to the use of AI-generated assets in their games, a quick glance at the latest, non-featured titles in the Next Fest line-up features more than a few suspiciously AI-generated-looking titles, none of which include any sort of AI-disclosure tag on their Steam storefront pages.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000673295" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000673295"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000673295">Valve</figcaption></figure> <p><span>As one user </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1rd10ws/comment/o728gau/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>explains</span></a><span>, they believe this is happening because developers are seemingly never punished for lying about generative AI use. “There is no real penalty so far for not disclosing. Only if you blatantly used like LLM text generation at run time would Valve care and that’s just for legal reasons. For assets etc it’s very much a trust system by Valve, they mostly did it to shut people up.”</span></p>   <p><span>So what’s the solution? According to several commenters, the only way to combat the rising tide of AI-generated games on Steam is to sort by popularity and reviews. However, the irony of sorting by popularity during Next Fest, an event designed to freely advertise indie demos, </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1rd10ws/comment/o72ewb7/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>hasn’t been lost</span></a><span> on the community. “These last few fests I’ve just had to sort by popularity. But I feel like that defeats the purpose of these events if all I’m doing is ‘finding’ the stuff that I would’ve heard about anyway. It’s just too exhausting to filter through.”</span></p>

 <p><span>On the flipside to the issue at hand, there’s an equally terrible problem plaguing a large swathe of indie devs taking part in Next Fest: false-positive AI-generated accusations. In the lead-up to the event, dozens of developers on subreddits such as </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IndieDev/comments/1p72gqo/how_can_we_defend_from_aiallegations/"><span>r/IndieDev</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1pr677z/how_should_devs_handle_curator_reviews_that_make/"><span>r/gamedev</span></a><span> have reported being incorrectly accused of using AI to make their games. Whatever the fix is, it’s clear that the onus here is on Valve, because this new wave of false-positive reporting proves that it’s getting harder and harder for the common man to accurately spot AI-gen’d assets.</span></p>

<p>Asha Sharma responds to concerns over her Xbox gamertag profile and recent social media posts.</p>



<p>Following Phil Spencer’s retirement announcement on Friday, February 20, Asha Sharma was named EVP and CEO of Microsoft Gaming. In an attempt to familiarize herself with the Xbox player base, Sharma <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-xbox-ceo-responds-to-fans-desire-for-console-exclusives/" id="178442">replied to players on Twitter</a>, letting them know that she hears their concerns and wants to recommit to core Xbox players and re-strengthen the brand.</p>



<p>In one of these tweets, she shared her gamertag.<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-ceo-profile-one-month-old-suspicious/" id="178467"> Internet sleuths quickly searched the profile </a>and felt it was artificially boosted to enhance her appearance as a relatable gamer.</p>



<h2 id="h-asha-sharma-didn-t-expect-her-profile-to-become-a-big-deal">Asha Sharma Didn’t Expect Her Profile to Become a Big Deal</h2>



<p>Responding to IGN’s Ryan McCaffrey on Twitter, Sharma claimed that she didn’t expect the gamertag to garner so much attention. </p>



<p>She also responded to concerns that AI, the department at Microsoft she previously worked in, is being used to write her posts, saying she agrees with those who claim that faking her affinity for gaming would be a bad thing.</p>



<p>She says her account had racked up more than 10,000 Gamerscore and played such a wide variety of games because it was a shared account at home. That has since been fixed.</p>



<p>“I also didn’t expect my gamertag to blowup and the reality is more boring. I created it recently to learn and understand this world. I’ve played with my family, and it’s a shared home account across devices (which you can see in the range of games /achievements). Fixed that this weekend and everyone is only playing on their own GTs,” she said before reaffirming that her goal is to return to the roots of Xbox and make the brand stronger for the future.</p>

<p>One of the games that Asha Sharma’s profile had 100% completed was Firewatch. Sharma has claimed that the game deeply resonated with her, and she wants to make emotionally impactful content like that at Xbox.

<p>Despite being regarded as one of the greatest role-playing games of all time,&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind </em>disappointed some fans upon its release in 2002 because it didn’t match the colossal scope of its predecessor, <em>The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall</em>. Almost immediately, fans began modding the remaining parts of the series’ fictional continent, Tamriel, into the game.</p>
<p>Over 20 years later, thousands of volunteers have collaborated on the mod projects <a href="https://www.tamriel-rebuilt.org/">Tamriel Rebuilt</a> and <a href="https://www.project-tamriel.com/welcome">Project Tamriel</a>, building a space comparable in size to a small country. Such projects often sputter out, but these have endured, thanks in part to a steady stream of small, manageable updates instead of larger, less frequent ones.</p>
<h2>A tale of (at least two) mods</h2>
<p>It’s true that <em>Daggerfall</em> included an entire continent’s worth of content, but it was mostly composed of procedurally generated liminal space. By contrast, <em>Morrowind</em> contained just a single island—not even the entire province after which the game was named. The difference was that it was handcrafted.</p>
<p>Still, a player called “Ender,” stewing in disappointment over <em>Morrowind</em>’s perceived scope, took to an Elder Scrolls forum to propose a collaborative effort to mod the rest of Tamriel into the game. Tamriel Rebuilt was born.</p>
<p>After realizing that re-creating the entire continent was too lofty a goal, the group decided to instead focus on the rest of the <em>Morrowind</em> province alone—but that didn’t last long.</p>
<p>There had been others working toward similar goals. The makers of the fan project “Skyrim: Home of The Nords” were working on putting the province of Skyrim into&nbsp;<em>Morrowind</em>&nbsp;well before that location was officially made the setting of the 2011 sequel <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em>.</p>

<p>Other modders were working on “Project Cyrodilll,” an attempt to put <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em>’s province into <em>Morrowind</em>. In 2015, those two projects combined to form Project Tamriel, reigniting the goal of adding the remaining provinces of Tamriel.</p>
<p>Tamriel Rebuilt and Project Tamriel first became connected when the modders decided to combine their asset repositories into <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44537">Tamriel_Data</a>, but they have since grown closer through their shared developers, training protocols, and tools.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
            
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>“The entirety of Tamriel is, in our scale, roughly the size of the real-life country of Malta, which is small in real life, but quite big from a human perspective,” said Tiny Plesiosaur, a senior developer who has done mapping and planning for both projects but who spends most of her time on Project Tamriel these days.</p>
<p>Both projects aim to create a cohesive, lore-accurate representation of these realms as they would have looked during the fictional historical period in which <em>Morrowind</em> takes place. So far, they’ve made substantial progress.</p>
<p>One thing in their favor, said Mort, a 13-year veteran quest-designer of Tamriel Rebuilt, is that <em>Morrowind</em> design makes it especially amenable to large-scale modding.</p>
<p>“I’d say the thing that makes <em>Morrowind</em> most conducive to these kinds of projects is no voiced dialogue,” Mort said. “The reason that you see so many quest mods for <em>Morrowind</em>&nbsp;as opposed to <em>Oblivion</em> and <em>Skyrim</em> and even <em>Fallout</em> is that the barrier to make a quest is essentially nothing.”</p>
<p>Frequent, contained public releases also work to their advantage. “I know for a lot of projects, they want to [do a] ‘we’ll release it when it’s done’ kind of thing,” said Mort. “We’ve found that releasing content builds hype, it gives players what they want, and perhaps most importantly, it serves as a proof of life and a fantastic recruitment tool.”</p>

<p>Every time Tamriel Rebuilt pushes a release, he said, the team picks up at least a dozen devs almost immediately. So far, Tamriel Rebuilt has seen nine releases; the most recent is titled “Grasping Fortune.” The next release, “Poison Song,” is expected sometime in 2026 and will include a never-before-seen faction. The most optimistic estimate for when the project will be fully finished is 2035.</p>

<p>Project Tamriel has made most of its progress in Skyrim and Cyrodiil. The release of “Abecean Shores,” the coastal section of Cyrodiil, came in late 2024. Together, the projects have added hundreds of hours of hand-crafted quests, dungeons, and landscapes to a game that was already robust.</p>

<p>Lus said the current timeline for Project Tamriel is a new release for Skyrim and then Cyrodill, followed by either High Rock—a comparatively smaller, peninsula province west of Skyrim—or the desert province of Hammerfell.</p>
<p>For many developers, the point isn’t to see these massive projects in a finished state but to complete the next task and hopefully bring the team closer to the next release.</p>
<h2>A brief history of Tamriel Rebuilt</h2>
<p>Sultan of Rum, a kind of historian for Tamriel Rebuilt, joked that the project was aptly named because of how many times it has been rebuilt—partly because the tools the modders use to build the project have gotten better over time, rendering work done before those advances obsolete.</p>
<p>But even then, Tamriel Rebuilt was more of a Wild West in its infancy: a ragtag bunch of video game enthusiasts working mostly independently and without very much oversight. As the project has become more unified, it has meant a lot of turnover and a fair share of setbacks.</p>
<p>“If you took a satellite picture of the game world in 2005, you’d have essentially a complete province already,” Sultan of Rum said. “But the trouble was that the quality wasn’t good; there was no coherence. The 5 percent of the work to just create a landmass was done, but the management wasn’t there.”</p>
<p>Much of the project’s history has been lost to time as Internet forums disappeared, but Sultan of Rum has been able to piece together some of the growing pains Tamriel Rebuilt has endured. A struggle between the need to centralize and the desire of some modders to remain independent is a recurring theme.</p>
<p>One period is considered a dark age for Tamriel Rebuilt. In the first couple of years, a significant group of modders had been working on a piece of content for the project called “Silgrad Tower,” while the project simultaneously began consolidating to build continuity.</p>

<p>There was debate among the modders about where Silgrid Tower should be located and which faction would have controlled it. This eventually led to an acrimonious split between the two groups. “The Silgrid Tower team was eventually put to the choice of either having to delete their work and restart it or, you know, leave the project. So they left the project,” said Sultan of Rum.</p>
<p>He said that much of the conflict has since been scrubbed from the forum archives, and the ordeal led to the deletion of the Tamriel Rebuilt forums, which were hosted by the Silgrid Tower team. This was probably the most drama the project has seen, he said.</p>
<p>There was also a period when the project moved to <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em>’s construction set. “Maybe even a majority of the project jumped onto the [Oblivion] engine to start building out Hammerfell,” said Sultan of Rum. “So for a long time—four years—the sort of focus point of Tamriel Rebuilt was on <em>Oblivion</em> and on the province of Hammerfell, not on the <em>Morrowind</em> part, which of course was the successful one.”</p>
<p>Another event is solemnly referred to as “The Great Self-Decapitation.” Sultan of Rum explained that around 2015, some of the older guard—developers and administrators alike—left the project all at once. The exodus was due to the second scrapping of a large city in development.</p>
<p>“People were hoping that by 2013 it would come out. Literally thousands of hours of human labor were spent creating it in the construction set,” recalled Sultan of Rum. “It just turned out that it was non-viable as a playable space. It wasn’t thought out well enough, it didn’t coalesce into a compelling, playable world. The modders were faced with the prospect of having to throw out just a huge chunk of work.”</p>
<p>That decision sapped a lot of energy from the project, and others on the team began to move away from it as their personal lives became busier. Sultan of Rum said all this has made the project better in the long run. Project leaders soon instituted better planning and management systems that centralized information and preserved institutional knowledge in case longtime developers decide to leave.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
            
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Over the years, they’ve also refined their training practices, which has ultimately led to more developers joining both projects.</p>
<p>“If your goal is to get development done, providing as much detail and tutorializing and onboarding processes, making that as simple as possible is going to get you your best results,” said Mort. “Because, again, if you aren’t gaining devs, you’re losing devs.”</p>
<p>The parameters for onboarding new developers are now clearly defined, with a low barrier to entry focused on competence with the tools. These tests are called <a href="https://www.tamriel-rebuilt.org/content/showcase-guidelines">showcases</a>.</p>
<p>Once the showcase is accepted, developers can begin working on both Tamriel Rebuilt and Project Tamriel, where much of the overlap between the two lies.</p>
<p>Mort added that the gap between a potential developer expressing interest and actively contributing can be as little as a week. This also allows movement between roles—for example, an interior designer training in exterior designing or someone starting in quest design moving elsewhere if it’s not a good fit.</p>
<p>Even more importantly, newer tech has improved the development process. The open source 3D modeling and animation tool Blender has become much friendlier to <em>Morrowind</em> modders, enabling teams to create custom assets more easily.</p>
<p>While this has required retouching some areas of Tamriel Rebuilt, it has also meant quicker turnaround times for custom assets. For Project Tamriel developers, the impact has been greater, as they can now reliably and routinely create assets to better represent Tamriel’s diverse cultures.</p>

<h2>The old informs the new</h2>
<p>The developers are well aware that both projects may still be unfinished 10 years from now, but most are just working toward the next release.</p>
<p>Discussing the project with just a few of the developers, it’s immediately clear how current work will inform future efforts.</p>
<p>For example, LogansGun is an exterior developer who did much of the work on the promotional videos for Tamriel Rebuilt’s last few releases. He joined the project because he wanted to leave his mark on this historical effort and ended up staying much longer than he thought he would.</p>

<p>Between work and raising a family, LogansGun often found himself working on Tamriel Rebuilt instead of playing video games, partly because of a childhood love for <em>Morrowind</em> and a desire to make the game more than it was.</p>
<p>“I remember playing it a lot, and it really stuck with me,” LogansGun said. “And it might have been like 5th or 6th grade that I had a friend and we all sat in like a four-student pod, and he would bring the map inside the plastic Xbox disc case. When we had some free time in class, he’d lay it out, and we’d all be looking all over the map of Vvardenfell and all the things that we had explored or wanted to explore.”</p>

<p>Meadhainnigh, a college-aged chemical engineering student, first learned about Tamriel Rebuilt through the promotional video for Grasping Fortune, the project’s most recent update. The roughly three-minute video showcases some of the landscapes, cityscapes, and interiors, the culmination of thousands of hours of work. LogansGun is credited as the creator of that video, which has been used to inspire the next wave of contributors.</p>
<p>“I was thinking, well, this seems like a really cool project, and I just wanted to contribute and feel part of something bigger, and the rest is history, really,” said Meadhainnigh, who is now an asset dev for Project Tamriel. “But I joined the Discord server. I kind of learned the process of the project, and once I felt like I knew what I was going on, I tossed my hat in the ring.”</p>
<p>Meadhainnigh knew very little about development before he joined the project, and he said it’s the first online community he has been a part of. What keeps him going is that community—and to see his and others’ work become a part of a whole.</p>
<p>“We have some really wonderful people who are the old guard that feel like they are the comfortable welders, and they’re all very wise,” he said. “But even in the newest editions, we’re not here because we think that it’s all going to be done within our lifetimes. We like to joke about 2090 and about raising our children to work on the project. We just like to look at the next release, and that tends to be exciting enough to get us going.”</p>
