A webcam isn’t a necessary accessory, but since the Switch 2 lacks one of its own, you need one to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/video/685229/nintendo-switch-2-gamechat-c-button-mario-kart">take full advantage of the console’s GameChat feature</a> that can livestream players’ faces during multiplayer matches. Switch 2 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/693182/nintendo-switch-2-webcam-mystery-1080p-480p-uvc-iso-bulk-ugreen-elgato">webcam compatibility has since improved</a>, but if you don’t already own one, you can now use your Pixel smartphone, <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-phone-as-switch-2-webcam-3622443/">according to <em>Android Authority</em></a>.</p></div><p>Despite Nintendo’s claims that the Switch 2 works with most USB webcams, our own testing confirmed that Pixel smartphones could not be used as webcams at launch, even with the device’s settings switched to the USB webcam mode that Google introduced with Android 14. Switch 2 users eventually found that Android phones and iPhones could be used as a webcam for the console, but with the help of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGH_VF-Gx4Y">additional USB-C to HDMI adapters</a>, and HDMI capture cables.</p><p>But extra hardware is no longer needed to use a Pixel smartphone as a Switch 2 webcam. We tested a Pixel 9 Pro connected directly to the Switch 2’s top USB-C port with a single cable and, after switching the USB preferences to “Webcam” mode, we were able to use the smartphone as the camera for GameChat. If you’re playing multiplayer games like <em>Mario Kart World</em>, GameChat lets you not only speak with other competitors around the world, but also see them superimposed over a livestream of them playing if you’re using a webcam.</p><p>It’s not known if recent updates on Google’s or Nintendo’s end are responsible for making this work (the Pixel 9 Pro we tested it with is running the Android 16 December release) but it’s a welcome upgrade for those who frequently travel with their Switch 2 and don’t want to lug a separate webcam everywhere they go.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>The Verge Daily</h2><p><span>A free daily digest of the news that matters most.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></div></main></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/839133/google-pixel-smartphone-nintendo-switch-2-webcam]]></content:encoded>

But it looks like Nintendo isn't ready to give up on the nostalgia just yet, as it has released a printable 'databook' for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, that just makes our hearts sing (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ninpatentswatch.bsky.social/post/3m75hnarurk2b">@ninpatentswatch</a>).</p>
<p>The booklet is only available on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/games/switch2/bgw5a/databook/index.html#page1">Japanese Nintendo website</a> at the time of writing — with all of the text in Japanese, natch — but it scratches such a retro itch for us that we're amazed the big N doesn't do something similar for all its releases.</p><div><figure data-videoid="6TAq6m9hxyY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt6TAq6m9hxyY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed76f4ceszpnol&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>The 24-page 'World Databook', to give it its official title, is full of a lot of things you would expect from a classic instruction manual, including game controls and character introductions, but there are also rundowns of the game's main locales and mechanics, with a sneaky bit of lore peppered in there, too.</p>
<p>Here's a couple of pages, so you can get a taste for what's inside:</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/games/switch2/bgw5a/databook/pdf/PDFmanual.pdf">full PDF</a> has instructions for how to print and fold the booklet, so you can rest easy knowing that it'll slot nicely into those under-utilised plastic clips that occupy the top half of all modern game cases.</p>
<p>Would opening the in-game menu and looking up the controls that way be an awful lot easier? Sure it would. But come on, where's the fun in that?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat, Hogwarts Legacy, And Batman: Arkham Are Going To A Company That Closed Its Only AAA Game Studio]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/netflix-wb-batman-arkham-hogwarts-legacy-mortal-kombat-2000650918</link>
            <guid>1374697</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Netflix is bidding <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-warner-bros-deal-batman-hbo-max-2000650875">over $80 billion to buy Warner Bros.</a>, and it’s probably not doing it for the games. But the company will still come away with a ton of them if the merger goes through. Warner Bros. Games is one of the few major publishers left in the U.S. following years of big acquisition deals. What might be closer to a rounding error relative to the larger movie and TV portfolio still marks a huge shift for the industry. And Netflix’s incredibly chaotic fumbling of gaming over the last several years raises some alarm bells.</p> <p>The king of streaming confirmed during a conference call presentation about the newly revealed deal that games would be part of the transaction, but <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/yes-netflix-is-acquiring-warner-bros-games">never discussed them outright</a>. Instead, they were relegated to the smallest square on a presentation slide outlining the various components of the merger. They were lumped in with “Games &amp; Consumer Product &amp; Experiences” alongside much bigger brands like HBO, DC, Harry Potter, and Superman.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000650991" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650991"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650991">Netflix / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Even with its massive success, the best-selling game of 2023, <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, was clearly nowhere close to top-of-mind for Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters. The open-world wizarding game already has a sequel in development at Avalanche Software, and it’s supposed to have <a href="https://kotaku.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-hbo-harry-potter-tv-release-date-1851690168">some level of crossover</a> with the upcoming HBO <em>Harry Potter</em> reboot. The first <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> sold over 30 million copies. In revenue terms at least, that puts it way ahead of the global box office for something like James Gunn’s first<em> Superman </em>movie.</p>

 <p>Then there’s TT Games, the UK-based maker of the recent hit <em>Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</em>. It announced a new adaptation of <em>Batman</em> earlier this year called <em>Lego Batman: The Legacy of the Dark Knight,</em> which acts as a best-of sizzle reel for the comic book hero’s peak movie moments <a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-preview-arkham-2000633994">in an<em> Arkham</em>-style open world</a>. There’s no release date yet, but it seems likely to arrive sometime in 2026. If it’s anything like the <em>Skywalker Saga</em>, it’ll be another top-seller.</p>

 <p>Netflix will also become the new home of <em>Mortal Kombat</em>. While a new movie launches next year, fans have been waiting for NeatherRealms to return to the DC universe with <em>Injustice 3</em>. The studio <a href="https://x.com/MortalKombat/status/1926020816879206810">announced earlier this year</a> that it was done shipping new DLC for 2023’s <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> and would switch to focusing on its “next project” instead. Unless Ed Boon’s team is quietly at work on a completely new cross-over fighting game, a return to the alternate DC universe where Superman is bad still seems like the safest bet.</p>

 <h2>The fate of Rocksteady Studios</h2> <p>After that, things at Warner Bros. Games start to get really messy, thanks to years of seemingly short-sighted and chaotic executive decisions. Rocksteady Studios, once the team behind premier blockbusters like <em>Batman: Arkham City</em> and<em> Batman: Arkham Knight,</em> has been licking its wounds after the dismal failure of last year’s live service spin-off,<em> Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League</em>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-hogwarts-legacy-rocksteady-arkham-1851522893">Encouraged by publisher leadership</a> despite misgivings from the studio floor, the multiplayer loot shooter lost over $200 million, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-06/-suicide-squad-warner-bros-s-200-million-flop-haunts-the-gaming-industry">according to<em> Bloomberg</em></a>.</p>

 <p>The studio is reportedly back to focusing on the Arkham franchise that made it famous, but a new entry would still be years away during a time when AAA development is more expensive and precarious than ever. Earlier this year, Warner Bros. Games took an ax to many of its other studios, including <em>MultiVersus</em> maker Player First Games, WB San Diego, which was making a free-to-play AAA game, and Monolith Productions, which was working on a long-in-development adaptation of <em>Wonder Woman</em>. The latter had a storied history, including developing the <em>Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor</em> series, but <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/103578/full-backstory-revealed-on-why-wb-games-axed-monolith-productions/index.html">lost key leadership</a> after it was forced to pivot from a new IP to adapting <em>Wonder Woman</em>.</p>

 <p>All of this turmoil resulted in publishing head David Haddad being fired from Warner Bros. Games after a decade-plus tenure. The game division’s struggles may have also been compounded by whip-lash from above, amid Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav’s ongoing whirlwind tour through the unraveling conglomerate. Despite casually trampling on marketing plans by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23612615/mortal-kombat-12-announced-2023-release-date/">revealing projects early</a> during investor calls, Zaslav never seemed to be interested in providing Warner Bros. Games with a clear mission or mandate other than “help make stock price go up.”</p> <h2>The Netflix Gaming debacle</h2> <p>News of the sale might be more reassuring if Netflix management didn’t seem equally at a loss when it comes to games. The streamer snatched up a bunch of small studios, including notable indie darlings like<em> Oxenfree</em> maker Night School Studio and <em>Cozy Grove</em> maker Spry Fox over the years. It loaded up its mobile app with tons of critically-acclaimed games from<em> Hades</em> to <em>The Rise of the Golden Idol</em>. It sought big-name additions like the<em> GTA Trilogy Remastered</em>. It even plunged ahead with an AAA studio called Team Blue that pulled veterans from&nbsp;<em>Overwatch</em>,&nbsp;<em>Halo</em>, and&nbsp;<em>God of War</em>.</p> <p>But despite bundling top games with its standard subscription service, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/23/netflix-takes-slow-approach-to-video-games.html">almost nobody played them</a>. It started abandoning indie game deals, cutting resources, and <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-team-blue-socal-studio">quietly shuttered</a> its AAA team last year. Just this week, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-sells-game-studio-spry-fox">Netflix announced</a> it was selling off Spry Fox, which it bought only three years ago, though the ambitious 3D Studio-Ghibli-meets-<em>Animal-Crossing</em>-chillfest called <em>Spirit Crossing</em> will remain in development. Instead, the company’s big focus moving forward will be party games and quick-turn-around licensed junk for its biggest streaming hits like <em>Squid Games</em> and <em>Bridgerton</em>. It’s the latest example of a <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-squid-game-unleashed-app-subscription-team-blue-1851755122">tech company racing into gaming and falling flat on its face</a>.</p>

 <p>So where does that leave Warner Bros. Games and its checkered portfolio of major games and studios? It’s hard to say. In some ways, it complements all of the areas of gaming where Netflix has already failed or retreated. It may not be high up on the list of synergies, but maybe the possibility of an eventual <em>Lego Stranger Things</em> anthology is still part of the streaming platform’s overall ambitions for the merger. Or maybe gaming, and AAA blockbuster gaming in particular, is so peripheral to Netflix’s broader business that Warner Bros. Gaming will find itself in an even more precarious position.</p> <p>Giant acquisitions are rarely as neat and tidy in practice as they appear on paper or in a PowerPoint presentation, even in the best of times, let alone when they’re thrown together in the midst of bidding wars, tumultuous legacy media transformations, and a race toward industry consolidation in order to achieve monopoly pricing power. The only thing worse is the alternatives: <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/i-wanna-blow-this-up-how-bari-weiss-is-trying-to-overhaul-cbs-news-7c222dcd?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqf__sU79yafyMQJEMfHCSs4fmigQ3B1FDTDxd4VSdFIXnEqE9fLO4kOIFOfdrE%3D&amp;gaa_ts=693321bd&amp;gaa_sig=YVIiDhsSG8Saq0NhdsXVZfrJk7xIcIWtlf4iFEqprJZt9Q0pE5poRMAJo7dIKNvDDygD-VXenQ654oZeVxoqcQ%3D%3D">the Bari Weis network</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-price-hike-game-pass-layoffs-new-console-2000638546">Microsoft</a>, or <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-arabia-ownership-trump-jared-kushner-2000649726">Saudi Arabia</a> aren’t great options either.</p>

Heavily influenced by Tactics Ogre and Final Fantasy Tactics, the game has captivated fans with its meticulously crafted war story and highly strategic battles, all played out to a beautiful soundtrack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just over a year following its release, a truly major collaboration between Sword of Convallaria: For This World of Peace and CD PROJEKT RED's open-world RPG The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt has been fully realised and delivered to gamers. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEGNfoSPAXg?si=7s8jqQG1yfoKBR-5" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Geralt, Yennefer, Triss, and Ciri now appear in Sword of Convallaria as playable characters</a>; allowing players to enjoy collaborative stories and quests surrounding the Lord of the Forest from another world.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/05/sword-of-convallaria-the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-collaboration-teaser-0-35-screenshot-1764947962246.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Geralt and Yennefer in the Sword of Convallaria x The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Official Collaboration Trailer</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Bartosz Sztybor, Franchise Creative Director at CD PROJEKT RED, explained his take on the collaboration and how it came together:</strong> “At CD PROJEKT RED, storytelling is at the heart of everything we do, and we take a hands-on approach even when collaborating with external partners. For our partnership with Sword of Convallaria, our Franchise Creative team worked closely with developer XD International to craft a story that captures the essence of The Witcher universe, both for the anime trailer and the collaboration quest. Working with a partner who shares our passion for The Witcher is always a privilege, and we’re thrilled with the results of what we’ve created together. We’re looking forward to sharing the fruits of this partnership with the community, and can’t wait to see their response!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>CD PROJEKT RED’s Satoru Homma, Japan Country Manager, offered further insight into their partnership with XD Games:</strong> “For the collaboration between Sword of Convallaria and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, I was responsible for project management on behalf of CD PROJEKT RED. I am personally a huge fan of Sword of Convallaria, and I had a strong desire to see The Witcher 3’s characters — rendered in beautiful pixel art — playable within a tactical RPG. With the deep love and understanding Sword of Convallaria’s team holds for The Witcher 3, and under the thorough supervision of our in-house lore specialists, we were able to deliver grounded and authentic storytelling in the collaboration quest. I sincerely hope that The Witcher 3 players who may be unfamiliar with the tactical RPG genre will take the time to enjoy this content, which is infused with a deep appreciation for the world and its characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Director of Sword of Convallaria, Guo Lei (of XD Games)spoke about this collaboration in more detail — as well as the circumstances that led to it becoming a reality.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Inspired by <em>Tactics Ogre</em>, which he played in high school, Guo always wanted to become a game creator. He is also a fan of <em>The Witcher 3</em>, and his favourite characters are Geralt and Yennefer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Guo on Sword of Convallaria passing the first anniversary of its western release and how he feels looking back on the past year:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sword of Convallaria got off to a successful start, but there was a period when we were searching for the right direction to go in. However, thanks to the support of our fans, we were able to turn things around and successfully celebrate our first anniversary. From now on, we will continue to develop the game with confidence and enjoyment for the fans who have high expectations for it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regarding the game's content, the Global version saw the release of Iria, and the story of her stepping into the world that lies beyond was depicted on the first anniversary. In the future, Sword of Convallaria will enter its 2.0 story arc, taking players on adventures beyond Iria, and develop a story in which the player protects peace. We hope you will look forward to it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>— On how the  The Witcher 3 collaboration came about:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Guo:</strong> From the beginning, our team had already been acquainted with the CDPR China team. During one of these casual conversations, we mentioned that it would be exciting if we could one day work on something together based on Sword of Convallaria and The Witcher 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Later, we had the opportunity to meet the CDPR Japan team in person at Tokyo Game Show 2024. During our discussions there, I showed them my personal love for The Witcher 3 and the interest in exploring whether we might create something together. They encouraged us to submit a formal proposal, which set the collaboration into motion. The Witcher 3 is a game that boasts worldwide popularity, so I was over the moon when he positively considered our proposal for a collaboration. After considerable effort, the collaboration was officially approved. From that point onward, both teams dedicated nearly a full year to development, ultimately bringing this collaboration to life in the form you see today.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/05/sword-of-convallaria-the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-collaboration-teaser-1-12-screenshot-1764948504837.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Play as Geralt, Yennefer, Triss, and Ciri in Sword of Convallaria</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What it was about </strong><em><strong>The Witcher 3</strong></em><strong> that particularly appealed to him:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">First of all, it's the sense of immersion that comes with being so realistic. You get the feeling that you're immersed in the world, something you can't experience in other games. Also, it's the story element. What's great about it is that it depicts so many stories that you can empathise with. It's very unique in that you make painful choices that change the outcome of the story. I was overwhelmed by how the fascinating characters play an active role in the story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>How the story was designed, its core themes, and the creative collaboration behind it</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We wanted to create the worldview of <em>The Witcher 3</em> within the world of <em>Sword of Convallaria</em>. However, it goes against Geralt's beliefs to get involved in conflicts between nations, and in fact, if we were to depict an epic story involving <em>The Witcher 3</em>, we felt that it would be quite a high hurdle to figure out how to resolve it. For this reason, we decided to aim for a down-to-earth story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The story revolves around the Leshen from <em>The Witcher 3</em> appearing and causing trouble, and Geralt and his friends teaming up with the Leader to defeat it. Behind the scenes, the story also depicts the malice of people. For example, when a problem occurs, people assume that it is the work of those from a different background to themselves and blame them. The theme of the story poses a question of morality, as Geralt and Yennefer intervene to try to resolve this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In The Witcher 3, Geralt and Yennefer are portrayed as unusual people who present differently from the average person. Naturally, they have differing personalities and ways of conducting themselves. We made it a priority to carefully express the various facets of these characters in the collaborative story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We made sure to communicate closely with CD PROJEKT RED. We created shared documents, edited those documents, and received feedback, all of which allowed us to proceed with development meticulously and efficiently. This resulted in a fun development experience unlike any other.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>How they approached reimagining The Witcher 3 characters into the pixel-based world of Sword of Convallaria:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Witcher 3 has a realistic 3D visual style, but when translating that into pixel art, our first priority was to think about how to express the movement in a way that would satisfy players.
</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, the designers also love The Witcher 3, so they had fun designing it  with care, for example, to make it clear the difference between a silver sword and a steel sword. As a result, I got the impression that the visuals went smoothly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>The regions that were  main target for the collaboration:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Worldwide. Sword of Convallaria is available in four languages: Chinese, Japanese, English, and Korean. As with The Witcher 3, we have a global perspective and want game fans around the world to enjoy Sword of Convallaria Sword IP. Therefore, every region is important to us.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If I had to say, we're particularly interested in English-speaking countries. We see the English-speaking world as a region where we still want to gain more fans for Sword of Convallaria. It goes without saying that The Witcher 3 has already gained many English-speaking fans, so we hope that this collaboration will help us further appeal to the English-speaking world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Aspects that particularly stood out for him during this collaboration:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think this was a true collaboration. The fact that both parties were working together in the same direction was a feeling I'd never had before, and it was a lot of fun. It was a wonderful experience for us. So, this time, we were able to communicate directly with CDPR, and not only was it very efficient, but we also felt that everyone gained something from this project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>The part of the collaboration that symbolised its success, or made him especially proud to be a part of it:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s necessary when collaborating with other artists is love for the work. I think that only when we have a strong love for the work can we create something that satisfies our collaborators. We ourselves had always wanted to collaborate with The Witcher 3, but it was thanks to CDPR that we were able to make it happen. We are truly happy. We have also prepared skins for Geralt, Yennefer, and Triss. We have created skins based on the scenes that moved us the most while we were playing The Witcher 3. Geralt usually wears armor, but for this skin we created one that realistically expresses the love between father and daughter when Ciri visits Geralt.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Triss, in The Witcher 3, Triss and Geralt attend a dance party. However, the two of them aren't very interested in the dance party, so they sneak out midway through and enjoy a date in the garden. We recreated that atmosphere with the skin.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each skin was created with love, so I hope all players will check them out.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/05/sword-of-convallaria-the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-collaboration-teaser-1-26-screenshot-1764948378963.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Yennefer stands in front of a portal in the Sword of Convallaria x The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Official Collaboration Trailer</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"> 
<strong>His message to the Sword of Convallaria players who are looking forward to the collaboration:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to all of our fans. It is thanks to you all that Sword of Convallaria has grown so much over the past year or so, and that we have been able to safely reach our first anniversary. Thank you so much! Thanks to everyone's support, we were able to collaborate with The Witcher 3. How will Geralt and his friends play a role in the world of Sword of Convallaria? We hope that not only the Leaders but also fans of The Witcher 3 will enjoy the event.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/developer-of-new-postal-game-shuts-down-studio-after-game-was-announced-then-canceled-over-gen-ai-allegations</link>
            <guid>1374691</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The studio behind the Postal franchise just announced that it will be publishing a brand new Postal game, to be developed by Goonswarm Games. Unfortunately, it even more recently announced it would be cancelling said game, due to accusations that Goonswarm had used generative AI in its development. And now, Goonswarm is shutting down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game, entitled Postal: Bullet Paradise, was announced earlier this week on Wednesday with a reveal trailer and press release. It purports to be a "timeline-hopping, dystopian bullet heavne first-person shooter" set in the Postal universe, where players can select from 11 unlockable Postal Dudes from different timelines and, well, shoot people.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, not long after the trailer debuted, Postal fans began pointing out that the game had a lot of hallmarks of assets made with generative AI. When we went to embed the trailer into this article for you to watch, our access to the video file had been cut off and the official version had been removed from YouTube. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4162690/POSTAL_Bullet_Paradise/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">still watch it through the Steam page here</a> and judge for yourself.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/05/unnamed-1764952300064.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Checking in on the Postal subreddit, you can see some of the feedback. Fan spoint out that the pixel sprites' mouths "don't make sense", and elements such as shading and pixel placement are off somehow. They also point out that Goonswarm has almost certainly used generative AI in its games before (a close watch of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3642560/SCP_Control_Error/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this trailer</a> has a number of pretty obvious indicators), making it not impossible that it would do so again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When accusations initially began flying, both Goonswarm and Running With Scissors denied the use of generative AI. As Goonswarm <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/postal-bullet-paradise/canceled-ai-use" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told PCGamesN in a statement</a>:</p><blockquote>No generative AI was used for the reveal trailer or for the game. All assets were created by our human artists using standard tools. We've already shared layered PSDs, work-in-progress files, and other materials to confirm this. Any mistakes or rough spots in those files are being misinterpreted as 'proof' of AI, but they simply reflect the normal, human art-creation process</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, while Running With Scissors <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/postal/comments/1pdxamc/important_update_to_the_whole_ai_situation/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">initially promised to investigate further</a>, studio co-owner Mike Jeret <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/postal/comments/1peg2v8/wow_mike_j_great_customer_service_skills_go_to/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">angered the Postal audience further</a> by not just vehemently denying there was generative AI in the game, but also using fairly strong language toward the accusers, referring to them as "ignorant assholes" and telling anyone who thought the game used generative AI to "excuse yourself from our Discord."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But finally, today, the publisher has taken a definitive stance. Running With Scissors announced it would be canceling the game entirely, saying that the audience feedback had caused "extreme damage to our brand and our company reputation" and that it no longer trusted the development team.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's Running With Scissors' statement in full:</p><blockquote>After revealing Postal: Bullet Paradise, a title Running With Scissors was planning on publishing but not developing, we've been overwhelmed with negative responses from our concerned Postal Community. The strong feedback from them is that elements of the game are very likely AI-generated and thus has caused extreme damage to our brand and our company reputation.</blockquote><blockquote>We’ve always been, and will always be, transparent with our community. Our trust in the development team is broken; therefore, we've killed the project. We have a lot of good things coming (some you know and some you don’t).</blockquote><blockquote>Since forming Running With Scissors in 1996, we’ve always said that our fans are part of the team. Our priority is to always do right by the millions who support the Postal franchise. We are grateful for the opportunity to make the games we want to play, and will continue to focus on our new projects and updates coming in 2026 and beyond. We can’t wait to share more!</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Fan feedback in response to this seems generally positive, with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/postal/comments/1peewit/postal_bullet_paradise_cancelled/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a number of people suggesting</a> they were excited about the premise of the game and hoped it could be passed on to a different developer. Some are still hoping for an apology from Jeret for his language toward the community, but that has not yet manifested.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there's one group of folks who aren't happy, and that's Goonswarm. In a statement posted to Twitter, the studio announced it would be <a href="https://x.com/goonswarmgames/status/1996984553257279918?s=46" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shutting down due to the cancellation of its game</a>. Here's their statement in full as well:</p><blockquote>Our project, and everything we built over the psat six years, was canceled in just a few days.</blockquote><blockquote>Our studio was mistakenly accused of using AI-generated art in our games, and every attempt to clarify our work only escalated the situation. In the last few hours, we've received a large number of threats, insults, and mockery, which pushed us toward a very difficult decision.</blockquote><blockquote>We're truly sorry for the artists who put their soul into this and supported our studio, only to face false AI accusations. It's tough to pour so much energy into a game and end up caught in the middle of an AI war by accident.</blockquote><blockquote>We've decided to shut down the studio and end all future activities.</blockquote><blockquote>Thank you for being with us. Stay strong, play games.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">This is far from the first time the Postal games, which are essentially about various guys committing mass shootings, have been embroiled in controversy. The last mainline game, Postal 4: NoRegerts, released in 2022 to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/postal-4-no-regerts-review">a rare 2/10 from us</a>. Our reviewer said that "the comedy is lazy and embarrassing, the combat is messy and painfully unsatisfying, and it runs so poorly on high-end hardware that it can scarcely be enjoyed at all even by those just hoping for some campy shock humor." Running With Scissors has also released multiple spinoffs in recent years, such as 2022's Postal: Brain Damaged by CreativeForge Games and a 2023 April Fool's joke in POOSTALL Royale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/steamos-vs-windows-on-dedicated-gpus-its-complicated-but-windows-has-an-edge/</link>

<p>Other results vary from game to game and from GPU to GPU. <em>Borderlands 3</em>, for example, performs quite a bit better on Windows than on SteamOS across all of our tested GPUs, sometimes by as much as 20 or 30 percent (with smaller gaps here and there). As a game from 2019 with no ray-tracing effects, it still runs serviceably on SteamOS across the board, but it was the game we tested that favored Windows the most consistently.</p>


<p>In both <em>Forza Horizon 5&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077,</em> with ray-tracing effects enabled, you also see a consistent advantage for Windows across the 16GB dedicated GPUs, usually somewhere in the 15 to 20 percent range.</p>
<p>To Valve’s credit, there were also many games we tested where Windows and SteamOS performance was functionally tied.&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk</em> without ray-tracing, <em>Returnal</em> when not hitting the 7600’s 8GB RAM limit, and&nbsp;<em>Assassin’s Creed Valhalla</em> were sometimes&nbsp;<em>actually</em> tied between Windows and SteamOS, or they differed by low-single-digit percentages that you could chalk up to the margin of error.</p>


<p>Now look at the results from the integrated GPUs, the Radeon 780M and RX 8060S. These are pretty different GPUs from one another—the 8060S has more than three times the compute units of the 780M, and it’s working with a higher-speed pool of soldered-down LPDDR5X-8000 rather than two poky DDR5-5600 SODIMMs.</p>

<p>But <em>Borderlands&nbsp;</em>aside, SteamOS actually did quite a bit better on these GPUs relative to Windows. In both&nbsp;<em>Forza&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk</em> with ray-tracing enabled, SteamOS slightly beats Windows on the 780M, and mostly closes the performance gap on the 8060S. For the games where Windows and SteamOS essentially tied on the dedicated GPUs, SteamOS has a small but consistent lead over Windows in average frame rates.</p>

                <p>Nvidia today is the world's most valuable company with a market cap of more than $4 trillion, thanks in large part to the AI boom of the past few years. But Nvidia's success was far from guaranteed.</p><p>CEO and co-founder Jensen Huang recalled recently how a $5 million gift following a failed business deal with Sega gave the company the lifeline it needed at the time, allowing the fledgling company to stay in business and eventually become what it is today.</p><p>Appearing on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hptKYix4X8&amp;t=5567s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joe Rogan Experience podcast</a>, Huang talked about how, back in the 1990s, he and his two co-founders were trying to drum up business for their start-up PC company. They traveled to Japan and pitched Sega management on the idea that Nvidia could build the company's Dreamcast console.</p><p>Nvidia wasn't able to get it done, however, discovering that it didn't have the technical ability to give Sega what it needed (Sega would end up partnering with VideoLogic for the Dreamcast). However, Huang still wanted the last $5 million that Sega was due to pay Nvidia for its work on the contract. He told Sega management that Sega could give Nvidia the money as an investment, but Huang frankly admitted that "it is most likely to be lost" given Nvidia's lack of business opportunities.</p><p>At the same time, if Sega didn't give Nvidia the money, Nvidia would go out of business, Huang said. The Sega management team informed Huang that, even with the $5 million investment, Nvidia would likely still go out of business. "It was completely true," Huang said.</p><p>But a top Sega boss apparently took a liking to Huang and decided to give him the money as an investment because "Jensen was a young man [the CEO] liked. That's it." Huang said there was about a 0% chance that Nvidia would be able to return Sega the money.</p><p>Nvidia took that money and used it to help build and grow its business in the world of video games, and when Nvidia went public in 1999 at a valuation of $300 million, Sega cashed out. "If he would have kept that $5 million investment, I think it would be worth probably about $1 trillion today," Huang said.</p><p>Nvidia continues to be a big player in the gaming space with its GPUs and it runs the GeForce Now cloud-gaming platform. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/how-nvidia-makes-money-4799532" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">How Nvidia makes its money</a> today derives more from sales to AI companies.</p>

<figure data-uuid="67780ae09ad49"><a title="M-Ultra Gen2 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/67780ae09ad49/m-ultra-gen2-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Cosmox Gaming offers up a <em>lot</em> of arcade controllers, including the modular <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/hautepad-x-arcade-controller-for-switch-and-switch-2-a-modular-masterclass-at-a-premium-price">Hautepad X</a> at a more premium price and the remarkably affordable <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/hautepad-c16-and-c16-s-arcade-controllers-for-switch-1-and-2-affordable-and-unique-in-equal-measure">Hautepad C16</a>.</p>
<p>Now, the company has launched the <strong>M-Ultra Gen2</strong>, an aluminium-built leverless that sits somewhere in-between the two. If the C-16 is primarily aimed at beginners and the X is for the more hardcore enthusiasts, then the M-Ultra Gen2 is, theoretically, for <em>everybody</em>. It’s quite possibly Cosmox’s best controller yet.</p>
<p>Priced at just over <strong>£110</strong> (or <strong>$149.99</strong> in the US), the Gen2 is more expensive than the aforementioned C-16 and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/8bitdo-arcade-controller-for-switch-plus-switch-2-the-best-way-to-play-street-fighter-6">8BitDo’s Arcade Controller</a>, but still sits comfortably toward the more ‘affordable’ end of the spectrum. You wouldn’t think that after going hands on with it, though. With its aluminium build, the Gen2 is a solid, heavy device that feels a lot more comparable to the Hautepad X.</p><div><figure data-videoid="-13CJKg9tJk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt-13CJKg9tJk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c0dc7sqtvnh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>The surface is slightly textured, meaning it won’t attract any nasty fingerprints when handled over time. With models available in both black and blue, I can’t say for definite whether the black version also repels smudges and grime, but the blue model has remained completely spotless after my time with it.</p>
<p>Like the previous models, the Gen2 is compatible with the Switch and Switch 2 right out of the box – just hold down the relevant button to enable Switch Mode while plugging the device in, and you’re good to go. Naturally, you can use the controller with most modern systems, but just keep in mind that you’ll need an extra authenticator to use it with a PS5 or Xbox.</p>
<p>Speaking of plugs, you get a braided USB-A to USB-C cable, which can either go into the top of the controller or over on the left hand side. If you opt for the top, Cosmox has included a new security clasp to lock the cable in place. You just pull the small switch down to open it up, and the actual port is housed about an inch inside. Once the cable is plugged in and the clasp is locked, there’s no way of accidentally yanking it back out – very handy.</p>

<p>The 16 button layout is pretty standard, with four directional inputs, eight action inputs, and four additional programmable buttons. They utilise Shadow Hunting switches, which are comfortably the lowest-profile yet, and this makes actuation exceedingly quick. In fact, the low profile makes advanced techniques like sliding easier than ever, while they still allow for other methods like double-tapping a single button with two fingers.</p>
<p>So all of this combined with the relatively close spacing between the buttons themselves make general gameplay feel more comfortable than ever. Seriously, if you thought pulling off combos in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> was easy on the C-16, then you’ve seen nothing yet – I wouldn’t be surprised if the Shadow Hunting switches just become the new standard going forward. It's incredibly comfortable to use, and I’ve no doubt it’ll give you an edge if you play competitively.</p>
<p>Taking inspiration from the C-16, all switches include customisable RGB rings which you can tinker with on the device itself via several button combinations. If you want to go even further, you can connect the Gen2 to a PC or Mac and follow the URL address displayed on the controller’s screen to reach the web configurator. Here, you can set the RGB rings to whatever colour you wish and remap the inputs, setting several profiles depending on what kind of game you’re playing.</p>

<p>As is the standard now for Cosmox, the Gen2 also features its own OLED screen to display button-presses in real-time along with your input mode and SOCD mode (plus you can upload custom pixel art via the configurator if you want to personalise it even more). It’s larger than ever this time, which is great if you’re after a bit more clarity, though I’d probably prefer it to be situated more in the middle of the device rather than toward the left. Symmetry ‘n’ all that.</p>
<p>And of course, you’ve got a tournament lock switch on the top left alongside one to toggle the RGB lights on and off. Over on the right are your function buttons like start, select, home, etc. Everything’s labelled nicely, including the main face buttons, but keep in mind that when you’re in Switch Mode, the labels won’t match up with the actual in-game inputs. You’re not going to be looking at the buttons much either way, so it probably won’t matter, but if you’re sensitive about this kind of thing, it’s worth keeping in mind. If it really bothers you, then just remap the inputs via the configurator to match the labelling.</p>
<figure data-uuid="36fb367f2eebd"><a title="M-Ultra Gen2 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/36fb367f2eebd/m-ultra-gen2-8.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I can’t overstate just how <em>nice</em> the M-Ultra Gen2 feels to use. With each new release, it feels like Cosmox Gaming is making more and more small tweaks to achieve eventual perfection. It’s not <em>quite</em> there yet – the 8BitDo Arcade Controller’s ability to dynamically change the button labelling is still a marvel – but the way the buttons feel and the overall build quality of the Gen2 is incredible. Simply put, this is the company’s strongest effort yet, and one of the best leverless arcade controllers available if you’re on a budget.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/fnaf-2-five-nights-freddys-2-movie-trailer-teaser-foxy-1851786887">Five Nights at Freddy’s 2</a>,</em> out now in theaters, doesn’t sound like a good movie. And sure, the first film wasn’t a cinematic masterpiece, but according to critics, the sequel is even worse. It’s already one of 2025’s worst-rated movies, beating out some real stinkers.</p> <p><em>Five Nights at Freddy’s 2</em> is the follow-up to 2023’s <em>Five Nights at Freddy’s</em> and, like that movie, is a live-action adaptation of the popular horror game franchise that features a lot of evil animatronic figures and tons of confusing and bizarre lore. <a href="https://kotaku.com/five-nights-at-freddys-fnaf-movie-review-box-office-1850974086">The original film was a big hit at the box office</a>, but took a beating from critics and ended up with an abysmal <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/five_nights_at_freddys">33% on</a> <em>Rotten Tomatoes.</em> I bet Blumhouse and Universal would love for the newly released sequel to have that score. Instead, critics seem to hate this new entry even more, with <em>Freddy’s 2</em> sitting at a truly awful 12% on the review aggregate site. Ouch.</p>

 <p>Here’s what various critics think about this latest horror sequel:</p> <blockquote><p>“Clunky, overstuffed, and strangely lifeless, <em>Five Nights at Freddy’s 2</em> trades genuine scares for incoherent lore. Even the animatronics can’t save a sequel that feels more like brand maintenance than an actual movie.” – <strong>Dionar Hidalgo, <em>Algo Más Que Cine</em></strong></p> <p>“[Its] sole imperative appears to be boring its audience to death.” – <strong>Nick Schager, <em>The Daily Beast</em></strong></p> <p>“<em>Five Nights at Freddy’s 2</em> plays best for die-hard fans; for everyone else, it’s a stitched-together sequel with few scares and even fewer surprises.” – <strong>Allison Rose, <em>FlickDirect</em></strong></p> <p><em>“Five Nights at Freddy’s 2</em> is one of Blumhouse’s worst sequels, nothing more than a cynical cash grab that treats its audience and fanbase like mindless children.” -T<strong>yler Taing, <em>Discussing Film</em></strong></p></blockquote> <p><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/five_nights_at_freddys_2/reviews">And it goes on and on and on.</a> The consensus is that the movie is primarily designed to appeal to younger teens who are already obsessed with the franchise and will pick up on all the lore, Easter eggs, and secrets buried in the PG-13 horror flick. So it will likely make a lot of money, like the last one. But for everyone else, including people who like good movies, <em>Freddy’s 2</em> sounds like a bad time and one to avoid.</p>

 <p>Compared to some other stinkers released this year, <em>Five Nights at Freddy’s 2</em> is up there. It has a worse <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/star_trek_section_31">Rotten Tomatoes score than the awful <em>Star Trek</em> movie</a> we got this year, which most people thankfully don’t know about. <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/a_minecraft_movie">It also has a worse <em>RT</em> rating</a> than the <a href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-review-bad-jack-black-kids-movie-steve-1851775345">utterly awful Jack Black led <em>Minecraft</em> film</a>, which is wild. It even has a <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/disneys_snow_white">worse score</a> than <a href="https://kotaku.com/snow-white-seven-dwarfs-trailer-cgi-ugly-bad-disney-1851712570">Disney’s terrible <em>Snow White</em> remake</a>, which, yes, came out this year. Remember that movie? Probably not.</p> <p>Oh, and if you are wondering, no, according to <em>Rotten Tomatoes, Freddy’s 2</em> is better than the <em>Borderlands</em> movie. But just barely, as that disaster of a flick from Eli Roth has <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/borderlands">a 10% rating.</a> Better than <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-movie-review-rotten-tomatoes-cast-release-1851616912"><em>Borderlands</em></a> isn’t much, but it is something to brag about, I guess?</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Dave the Diver is a modest game that has expanded like Dave's belt size. The underwater adventure and restaurant management sim mash-up was a surprise hit, and has since spawned crossover efforts with fishing game Dredge, the kaiju Godzilla, and even Ichiban Kasuga of the Like A Dragon series. Now the game is preparing to dive back in with the In The Jungle expansion in early 2026. The DLC will see Dave and his crew heading to a new freshwater biome and catching lake-dwelling creatures to make their dishes. GameSpot spoke with Mintrocket CEO and Dave the Diver game director Jaeho Hwang about the upcoming expansion, how the studio has responded to the game's success, and the delicious research that goes into making a game all about food.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ZsbGrCQ58" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/P3ZsbGrCQ58" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: What was the genesis of the "In the Jungle" concept? What was the team trying to achieve with this new biome?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Jaeho Hwang: </strong>In Dave the Diver, we felt we had done a fair job showcasing the mystique of the ocean, so we wanted to explore a completely different world this time.</p><p dir="ltr">The jungle biome was something we had been eager to try since the early days of developing Dave the Diver. We couldn't include fascinating freshwater creatures like alligators or piranhas before, and players have been asking for them a lot. You may have seen massive, fierce fish like catfish or tigerfish in documentaries or on YouTube. We thought it would be fun for Dave to catch and battle these kinds of creatures.</p><p dir="ltr">Besides the lake, we also plan to bring the jungle's diverse wildlife and insects to the game. You'll see Dave chasing wild butterflies or even getting attacked by monkeys.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Did you learn any lessons from the main campaign and previous DLCs that you've applied to this one?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Hwang:</strong> Rather than simply expanding the main game experience like most DLCs do, our goal was to create a DLC that offers a completely different experience. Of course, we've kept the fun core elements of management and exploration from the main game, but beyond that, we aim to deliver that enjoyment through new systems. Expanding the game using the original systems and mechanics will continue through other DLCs or updates, while In the Jungle DLC focuses on introducing new experiences and experimental systems. We are trying to distinguish and offer two different concepts.</p><p dir="ltr">For example, in this DLC, time flows in real time at the village. There are also gathering and crafting elements. Unlike the original game where the story has linear progression and the NPCs appear automatically, Dave will need to actively approach and talk to them this time. Of course, there still are unique guests who show up unexpectedly.</p><p dir="ltr">Maintaining the entertainment of the original game while presenting it in a new way is as challenging as creating an entirely new game. The development process has certainly been difficult, but we're continuously improving the quality and believe we would be able to present a satisfying experience to our players when the DLC launches.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What kind of research goes into developing new underwater biomes and sushi recipes? Trips to the aquarium and great sushi restaurants?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Hwang:</strong> This time, since the theme is freshwater fish, the main dishes will surprisingly be grilled fish instead of sushi!</p><p dir="ltr">[That may] sound a bit reckless for us to remove one of the most beloved elements. But that's actually why we're releasing this as a DLC rather than a full sequel. A sequel would need to preserve and build upon the appealing elements of the original game.</p><p dir="ltr">When we design new regions or ecosystems, I try to experience the atmosphere firsthand as much as possible. For the jungle environment, I drew a lot of inspiration from a trip to Indonesia--although I didn't get the chance to dive into a lake.</p><p dir="ltr">Most of the dishes in Dave the Diver are fictional, but many team members love scuba diving and often share food experiences from their travels, which we incorporate into the game. We also had team gatherings at the aquarium to observe fish behavior in real life.</p><p dir="ltr">For In the Jungle DLC, we referenced some fish directly from our office aquarium, including discus and snakehead.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4616685-mintrocket_officeaquarium.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4616685" data-ratio="0.66666666666667" data-width="6192" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4616685-mintrocket_officeaquarium.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4616685"></a><figcaption>Mintrocket's office aquarium</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4616685-mintrocket_officeaquarium.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>The new lake setting would seem to make a big difference to the types of fish available. Does it impact other aspects of the underwater segments?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Hwang:</strong> As shown in the trailer, the biggest change is the introduction of creatures like alligators and catfish.</p><p dir="ltr">There are also differences in the resources you can gather underwater at the lake. For example, since it's not the ocean, you won't be collecting coral or starfish.</p><p dir="ltr">In this DLC, we've reduced the randomness of obtaining weapons underwater and instead focused on upgrading the equipment in various forms in the village. You'll also find new weapons tailored to the region.</p><p dir="ltr">The lake in the DLC actually starts off polluted due to a certain incident, and there are some elements triggered from this. It can also be purified through a certain process.</p><p dir="ltr">I can't reveal a whole lot just yet, but there are also some gimmicks from ancient civilization elements found in the lake.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>How do you approach paid vs free DLC updates?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Hwang:</strong> Dave the Diver has been far more successful than we have expected, so we've tried to provide as much content as possible for free. So far--aside from the Like a Dragon collaboration--everything, including the Nintendo Switch 2 upgrade, has been offered at no cost. Our players have been supporting us with incredible passion, and we've never felt that this approach has caused us any loss.</p><p dir="ltr">However, In the Jungle DLC content would be around 10 hours of gameplay and we've put in a significant amount of development effort behind this. For this reason, it will be released as paid add-on content. We've heard some disappointment from our community regarding the high price of the Like a Dragon DLC ($6.99) compared to its volume, so this time we're committed to setting a fair price and delivering content that exceeds expectations in quality as we have done in the past.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>How has the game's success impacted your process for handling DLC? Did you add more post-launch plans once it took off or was the plan always to provide this much post-launch support?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Hwang:</strong> As a director, I've always dreamt that if the base game succeeded, we would have the chance to expand its universe through collaborating with other games. Thankfully, Dave the Diver's success gave us the opportunity to work with many amazing IPs--and even bring some of my personal favorites, like Godzilla and Ichiban Kasuga, into our world.</p><p dir="ltr">Jungle-themed DLC was always part of our plan, but it would have been difficult to commit to it if the game hadn't received such a positive response. I want to take this chance to thank our players for giving us the opportunity to keep moving forward.</p><p dir="ltr">Even after the In the Jungle DLC, I have some fun crossover and content ideas that I'd love to pursue. I can't reveal anything just yet, but I hope there will be another chance to share them someday through GameSpot.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Of the many progression paths to follow in extraction shooter <i>Arc Raiders</i>, perhaps one of the most rewarding are blueprints. They expand your arsenal by giving you access to craft all sorts of new weapons, gun mods, grenades, and more. Once you hit max level, finish all your quests (you get blueprints for many of these!), and even wrap up the expedition project, collecting blueprints is the true end-game grind.</p> <p><b>Read More: </b><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-screenshots-photo-mode-hud-binoculars-2000650620">One Player Turned 2025’s Hit Extraction Shooter Into A Stunning War Photography Sim</a></p> <p>But blueprints are often quite tricky to find. Outside of the ones you earn for completing quests, most players come across blueprints randomly, without much rhyme or reason as to why they’re found in certain areas.</p>

 <p>In my extensive time with the game, blueprints can be very hard to source reliably, unlike much of the game’s loot, which typically is found in specific environmental categories. It truly feels random.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-leaper-kill-spaceport-trials-into-the-fray-2000649665">This Is The ‘Easiest’ Way To Kill A Leaper In <i>Arc Raiders</i></a></p> <p>But don’t despair, there are some clear strategies that can amplify your chances of finding new blueprints. Let’s get into it.</p>

 <h2>Blueprint hunting? Prioritize Night and Electromagnetic Storm Raids</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000650972" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650972"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650972">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><i>Arc Raiders</i>’ five unique maps see a regular rotation of activities, such as Night Raids, raids with intense lightning storms, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-hidden-bunker-wall-hack-glitch-keys-2000650571">Spaceport’s exclusive Hidden Bunker activity</a>. These activities have fewer extraction points, as well as environmental conditions that can prove more dangerous than a normal run.</p>

 <p>But in my experience, they seem to dramatically improve your chances of finding blueprints. Also, running an activity like a Night Raid will double the amount of trial points you get for completing certain activities, and it’s not uncommon to earn a blueprint from completing a trial.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-inventory-full-stash-loadout-crafting-cheat-sheet-2000643629">The Hoarder’s Guide To Managing Your <i>Arc Raiders</i> Inventory</a></p> <p>These activities are dangerous, however, so you want to go in well-equipped <i>or</i> without much to lose. Whether you want to bring in your valuable weapons or minimize your losses is up to you, but if there’s one thing I’ve learned by hitting Night Raids and similar activities, it’s to avoid running with a Free Loadout when possible.</p>

 <h2>Don’t use Free Loadouts when hunting for blueprints</h2> <p>Free Loadouts are wonderful. They’re a quick way to warm up without much risk of loss. But they don’t include a safe pocket, which lets you stash away a single item (that isn’t a gun or shield) to be preserved even if you fail to extract with it.</p>

 <p>So yes, while rolling into a Night Raid with a Free Loadout situates you with nothing to lose and everything to gain, scoring a blueprint on a run won’t do you much good if you get taken out without the ability to safely secure that item.</p> <p>By the time you start&nbsp; grinding for blueprints and hitting up the more challenging map conditions, you should have enough loot to at least put together a basic loadout with an augment that includes a safe pocket.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-guns-blue-green-purple-gold-best-2000644142">The Best Guns For Every Possible Situation In <i>Arc Raiders</i></a></p> <p>Remember, you can always trade a Free Loadout augment for any of the starting augments from Lance in the Traders tab of the main menu.</p>

 <p>Once you find a blueprint, toss that thing into your safe pocket immediately. Don’t take any chances.</p> <h2>Now that you have a safe pocket for blueprints, where should you look?</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000650971" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650971"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650971">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>There might be a blueprint hiding in some random hood of a car in a parking lot. There could be one in a trash can tucked away in an alley somewhere. They’re exceedingly random in their hiding spots, and it’s hard to predict just where you’ll find one.</p> <p>For that reason, you’re going to want to prioritize locations with <i>tons</i> of loot containers, especially office buildings that have no shortage of desk drawers, lockers, and cabinets to rifle through.</p>

 <p>In my experience, it’s not so much that things like desk drawers and lockers have a higher likelihood of containing a blueprint, but it’s that in a room filled with them, you’re simply opening far more containers and are thus increasing your odds of finding a blueprint by numbers alone. Think of them like loot boxes (that you don’t pay for). Do you want to open one or two with the chance of finding something good? Or a dozen of them?</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-cheat-sheet-crafting-guns-ardb-wiki-2000644449"><i>Arc Raiders</i>: The Best Cheat Sheets And Third-Party Resources</a></p> <p>I recommend searching the following locations as they’re filled with lockers and drawers:</p> <h3>Spaceport</h3> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Arrival Building</li> <li aria-level="1">Departure Building</li> <li aria-level="1">Control Tower A6</li> </ul> <h3>Dam Battlegrounds</h3> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Research &amp; Administration</li> <li aria-level="1">Control Tower</li> <li aria-level="1">Testing Annex</li> </ul> <h3>Buried City</h3> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Plaza Rosa (especially the locked pharmacy)</li> <li aria-level="1">Library</li> <li aria-level="1">Space Travel</li> <li aria-level="1">Research</li> <li aria-level="1">Hospital</li> </ul> <p>As for the remaining two maps, you can certainly end up finding blueprints on them, but Blue Gate, in my experience, doesn’t have as many office suites filled with tons of drawers to improve your lottery chances. That said, the Reinforced Reception area is pretty good, but that location is likely to be hot with other players as there’s some great weaponry to be found down there.</p>

 <p>Similarly, Stella Montis, the game’s tiniest map, has quickly made a name for itself as a slaughterfest. It’s basically the unofficial PvP map. So, while you might stand to find some good blueprints here, expect some overwhelming fights. If you’re dead set on going here to hunt blueprints, you probably want to prioritize Medical Research, Loading Bay, or the many discarded suitcases in Lobby. Still, Stella Montis is typically such a dangerous map that I wouldn’t advise going here unless you’re looking for a brawl. You might find a blueprint, only to be killed moments later without a chance to even stash it away in your safe pocket.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-trade-fruit-loot-scrappy-lemons-mushrooms-2000649233">Extraction Shooter Player Puts Down Guns And Starts Selling Fruit Instead</a></p> <p>Finally, trash cans <i>seem </i>like they have a higher percentage of containing a blueprint. Don’t worry, that doesn’t mean you need to run up to every single trash can you see. You can tell if a trash can has loot if it has an extra cover on top, making it appear taller than other receptacles.</p> <h2>Search <i>everything</i> in key rooms</h2> <p>In general, it’s best to loot the locked rooms during Night Raids and similar activities. But as with the locations listed above, be <i>thorough</i> in your searches of these rooms. I recommend bringing Door Blockers and Barricade Kits, as well as other items to booby trap these rooms once you get in. That will buy you time to sift through every possible loot container in case <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-pvp-betrayal-bounty-rat-camp-2000649163">another player tries to jump you</a> while you’re looting the now-unlocked room.</p> <hr> <p>Blueprints are essential for piecing together a new <i>Arc Raiders </i>loadout that’s powerful and effective after a crushing loss.</p> <p>Happy hunting!</p>

              <p>The&nbsp;<em>Postal</em> games have always been what you might call “slop.” Running With Scissors’ series of puerile, drearily unfunny action games have somehow regularly been released since 1997, relying entirely on their hamfisted “shock factor” to try to impress an audience that delights in “politically incorrect” or “anti-woke” dross, without also remembering the important elements of “fun.” But the most recently revealed entry in the 30-year series, <em>Postal: Bullet Paradise</em>, earns the “slop” mantle for a different reason, after massive backlash against its prolific use of AI has seen it canceled in the same week it was announced!</p> <p>Revealed just two days ago, on December 3,&nbsp;<em>Postal: Bullet Paradise&nbsp;</em>was due to be a&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>-like spin-off from the franchise, developed by a separate team called Goonswarm Games. Described as a “bullet-heaven shooter with online co-op,” Running With Scissors promoted the upcoming game with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4162690/POSTAL_Bullet_Paradise/">a Steam page</a>, YouTube trailers, and a <a href="https://runningwithscissors.com/postal-bullet-paradise-brings-nonstop-action-pc-consoles/">section on its own website</a>. Of them all, the only thing that fully remains two days later is the post, with the Steam page delisted and the game removed from RWS’s and Goonswarm’s pages.</p>

 <p>Based on the game’s cancellation announcement <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/postal/comments/1pdenph/rws_using_ai_is_incredibly_disappointing/">on Running With Scissors’ X page</a>, it seems potential fans launched a sizable backlash after noticing&nbsp;<em>Postal: Bullet Paradise</em>&nbsp;allegedly contained AI-generated material. Users on the franchise’s Reddit were complaining about AI art appearing in the trailer, and alleging Goonswarm had used AI in its previous work. “You see can very clearly that all the pixel sprites are ai generated,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/postal/comments/1pdenph/rws_using_ai_is_incredibly_disappointing/">claimed on Reddit poster</a>, adding, “It just sucks that rws is going down the path of ai since they’ve been so supportive of art for a long time.”</p>

 <p>Then came the announcement declaring the entire project flushed. “After revealing <em>POSTAL: Bullet Paradise</em>, a title Running With Scissors was planning on publishing but not developing,” says the statement, “we’ve been overwhelmed with negative responses from our concerned&nbsp;<em>POSTAL</em> Community. The strong feedback from them is that elements of the game are very likely AI-generated and thus has caused extreme damage to our brand and our company reputation.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">After revealing POSTAL: Bullet Paradise, a title Running With Scissors was planning on publishing but not developing, we've been overwhelmed with negative responses from our concerned POSTAL Community. The strong feedback from them is that elements of the game are very likely…</p> <p>— Running With Scissors (@RWSstudios) <a href="https://twitter.com/RWSstudios/status/1996715985437388817?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The statement goes on to express RWS’s desire to be transparent before stating that <em>Bullet Paradise</em> has been canceled, effective immediately. “Our trust in the development team is broken,” it reads, “therefore we’ve killed the project.”</p>

 <p>This is especially embarrassing for the publisher, given that it had only a few days ago publicly disagreed with Epic’s Tim Sweeney over the need to declare AI use in game development.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Customers deserve to know if a game was crafted with creativity, soul and actual talent rather than some machine that craps out anything from a prompt.</p> <p>We don't know what the future holds, but AI apologists like Mr. Sweeney are making this shit unbearable already. <a href="https://t.co/eHszQu5STP">https://t.co/eHszQu5STP</a></p> <p>— Running With Scissors (@RWSstudios) <a href="https://twitter.com/RWSstudios/status/1994033855934644492?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The original&nbsp;<em>Postal</em>, a top-down shooter about playing a postal worker who goes on a mass murder spree throughout the town of Paradise, Arizona, went out of its way to court controversy and notoriety when it first appeared. Its final level was set in an elementary school (albeit where the main character, Postal Dude, has a complete breakdown after none of his weapons work on the children), and its deliberately crass approach was designed to get as much negative attention as possible, presumably to drive sales. However, the mediocre game never sold all that well, and after an equally crap 3D sequel five years later, the company began outsourcing development to Russian studios. 2011’s <em>Postal III</em> was made by Trashmasters, and was so terrible RWS apologized for the game in the aftermath, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130629223127/http://runningwithscissors.com/main/index.php?topic=625.0">eventually deleting it from their store entirely</a>. A 2016 redux version of <em>Postal 2</em> sold so poorly on PC that console versions were canceled (until years later), until RWS finally returned to making their own game with 2022’s <em>Postal 4: No Regrets</em>.</p> <p>It’s probably not a good thing when your franchise’s highlight is a Uwe Boll movie. And to be clear, <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/postal/">that too was atrocious</a>.</p>

<p>Battlefield 6 Winter Offensive content update details have been revealed, and it seems we are receiving a new time-limited map, game modes, and a whole set of bug fixes. </p>



<p>The update highlights for Battlefield 6 Winter Offensive were revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-winter-offensive-update-details-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earlier this week</a>, with developers discussing audio issues, mode adjustments, combat system, soldier visibility, and more.

<h2 id="h-what-s-new-in-battlefield-6-winter-offensive">What’s New in Battlefield 6 Winter Offensive?</h2>



<p>Starting with all the new content in Battlefield 6 Winter Offensive, players will receive a new time-limited map called Ice Lock Empire State, a winter version of the map with frozen streets and seasonal environmental visuals. Along with the players will get a new themed event game mode, which can be played across Domination, Conquest, and Gauntlet mission variations on Ice Lock Empire State. The event will also come with a time-limited mechanic called freeze. </p>



<p>Moreover, Battlefield 6 Winter Offensive will also add a new melee weapon, the Ice Climbing Axe, which will be available on the latest battle pass. The battle pass for this event is called Winter Offensive Bonus Path, and it features an 11-tier, time-limited reward track featuring event cosmetics, XP Boosters, and the Ice Climbing Axe. Lastly, the new Ice Lock Empire State map will also be supported for Portal Experience during its availability period. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Bungie have taken a step in to unknown for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>: Renegades, their first expansion that’s based on an existing IP, and it’s a pretty big one. You might have had a bad feeling about this, but whether you knew the odds or not, you will be pleasantly surprised to hear that this Destiny 2 <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/star-wars">Star Wars</a> crossover is a gamble that has mostly paid off.</p>
<p><iframe title="Destiny 2: Renegades | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PqicEwg2qEc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The idea with Destiny 2: Renegades is to take elements and themes from Star Wars and feed them into the Destiny universe. You won’t be running into Luke Skywalker, but you will hear music cues and imagery that refers to, rather than directly lifts from, Star Wars. This sounds like a bit of a mess until you step back and think just how much of Destiny, and indeed many other sci-fi shows, have been influenced by the George Lucas tale. The most obvious comparison is Spider,&nbsp; the gruff underworld criminal with a huge bulbous body sat on a throne, who is clearly inspired by Jabba the Hutt and takes that exact role in Renegades.</p>


<p>Then there’s Drifter, who has always been a wisecracking rebel working with but slightly outside the Vanguard – basically Han Solo – and Destiny as a whole has already explored the Light and Dark sides and given everyone Jedi-like powers. All this means that any additional Star Wars themes can slot in with ease rather than be honkingly obvious.&nbsp; It also helps that Destiny already has three worlds that are shoe-ins for those found in Star Wars. Mars stands in for the desert planet Tatooine, Io is the swampy Dagobah, and the frozen wastes of Europa are perfect for Hoth.</p>


<p>There are two new characters, the rather bland Aunor from the Praxic order – aka Jedis – and Bael, who couldn’t be more Kylo Ren if he tried, I honestly thought Adam Driver had been booked to do the voice work.</p>
<p>Renegades has two intertwined stories, the first of which finds you working for three splinter factions from existing Destiny races who have all set up home in a Cantina on Mars. This is genuinely fun and gives the game plenty of opportunity for some much-needed humour; The Vex have split from the Hive mind and gained individuality, which has manifested in them becoming obsessed with fashion, and capes in particular.</p>

<p>Each of the factions will give you bounty hunts, which take you to one of the three locations, where you have to perform a series of tasks whilst being hammered from all sides by an impressive number of enemies. It is mostly shooting, but that’s what Destiny is particularly good at, and as each location is large and features a good range of tasks, it never feels boring. Bungie have clearly been playing Hellidvers, as prep for each mission by going to your hangar and loading up with Strategems… I mean <em>abilities</em>. These are bonus powers that you can use while out in the field and include air strikes, vehicles, and healing drones, and they are very useful at giving you a few seconds of breathing space when cornered. The core Destiny gameplay remains the same and is as good as ever, and it’s really nice to have new expansive areas to explore.</p>
<p>The campaign lasts around eight hours on normal, longer on Legend difficulty and is bookended with two spectacular missions that are a joy to play and really channel the Star Wars vibe. After that you can start running bounty hunts for the various factions, but it remains to be seen if this going to become repetitive or Bungie are going to continue to mix things up.</p>

<p>I think the decision to allow players to complete the expansion in one sitting, rather than spreading out the missions over eight weeks has been detrimental to the game. When the Heresy expansion was live, Tuesday night was Destiny night. Everyone used to log in, do the mission, uncover some new areas or lord, and because your friends were online at the same time you could then team up for a Nightfall or a Raid. These days everyone does the campaign with a day or two of release and there’s quickly little need for everyone to check in the following weeks. The social aspect of the game have completely died off for me. Playing it all in one go also rushes the story beats, characters motives flip in moments, there’s no time to for things to settle and for the player to consider the most recent developments.</p>
<p>There are some new Star Wars inspired weapons, a set based on Han Solo’s blaster and Praxis blades – the Destiny take on Lightsabers. The blades are a lot of fun and you can perform all the classic Jedi moves with them, accompanied the by unmistakable vwooom sound effects. You can also dress up as Boba Fett, but that will cost you extra money.</p>

<p>Aside from the Star Wars campaign, the other plot continues the story of The Nine that began in The Edge of Fate, an expansion I did not play. Even though I had just missed one DLC, I had absolutely no idea what was going on. There’s talk of numbers and innies and outies and it all went over my head – they could have been chatting about Severance or belly buttons for all I know. There is a catch up movie at the start of the expansion, but it doesn’t explain half of what you would need to actually catch up and follow the plot.</p>
<p>Complaining that the story in a game over ten years old is incomprehensible does seem imprudent and with any other Destiny DLC I would agree, but The Edge of Fate was intended to kick off a new story arc, which should have been a bit of a reset, and Renegades has clearly marketed at Star Wars fans who may have not played Destiny before. If they had opened the game with a classic Star Wars text crawl explaining previous events that would have been perfect, but this is going to be as impenetrable to newcomers as usual for Destiny.</p>
<p>Taking of The Edge of Fate, while I didn’t play this at its launch, buying Renegades seems to have handed me access to The Edge of Fate as well.&nbsp;Whether intentional or a bug, I gave it a go. This has actually been my first time back in Destiny 2 since it was revamped and restructured around the Portal – the&nbsp;new way of delivering content used to grind for power and weapons.</p>
<p>I hate it. I absolutely hate it.</p>
<p>Destiny is a shooter RPG, and what used to happen is that to get to mission you got in your ship, flew to planet, pottered about on the surface and met some random Guardians. Maybe you’d join in a local event, find a secret area, and only then would you continue on to your mission marker to get to what you wanted to do. That has all gone, there’s no world building, there’s no random encounters, it’s just a list of tasks picked from a screen and it feels like work. It’s like someone has made a Kanban board of Destiny 2 stuff and then assigned it to you. I want to play video games to forget about my day job, not be reminded by it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Golden Empire from across the sea has always had envoys and diplomats in the Jwar Isles, but now the Empire has arrived in force, and the synchronized steps of their stone warriors herald their arrival. In this article, we take a look at the new Bai Qian themed warband box and the new Imperial Court faction for <em>Bushido</em>.</p><p>We've been covering <em>Bushido&nbsp;</em>for years, so if you'd like to learn more about the game, check out <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/bushido-risen-sun-guide" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">our guide to <em>Bushido Risen Sun</em></a>, our <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-two-player-starter-set-review" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">review of the <em>Bushido Risen Sun</em>&nbsp;2-player starter set</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/start-collecting-bushido-risen-sun-part-1-introduction-and-developer-interview" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">our "Start Collecting" guide to <em>Bushido</em></a>, which includes an interview with the game's developer.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Thematically Themed</h2><p>When selecting a warband in <em>Bushido</em>, you must first choose a faction from the now 14 available to select your fighters from. Each faction also has access to theme cards, which offer special abilities but restrict the units that can be included in the warband. The Imperial Court is a new faction for <em>Bushido</em>, and The Eternal Legion is a theme card that restricts you to Imperial and Ronin Imperial, and must include 1 Warden model for 1 or 2 Fangshi models, and 2 Wardens for 3 or more Fangshi models (we discuss why below), but gives them some incredible benefits that play into their theme.</p><p>Using the theme, Bai Qian, the stone warriors, gain Fear (5) and don't suffer the -1 in melee for taking the run action. Fangshi models who power the Bai Qian can focus to gain additional Ki for 1 activation counter rather than 2. In the first turn of the game, because of the Darkness special rule, models may only draw line of sight up to 4 inches (unless they're bakemono, soulless, or have sixth sense).</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<p>There have been a few Imperial Ronin models and the Ronin Imperial March theme in <em>Bushido</em> for a while, but this is the first time they've had their own dedicated faction.</p><p>The Eternal Legion is an exciting theme, with the bulk of the force made up of Bai Qian stone warriors (based on the Terracotta Army), and the Fangshi handlers who have the power to animate them. Watching over them all are the Wardens, who are empowered to stop the Fangshi from falling into enemy hands and revealing their secrets, usually through permanent means.</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<h2>Stoic Resilience</h2><p>The Bai Qian themed warband box, under the Eternal Legion theme, contains 9 models. These are:</p><ul><li>Chen Lu - The box's&nbsp;Warden, in charge of protecting the Fangshi. Lu is a great fighter and can switch the target to herself with her Intercept ki feat, preventing&nbsp;the enemy from charging her wards. She has to be within 3 inches of a friendly Fanghsi to generate ki. If she's within 6 inches of a friendly Fangshi model, who is in base-to-base contact with an enemy model during the end phase, she removes the Fangshi model, and you gain a scenario point, as she stops them from falling into enemy hands.</li><li>Zuo Ci - Ci is 1 of the 2 Fangshi models in the warband. Ci can&nbsp;channel ki into the Bai Qian, and is also quite adept at smashing enemies with his ruined earth sword, which is +3 damage and adds 3 to the final attack score when allocating dice to attack. Ci can also, once per game, return a removed Shibing or Rui Jin to the battlefield.&nbsp;If Ci channels into a Bai Qian, they allow that model to also use the ki feats on their own card.</li><li>Zi Xu - Xu is the second Fangshi in the warband, and where Ci smashes opponents, Xu instead&nbsp;has a +3 damage weapon, but with Dodge 3, which allows them to make their opponent reroll up to 3&nbsp;attack dice. Their Mirage ki feat also lets them move after being targeted by an attack, wasting your opponent's action. As with Ci, if Xu&nbsp;channels into a Bai Qian, they allow that model to also use the ki feats on their own card.</li><li>Bai Qian - both types of Bai Qian below have similar rules. They gain&nbsp;one activation each round and turn into a destructible terrain element when exhausted (destructible elements can't be attacked directly, but can be removed by a model in base-to-base contact and not in an enemy zone of control, by taking a wait action). All 3 models on each profile can also operate as a group, all moving or attacking in the same activation.<ul><li>3x Shibing - The Shibing are melee-based, and all armed with +2&nbsp;damage yari's with reach. Their group activation means that if you can get them into combat, they can easily overwhelm an enemy.</li><li>3x Rui Jin - The Rui Jin are the long-distance version of the Bai Qian, armed with a range 12, +1 damage repeating crossbow. Their group activation means they can level 3 shots on a single target, or spread their fire.</li></ul></li></ul><p>The Eternal Legion theme requires a lot of strategy to use. The positioning of your forces is key. Chen Lu only generates ki if she's nearby Fangshi models, but if a Fangshi model ends a turn in base-to-base contact with an enemy, Lu will remove the from play.</p><p>The Fangshi also need to be close to the Bai Qian. The Bai Qian don't generate ki themselves, and after taking their activation, are in a dangerous position that a wait action could remove them. They do have an instant ki feat that you can use as the active player at a 1 ki cost to give them an activation counter and stop them from being terrain. They can use that ki to generate an activation on their turn, but you have to manage it to make sure they have enough to protect them from being taken out by a wait action.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Like your Bai Qain thicc? Then upgrade to the&nbsp;Bu Dong.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Expanding The Empire</h2><p>While several Imperial Court Ronin models have been available for a while, the best addition to the Eternal Legion theme is currently the Bu Dong. These Bai Quin come in a pair, rather than a trio, have a lot more wounds, and come armed with a +2 strength Polearm with Pierce to help get through enemy armor.</p><p>They operate the same as the other Bai Qian, but have the option to gain the group trait during the starting phase. So if you want to smash into an opponent, you can choose to give them group, but if you want the additional separate activation, which is helpful sometimes to make sure you still get active player turns to stop your opponent taking out your Bai Qian terrain with a wait action, you can choose to activate them separately.</p><p>Their combined points are the same as the other 2 groups of Bai Qian, so they're a clean swap into a 100-rice warband out of the Bai Qian themed warband.</p><h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On The Bai Qian Themed Warband?</h2><p>The Bai Qian themed warband continues the recent trend of incredible design from GCT Studios. The recent wave of faction starter sets and themed warbands has been inspired, and this is no different. Perfectly capturing thematically and mechanically the nature of how you'd imagine a group of stone statue warriors go to war, this set offers a great challenge (for you and your opponent) and adds an entirely new element to an already great wargame filled with interesting factions and warband themes.</p><hr><p>The copy of&nbsp;<strong>Bushido Bai Qian</strong>&nbsp;<em>used to produce this review was provided by GCT Studios.</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <p>He's back. Tim Cain, co-creator of the original Interplay <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout">Fallouts</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines">Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines</a> programmer has emerged from semi-retirement, returning to Obsidian to work on a game he can't talk about yet because legal documents. For the past few years, the veteran developer's been contracting on a number of games, including Obsidian's own <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, having previously co-directed the first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds">Outer Worlds</a>.</p>

</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCVWRZqyroA" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>

<p>"I’m back at Obsidian," Cain announced in the latest video posted to his YouTube channel where he talks about many things. "I’m there as a full-time employee and in-person, so not remote. I’m not a contractor anymore. So, this means that I’m not working at other places, although there’s at least one game that I worked on [in that capacity for another studio] that I know is going to ship."</p>
<p>Sensing the speculation swarm buzzing at his door, Cain swiftly said: "I can’t talk about the project that I’m working on at Obsidian, just because that’s covered by NDA. Don’t bother guessing, you’re not going to guess right. I would say that I’m probably a lot less retired now." Damn you, No Don't Ask paperwork.</p>
<p>Despite having a new gig, the veteran developer doesn't currently have any plans to stop posting to his YouTube channel, which he started to discuss stories from his career after being told a written memoir he penned was a bit boring.</p><p>"No one in Obsidian has even remotely suggested that I have to stop it," Cain explained. "In fact, many of my co-workers have said that they watch this channel. And I know they did because they started telling me which videos were their favorite or what stories I said that they thought were funny. So, people are saying that they like it. I'm going to keep doing it as long as I have stories to tell. As long as you have questions that are really good and that I think need a video to answer and that I can answer."</p>
<p>Good news, especially given a section of this particular video includes a clip of Cain feeding a squirrel a walnut, which he says is basically a tax he now has to pay whenever he leaves the place he's recently moved into.</p>
<p>Now, we just have to wait and see what this mystery game the studio who put out both The Outer Worlds 2 and its quirky mushroom sibling <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a> this year have brought the original Falloutman back for.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dysons-no-profit-play-on-its-heater-and-fan-combo-is-still-active-to-offload-stock-even-after-black-friday-2000650900</link>
            <guid>1374574</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I love winter, but I am definitely the complaining type. Anything below 15 degrees is a bit too cold for me, and the same is the case during summer; above 30°C is basically the boiling point. If you can relate and are looking for a year-round solution that offers both focused and diffused modes, the Dyson Hot plus Cool AM09 Jet Focus heater and fan is an excellent option to consider, especially at its current price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4614/">Right now, you can pick it up for just $350 at Amazon, after the retailer took a whopping $150 off its usual price</a>. It’s a post Black Friday deal that made it through the main event, but it won’t be around forever. It won’t be long before the price shoots back up, so it’s best to get your orders in quickly.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4614/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Uninterrupted Airflow</h2>
<p>It’s Dyson, so as you’d expect, the overall design is quite minimal. The solid base makes it easy to place it just about anywhere, from the middle of the lounge to a corner of your room. Year-round comfort is made possible with its dual capabilities; cools you in summer and warms you up when things start to get chilly.</p>
<p>The fan uses an Air Multiplier technology that amplifies the surrounding air to give you a smooth, uninterrupted airflow. There are two operating modes to choose from. The Focused mode delivers fast, personal heating or cooling, while the Diffused mode gently adjusts the temperature of your entire room. Speaking of temperature, you can adjust it anywhere from 32 to 98.6°F. For instance, in winters, if you’ve just come home after spending time with friends on a chilly evening, go for the focused mode to relax your body a bit, and then switch to the Diffused mode to warm the entire room up. The ceramic plates heat up fast, so you won’t have to wait too long for the thing to work, either. When using the diffused mode, the fan oscillates at a 70° angle to direct airflow around the room evenly.</p>



<p>It also works fairly quietly, which is great if you want to take a nap with it running. What’s more, you can create sleep timers to program the fan to turn off after pre-set intervals. These can range anywhere from 15 minutes to 9 hours​. The included remote makes it easy to do this and more. You can adjust the temperature, switch modes, create schedules, etc. It’s also magnetized, so you can store it neatly on the fan itself and never lose track of it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4614/">This deal brings the price of this smart, multifunctional fan to just $350, saving you $150 on your purchase.</a> It can be used in both summer and winter, doesn’t make an annoying sound while working, and even lets you set timers for added convenience. The Silver finish gives off a premium look, so it can blend into any setup with ease. And since the fan isn’t cordless, you don’t have to worry about running out of power when you need it the most. Just plug it into an outlet, and enjoy an uninterrupted stream of airflow for hours. Again, the retailer has listed it as a limited-time discount, so we don’t expect it to last long. In fact, it might not even make it through the weekend. If you’ve been after a unit that works as both a heater and a fan, now is the time to make the move.</p>

<p>Grand Theft Auto 5 dropped twelve years ago, and it’s still one of the best-selling games around. That’s because of GTA Online, the multiplayer component to GTA 5 that has proven to be a live-service cash cow for more than a decade. It’s what keeps the beating heart of GTA still pumping today.</p>



<p>Recently, it was revealed by Rockstar Games that Michael de Santa, played by Ned Luke, is <strong>finally coming back </strong>to GTA via a new update – GTA Online: A Safehouse in the Hills. The timeline has moved forward, though, and he has noticeably aged.</p>



<h2 id="h-michael-is-back-in-gta-online">Michael is Back in GTA Online</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, Rockstar Games revealed that Michael de Santa is headed back to GTA Online in the next major update, which gives players the opportunity to purchase a staggering mansion in the hills of Los Santos:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Prime luxury real estate for those who've reached the highest rungs of the criminal ladder arrives on Dec 10 in GTA Online: A Safehouse in the Hills.</p><p>The monumental update also features a new action-packed adventure, new vehicles to collect and much more: <a href="https://t.co/xGottYirhm">https://t.co/xGottYirhm</a> <a href="https://t.co/cCsNpe25AW">pic.twitter.com/cCsNpe25AW</a></p></div>— Rockstar Games (@RockstarGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/1996956990141075837?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 5, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>While other expansions have been backed by other characters, such as Lemar, Lester, or Martin Madrazo, this is the first time that a Michael de Santa has fronted an update. When GTA Online came out, characters like Trevor Philips (Steven Ogg) had smaller roles, and Franklin (with Chop) resurfaced a while ago, but Ned Luke is back in the booth for Michael de Santa for the first time in almost 15 years.</p>



<p>Ned Luke responded to the post with an excited sentiment:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Fans of Grand Theft Auto were constantly shocked by Rockstar Games’ apparent reluctance to expand GTA 5 with any kind of expansions, even though we know they were in the works, but later cancelled. This is how we get to revisit those characters after all these years, it seems.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Escape from Tarkov Player Makes Shocking Realization About Game’s Ending]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-ending-shocking-realizatio/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov now has an <strong>ending</strong>. You read that right; there’s now a way to finally escape from Tarkov and deliver on everything promised in the game over the last ten years of development. This is a new element in the game as of November 15, and with the arrival of 1.0, there’s a new campaign that players can ultimately complete to get the hell out of dodge.</p>



<p>It was only earlier this week that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/someone-finally-escaped-from-tarkov/">first person in the world</a> managed to complete Escape from Tarkov, and since then, others have popped up. In a shocking social realization, some players have found out that Battlestate Games has played a sick and twisted game that has, until now, been kept a complete secret.</p>



<h2 id="h-don-t-go-with-a-full-team">Don’t Go With a Full Team</h2>



<p>On social media, Axel, a popular Escape from Tarkov creator, posted an image showing what happens when you push through Escape from Tarkov’s final mission with <strong>a full squad</strong>. After you’ve all valiantly fought your way through Terminal, you’re presented with a drastic, horrifying message:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Zubr boat cannot take everyone. The evacuation will begin only when there are 3 people left on the pier.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This means that, if you have four or five players, <strong>someone has to die</strong>. Given that this is Escape from Tarkov, it costs absolutely nothing to turn around and drop the man standing next to you, but who decides who lives and who succumbs right at the very end of the game?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s truly representative of how sadistic Battlestate Games can be with this spearhead extraction shooter title that has often been dubbed the most challenging game ever made.</p>



<p>Fans of Escape from Tarkov commented on Axel’s post, and many of them immediately understood the drill. It’s a kill-or-be-killed world out there, and if you want to get that ultimate achievement for escaping from Tarkov, you’ll need to eliminate one of your buddies, potentially fracturing a friendship.</p>



<p>Have you managed to get to the end of Escape from Tarkov yet? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> what ending you managed to get.</p>

            <guid>1374565</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA fans finally have their first look at Grand Theft Auto 5 character Michael in the Grand Theft Auto universe since the game launched back in 2013.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We can see Michael in the trailer for GTA Online DLC A Safehouse in the Hills, below. In the teaser for the upcoming expansion, which adds a luxurious new home for the most successful of online criminals to the online mode, a noticeably older, greying, Michael De Santa and his wife Amanda can be seen greeting a player at the front door of their fancy new Hollywood Hills crib. This is the first time that Michael, played by Ned Luke, has been seen in the Grand Theft Auto universe since GTA 5 launched back in 2013.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The update also settles any lingering questions around the canon ending for GTA 5, confirming once and for all that Option C, otherwise known as “Deathwish”, is how the story <em>should </em>end. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It now means that all three playable protagonists, with Franklin and Trevor being the other two, have appeared in GTA Online. Naturally, this means the “Deathwish” ending is now canon in Online’s version of Los Santos, as this is the only way that all three characters remain alive at the end of GTA 5’s final mission “The Third Way” — one of three possible last levels available depending on the player’s choice. For reference, “Something Sensible” is Option A, which leaves both Franklin and Michael alive, but kills Trevor, and “The Time’s Come” is Option B, resulting in Franklin and Trevor’s survival, but Michael’s death.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In all three possible endings, Franklin lives to walk the streets of Los Santos, so it always felt natural that he’d be a part of GTA Online, which takes place after the events of Grand Theft Auto 5. Trevor has also been present since 2013, giving the online protagonist missions and calling to berate them over the phone in his own peculiar manner, but this is the first time we’ve seen Michael’s face since.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eagle-eared online players would’ve heard a small reference to the professional bank robber back in 2021, though, which, although it definitely alludes to Michael, didn’t 100% confirm he was still around. This occurs when Franklin is chasing two golfers through the Richards Majestic Studios film lot in the centre of the city. This is one of the places Michael works in order to achieve his Hollywood movie-producing dreams in the main game’s campaign. Franklin remarks, “I know one of the producers around here. I hope his ass ain’t work today…”, suggesting De Santa is still employed there after all this time.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Celebrity in GTA 5 and GTA Online</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It is curious that Rockstar has chosen to put Michael back into the world of GTA so many years after we saw him last, and it does beg the question of how long this was planned for, seeing as this update has dropped so close to GTA 6’s previous release date of November 19, 2025. Is this the Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption developer saying their final goodbye to these characters before gearing up to unleash Lucia and Jason into the world in 2026?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">How do you feel about the “Deathwish” ending being chosen by Rockstar as the canonical one for GTA 5? Let us know in the comments below.

And while who wins Game of the Year will steal some of the headlines on December 11, a lot of the excitement also comes from the secrets and surprises that get unleashed in the form of new game announcements. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So we’re keeping tabs on what has been confirmed to make an appearance so far, what has been teased, and some of the pie-in-the-sky dream games we know deep down in our brains won’t be there, but our heart tells us there <em>might</em> just be a chance. Don’t worry, we’re not going to be quite as far-fetched as to say <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi"><u>GTA 6</u></a> will be at The Game Awards, nor <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-iv"><u>The Witcher 4</u></a>, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekt-says-the-witcher-4-wont-be-at-the-game-awards-this-year-but-we-do-know-one-game-that-will-be"><u>CD Projekt Red has already confirmed won’t be</u></a>.

Inspiring. Thickness. No, not words often used to describe me, but the ones that accompanied Geoff Keighley’s social media post of a mysterious demon-covered monolith that appeared in the Mojave Desert last week. Theories have been flying out as to what it could be teasing, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/geoff-keighleys-mysterious-the-game-awards-statue-reportedly-isnt-teasing-the-elder-scrolls-6-diablo-or-god-of-war-so-what-is-it-teasing"><u>much of that speculation has been debunked</u></a>, with Diablo, God of War, and The Elder Scrolls 6 all supposedly not what it relates to. What do you think it is?</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">regal.inspiring.thickness <a href="https://t.co/lY1duUcE1B" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/lY1duUcE1B</a></p>— Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1994609007672381595?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 29, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">We do know that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem"><u>Resident Evil Requiem</u></a> will be showing up on the 11th with a new look at the long-running horror series’ latest entry. Arriving early next year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-producer-teases-characters-involved-in-the-raccoon-city-incident-are-in-the-game"><u>rumours have been circulating </u></a>ever since its original reveal that Resident Evil 4 hunk, Leon Kennedy, will make an appearance in Requiem. Is now the time for Capcom to confirm his inclusion?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A new playable character will be revealed for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/invincible-vs"><u>Invincible VS</u></a>, though. The fighting game adaptation of the cult-favourite comic and animated TV show has garnered a lot of attention since its summer reveal, so who do you think this character will be? We’ll also get a good look at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/exodus-archetype-entertainment"><u>Exodus</u></a>, the upcoming sci-fi action RPG from Archetype Studios, formed by former BioWare developers. With that sort of Mass Effect pedigree behind it, it's certainly one we’re looking forward to seeing a lot more of. We also know that a new Total War game will be revealed by developer Creative Assembly, following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/everything-announced-at-creative-assemblys-total-war-25th-anniversary-showcase"><u>the series' 25th anniversary</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, we know that one of the musical performances on Thursday night will be from Evanescence, who will be showcasing their song “Afterlife” from the Netflix adaptation of Devil May Cry. Would I prefer they did “Bring Me to Life” with Nathan Fielder dressed as an airline pilot on backing vocals? Yes, of course, but we can’t have everything in this world.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>What Might Be There</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33"><u>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</u></a> broke the record for the most nominations of The Game Awards, and looks set to be one of the big winners of the night. Could we see a release date announcement for the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-getting-a-free-update-featuring-new-dungeon-enemies-bosses-and-costumes"><u>upcoming free update that will add a new dungeon</u></a>, among other treats? Who knows, maybe even a cheeky little shadow drop…</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another announcement we could see from one of the big nominees of the night is a wider console release for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hades-ii"><u>Hades 2</u></a>. Currently only on PC and Switch, could one of 2025’s best games come to PS5 and Xbox?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/fallout-the-series"><u>Fallout Season 2</u></a> arrives on Amazon Prime Video on December 17, and given Geoff’s penchant for having stars of the big and small screen on stage at The Game Awards, we wouldn’t be shocked to see some combination of Ella Purnell and Walton Goggins arrive to give us a sneak peek of what’s to come. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of stars of the big screen, things don’t come much more cinematic than James Bond. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/007-first-light"><u>007 First Light</u></a> is the upcoming action-adventure from Hitman studio IO Interactive, and it's shaping up very nicely, as you can read <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/007-first-light-is-the-hitman-and-uncharted-hybrid-i-wanted-it-to-be"><u>in my big preview</u></a>. With it coming out in March 2026, surely we’re due for another hit on the Bond pipe soon. Could a big reveal, such as who the villain will be, or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-previous-james-bond-movie-snub-fans-think-lana-del-rey-has-recorded-the-theme-song-for-007-first-light"><u>who is performing the game’s theme</u></a>, be at The Game Awards? The stage certainly seems set for the latter to come with a live performance at the show.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra"><u>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</u></a>, which is being helmed by Uncharted’s Amy Hennig, moved out of early 2026. The delay may mean that we’ll be waiting a little longer to play Captain America and Black Panther’s WW2 adventure, but is now the time for a full gameplay reveal?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Marvel, Insomniac’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvels-wolverine"><u>Marvel’s Wolverine</u></a> is due late 2026, and while we’ve had some teases of what it will look like in action, we’d certainly love to see more. As for other PlayStation exclusives, Housemarque’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/saros"><u>Saros</u></a> looks set to follow in the sci-fi shooter footsteps of breakout hit Returnal when it arrives in March. Again, we’d love to see more. And one PlayStation Studios game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet"><u>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</u></a>, may well be a while off yet — if you think you’re playing this in 2026, keep dreaming — but seeing as it got its big reveal at last year’s Game Awards, it wouldn’t be a stretch to see a bigger look at Naughty Dog’s next project very soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the Xbox side of things, could we finally get a good look at some <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fable"><u>Fable</u></a> gameplay? Or maybe see <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/gears-of-war-e-day"><u>Gears of War: E-Day</u></a> in action? There’s also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/forza-horizon-6"><u>Forza Horizon 6</u></a> on the way next year, of which we’ve seen nothing but the smallest of teasers. We know it's set in Japan, so we would love to see just how beautiful Playground Games’ depiction of Tokyo is. Plus, let’s face it, driving games can never resist pulling out all of the stops and placing their cover car centre of stage at events like this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also wouldn’t be a Geoff Keighley show with a sprinkling of Hideo Kojima into the mix. The Metal Gear Solid creator is up for a few awards thanks to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach"><u>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</u></a>, but might we also get a look at what is coming up next from him? Xbox horror exclusive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/od-a-hideo-kojima-game"><u>OD: Knock</u></a> continues to be teased as it conjures up unsettling memories of P.T, so we could see more of that. There’s also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/physint-hideo-kojima-action-espionage-project"><u>Physint</u></a>, his PlayStation espionage action exclusive. That may well be far away at this point, but not beyond the realms of possibility for Kojima to tease further.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another legendary developer, Ken Levine, continues to work away on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/judas"><u>Judas</u></a>. It’s been over 12 years since he last released a game, 2013’s Bioshock Infinite, so who really knows if now is the time to finally give us a launch date for this one. I’m very excited about it, but I won’t let myself get carried away until I have any idea when I’ll actually be able to play it. Something I have already been able to play a little of is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/phantom-blade-zero"><u>Phantom Blade Zero</u></a>, a quite punishing sword action game from Chinese developer S-Game. It was originally meant to arrive in 2025, but could a release date finally be unveiled on the 11th?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And, finally for now. FromSoftware’s Switch 2 exclusive, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-duskbloods"><u>The Duskbloods</u></a>, has been very quiet ever since its initial reveal back in April's Nintendo Direct. Due for 2026 – and seeing Keighley has had several previous Hidetaka Miyazaki-related reveals at The Game Awards in the past – maybe now is the time for an in-depth look at exactly what this co-op action RPG is.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>What We Can Dream Will Be There</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, at least we don’t have to close our eyes and cross our fingers in hope of a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong"><u>Hollow Knight: Silksong</u></a> release date anymore. But will Team Cherry tease DLC for one of 2025’s best games? Even I won’t go as far as to genuinely suggest that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another one of this year’s best games is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-bananza"><u>Donkey Kong Bananza</u></a>, which served as Nintendo’s big launch window 3D platformer. That may have come as a surprise to some who thought Mario would have that position nailed down. Could we see a new 3D Mario game announced at The Game Awards? It’s admittedly a long shot, but with the new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie"><u>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</u></a> on the way next Spring, it sure would be nice to have a new game to play alongside it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What might be more likely is a look at what Cory Barlog has been cooking up at Sony Santa Monica. A new game from the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/god-of-war"><u>God of War</u></a> director outside of that universe has been rumoured for a long time now, and it feels like we may be getting closer to seeing what it is. The Game Awards has a pattern of bringing back past winners of the Game of the Year award to tease their next projects. So this gives us a little hope here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following on from that train of thought, two recent recipients of the big prize have been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring"><u>Elden Ring</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii"><u>Baldur’s Gate 3</u></a>. The former’s creator, FromSoftware, may well bring The Duskbloods with them, as mentioned earlier, but what about a new single-player action RPG in the mould of what has made them so well-renowned? Bloodborne 2, anyone? I almost feel bad for mentioning it. As for Baldur’s Gate 3, developer Larian is surely now working on its next game, although seeing as BG3 did take many, many years to make, we won’t be expecting to play this one soon. Could we see a tease of what’s to come, though? Do you think it would be Baldur’s Gate 4 or something altogether different?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Baldur’s Gate’s original developer, BioWare, has its sights set on the stars, as the EA studio returns to the beloved sci-fi RPG series, Mass Effect. Could we be given a glimpse into where the story may be heading next? Or dare we even dream of some <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mass-effect-next-chapter"><u>Mass Effect 5</u></a> gameplay? That may be a little too far, but I do like to dream.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And speaking of dreaming, I can’t not mention <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/half-life-3"><u>Half-Life 3</u></a>. Rumours have been circulating over recent weeks that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-is-everyone-posting-about-a-half-life-3-announcement-soon"><u>the long, long-awaited FPS sequel might actually be in development</u></a>, with an announcement imminent. Could it actually be at The Game Awards? Geoff Keighley does have a long history with Valve, but these days it operates more like Rockstar does, with outside help rarely called on for its big marketing beats.
