            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-16-march<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has announced the&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 1.6 release date, with the latest update for the stylish hack-and-slash action RPG set to launch next month.</p>

<p>Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-1-5-release-date" rel="nofollow">January's Version 1.5</a>,&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 1.6, which bears the characteristically HoYoverse alternate title of "Among the Forgotten Ruins", will launch across all platforms on March 12th.</p>

<p>It'll bring with it a new chapter of the main story in which you must go up against the mysterious phantom thief syndicate known as Mockingbird, attempting to secure an artifact replete with secrets. Sounds like classic&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>stuff to me.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-version-1.6-soldier-0-anby.jpg?itok=yw5J5rMM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-version-1.6-soldier-0-anby.jpg?itok=oj4oOjs9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 1.6 brings new Agents and more in March.</figcaption></figure><p>As is usually the case with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-54-release-date" rel="nofollow">updates</a> for HoYoverse's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-31-release-date" rel="nofollow">games</a>,&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 1.6 will also bring three new Agents with it. The first, Soldier 0 - Anby, is an S-rank Electric Attack Agent who can amplify crit damage for her allies.</p>

<p>Another S-rank Agent, Trigger, will also be joining the fray in this update. Like Soldier 0 - Anby, Trigger's element is Electric, but she's a Stun Agent who can easily dodge attacks using her Sniper Mode and boost damage from her teammates.</p>

<p>Lastly, Pulchra will be available as an A-rank Physical Stun Agent in Version 1.6, and reruns will be available for Fire Anomaly Agent Burnice and Ether Attack Agent Zhuyuan throughout the update's life cycle.</p>

<p>As well as all of the above, you'll also get the chance to fight a new boss, Geppetto, in Hollow Zero, and there are plenty of other new challenges to try out as well.&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 1.6 is a characteristically dense HoYoverse update, so make sure to add March 12th to your calendar if you're a fan.</p>




<p><em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>is the latest game to be released by&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>studio HoYoverse (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-developer-mihoyo-rebrands-as-hoyoverse" rel="nofollow">formerly known as miHoYo</a>).</p>

<p>Like its predecessors,&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>is an action RPG, but its emphasis is far more on stylish hack-and-slash combat rather than the elemental experimentation of&nbsp;<em>Genshin&nbsp;</em>or the turn-based strategizing of&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail</em>.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>right now for free on <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/621339/amd-radeon-9070-xt-price-release-date-gpu<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>AMD’s answer to Nvidia’s RTX 50-series GPUs is arriving next week — and its new graphics cards are aggressively priced against Nvidia’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gpu-reviews/615075/nvidia-rtx-5070-ti-review-test-benchmark">$749 GeForce RTX 5070 Ti</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/612650/nvidia-delays-rtx-5070-after-amd-9070">$549 RTX 5070</a>. The AMD Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT ship on March 6th for $549 and $599, respectively, one day after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/612650/nvidia-delays-rtx-5070-after-amd-9070">the RTX 5070 arrives</a>.</p><p>AMD says they both offer “4K gaming at a 1440p price,” though it’s making some unusual comparisons to do so — according to AMD, the 9070 XT is 51 percent faster on average than a four-year-old <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163537/amd-radeon-rx-6900-xt-review-roundup">RX 6900 XT</a> at 4K and max settings and 26 percent faster than a four-year-old RTX 3090 at the same settings, cards that filled a pricey niche two generations ago.</p><p>While leaks had suggested the pricing of AMD’s 9070 could start at $649, <a href="https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1238/amd-unveils-next-generation-amd-rdna-4-architecture-with">AMD surprised everyone today</a> with suggested retail prices at $549 for this card — putting it head-to-head with Nvidia’s $549 RTX 5070. The $599 9700 XT could even challenge Nvidia’s $749 pricing for its RTX 5070 Ti, as long as AMD has managed to deliver performance that can challenge both of these RTX 50-series cards.</p><p>We won’t know the full answer to that until reviews for AMD’s cards appear next week as well as reviews for Nvidia’s RTX 5070. AMD is dropping some performance hints about where its 9070 series cards might fit in, though. AMD says the 9070 XT is 42 percent more potent at 4K Ultra (and 38 percent at 1440p Ultra) than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24083386/amd-radeon-rx-7900-gre-review-benchmarks-price">AMD’s RX 7900 GRE</a>, a card that challenged the RTX 4070 at $549 but vanished after less than a year. And it’s “just barely slightly slower” than a 7900 XTX, AMD’s 2022 flagship, we heard on a call.</p><p>The vanilla RX 9070, meanwhile, is 21 percent faster than the same 7900 GRE at 4K, suggesting it’s not far off the XT in performance: 38 percent faster than the AMD 6800 XT and 26 percent faster than the Nvidia RTX 3080, according to AMD. At 220 watts of board power, AMD’s director of graphics product management, Scott Olschewsky, says the 4nm monolithic chip is “the most efficient GPU we’ve ever built.”</p><p>Each card also offers 16GB of GDDR6 memory, DisplayPort 2.1a and HDMI 2.1b ports, and are PCIe 5.0 cards — not that your motherboard needs a 5.0 new slot or would necessarily benefit from one. They will use standard 8-pin PCIe power connectors.</p><p>While both the 9070 and 9070 XT have far fewer graphics compute units than the 7900 GRE (55, 64, and 80, respectively), they don’t need as many because they’re the first cards to ship with RDNA 4, which AMD says offers twice the rasterization (read: non-ray traced) graphics performance per compute unit as RDNA 2. (RDNA 3 was closer to 1.4x that of RDNA 2.)</p><p>AMD says it’s taken larger steps than that in ray tracing, too, and almost fully doubled its FP16 machine learning performance since RDNA 3, and up to 779 TOPS, though performance will differ from app to app: AMD’s only seeing 12 percent more performance in Adobe Lightroom super resolution over the 7900 GRE, as one example.</p><p>But even if you’re not playing with AI very intentionally, AMD will put that hardware to use in gaming with FSR 4, which comes with a new AI upscaling algorithm for its super resolution tech that’ll exclusively run on these RDNA 4 and newer cards.</p><p>Olschewsky says FSR 4 can increase frame rates “while looking just as good as native rendering” at 4K resolution. AMD used some images from <em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</em> — a title that averages just 53fps at 4K Ultra settings — to show more fine detail in the distant background of an image while averaging at 182fps with FSR 4 and frame generation turned on.</p><p>And while AMD didn’t share expected performance for that game without the fake frames added, it did break out the differences for a handful of other games like <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> and <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank</em>:</p><p>AMD says it’ll have 30 FSR4 games at launch and over 75 by the end of the year — one obvious theme is a <em>lot</em> of PS5 games, making us wonder how closely the PS5 Pro’s “PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution,” an AI upscaler powered by AMD hardware, might be related to it. But AMD also says FSR 3.1 games can be updated to FSR 4 “with a simple toggle.”</p><p>The new cards also have an enhanced media engine with higher image quality for gameplay recording, as the last one “did not meet quality expectations from the gamers trying to record and stream.” AMD says its Fluid Motion Frames (AFMF), its generic fake frame generation you can apply to any game yourself, is being upgraded to AFMF 2.1, with less ghosting and smearing of details.</p><p>As with any graphics card these days, the actual amount you pay will be determined by whether AMD can actually make enough of the things, and if AMD’s board partners don’t jack up the price. Olschewsky had some fighting words for Nvidia there, though: “We believe that our 9070 XT will be going toe-to-toe with what you’ve seen from the 5070 Ti that users may or may not be able to buy,” adding that the 9070 “is going to look very strong against their upcoming 5070.”</p><p>Unlike Nvidia, which warned of shortages with its new cards, he says AMD expects “strong availability at launch.”</p><p>“We are working with all of our partners to go and deliver the most competitive prices on GPUs around the world; our focus is ensuring cards hit target price points around the world. It’s difficult to predict what’s going to happen, but we’ll be working with partners as we see pricing show up.”</p><p>At the end of AMD’s event today the company also teased that its RX 9060 series cards will arrive in the second quarter to “broaden the family even further.” AMD plans to disclose more information about these cards “later,” but it certainly looks like it’s getting ready to challenge Nvidia’s unannounced RTX 5060 cards.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Battlestate Games has released an all-new update in Escape from Tarkov. The core of this update is that it <strong>finally </strong>gets rid of snowy weather and brings back a spring atmosphere. It’s that time of year when the ice underfoot has thawed and the trees are in bloom, which is great news for anyone tired of snowblindness or crunchy footsteps.</p>



<p>The team at BSG has also made several major updates to the game’s AI engine and mechanics, which have been an instant hit with players worldwide.</p>



<p>Read on to learn everything you need to know about this relatively major Escape from Tarkov update.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-springtime-has-arrived">Springtime Has Arrived</h2>



<p>Now that the world is no longer white in Escape from Tarkov, you can hide in bushes and wear dark clothing once again. The removal of snow and the arrival of spring weather is great, even if it means it’ll be raining a little more in your raids.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov fans around the world are rejoicing at some of the newest AI-based changes in the game, though.</p>



<p>For this popular extraction shooter, the AI intelligence, mechanics, and tactics are all sticking points that can often mess with the community to no end. We’ve seen ‘aimbot’ enemies, bizarre health pool changes, dimwitted patrol paths, and audio issues all tied to AI NPCs over the years.</p>



<p>This latest Tarkov patch makes a <strong>phenomenal number </strong>of changes to the game’s AI.</p>



<p>For instance:</p>



<ul>
<li>Enemy detection has been overhauled and is dependent on distance, view angle, weather, stance, and aggravation levels. If you’re prone in fog and not in the enemy’s line of sight, you’ll be detected incredibly slowly compared to if you were running in the open</li>



<li>Vegetation now impacts the enemy’s vision – except Zryachiy, Birdeye, and the BTR because they’re just on another level. If you hide in a bush, <strong>you’re hidden</strong>.</li>



<li>Enemies will now relay information about an enemy <strong>only to those close to them</strong>. If the bot isn’t in a group, it can only shout to a maximum of 50 meters.</li>



<li>Only Raiders, Rogues, and Bosses will use suppressive fire mechanics. If a common AI enemy can’t see you, they won’t shoot you, which means no more wallbang deaths.</li>



<li>When an AI enemy is hit, it’ll suffer a considerable accuracy drop.</li>



<li>If a common AI enemy detects you at long range, they won’t immediately engage, but instead, they’ll deploy a ‘waiting tactic’ until you fire first.</li>
</ul>



<p>The general spawn rates, positions, and pathing systems for AI enemies have all been addressed. This means that one player won’t be able to trigger too many bot spawns, which will come in handy in PvE and getting swarmed by endless streams of Scavs.</p>



<p>Finally, AI enemies won’t move closely together or occupy the same areas of cover, which means less colliding and piling, which should also reduce stress on resources.</p>



<p>The full list of AI changes can be <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/news/id/334?utm_source=x_post&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=winter_drops_24-25&amp;utm_term=link_1&amp;utm_content=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">found on escapefromtarkov.com</a>.</p>



<p>Additionally, Battlestate Games has patched up some of the most irritating issues in Escape from Tarkov with this latest patch:</p>



<ul>
<li>Headshots are no longer deafening</li>



<li>The ‘arm/thorax damage issue’ has been resolved</li>



<li>Bots can no longer pass through closed doors</li>



<li>Error 228 has now been fixed</li>



<li>Transitions in PvE will no longer take you into a PvP game – thanks, BSG</li>
</ul>

    <p><span>More secrets of Sacrifice and the hidden history of New Eridu's military factions.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 1.6 update for <em><a title="Games > Zenless Zone Zero [20 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/zenless-zone-zero">Zenless Zone Zero</a></em>, dubbed “Among the Forgotten Ruins,” will launch on March 12, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [186 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-947453"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>Commissioned by the Mayor of New Eridu, Proxies will vie against several factions including the phantom thief syndicate Mockingbird in an exclusive auction to seize a coveted artifact entwined with the Sacrifice’s secrets. Meanwhile, Anby’s true identity gradually emerges, and Trigger, the teammate of Solider 11, will reveal more about the history of New Eridu’s military factions. With new foes including Geppetto in Hollow Zero and varied in-game events, Proxies can expect an enriched and exciting adventure.</p><p>In this new chapter of the main story, Proxies are determined to secure an artifact related to Sacrifice in an auction that has ignited tensions among different factions. Amidst the intrigue, Hugo and Vivian appear to be deliberately drawing close to the Proxies, blurring the line between ally and adversary. Beyond the main narrative, players will also uncover Anby’s past before her involvement with the Cunning Hares and gain deeper insights into New Eridu’s military force.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_947454"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Anby Demara used to be known as Soldier 0 – Anby, the former leader of the Silver Squad. She is an S-Rank Electric Attack Agent, wielding dual swords to rapidly deal Electric damage. Her attack triggers Aftershock as well as amplifying the CRIT DMG of allies targeting the same enemy. Alongside Soldier 0 – Anby, the new S-Rank character Trigger, an Electric Stun Agent and ace sniper of the Obol Squad, will make her debut. When entering Sniper Mode, Trigger can swiftly evade enemy attacks, striking at the opportune moment while calling in teammates for a Quick Assist. Her attack accumulates Purge, enhancing Aftershock damage and increasing damage dealt by allies on the same target. In addition, our familiar friend Pulchra Fellini is making her return in Version 1.6 as an A-Rank Physical Stun Agent under the banner of the Sons of Calydon. In the meantime, S-Rank Fire Anomaly Agent Burnice and S-Rank Ether Attack Agent Zhuyuan will also make their return in the rerun banners.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>In Version 1.6, players will get to confront the new boss Geppetto in Hollow Zero and unlock the newly introduced Difficulty VI in Battlefront Purge. Furthermore, players can experience the new Hollow Zero gameplay Shadow Operation, featuring unique effects in every battle stage, such as increasing damage based on accumulated coins. In Trigger’s TV Schedule, a new third-person shooter gameplay will be introduced, allowing players to take on sniper missions. Additionally, Proxies can complete challenges as a Bangboo drone in the March On, Tiny Titan! event or aid a Bangboo in completing 10 different trials in the Little Knight’s Big Charge event to obtain exclusive rewards, including the playable agent Pulchra.</p></blockquote><p><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> is available now for for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,963 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> via <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009763" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation Store</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [22,492 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/zenless-zone-zero-c7c151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zenless-zone-zero/id1606356401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.Nap&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a></p><p>Watch the version 1.6 trailer and special program below.

                <p> The Command &amp; Conquer community is in for a treat, as EA has released the source code for four classic C&amp;C games, as well as adding Steam Workshop support and releasing further modding tools for other titles in the franchise.</p><p>In collaboration with community creator Luke "CCHyper" Feenan, EA has released the fully recovered source code for the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/command-and-conquer/" data-ref-id="5000-1">Command &amp; Conquer</a> (aka Tiberian Dawn), <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/command-and-conquer-red-alert/" data-ref-id="5000-686">C&amp;C Red Alert</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/command-and-conquer-renegade/" data-ref-id="5000-2517">C&amp;C Renegade</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/command-and-conquer-generals/" data-ref-id="5000-4287">C&amp;C Generals</a>--along with its expansion pack, Zero Hour. The source code for the games is available on <a href="https://github.com/electronicarts" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">EA's GitHub page</a> under a GPL license, which grants users the right to run, study, share, or modify the software.</p><p>"Over the past year I have been working alongside the amazing C&amp;C stakeholders here at EA to restore the Perforce source code archives for the C&amp;C games back to buildable states, which now provides us with the ability to patch these classic games in a deeper way going forward," CCHyper said of his collaboration with the C&amp;C team at EA. "As a long time modder, it was amazing to finally get a chance to deep dive into the source code for these games and see how they work!"</p><p>With the first Command &amp; Conquer now over 30 years old, CCHyper celebrates the release of its recovered source code as a win for video game preservation, saying the decision will help fan communities to "continue to support these games and keep them playable for future generations to come."</p><p>Alongside the release of the source code, EA is also releasing further tools for modders, as well as Steam Workshop support for multiple C&amp;C titles including: C&amp;C Renegade, C&amp;C Generals &amp; Zero Hour, C&amp;C 3 Tiberium Wars and Kane’s Wrath, C&amp;C Red Alert 3 &amp; Uprising, and C&amp;C 4 Tiberian Twilight. Fans will also be able to publish maps directly to Steam Workshop through the Mission Editor and World Builder tools.</p><p>Modders will also be able to take advantage of a C&amp;C Modding Support Pack, which contains the source Xml, Schema, Script, Shader and Map files for all C&amp;C titles using the SAGE engine.</p><p>As one last gift to C&amp;C historians, EA has released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN2gryZYz6g" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">half an hour of archive footage</a> from the development of Renegade and Generals, including tech demos and concept videos from the classic games. </p>

			<p>Despite what may have looked like, Ciri's model in The Witcher IV hasn't been changed in the recently released behind-the-scenes video, the game's director confirmed.</p>
<p>A few hours ago, Game Director Sebastian Kalemba provided a clarification on <a href="https://x.com/Skalemba" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a>, saying that the behind-the-scenes video released earlier this week, which provided a look at how the game's reveal trailer was created, features the same in-game mode of Ciri seen in the reveal trailer shown during this year's The Game Awards show. What makes the model feel different is the fact that, in the behind-the-scenes video, the model is shown without facial animation, lighting or virtual camera lenses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The behind-the-scenes video features the same in-game model of Ciri as seen in the original trailer. We have not modified it.

<p>Previously known as <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-polaris-development-cdpr-acquired/">Polaris</a>, The Witcher IV was officially unveiled late last year with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-gets-first-trailer-showing-off-cirilla/">cinematic trailer</a> that confirmed, as many speculated, that Ciri will be the main character in the new entry in the series. Featuring the<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-will-be-around-the-same-size-of-wild-hunt-devs-aim-for-quality-over-quantity/"> same size as The Witcher 3</a> in a bid to go for quality over quantity, The Witcher IV will put<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-devs-comment-on-ciri-as-the-new-protagonist-explain-that-player-agency-will-be-at-the-center/"> player agency at the center of the experience</a>, providing players with plenty of meaningful choices to make, including opting to play <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-dev-confirms-gwent-talks-about-ciris-new-powers/">Gwent</a> once more instead of focusing on solving whichever crisis will challenge Ciri during the course of the new adventure.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> CEO Dan Clancy has published an <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2025/02/27/what-s-next-in-2025-an-open-letter-from-twitch-ceo-dan-clancy/">open letter</a> detailing the company's plans for 2025, including new ways of collaborating, mobile improvements, and more monetisation.</p>
<p>After thanking the streaming community for an "amazing" 2024 - "More than ever, in today’s world, we all want and need to find belonging and connection with other people," said Clancy - the CEO listed new tools and opportunities for streamers, as well as new ways of building connection.</p>
<p>Collaboration is a "core part of Twitch", so following the Stream Together feature added last year, the company is working on shared hype trains and shared sub goals to drive revenue collaboratively. In addition, shared chat will be manageable in the mobile app for IRL streamers.</p>

<p>Speaking of mobile, last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitchs-revised-mobile-app-will-arrive-this-summer">Twitch re-launched its mobile app</a> (as announced at TwitchCon Europe), adding a Discovery Feed to find streamers based on recommendations. This year it will continue to revise the app, adding the ability to stream in both landscape and vertical video, and investing in the feed to aid discovery. Clips - short videos of a streamer's best moments - will also be easier to edit.</p>
<p>Perhaps most interestingly, Twitch is opening up monetisation for "most" streamers, such as subscriptions and bits. Usually streamers need to reach Affiliate status before monetisation tools kick in, but this year streamers will be able to start earning immediately. Of course, Twitch takes a cut of all monetisation, so it's as much of a benefit to the company as to streamers themselves.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the company is launching a new tool for streamers to let brands know they want to collaborate (sponsored streams are often more lucrative to streamers than subscriptions), and will also launch more promotional events.</p>
<p>Importantly, Twitch is continuing to focus on safety. This month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-reckons-cheating-while-livestreaming-is-a-low-severity-violation">Twitch updated its enforcement rules</a>; next it's looking to provide more detail on violations, and will expand moderator tools to make it easier to protect streams.</p>
<p>Lastly, Twitch will expand more of its Guilds (such as the Pride Guild) to a global community and include Ambassadors from around the world.</p>
<p>It's been a quieter start for the year for Twitch compared with 2024. It began last year with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-reportedly-set-to-lay-off-around-500-employees-later-this-week">over 500 layoffs</a> as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-isnt-profitable-admits-ceo-in-wake-of-recent-layoffs">Clancy admitted the platform isn't profitable</a>.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-staff-concerned-about-more-layoffs-later-this-year">report later in the year claimed staff were concerned about more layoffs</a> on the way and the future of the platform.</p>
<p>At TwitchCon Europe last year, I spoke with VP of product Jeremy Forrester about the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-future-of-twitch-safety-growth-and-the-importance-of-finding-community">sustainability of the platform</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-%E2%80%93-how-to-upgrade-armor.1121706/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/monster-hunter-wilds-how-to-upgrade-armor/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Crafting new armor is something you will be doing a lot in Monster Hunter Wilds, as it is a central part of its engaging gameplay loop. As you defeat more monsters and obtain new parts from them, you will be able to craft even more new armor pieces, which, with their stats and skills, will help you better define your character build. The game constantly offering you new armor to craft doesn't mean that you should always discard your old gear, as Monster Hunter Wilds, like previous entries in the series, gives you the option of upgrading every piece of gear to enhance its basic Defense stat.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250228113010_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>To upgrade any armor piece in Monster Hunter Wilds, you will first need to make some progress in the game's main story campaign and complete<strong> Chapter 2-2</strong>. Once this is done, all you need to do to upgrade your armor is speak with Gemma at the <strong>Smithy</strong> and select the <strong>Upgrade From Box</strong> option, which will allow you to use Armor Spheres to increase any armor piece Defense value up until it reaches a certain level that varies per gear. The higher the rarity value of the gear you are upgrading, the more points will be needed to upgrade, so it is always a good idea to only focus on armor that you know you will use often, as, while the game is pretty generous when it comes to rewarding you with Armor Spheres, there will come a time with high rarity gear when upgrading any armor piece will become very expensive.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-intel-xess-2-support/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hogwarts-legacy-latest-pc-patch-introduces-intel-xess-2-extended-nvidia-frame-generation-features-support-and-more.1121703/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-intel-xess-2-support/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Hogwarts Legacy patch is now live on PC, introducing new features to the game, including support for <a href="https://wccftech.com/intel-xess2-frame-generation-low-latency-mode-smoother-gaming-first-titles/">Intel XeSS 2.</a></p>
<p>The February 27th patch primarily focuses on improving mod support with plenty of fixes, which include input prompt, text, and interface fixes. The patch also introduces some gameplay fixes for fast travel, Third Time's a Charm not being unlocked, silent restart falling with mods, and basic attacks leaving blank impacts on hit surfaces, among other fixes. The biggest new feature added to the game by the latest patch, however, is the introduction of Intel XeSS 2 support, specifically the frame generation features of Intel's tech that can only be used on Intel GPUs, both Alchemist and Battlemage. Extended NVIDIA Frame Generation features are also mentioned in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/990080/view/506195909797741136?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patch notes</a>, although it is not yet clear what these are since the game already supports Multi Frame Generation on the NVIDIA RTX 5000 series.</p>
<p>Hogwarts Legacy has been a smashing success since its release in 2023, so much so that the game is reportedly getting an <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-directors-cut/">expanded Definitive Edition</a> that will also receive DLC content. Avalanche Software is reportedly also working on <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-reportedly-wont-be-live-service-hogwarts-definitive-edition-will-include-dlc/">a second entry in the series</a> that will not be a live service game, which is definitely good news, considering how Warner Bros' recent<a href="https://wccftech.com/multiversus-to-end-with-season-5-game-to-go-offline/"> live service offerings</a> have <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league/">turned out.</a></p>
<p>Hogwarts Legacy is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. You can learn more about the game by checking out Chris' <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hogwarts-legacy-review/">review.</a></p>

The company said the patch’s early April release date, set to arrive a little over a month after the game itself, "will give hunters enough time to prepare for the new content, and challenges, that await them.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To that end, Title Update 1 adds a new level of challenge: “Prepare your gear, and resolve, hunters!” Capcom said. “TU1 will bring with it a monster of formidable strength at a level above Tempered!” Meanwhile, a new challenging monster will be added with Title Update 1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, Title Update 1 also adds an endgame place to gather. “A new place to meet, communicate, have meals together and more with other hunters will be added to Monster Hunter Wilds in TU1!” Capcom said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This area will be available to hunters who have completed the main story, so get hunting and be ready!”</p><div id="monster-hunter-wilds-weapons-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Monster Hunter Wilds Weapons Tier List</h3><h3>Monster Hunter Wilds Weapons Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Early reaction to the news that Title Update 1 will add a place for endgame players to gather has been mixed, with some welcoming the addition, others wondering why it’s not in the game at launch. It sounds very much like a Gathering Hub from previous Monster Hunter games, but as some have pointed out, it’s interesting that Capcom has chosen not to call it that here. While other players can turn up in your camp, Monster Hunter Wilds lacks a true social hub, so hopefully whatever this is will fill the void.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom released a few images showcasing this new place to gather:</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Monster Hunter Wilds Title Update 1 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Capcom issued a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-mixed-steam-user-review-rating-capcom-issues-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-troubleshooting-guide">Monster Hunter Wilds troubleshooting guide</a> amid ‘mixed’ Steam user reviews.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To help get your Monster Hunter Wilds adventure started, take a look at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Things_Monster_Hunter_Wilds_Doesn%27t_Tell_You_-_Tips">what Monster Hunter Wilds doesn’t tell you</a>, and a guide to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Weapons">all 14 weapon types</a> in the game.

It’s a deal that could involve the trade of titles such as Monster Hunter Now, Pikmin Bloom, and, yes, Pokémon Go, with an announcement reportedly expected to arrive soon. There’s been no word on how significantly a leadership change could impact in-game mechanics and microtransactions... yet.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">With Scopely in the picture, this is what we’re looking at. There goes my desire to play pogo. 😬🤬 <a href="https://t.co/UKYLFV7VKX" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/UKYLFV7VKX</a></p>— AmyWiedy (@Amy_Wiedy) <a href="https://twitter.com/Amy_Wiedy/status/1892380485940085226?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 20, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Scopely oversees a fleet of notable mobile experiences that range from board game offshoots like Scrabble Go and Monopoly Go! to games like Stumble Guys and Marvel Strike Force. The one element scaring Pokémon Go players more than anything else is the microtransaction practices these titles are notorious for. With the real-life-adventure spinoff continuing to play a crucial part in players’ lives nine years after its release, thousands of fans are concerned that things could take a turn for the worse.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“They will still probably release Mewtwo X and Y, except you have to pay $100 just for a chance to get them,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/1ist4yc/comment/mdki28l/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reddit user theorized</u></a>. “If everyone here knew what they did to Marvel Strike Force, we'd all panic. They will absolutely drive this game into the ground.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Looking for an Everstone</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Fear of Scopely ownership stems more from the aggression behind these monetization tactics rather than the tactics themselves, and it’s this same fear that drove Reddit user and long-time Pokémon Go fan Tetrylene to take action. As rumors of Niantic’s interest in a sale gained momentum, he <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1itre34/write_to_the_pok%C3%A9mon_company_if_youre_concerned/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>published a post</u></a> in hopes of organizing a campaign for other Pokémon Go-ers to respectfully let The Pokémon Company know that, regardless of ownership, there are certain changes they won’t stand for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But here’s the thing: we must try and exert some leverage,” Tetrylene’s post says. “By reaching out to (The Pokémon Company) we can express our concerns and emphasize the importance of maintaining some semblance of [the] game’s current ethos. They’ve invested heavily in the Pokémon brand and are likely to be receptive to feedback that could impact its reputation.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That post, now more than one week old, generated 1.4K upvotes with hundreds of comments from like-minded fans. Tetrylene tells us his initiative began with a desire to bring the community’s concerns front and center. There’s no telling if the message will actually reach The Pokémon Company in a meaningful way, but he says the discussion his post has brought to the table was well worth the effort.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This is all very defensive, but part of me hopes that there's a chance that the new owners want to capitalise on the incredible potential of the game rather than bleed it dry.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“In the same vein that loot boxes have all but been turned into a toxic monetisation option for the industry, I hope that our pushback sends a signal that there is absolutely a limit to how much a player base will put up with,” Tetrylene explained. “This is all very defensive, but part of me hopes that there's a chance that the new owners want to capitalise on the incredible potential of the game rather than bleed it dry. The door is wide open to both possibilities; I hope we can try and guide them towards the former rather than the latter.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like any one of the other millions of Pokémon fans, Tetrylene holds a few Pokémon close to his heart — his favorite is a tie between Groudon and Metagross. When he says “Gen 3 for life,” he means it. He tells us Pokémon Go has been his go-to hobby for two-and-a-half years, adding that the mobile game has also served as an excuse to meet up with friends at least once a week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s blossomed into an activity that sees Tetrylene co-leading an active group of nearly 70 players. It’s led to trips to new cities — and new friends. While much of the world moved on from Pokémon Go when the honeymoon phase eventually wore off, a dedicated group of trainers continues to routinely connect with others, show off their Pokémon collection, and battle.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Type Advantage</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">No two players enjoy Pokémon Go in the same way, though. For every casual Pokémon Go fan there is one who has spent thousands of dollars on it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reddit user and a self-proclaimed Pokémon Go big-spender known as a “whale,” NextLevelEvolution, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/1iu3ccv/open_letter_to_scopely_from_a_pokemon_go_whale/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>penned an open letter to Scopely</u></a> amid rumors of Niantic’s potential sale. It stops short of being a call-to-action but does come with the warning that a more aggressive monetization strategy would likely “break trust with the user base” and “alter the game enough that it would no longer be considered a true Pokémon-franchise experience” by fans.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I hope the spirit of this game is not lost to make another quick buck.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“For me, Pokémon is extremely nostalgic. And I believe Pokémon Go is in a pretty good place right now and on a generally upward trajectory for the first time in several years,” NextLevelEvolution told IGN. “At their best, Pokémon games are about adventure and discovery. When Pokémon Go first came out, the idea that I could be a Pokémon trainer in the real world was enough to get me and millions of others hooked. I hope the spirit of this game is not lost to make another quick buck.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">They say they’re aware of other whales who have spent “many thousands of dollars” per year, and “none of them are excited about the possibility of Scopely purchasing Pokémon Go.” For now, NextLevelEvolution isn’t optimistic that a community-driven movement to bar aggressive monetization tactics will gain enough momentum to make a difference, but they’re at least willing to vote with their wallet if worse comes to worst.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’m not particularly hopeful that this will have any effect,” they explained. “But I can tell you that if I have to pay to get rid of ads in the game, then they will lose me as a customer entirely and many other whales I know as well.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Stay Aware of Your Surroundings</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s debate surrounding the current state of Pokémon Go and if existence under the Scopely banner would actually result in a worse experience. Regardless of how the game has been or will be monetized, Niantic has spent nine years molding it into something that is both beloved and messy. Tetrylene has a laundry list of tweaks he’d like to see implemented that includes the ability to skip certain animations, an NPC to trade with, new points of interest, fleshed-out in-game communication options, and more thoughtful placement for raids.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The general consensus is that Pokémon Go needs some upkeep, but its most devoted fans still see the experience as a once-in-a-lifetime hobby that is as exciting as it is fragile. For them, it’s hard to look at how Scopely has monetized other titles and not see it as a threat to a fun pastime and the tool millions use to stay connected.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I’ve got mixed feelings with the news that pokémon go is being sold to scopely for $3.5 billion</p><p>it could revive the game, or we could see ourselves watching 10 second ads after spinning a pokéstop</p><p>I shit on niantic as much as the next guy but lowkey kinda worried <a href="https://t.co/MOgMx3tdpk" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/MOgMx3tdpk</a></p></div>— PoGOCentral (@pogo_central) <a href="https://twitter.com/pogo_central/status/1892050096637780357?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 19, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Tetrylene hopes the momentum continues but has at least been “pleasantly surprised” by how the community has responded to their call to action. He says pulling players together in this way has resulted in some already reaching out to The Pokémon Company to make a difference. Without confirmation that Niantic is actually looking to sell, Pokémon Go remains as something Tetrylene calls “the ultimate social hobby.” What it might look like in the coming years remains a mystery.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There will never be another game like Pokémon Go,” the community organizer told us in one final message to The Pokémon Company. “There is no other game that can truly claim to be social in the way that this one is. There may never be another game — of any genre — that fosters a global community on this scale, even after nearly a decade. There still is no other mobile game that lets you stumble through an unfamiliar place and quickly find new friends for life.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He continued: “The prospect of losing all of this to a cold investment firm that doesn't care for any of that truly saddens me. Does the journey really end here? It doesn’t have to. Pokémon GO still has so much left to give. Let it soar.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has contacted The Pokémon Company and Niantic for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

            <p>
Nintendo Switch Online's retro game collection is losing its first game - in Japan at least. 
</p>
<p>
Today, Nintendo announced via a <a href="https://x.com/nintendo_cs/status/1895280559703892048">post on social media</a> that 1991 SNES football game Super Soccer will be pulled from the Japanese Nintendo Switch Online catalogue in a month's time, on 28th March. No reason was given for the removal. 
</p>
<p>
For now, Nintendo is yet to say whether Super Soccer will also similarly disappear from other versions of the Nintendo Switch Online catalogue elsewhere in the world. Eurogamer has contacted Nintendo for comment. 
</p>
<p>
Is Super Soccer being removed due to a rights issue - as is so often the case with other digital subscription services elsewhere? Will this become more common, as the Nintendo Switch Online catalogue ages? Is this anything to do with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a>?
</p>
<p>
Whatever the reason, it's frustrating to see, yet again, another digital games library meant to preserve access to older games being subject to removals such as this. (It was also not an issue on previous Nintendo consoles, where retro games were sold rather than placed behind a subscription.)
</p>
<p>We'll update if we hear more from Nintendo on why Super Soccer has been removed.</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-online-adds-game-boy-advance-wario-next-week">Nintendo added its first Game Boy Advance title to its subscription service for more than four months</a>. Wario Land 4 arrived on Valentine's Day, and makes up one of the dozens of games available in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-online-games-available-to-play-right-now">the full Nintendo Switch Online catalogue</a>.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/how-to/monster-hunter-wilds-best-gear-to-get-started-for-beginners/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-%E2%80%93-best-gear-to-get-started-for-beginners.1121673/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/monster-hunter-wilds-best-gear-to-get-started-for-beginners/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Monster Hunter series is known for giving players tons of viable options to build their hunter, and Monster Hunter Wilds is no different, as even at the beginning of the adventure in the Forbidden Lands, you have a decent choice of gear coming with skills that are more or less useful, depending on the situation. For a newcomer to the series, however, even the few choices available at the start of the game can feel overwhelming. This, combined with the lack of knowledge regarding the <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/monster-hunter-wilds-best-beginner-weapons-to-learn/">14 weapon types</a> and the general flow of the game, can make the first few hours of the game a little frustrating.</p>
<p>While Monster Hunter Wilds does an excellent job at introducing its core mechanics to the player, you are going to make a lot of mistakes as you hunt your very first monsters. As such, the first thing to look for in gear at the very beginning of the campaign is what it can offer in terms of survivability. In this regard, there's no better early choice than the<strong> Hope Mail</strong> and <strong>Hope Vambraces</strong>, which are both available from the start of the game and come with the <strong>Divine Blessing</strong> skill, which reduces received damage and activates fairly frequently. This will help you survive while you are learning how the game works.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250227115609_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Every other piece of gear available during the early game in Monster Hunter Wilds is generally fine for protection, but not as much for skills, so pick any option that looks good for you until you can craft either the <strong>Bone Helm</strong>, which requires 1 Mystery Bone, or the <strong>Alloy Helm</strong>, which requires 1 Machalite Ore and 1 Iron Ore which can be found rather easily on the Windswept Plain. The Marathon Runner skill of the first, which reduces Stamina depletion for actions that constantly deplete it, like running, and Quick Sheathe of the second, which makes you sheathe your weapon faster and lets you use items more quickly with the exception of the Sword and Shield that doesn't need to be sheathed to use them, are decent skills that can enhance your survivability.</p>
<p>For a good Coil and Greaves, you will need to proceed a bit further into the game until you can craft better gear.&nbsp;<span>The&nbsp;<strong>Balahara Coil and Greaves</strong> come with the Evade Extender skill that increases the distance of your dodge maneuver, which is a big help not only for defensive purposes but also for repositioning yourself when needed.</span> To craft them, you will first have to hunt a Balahara as part of the main campaign and then collect 1 Balahara Certificate, 2 Balahara Scales, 1 Balahara Shell, and 1 Balahara Pearl. for the Coil 2 Balahara Shells and 1 Balahara Skulls for the Greaves.</p>
<p>As Monster Hunter Wilds rewards experimenting with gear, these recommendations may not be the best for everyone and are based on my experience as a former newcomer who got pulled into the series with Monster Hunter Rise, before going back to playing older entries in the series, so you may find some other early game gear combination that could work better. In addition, these recommendations don't take the used weapon type into account. For any weapon that can guard and has an offset attack, like the Great Sword, for example, the <strong>Doshaguma Armor set</strong> is a good choice due to Doshaguma's Might, a set bonus that increases attack when Power Clashing against a monster or successfully deflecting an attack with an Offset attack. The Long Sword, on the other hand, benefits greatly from the <strong>Alloy Helm and Greaves</strong>, which come with Quick Sheate that speeds up all weapon sheating, including Special Sheathe, which you will want to learn to use properly if you want to master this weapon type. You will need 1 Machalite Ore and 1 Iron Ore to craft either of them and with some upgrades, they can potentially carry you throughout all of Low Rank.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Little Nightmares 3 Multiplayer? Co-op Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/is-little-nightmares-3-multiplayer-co-op/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-little-nightmares-3-multiplayer-co-op-explained.1121670/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-little-nightmares-3-multiplayer-co-op/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Co-operative gameplay and teamwork are emphasized in Little Nightmares 3. You have two characters to escort to safety after all. Considering the previous entry neglected any form of two-player integration, it’s natural to wonder if Little Nightmares 3 includes co-op or multiplayer, and we have the answer.</p>



<p>One of the biggest differences between the first Little Nightmares and its successor is the characters. Little Nightmares 1 was a story around a small child called Six. Little Nightmares 2 went one step further and gave Six a co-op pal—Mono. In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-release-platforms-editions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3</a>, both are out, and in come Low and Alone for a new torturous tale.</p>



<p>With Supermassive Games running the ship, things are changing for the threequel. That being said, let’s find out if co-op, multiplayer, or something in between debuts.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-little-nightmares-3-in-online-co-op">Can You Play Little Nightmares 3 in Online Co-op?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Real friend. Credit to Supermassive Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Little Nightmares 3 introduces online co-op for the first time and allows you to unravel the unknown with another human player.</strong></p>



<p>Adding a second main character in Little Nightmares 2 hinted at this possible new direction. Co-op seemed to be an inevitable inclusion if <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/little-nightmares/little-nightmares-iii" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Little Nightmares 3</a> also had a second protagonist to control. This had turned out to be the case, and both Low and Alone can be controlled by two different players.</p>



<p>You need an online connection, and someone else with a copy of the game, but the opportunity for online co-op is there.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-little-nightmares-3-have-local-co-op">Does Little Nightmares 3 Have Local Co-op?</h2>



<p><strong>Little Nightmares 3 does not feature local co-op in any way and it’s one of the more baffling omissions from the horror title.</strong></p>



<p>A 2023 interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/little-nightmares-3-preview-hands-off-gamescom-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamesradar</a> explained the studio’s decision to go against local co-op. Game director Wayne Garland said: “Couch [co-op] is something that we considered, but again, when you come back to the atmosphere and the immersion that we’re trying to elicit through Little Nightmares, I think it was important for us that we stuck to our online co-op only rather than traditional more party aspects.”</p>



<p>There you have it. Supermassive Games wants co-op, but still wants you to feel like you’re on your own. It’s an immersion thing, although I still feel it’s not quite enough justification as I’d love to play it in local co-op. This might just be me though! Who knows, it might get added as a feature well after release. We’ll have to see.</p>

<p>I don’t think I even need to ask if you’re disappointed about a lack of local co-op. With so many titles advocating the concept, it seems baffling to omit it from Little Nightmares 3 altogether. Are you hoping it’s added later on as part of an update? Let us know.</p>

<p>"On 28th February, we received a series of puzzling reports from many employees that they might feel unwell the next day, so we decided to institute a special holiday for the company," the memo said (as translated by Google).</p>
<p>It then confirmed a special day's holiday has been awarded to <em>most</em> departments - it's unclear what teams won't be eligible - and stressed to players that the time off would not impact Palworld or Craftopia, with scheduled updates progressing as planned (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/palworld-developer-pocketpair-gives-employees-special-holiday-that-just-so-happens-to-coincide-with-monster-hunter-wilds-release/">Automaton</a>).</p> <div>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-has-a-truly-wild-debut-smashing-series-player-numbers-on-steam">Monster Hunter Wilds currently boasts an all-time player peak of 987,482</a>, although it seems likely it will smash past this number over the weekend. This makes Wilds one of the most-played games on Steam, surpassing peak player numbers for the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>.</p>
<p>In comparison, Monster Hunter World has an all-time player peak of 334,684, meaning Wilds has almost tripled the former's peak player numbers in less than a day.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-review">Eurogamer Monster Hunter Wilds review</a>, our Matt awarded it 4/5, saying: "Wilds remains an exhilarating piece of work - so refined, so alive, so giddily, chaotically joyful when it all comes together that it feels like the ultimate culmination of everything the series has been working toward over the last two decades.</p>
<p>"And if it continues Monster Hunter's legacy of generous post-launch support - where the series has traditionally felt the freest to get daft and indulge in its more sadistic tendencies - it'll be fascinating to see how this beautiful new baseline for the series develops."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>It’s been a funny old week, when I thought that Wednesday was Thursday, thanks in part to a long day at a preview event on Tuesday throwing my internal calendar out of sync. What game, you ask? Well, I’ll tell you soon. We’ll also tell you what game Dom and I have been splitting up in co-op sometime next week, you can’t already guess what that is.</p>

<p>But there’s no guesswork for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/25/two-point-museum-review/">Two Point Museum</a>, which I had a lovely time reviewing for the start of the week. I do enjoy Two Point’s brand of management sim, and it’s always fascinating to see how each setting subtly shifts the style of the game, providing a canvas for all the base punning and nonsense that makes this feel so thoroughly British.</p>
<p>I mused the other day that Two Point Museum would be the perfect game to have a themed crossover with the huge game release of the week: Monster Hunter Wilds.</p>
<p><strong>Dom</strong> has played Monster Hunter Wilds.<strong> Nic B</strong> has played Monster Hunter Wilds. <strong>Jim</strong> has also played Monster Hunter Wilds. The last of this trio said, “I found the main story quests to be a little too easy, so I’m hoping the endgame content will prove more challenging. My go-to weapon has been the Insect Glaive but once online servers go live at launch, I’ll be partaking in some Hunting Horn rehearsals!”</p>


<p>He’s also been playing A Plague Tale: Innocence, “which has been rattling around in the backlog for years. It’s an incredibly atmospheric medieval stealth ’em up that weaves together simple yet satisfying stealth sections and puzzles.”</p>
<p>While <strong>Tuffcub</strong> has, quite obviously, been playing Destiny 2, <strong>Aran’s</strong> mixed things up a little with Afterlove EP and Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii. The former was ‘fine’ until he ran into a progression bug later on, while the latter is “as silly as you’d expect it to be.” Sounds perfect!</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc’s</strong> had a bunch of games, new and old on the go. In addition to his casual Phasmo and Palworld gaming, he was roundly disappointed by the Tomb Raider IV-VI remaster, and roundly satisfied by Avowed, “which is rather good in exactly the same kind of way as The Outer Worlds was.”</p>

<p>In addition to his continuing playthroughs of Immortals: Fenyx Rising and Sea of Stars, <strong>Ade’s</strong> also continued to have a great time fighting for freedom and liber-tea in Helldivers 2 this week –&nbsp;“There’s been some brilliant storyline developments added over the last few weeks; surely the payoff to all the drama will be the opportunity to battle on Super Earth itself?”</p>
<p><strong>Miguel’s</strong> played MiSide, and had a grand old time of it, while looking to sate his extraction shooter urges with Synduality: Echo of Ada. And he’s also played an odd bundle of Steam Next Fest demos, including A Gentlemen’s Dispute, Panic Delivery, Haste: Broken Worlds, and more!</p>
<p>And we’ll round out this week with <strong>Steve</strong>, who dabbled with the opening of Avowed, but has put it on hold until he finishes playing through Eternal Strands. It’s Steam Next Fest, so you know that he’s been delving into the delights of horror demos, and then pairing that with some of the “slight but delightful” Princess Peach Showtime on his commutes.</p>
<p><em>Now then, what have you played?</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/monster-hunter-wilds-best-beginner-weapons-to-learn/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>With 14 different weapon types and so many mechanics to learn, trying to get into the Monster Hunter series can feel daunting, and even with its streamlining of many of the experience's core mechanics, Monster Hunter Wilds can be difficult to get into for newcomers, since the game still plays like very little else on the market. Every journey, however, begins with a single step, and the very first step in any Monster Hunter game, including Wilds, is finding the best weapon not only to learn the game's intricacies but also to have fun relatively quickly. And just like monsters, not all weapon types are made the same, and some are better suited for beginners than others.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250215123352_1-1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The best beginner weapons in Monster Hunter Wilds share some common traits. For starters, they have relatively simple game plans that don't require managing resources or multiple gauges to hit hard, have versatile movesets that include both solid offensive and defensive options and have very simple combos that don't require pressing multiple buttons.</p>
<p>The first weapon that falls perfectly into this category is the <strong>Sword and Shield</strong>. This weapon has some very simple combos that are still satisfying to pull off, no gauges to manage or multiple stances, a very functional guard, and the ability to use items without sheating the weapon, which is quite helpful when you are trying to learn the game.</p>
<p>The other three great beginner weapons in Monster Hunter Wilds are slightly more complex than the Sword and Shield, but not by much, and still work great to learn the game. The <strong>Dual Blades</strong> are a little lacking in defensive options, as they cannot guard whatsoever and only have a perfect dodging mechanic that requires being in two of the three possible stances, but when it comes to offense, they are very straightforward with great mobility and some easy combos. The one thing that makes them slightly more complicated to use besides the lack of defensive options is resource management, as entering the powerful Demon Mode drains stamina. Keeping an eye on the Demon Gauge to enter Archdemon Mode once full adds a little more complexity, but the weapon's flow is generally pretty easy to understand, making it a solid choice for beginners.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250226120617_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The <strong>Lance</strong> is also a great beginner weapon in Monster Hunter Wilds thanks to its extremely good Guard, which can be kept up while attacking with its simple combos. Guarding also allows to counterattack when timed right, and with the addition of a few techniques that essentially allow Lance users to intercept monsters' attacks, the weapon is also great to learn some advanced techniques down the line that can be brought over to other weapons.</p>
<p>In past entries in the series, the <strong>Great Sword</strong> wasn't entirely a great beginner weapon. While its moveset was very simple, it required excellent positioning and good knowledge of monsters' tendencies and movesets to land those powerful True Charged Slashes. The buffing of the first two Charged Slashes in the weapon's basic combo, and the addition of Focus Mode, have made using the weapon much, much easier than in previous games, and the improvements made to guarding have made it more than viable to use, in addition to another advanced defensive tool, Offset Rising Slash, which allows you to intercept attacks with good timing. If you're looking for a weapon that hits very hard while being simple to use, the Great Sword is the weapon you want.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250226115127_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While these weapons are, in my opinion, the best for beginners in Monster Hunter Wilds, there are a few additional choices that may be better suited for your playstyle. The <strong>Hammer</strong>, for example, is a good choice with a simple gameplan and combos, but it feels a little weak in the game at the beginning without a proper build, so it may prolong fights a little too much. The <strong>Long Sword </strong>comes with relatively simple gameplay as well, but<strong>,</strong> on the other hand, you will need to learn how to use its counterattacks properly, like Foresight Slash and Iai Spirit Strike from Special Sheathe, to use the weapon to its full potential, which can feel a little overwhelming if you're just starting out your Monster Hunter journey. The ranged weapons - <strong>Bow, Light Bowgun, and Heavy Bowgun</strong> - are decent choices for beginners as well, but they require resource management to deal serious damage, and I think they don't really teach you the game properly, as a ranged playstyle doesn't carry much over to a short range playstyle.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, however, you could potentially feel more at ease with even the more complex weapons in the game, like the Charge Blade and the Switch Axe, so you should definitely try them all to see which one feels the best for you. Monster Hunter Wilds is not a competitive game, so having fun remains the most important thing. Back when I started my Monster Hunter journey with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-pc-dont-fear-the-rampage/">Rise</a> after many failed attempts over the years, I learned the game with the Long Sword before moving on to some more complex weapons like the Insect Glaive and the Charge Blade, so don't stop at your first pick once you have learned the basics of the series' formula: you may find some more fun ways to play the game and enjoy it for longer!</p>

<p>
Years ago I wrote <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/climate-crisis-city-building-games/">a piece</a> about what I presumptuously defined as the "emerging" subgenre of city games that respond to the climate crisis, with its attendant catastrophes of unchecked capitalism and resurgent fascism. Today, it feels dangerously like that subgenre is "sub" no longer.</p>
<p>We are engulfed in strategy sims where society is the rind between the formless terrors without and the only-human abusers within. The geography is clogged by Last Cities and Final Bastions Of Humanity, all of them awkwardly avoiding eye contact, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmyuE0NpNgE">the prophets that line the alleyways of Life Of Brian</a>. I guess it's in keeping with the "unchecked capitalism" bit that apocalypse fantasies have become a thriving business. I hope that's not my fault. On the brighter side, roguelike deckbuilder <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/as-we-descend">As We Descend</a> is quite fun, combining moderately baroque turn-based combat with tales of Vernian dystopia. Here's Wot I Think of the demo.

<p>
In As We Descend, you dutifully take custody of another Terminal Metropolis, a crenellated steampunk diorama that huddles <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a>-style around a light source - not a coal generator, in this case, but an enormous golden hologram, which is possibly the god of the draconian theocracy you'll have to wrangle with as the latest, unwilling First Ranger. 
</p>
<p>
For reasons currently unclear to me, your city is also a huge circular drill that is tunnelling to the centre of the Earth. On each level, you spend turns playing cards to access facilities and stories within the city. You'll also send expeditions into the surrounding caverns to recover technologies such as reactor rods, used to power the forcefields that safeguard your city's descent.
</p>
<p>
The local wildlife don't take kindly to this. That wouldn't be a problem if they were all roundworms and bacteria, but as with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/anoxia-station">Anoxia Station</a>, As We Descend has a nasty case of the megafauna. Enemies range in scale and threat level from gristle-filled balloons to massive, skinless Skeletors. Against these foes you shall pitch Age Of Sigmar-esque battalions of fragile arbalests, iron-palmed monks, tanks with tower shields, and clockwork soldiers, unlocked from run to run.
</p>
<p>
Battles see you distributing your units between two radial zones, while a smaller version of the big golden hologram slings ability cards from the rear. Units in the front zone auto-attack enemies between turns, but are naturally exposed to greater harm. The game's card alchemy feels appropriately compressed and dicey. There are cards that tether stat boosts to moving between zones, cards that cause units to "fixate", inflicting extra damage on a selected foe, while losing the ability to target others, and barrier cards to stave off unit wipes. All of which is powered by faith generated by your citizens, as long as you carry on completing quests for them.

<p>
I lost plenty of units in the demo - there's a nice sense of being fundamentally outmatched, and the longer you linger on a level, the more you're provoking a chonkier predator to attack your city directly. During my first run, my dystopaville fell to a crablike rhino that had the bad form to materialise after a series of expeditions, with all of my units at half-strength.
</p>
<p>
I'm wooed but not wowed by As We Descend's strategy-tactics sandwich. What lures me more is the glowering enigma of the city itself, whose art deco crevices teem with small, branching stories involving supercilious overseers and buff blacksmiths and the like. There's an agreeable stink of medieval politicking. Yes, humans are probably the real monsters here. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1769830/As_We_Descend/">Read more and find the demo on Steam</a> - the full game's out on 27th March.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> looks set to be a smash hit for Capcom, with the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-has-a-truly-wild-debut-smashing-series-player-numbers-on-steam">hitting nearly a million concurrent players on Steam overnight</a>, but the response to the game so far from those played is not all positive, according to Steam user reviews. 
</p>
<p>
On Steam, Monster Hunter Wilds currently sits with a Mixed rating, with  many responses criticising the game's technical performance. 
</p>
<p>
This morning, <a href="https://x.com/MHStatusUpdates/status/1895397927557980292">Capcom issued a social media post</a> seemingly in response to these early complaints, and said that anyone "experiencing any issues with Monster Hunter Wilds on Steam"  should try updating their graphics driver, turning off compatibility mode and then readjusting their settings. The company also linked to a more detailed <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/support/wilds/en/faq/detail/047">Capcom support blog</a> with further tips.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Hunters! If you're experiencing any initial issues with Monster Hunter Wilds on Steam, please try updating your graphics driver, turning off compatibility mode, and then readjust your settings.</p><p>Thank you all for your patience and support!</p><p>More details:<a href="https://t.co/v6g7UwFXpj">https://t.co/v6g7UwFXpj</a></p></div>— Monster Hunter Status (@MHStatusUpdates) <a href="https://twitter.com/MHStatusUpdates/status/1895397927557980292?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 28, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

For now, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2246340">Steam user reviews</a> are awash with complaints regarding the game's performance.
</p>
<p>
"This game is absolutely amazing - but has the worst optimisation I've ever seen," wrote one fan who has already clocked up five hours of playtime. "I'm aware this isn't the first instance of new games having poor performance on launch, because the same thing happened with World, but it feels inexcusable at this point."
</p>
<p>
"I have been a fan since MH3U," wrote another player. "I have 1000s of hours in MH across all of the games. My beefy rig with a 3080 super and decent CPU can't run this game at an acceptable frame rate."

<p>
"Runs even worse than the beta," wrote a third. "For reference, I could run the beta at a comfortable 60-70 FPS on High, usually higher than that. Now I'm running at less than 50 on Medium with noticeable dips. If I can run KCD2 and Cyberpunk on maxed out settings comfortably, then there is no reason this game should be running like this."
</p>
<p>
Still, the game's performance issues at launch don't seem to be putting too many people off from continuing. Currently, 940,000 people are playing Monster Hunter Wilds via Steam - just down from its overnight peak of 987,000. 
</p>
<p>
Digital Foundry will be weighing in with its verdict on Monster Hunter Wilds on PC shortly.
</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-review">Eurogamer's Monster Hunter Wilds review</a>, our Matt called it "the most exhilarating and refined Monster Hunter yet, even if its attempts to balance the old and new don't always quite coalesce in its ongoing quest to please all audiences".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/28/esoteric-ebb-to-be-published-by-raw-fury-become-a-cleric-in-this-crpg/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Raw Fury has announced that it is partnering with developer Christoffer Bodegård to publish the table top inspired CRPG Esoteric Ebb. Described as an absurd fantasy, Esoteric Ebb puts players in the shoes of a lowly cleric who is tasked with solving the mystery of an explosion that took out a tea shop in the city of Norvik. Much like table top RPGs, the cleric’s success relies on the roll of the dice and the advice and taunts of the six voices in his head.</p>
<p><iframe title="Esoteric Ebb | Partnership Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QrdSKgd-1do?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As the story of Esoteric Ebb moves forward, players can choose to try and solve the core mystery or do anything to ruin the flow of the plot. The Cleric has some magical abilities that allow him to read and control minds, and detect secrets within Norvik. The dice rolling affects everything from stealing and fighting, to narrative choices. Failure is an option in Esoteric Ebb, and that will open up different avenues to explore. There are battles to take part in, with those being turn based and reliant on the dice too. How the Cleric’s playstyle evolves depends on the Questing Tree, which is a quest log, mind map, and skill tree combined into one tool. The playstyles change depending on the outcome of quests and how they were completed.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2057760/Esoteric_Ebb/">demo for Esoteric Ebb</a> is available on Steam until March 17th.</p>
