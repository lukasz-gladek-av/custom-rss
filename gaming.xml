			<p>Publisher Kalypso Media announced Disciples: Domination, a new installment in the dark fantasy turn based strategy RPG franchise. This is the direct sequel to 2021's Disciples: Liberation (currently 65% off on Steam), though the developer has changed. Whereas Liberation was made by Canadian developer Frima Studio, Domination is being developed by French developer Artefacts Studio.</p>



<p>The narrative of Disciples: Domination begins fifteen years after the ending of Liberation, when Avyanna freed Nevendaar from the gods' tyrannical grip. Players will step on Queen Avyanna’s throne and attempt to hold together a crumbling kingdom.</p>



<p>The fire of doubt burns within the Queen, sparked by the weight of the Yllian throne and stoked by dreams of becoming the monsters she once defied and destroyed. Paralyzed by fear and haunted by her own power, her rule begins to crumble, with allies disappearing and abandoning her just as an unknown force spreads strife and madness throughout her realm.</p>



<p>Players' choices will shape the future, whether for salvation or ruin. As they chase the truths behind the ceaseless conflicts, dark magic, and conspiracies infecting the empire, they must also face betrayal, strife, and shadowy schemes. </p>



<p>Over the course of Disciples: Domination, they'll get to choose their companions. They can be consulted for guidance on the many choices that will shape the faction's reputation and impact how others react to Avyanna's rule. In combat, players will lead their army in tactical, grid-based battles with faster pacing, dynamic events, and richer interaction. New skills, faction abilities, and unit synergies deepen the strategic options available, along with the unique system of strengths and weaknesses.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sega-financials-q1-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sega-sales-and-profit-fall-due-to-weaker-back-catalog.1265550/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has released its financial summary for the first quarter of the 2025-26 fiscal year, and things aren't looking too good for the&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>studio, although the outlook for the rest of the year is a little rosier.</p>

<p>As revealed in Sega's latest financial <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/20250808_q1_presentation_e.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">presentation</a>, sales and income for the company's core gaming segment have fallen when compared to the same period last year. Sega puts this down to "repeat sales", i.e. sales of games from its back catalog, performing "weaker compared to expectations".</p>

<p>Indeed, across the board, Sega's sales are down by around 23%, with income also falling significantly. Despite this, Sega says its first quarter "exceeded expectation", with the company's pachislot and pachinko machine segment getting "off to a good start" this year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sega-financials-q1-2025-raidou-remastered.jpg?itok=y_Rk1x5n 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sega-financials-q1-2025-raidou-remastered.jpg?itok=_fKB5D03 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sega's first-quarter releases haven't made up for a shortfall in back catalog sales.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Sega, its releases for this quarter, which include titles like June's&nbsp;<em>Raidou Remastered</em>&nbsp;and a remaster of&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine</em>, performed "as expected", as did the company's existing free-to-play offerings.</p>

<p>Additionally,&nbsp;<em>Persona 5: The Phantom X</em>, a free-to-play game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-5-phantom-x-release-date-leaked" rel="nofollow">released in the West</a>&nbsp;in June, has gotten off to a steady start, according to Sega. Unfortunately, these games weren't enough to make up for a shortfall in back catalog sales for Sega.</p>

<p>The company's forecast for the rest of the year is looking a little more optimistic, however. Sega reckons it'll do better this year than last when it comes to sales, driven largely by the release of new&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Football Manager&nbsp;</em>titles later in 2025.</p>

<p>Indeed, Sega's first quarter may have been a little more lucrative had the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-canceled" rel="nofollow">not canceled&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-canceled" rel="nofollow">Football Manager 25</a>&nbsp;</em>in order to focus on its successor earlier this year, but from a quality perspective, that was likely the right decision to take.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater’s Fox Hunt mode has been given a Fall 2025 release window, indicating it won’t be available at launch. </p>



<p>The remake of Metal Gear Solid 3 is all set to release on August 28, 2025, bringing players back to their beloved stealth action title. The title will feature the same story and world, with brand new visuals and audio, improving on the core experience of the original. The title was also going to receive a brand new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-reveals-fox-hunt-multiplayer-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiplayer game mode</a> called Fox Hunt, but it seems that will be available post-launch.</p>







<p>Konami has posted a new update on its <a href="https://www.konami.com/mg/mgs3r/foxhunt/us/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a>, which provides a release window for Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater’s Fox Hunt mode. The post only states ‘Fall 2025’ without giving an exact release date. As the MGS 3 Remake is set to release at the end of this month, it seems players will have to do without the Fox Hunt multiplayer mode for some time. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater’s Fox Hunt mode is a hide-and-seek-based online experience. Here, players will utilise elements unique to Metal Gear, including camouflage and survival. The game mode features sneaking gameplay elements iconic to the Metal Gear series, and the new visual enhancements help make the experience that much more immersive. </p>



<p>Worry not, as the other two game modes of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will be available at launch. PlayStation and Steam players will receive ‘Snake vs Monkey’, where you have to round up all the escaped apes as Snake. Xbox Series X/S will receive ‘Snake vs Bomberman’, where you have to blast these bombermen across different stages. </p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Forza Motorsport Video Review In Progress</p>
      </div>
<p>The studio says that it has <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-motorsport-update-21-featured-tours" rel="nofollow ">several events planned for Forza Motorsport</a> throughout August and September, starting with the return of Track Toys Tour as a permanent feature in the game. At the start of each month, an additional Tour will be added to the game until all of these have returned.</p><p>Layoffs at Turn 10 come at a time when the Forza franchise is experiencing positive growth on PS5. Since Microsoft shifted to a multiplatform strategy for its first-party games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstations-biggest-game-of-2025-is-a-former-xbox-exclusive-analyst-says/1100-6533368/">Forza Horizon 5 and several other former Xbox exclusives</a> have been some of the best-selling games on PS5. Forza Motorsport hasn't been ported to the console yet, but it could only be a matter of time until it does, given the success of other Xbox games on the Sony platform.</p><p>It's also worth noting that Microsoft reported a net revenue of $70.1 billion (up 13%) and a net profit of $25.8 billion (up 18%) <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2025-Q3/press-release-webcast">for its latest quarter</a>, and a few months later, statements issued by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-defends-xbox-studio-closures-layoffs-i-have-to-run-a-sustainable-business/1100-6524121/">Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-tries-to-defend-shutdown-of-award-winning-hi-fi-rush-studio/1100-6523342/">Xbox president Sarah Bond</a> about the staff cuts weren't well-received. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="EA SPORTS Madden NFL 26 Review - Screenshot 1 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157925/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>One of the biggest misses for me personally with the original Switch is that none of the more popular sports games of our time, and I mean these big EA and 2K efforts like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-madden-nfl-26">Madden NFL 26</a> here, and the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ea_sports_fc_24">FC 24</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ea_sports_fc_25">25</a>, aren't up to standard seen elsewhere.</p>
<p>There have been decent enough<em>-ish</em> attempts, some of those footie games mentioned will do in a pinch (and they're leagues ahead of the awful legacy FIFAs which preceded them), but if you're someone who plays on Switch exclusively, you've been missing out on some fluidity, responsiveness, clarity of image, and a bunch of other stuff wot makes fancy modern sports games play good, innit.</p>
<p>And so, Madden 26 on Switch 2 is absolutely a triumph in most regards. It plays well, it runs decently, and it looks not too far removed from other console versions. I'm also playing the game on my PS5 in early access at the moment (forgive me, Mario), and so I can tell you that existing menu issues, long loading times, and/or a persistent issue that's locking me out of Madden 26 because the servers are busy, well, that's all happening on both systems.</p>
<figure><a title="EA SPORTS Madden NFL 26 Review - Screenshot 2 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157922/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It's lucky that I'm comparing it to PS5 here, actually, because I probably would have, and did initially, think it was all just too much, once again, for a Nintendo console to handle. However, this is not the case. Early access is just a little messy right now, pals.</p>
<p>Indeed, for a Madden effort that's really been impressing me thus far with its new additions (and a slick new overall look and vibe to its menus), it's a real shame that, if the servers are having any issues at all, the game is booting you out of whatever you are doing. Sort it before launch, folks, pretty please.</p>
<p>These teething problems aside, I think we've got a banger on our hands here; this is the best Madden I've played in a good few years. Now, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/madden_nfl_25">Madden 25</a> was no slouch either, and in terms of its on-field action, it had got everything feeling better than it had done in years. Offensively, there was more time and room on the ball, runs felt easier to pick out, the AI was smarter in making them, and tackles with the hit stick had never looked or felt more impactful and powerful. We were already in a decent spot with this franchise, even if the modes on offer were getting a little stale.</p>
<figure><a title="EA SPORTS Madden NFL 26 Review - Screenshot 3 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157926/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>With Madden 26, we've got improvements that make last year's effort immediately redundant to anyone who spends much time playing these things. And for newcomers, this is a fantastic Madden to get started on your gridiron journey with, because they've juiced the hell out of the tutorials. Oh yeah. The new training games and skill challenges here blow the old ways of learning out of the water. You earn some cool rewards, the challenges are actually fun, and the game does a much better job of pointing you towards things.</p>
<p>This refresh on the training front really does make it much easier to get to grips with, and it's worth old heads having a look around, too, and not just for all the rewards, coins, and all that nonsense. You'll probably also find yourself learning little things you didn't know. It's deep and it covers all bases (wrong sport, but whatever) with regards to taking you from how to run or pass, when to run or pass, how to make up yards, and all that basic core stuff, right through to fancy skills and strategies and things that my brain refuses to listen to.</p>
<figure><a title="EA SPORTS Madden NFL 26 Review - Screenshot 4 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157921/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>On the field of play, it looks better than ever, which is no surprise, and although there's plenty of weird limb and funny collision moments going on thanks to the fancy new physics model, it plays a better game than last year, and you can feel that immediately.</p>
<p>Now, the first and really only issue with the Switch 2 version crops up here as the game is running at what I'm <em>guessing</em> is 40fps in both docked and handheld modes. In handheld mode, this feels absolutely 100% fine. The game also looks very, very close to other consoles when played on the Switch 2's LCD screen. I've given this the biggest test I could, playing games whilst alternating between a PS5 Pro and a Switch 2, and honestly, give it five minutes — ten minutes if you're grumpy — and you get used to the slight drop in slickness.</p>
<p>I should note here that there is a more important sticking point with the lowered frame rate, and that is cross-play being ditched on Switch 2. It's a shame, for sure, but an understandable measure given you'd be fighting an uphill battle against lots of Captain 60fps opponents.</p>
<figure><a title="EA SPORTS Madden NFL 26 Review - Screenshot 5 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157919/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, in docked mode on your TV, it's a bit more noticeable. The resolution drop makes the play-arts and other things that appear in-game look a little less refined, and the reduced frame rate takes a little longer to bed in with. Again, I've been switching between this and a PS5 Pro in 4K, so it's a harsh test, and for me the Switch 2 version of Madden 26 passes it pretty easily. This is a version of the game that I will very happily play when I can't get to my other console, and for gamers who only have a Switch 2, there's nothing in terms of performance or quality of the port that should stop you from picking this one up. Hooray!</p>
<p>Moving on, Franchise has been the one mode that I reckon long-time fans have felt needs a reboot most, and in this year's game it's definitely much better. This time out, you choose a coach philosophy to get you started (so you may choose to run with an aggressive, strategic, defensively-minded character - all based on real coaches and real data, apparently) before jumping into an improved character creation suite to make your manager look how you like. There's still not a devastatingly terrible widow's peak to make my guy look just like me yet, but I've found one close enough that I'm willing to let this slide - for now.</p>
<figure><a title="EA SPORTS Madden NFL 26 Review - Screenshot 6 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157920/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Everything about Franchise mode feels tidier this year. It's much more addictive to play, too, thanks to lovely things like new equippable abilities that can be unlocked with skill points and will change depending on what coach philosophy you are coming from. Franchise this year also has brand new presentation packages, with fresh halftime shows and presenter bits to camera, primetime TV-styled stuff, and lots of other bells and whistles, making for a game that feels way, way closer to watching NFL on the telly. Heck, teams even have their own entrances and pre-game presentations, and even the jumbotrons and hoardings in stadiums are more exciting now.</p>
<p>Weather now plays a factor in games, with hot climates making your little smashers tired more quickly - and while we're on that topic, the snow games look great. Yes, even on the Switch 2!. This is also a much faster game in general, and the new animation system (which I don't understand, but apparently it's got more branching so it can be more reactive in any given moment) makes it feel much closer to EA's other American footie game.</p>
<p>Indeed, I have also been playing lots of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/ea_sports_college_football_25">EA Sports College Football</a> of late, and last year it was better than Madden. It was zippier and fresher, and it just felt like the more fun game to play. On the pitch it was more...expressive, let's say, and it blew Madden out of the water with its presentation, honestly.</p>
<figure><a title="EA SPORTS Madden NFL 26 Review - Screenshot 7 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157918/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>This year, you can feel how both games are much closer, sharing lots of UI features and gameplay similarities, not just on the field, but in how all of the modes work and flow. And this is a good thing! It's much tighter this year, with both games offering a very high standard of action, and I can't say I can pick a favourite just yet between the two.</p>
<p>Away from Franchise mode, Ultimate Team is still an incredibly, dangerously addictive thing to get involved in. It took me about an hour to have my first actual match, as there are so many packs to open starting out. But I can't help myself with this kind of thing and I'm fully involved in the yearly grind for all the best cards. You already know if this mode is for you and — if you can control yourself — it's a blast, with a ton of ways to play both on and offline with your team of superstars. Team-themed rewards are also a nice touch here, with my Las Vegas Raiders getting lots of bespoke gear and profile items that match my fave team, which keeps me hooked way better than getting lots of random crap. Note, there is still lots of random crap, if that's what you are into.</p>
<figure><a title="EA SPORTS Madden NFL 26 Review - Screenshot 8 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157917/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Across the rest of the game, well, it's business as usual in terms of the crazy amount of modes there are to toy around with, all the usuals are here, with an almost endless array of offline and online ways to play. I do loathe how progression and rewards in some modes require an online connection, but at least you can create your franchise and whatnot at the outset so that you can have it work offline.</p>
<p>When playing online, it must be noted, there's also a world of difference here in trying to get a match. It all works just like it should - there's no Switch slowdown or waiting for an extra ten minutes because the images aren't loading in.</p>
<p>And so, overall, we've got a port that scared the bejeezus out of me initially. I really thought those early server issues and laggy menus were just more of the same for Switch 2 owners coming from a bevvy of bad ports on Switch 1. However, this is not the case. Madden 26 on Switch 2, once you get used to the drop in frame rate compared to elsewhere, is a perfectly good way to play this excellent outing - a version I'll happily play alongside others on more powerful hardware.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Server issues at launch aside, and with the loss of cross-play noted, Madden 26 is a very solid port of one of the best outings for this franchise in recent memory. Yes, you'll need to get used to a drop in the frame rate to 40fps on Switch 2, but it's a reasonable downgrade in order to get this type of game running as well as it does on a portable machine. It really is a very close match in all other ways to other consoles.</p>
<p>For newcomers, this is one of the best Madden games I've played in terms of teaching you the ropes, and for the returning hardcore, the improvements on the pitch, and with regards to presentation, should impress where its predecessor felt a bit lacking.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Take-Two reported outstanding results for its first fiscal quarter of 2026, delivering total net bookings of $1.42 billion, up 17% compared to the $1.22 billion registered during last year’s fiscal first quarter. Net bookings from recurrent consumer spending (virtual currency, add-on content, in-game purchases and in-game advertising) also grew 17%, accounting for 83% of total net bookings. The most significant contributors to the record net bookings were NBA 2K25, Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online, Toon Blast, Match Factory!, Color Block Jam, Empires &amp; Puzzles, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Words With Friends, and Toy Blast.</p>



<p>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick was understandably bullish, especially since the publisher has arguably its strongest games lineup on the horizon. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-twos-strauss-zelnick-on-the-firms-most-robust-release-schedule-and-preparation-for-gta-6s-launch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to GamesIndustry.biz</a> ahead of the financial report, the executive listed a series of games coming next year, and in doing so also included Ken Levine's next game, Judas.</p>



<p><em>We have a number of releases coming in the next 12 months – it's probably our most robust release schedule ever. Obviously, Mafia: The Old Country is available on Steam and console. We have NBA 2K26 coming, Borderlands 4, which I'm really excited about, and WWE 2K mobile for Netflix. We've got WWE 2K26, then of course, GTA 6.</em></p>



<p><em>We have CSR 3 coming from Zynga, Judas coming from Ghost Story Games, and Project Ethos coming from 2K. It's the most robust lineup I've ever been able to talk about this far in advance.</em></p>



<p>The concept behind Judas, the so-called narrative LEGOs, has been in the works for over a decade. Levine famously hosted a GDC presentation about it in 2014 and then <a href="https://wccftech.com/ken-levines-new-game-is-small-scale-open-world-sci-fiai-themed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discussed it again in late 2015</a>. The game itself was <a href="https://wccftech.com/judas-announcement-trailer-bioshock-creator-ken-levine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> at The Game Awards 2022 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/judas-is-finally-unveiled-by-bioshock-creator-ken-levine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled</a> about fifteen months later. Just last month, Levine <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-creator-glad-allowed-design-judas-no-live-service/">thanked Take-Two</a> for not forcing Ghost Story Games to add live service elements.</p>



<p>That Judas is coming in the next twelve months is great news for the publisher, especially since the actual BioShock successor is <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-4-reportedly-development-hell-failed-review-narrative-overhaul/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly in development trouble</a> and may not materialize for quite a while yet.</p>



<p>Elsewhere in the GI.biz interview, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick expressed his strong confidence that Mafia: The Old Country would be successful:</p>



<p><em>I feel great about it. It's a wonderful premium title, it's priced right and it's really beautiful.</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojimas-physint-conceptual-phase/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hideo-kojima%E2%80%99s-physint-is-still-in-the-conceptual-phase.1265514/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Physint, Hideo Kojima's <a href="https://wccftech.com/physint-kojima-new-stealth-ip-playstation-transcend-film-video-games/">return</a> to the stealth action genre, is not going to be shown anytime soon, as work on the game is still in a very early phase.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/features/interviews/death-stranding-2-hideo-kojima-interview-1235143146/">IndieWire</a> in a fresh interview, the legendary game director was asked about what he is working on following the release of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, confirming that work is proceeding on the mysterious <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-disappointed-industry/">OD project</a>, and on Physint, although Kojima-san is working by himself on the latter as it's still in the conceptual phase. While this doesn't come as a surprise, considering it was made abundantly clear back in May that the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-stealth-game-physint-is-five-or-six-years-from-release-by-kojimas-estimate/">five or six years away</a> by Kojima-san himself, it's still a little disappointing to hear that even a first look at the game is really far away.</p>



<p>With Physint still in the conceptual phase, the mysterious OD project will undoubtedly be Hideo Kojima's next project to see the light of day. Following its announcement, very little has been said about the project in development with Microsoft, making some fear that it was cancelled alongside many other projects, including high-profile games like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">Perfect Dark reboot</a> and an <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-cancelled-mmorpg-story-gameplay-details/">MMO from the developers of The Elder Scrolls Online</a>. Thankfully, the project seems to be safe, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-od-xbox-horror-game-still-in-development/">work is continuing.</a></p>



<p>Though not a stealth action game in the capacity Physint will likely be, Hideo Kojima's latest game, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, does have <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-make-stealth-and-combat-way-more-enjoyable-with-this-one-game-changing-trick/">a few mechanics</a> that bring the Metal Gear Solid series to mind, including some significant improvements for stealth and combat mechanics. You can learn more about the game now out on PlayStation 5 by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/">review.</a></p>

            <p>Waiting's been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/with-battlefield-6-beta-queues-stretching-around-the-block-a-substantial-increase-in-server-capacity-should-just-have-helped">a bit of theme</a> during the early stages of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> open beta, which has otherwise been earning a lot of thumbs up from FPS heads. If you've recently run into an never-ending loading screen while trying to jump into a Conquest match, the good news is that the devs have been working to solve those issues.</p>
<p>While EA reckon the problem's specific to that game mode and the Siege of Cairo map, that doesn't look to have stopped plenty of players from running into it over the past 24 hours. Cue a number of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1mkcz0j/infinite_loading_screen_glitch_in_beta/">frustrated</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1mko40z/bug_as_of_this_morning_i_cant_get_into_a_game/">Reddit</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1mklzer/need_infinite_loading_screen_fix_asap/">posts</a> that boil down to the word 'stuck' being yelled so loud it could bring down a helicopter.</p>

<p>"Our team has been investigating reports of an infinite loading screen sometimes occurring when matchmaking into Siege of Cairo while playing Conquest," the official Battlefield Comms account tweeted this morning. "We've identified the cause and are performing server restarts to resolve this. These restarts will not affect players currently in-match. Thank you for your patience."</p>
<p>While waiting for EA to address the issue, folks had been trying stuff like verifying the game's files on Steam or restarting it to solve their problems.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Our team has been investigating reports of an infinite loading screen sometimes occurring when matchmaking into Siege of Cairo while playing Conquest.</p><p>We've identified the cause and are performing server restarts to resolve this.

<p>With those server restarts, hopefully Cairo conquesters'll no longer keep getting stuck staring at some soldiers' shapely posteriors in perma-load, and be back to staring at a soldier's shapely posterior because they've decided to use someone else as cover mid-match. It's a strategy. A crap one, but hey, some of us aren't blessed with Alexander the Great's tactical nous.</p>
<p>For those waiting until this weekend to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-early-access">jump into the Battlefield beta</a>, first of all congrats on likely missing the longest queues.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-fair-price-80-dollars/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/take-two-ceo-dodges-question-on-gta-6-costing-80-or-more-says-it-will-have-a-%E2%80%9Cfair-price%E2%80%9D.1265505/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has said that GTA 6 will have a “fair price” when the game releases in 2026.</p>



<p>Following a question from <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/take-two-gta-6-pricing-debate-june-earnings-1236481561/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a> ahead of Take-Two’s recent quarterly earnings report, the outlet asked Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick about $80 games and what that means for GTA 6.</p>



<p>According to Zelnick, that announcement will come from Rockstar Games, the developer behind GTA 6, in due time.</p>



<p>“Our goal always is to deliver more value than what we charge, so we’ve had variable pricing at the company forever. As you know, the approach of the industry is to launch at a premium price, sometimes with special editions, and over time, typically to reduce the price to enhance the overall size of the market. We do the very same thing. I think, probably more than most, we’re highly focused on making sure that the experience is great, not just because the game itself is great, but also because consumers have paid a fair price for it,” Zelnick said.</p>



<p>So to put it bluntly, Zelnick dodged the question pretty perfectly (hurrah for training), diverting the question from the actual price point to the value to customers.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-gta-6-release-at-the-80-price-point">Will GTA 6 Release at the $80 Price Point?</h2>



<p>Frankly, I find it hard to believe that GTA 6 won’t release at $80. Nintendo has already got the accolade for being the first publisher to make that plunge, and while <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-cuts-prices-of-the-outer-worlds-2-and-other-holiday-xbox-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft recently pulled back on their price increase</a>s, Take-Two won’t want to miss out on another 14% increase, especially for a game like Grand Theft Auto that is going to sell at that price point regardless.</p>



<p>Will other publishers follow suit with $80 games after GTA 6? I’d argue yes, and while Microsoft’s decision to revert their price points suggests otherwise, I believe it was a strategic move based on their current game pipeline and the issues the company is currently facing.</p>



<p>Another common rumor floating around is that GTA 6 will launch at $100, and while I don’t think that will be the case, they’ll almost certainly have an edition to tempt us, and likely go beyond that price point. </p>



<p>What do you think of GTA 6 costing $80 is a fair price? Do you think it will be justified, and what do you think of other games following suit?

            <p>
Retro fans rejoice! Raven Software's legendary (or at the very least, fondly remembered) fantasy FPS twosome Heretic and Hexen have risen from the grave and received the remaster treatment on Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC, courtesy of retro specialists Nightdive.
</p>
<p>
Heretic, for those too young to remember, originally released in 1994 while its sequel, Hexen: Beyond Heretic, released one year later, with Raven Software - these days best known for its work on Call of Duty - creating both using a modified version of the Doom Engine. But while the titles had much in common with id Software's seminal shooter, they managed to bring something new to the still-fledgling genre with their medieval fantasy setting; beefy guns and demonic hordes making way for swords, spell-casting, character classes, and the likes of monstrous spiders, golems, gargoyles, and the undead.
</p>
<p>
Both games have garnered plenty of fans over the years, and have gone on to inspire the likes of developer Indefatigable's superb 2018 retro-shooter throwback Amid Evil, but the originals are now set to enjoy a new lease of life thanks to Nightdive Studios.

<p>
Nightdive - the team responsible for many an acclaimed remaster, including the recent upgrades for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/system-shock-2-25th-anniversary-remaster-review">System Shock 2</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-star-wars-dark-forces-remaster-is-another-nightdive-triumph">Star Wars: Dark Forces</a> - announced its new Heretic + Hexen release ahead of this year's QuakeCon. Both games have now been finessed for modern machines and rereleased, alongside a whole bunch of extras, in one reasonably priced bundle.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, Heretic + Hexen gathers together Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders (combining both the original 1994 game and its expansion), Hexen: Beyond Heretic, and Hexen's Deathkings of the Dark Citadel expansion. That's alongside two new episodes, Heretic: Faith Renewed and Hexen: Vestiges of Grandeur.
</p>
<p>
Multiplayer fans have a variety of options too. There's split-screen local multiplayer for up to four players on all platforms (that's increased to eight players on Xbox Series X/S and PC), as well as cross-platform online support for co-op and deathmatch - the latter accommodating up to 16 players. There's also community mod support, the option to toggle between the original midi/FM soundtracks and a new version by composer Andrew Hulshult, new accessibility features, plus a "vault" containing a collection of behind-the-scenes development materials.
</p>
<p>
Switch supports up to 720p/60fps in handheld mode or 1080p/60ps when docked (there's no native <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> support, sadly), while 1080p/60fps is available on PS4 and Xbox One. PS4 Pro and Xbox One X shunt that up to native 4K/60fps, and you can expect native 4k/120fps on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. PC resolution and framerates are, obviously, dependent on hardware.
</p>
<p>
Heretic + Hexen is available now on Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (via Steam, GOG, and the Windows Store), and costs £13.49/$14.99. It's also available as part of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. Anyone considering purchasing it should check out the <a href="https://slayersclub.bethesda.net/en-US/article/heretic-hexen-release-notes">accompanying FAQ</a>, as players who own certain earlier editions are eligible for a free upgrade.

And in many cases, while that “free” perhaps deserves scarequotes for falling under a subscription fee for a monstrously evil corporation, they’re actually yours to keep forever, with no DRM, and no requirement to keep up your sub. That’s true for eight of this month’s offerings, including&nbsp;<em>Civilization III </em>and&nbsp;<em>Thief: Definitive Edition.</em></p> <p>The reason for this proper, actual ownership is Prime partners with GOG for a lot of the games it includes in the subscription, meaning that you’re getting a code that allows you to download a DRM-free version of the game that boots from an .exe, rather than requiring any launchers or proprietary software. So while you may observe that&nbsp;<em>Civ 3</em> is a 24-year-old game, and as such perhaps not quite matching the sorts of games added to services like PS Plus or Game Pass, in this case you’re getting&nbsp;<em>Civ 3</em> to&nbsp;<em>keep</em>. You could also point out that the game is <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/sid_meiers_civilization_iii_complete">currently available on GOG for $0.75</a>, which is approximately 185 times cheaper than an annual Prime subscription, and there I couldn’t argue back.&nbsp;<em>Thief: Definitive Edition</em>, however, is $25, so that’s definitely a sweeter deal. And, you know, as much as that game definitely shouldn’t have been called “<em>Thief</em>,” and as embarrassing as its <em>The Crow</em> cosplay may have been, it’s actually a pretty decent game in its own right.</p> <p>Amazon Prime likes to make it as confusing as possible to acquire your freebies, releasing the games in four separate batches across the month, guaranteeing you to forget at least some of them. It also removes other games from the selection at the same times, really keeping you on your toes. But the two headline games for August are <a href="https://gaming.amazon.com/home">both there to grab right now</a>, along with big names added in July like&nbsp;<em>Amnesia: The Dark Descent</em>, <em>Marvel’s Midnight Suns</em> and&nbsp;<em>Saints Row IV: Re-Elected</em>. Also coming later this month are&nbsp;<em>FATE: The Traitor Soul</em>–an expandalone entry in Travis Baldtree’s legendary&nbsp;<em>Diablo</em>-like series–and last year’s deckbuilding roguelite&nbsp;<em>Necroking</em>. Here’s the full list of games for August:</p> <p><strong>Available Now</strong></p> <ul> <li><em>Sid Meier’s Civilization III Complete</em> (GOG)</li> <li><em>Thief: Definitive Edition</em> (GOG)</li> <li><em>The Academy: The First Riddle</em> (Amazon Games App)</li> </ul> <p><strong>August 14</strong></p> <ul> <li><em>FATE: The Traitor Soul</em> (GOG)</li> <li><em>Filthy Animals – Heist Simulator</em> (Epic Games Store)</li> <li><em>Tin Hearts</em> (GOG)</li> <li><em>Necroking&nbsp;</em>(GOG)</li> </ul> <p><strong>August 21</strong></p> <ul> <li><em>Labyrinth City: Pierre the Maze Detective&nbsp;</em>(Amazing Games App)</li> <li><em>Silver Box Classics</em> (GOG)</li> </ul> <p><strong>August 28</strong></p> <ul> <li><em>Heroes of Loot 2</em> (GOG)</li> <li><em>Fantasy Empires</em> (GOG)</li> <li><em>City Legends: The Ghost of Misty Hill Collector’s Edition</em> (Legacy Games)</li> </ul> <p>You also get a bunch of games via the Amazon cloud gaming doodad, Luna, which rotate in and out. It currently contains&nbsp;<em>Saints Row: The Third</em>,&nbsp;<em>SkateBIRD</em>,&nbsp;<em>Overcooked! 2</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Dungeons of Hinterberg</em>, among others.</p>

And yes, that's as specific as publisher Konami is currently willing to get. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Announced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-has-an-online-multiplayer-mode-called-fox-hunt-with-completely-different-gameplay-than-metal-gear-online">back in June</a>, Fox Hunt is an entirely new multiplayer offering unrelated to Metal Gear Online, which came bundled with Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots back in 2008. MGO lasted four years, before its servers were switched off in 2012.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Fox Hunt is a completely original online multiplayer mode," said veteran Metal Gear Solid developer Yu Sahara, who now acts as the mode's director, back in June. "Although it shares the same world with Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, the gameplay is completely different.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When we say Metal Gear multiplayer, many fans will probably think of Metal Gear Online, but Fox Hunt will be its own new type of mode. We very much appreciate all the long-time fans of MGO who have always wanted to see it make a comeback, but the landscape of multiplayer games has changed a lot since MGO. It took a lot of careful consideration to think about what a new online mode should look like."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sahara continued by saying that Fox Hunt would focus on Metal Gear series' stealth and survival elements, and take "camouflage and hide and go seek to the next level" in order to ensure the mode offered "more than just a shootout."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of Fox Hunt, Delta is a remake of the 2004 classic Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Another week in the books, and it’s been one that’s raced by for me. Alas, we’ve not had Mafia: The Old Country through the doors for a review, but I’ve been able to sink a little time into Battlefield 6’s public beta now, made a little start on our review of the “brinepunk” roguelite Abyssus with Miguel, and repeatedly thrust my arms along a desk for something else.</p>

<p><strong>Aran</strong> popped in to tell us that he’s been playing&nbsp;SkyCards and Wild Hearts. “SkyCards is a very addictive mix of card collecting and Top Trumps, but it is based on FlightTracker24 data so you catch planes in your area as they fly past. You can also travel to other airports, but to do that you have to unlock the airports, and the only way to do that is to catch a plane going there.”</p>
<p>This sounds… expensive.</p>


<p><strong>Ade’s</strong> spent this week playing DOOM: The Dark Ages and has been absolutely loving it, while Jim has been playing Far Cry 5, having waited for a console performance upgrade before making a start on it – “Ubisoft has a done a great job patching past-gen titles to give them a higher frame rate on PS5”. He’s enjoying its characters, setting and open world, with the only negative being that the combat hasn’t been all that dynamic, he feels.</p>
<p>In stark contrast to one another, <strong>Nic</strong> has been ill, and that is all, while <strong>Steve</strong> has been holidaying in North Wales. He took his Retroid Pocket 3+ with him and played a bit of Breath of Fire II on the journey. Aside from that, he’s been working his way through Wuchang, which he’s enjoying despite hitting a brick wall of a boss, and has finished the main campaign of Space Marine 2 with his online buddies, “which was a fun time but it did seem to take control away at the end for cutscenes rather than combat which was a bit disappointing.”</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has been playing Peglin for review, and blended that with a mix of&nbsp;Death Stranding, a bit of Animal Crossing, which he’s already growing tired of, Burnout Paradise, Saints Row 3, and Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden.</p>

<p><strong>Dom</strong> has been playing Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar for our upcoming review, and turned in a report on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/05/tanuki-pons-summer-brings-together-a-bmx-raccoon-package-delivery-and-sumo-wrestling/">Tanuki Pon’s Summer</a>.</p>
<p>And we’ll finish things out with an essay from <strong>Tuffcub</strong>, who’s been playing Mindseye! Is it as bad as all that?</p>
<p>“It’s really clear that this was meant to be a GTA style game, there’s a lot of set-up for the vibrant city, and there’s a lot of driving to locations, the maps are big. However, somewhere down the line, time and budget meant it got cut down to a series of linear missions and all the features you would expect don’t exist. For example, you can murder the staff at your new job by running them over and nothing happens, No police, no retribution, not even a smacked wrist. Guns just vanish when you pick them up for ammo, and while it looks nice, examine closer and you can spot the cut corners, in one mission the same stick could be found on the ground about every ten paces.”</p>

<p>“Almost two months after launch, and it’s still got acres of screen tearing, and when a new scene loads the whole screen flashes like a disco as objects load in. The plot doesn’t make any sense either, whacked-out ex-marine gets the top security job at the world’s biggest tech firm just because his mate asked? What? And then there’s the office of this revered figure that the new boss has deliberately kept undisturbed for years.. and yet anybody’s security card will open it and you can have a look around and mess with stuff. What? I can see the game they wanted to make. Sadly, they didn’t get remotely close to achieving it.”</p>
<p>Now then, what have you played?</p>

            <p>Wake up, it's the 90s again. Ok, so maybe I've lied to you there, but two classic shooters from the decade that I as a child of 1999 definitely remember fondly have been re-released as one handy bundle with some extra features. Heretic + <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hexen-beyond-heretic">Hexen</a> is out now.</p>
<p>The surprise re-release of these virtual spell boxes came as part of QuakeCon, with Nightdive Studios and id Software collborating to revamp more old school shooty things after doing the same with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom">Doom</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom-2">Doom 2</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/doom-modders-are-annoyed-at-the-chum-bucket-of-wrongly-credited-mods-in-the-latest-doom-remaster">last year</a>. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>Announced by id’s Marty Stratton and Hugo Martin during last night's <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2533764889">QuakeCon welcome stream</a>, the <a href="https://slayersclub.bethesda.net/en-US/article/heretic-hexen-release-notes?linkId=100000377011247">Heretic + Hexen bundle</a> gives you Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders, Hexen: Beyond Heretic, and Hexen: Deathkings of the Dark Citadel. Plus, there are two new chapters developed specially for the re-release: Heretic: Faith Renewed and Hexen: Vestiges of Grandier.</p>
<p>If you've already got the old versions of one or more of the games in your library, you'll be offered a free upgrade to the new bundle and retain access to those previous versions, rather than the new thing annoyingly overwriting them.</p>

<p>"There were level designers (including myself) that wanted to work on something new for Heretic and Hexen," developer Matthew Tropiano said of how the new sections came to be in an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/07/heretic-hexen-surprise-release-today/">Xbox Wire interview</a>, "Kaiser (Sam Villareal) took point on the Heretic episode, while I handled the Hexen episode. We both enlisted the help of community member Not Jabba, as well as Heretic + Hexen lead Xaser Acheron for map design, and artist Arthur Biver for additional graphic work." He and Jaemen Moore added the games' original devs have been part of "inspiring some of the areas", with the Heretic chapter specifically drawing on "unused artwork" for some textures and two enemies, the draugr and troll.</p>
<p>Alongside those chapters, the new additions also include the likes of in-game support for community mods, local, online multiplayer support for up to 16 players with crossplay, and a remixed soundtrack by composer Andrew Hulshult. There are also performance tweaks that'll deliver up to 4K resolution and 120 FPS if you're packing the right hardware, and a vault where you can check out the likes of classic concept art.</p>
<p>Heretic + Hexen will set us PC folks back £13.49/$14.99, via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3286930/Heretic__Hexen/">Steam</a> or <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/heretic_hexen">GOG.com</a>, and it's also on Xbox Game Pass. If you've not played the original Hexen, here's our former deputy editor Adam with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hexen-retrospective">some words on it</a>. If you've not played Heretic then I dunno, maybe imagine it's 1994 and you're enjoying a dark fantasy sibling of Doom. It features a <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Morph_Ovum">magic egg</a> that can turn enemies into chickens. Life's good. Or at least I assume it was.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/classic-shooters-heretic-and-hexen-re-released-as-an-enhanced-bundle-with-cross-platform-multiplayer-and-mod-support]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Nintendo, apparently dissatisfied with being a stalwart of nearly every school child’s life, is aiming even younger. A new range of products under the banner of <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/my-mario/index.html"><em>My Mario</em></a> has been announced, including wooden block toys, board books, and a Switch and mobile app that’ll let kids mess with Mario’s face, all focused on a preschool market. Gotta get ’em young and impressionable.</p> <p>Initially launching in Japan, the physical toys will be available in select Nintendo stores, but will almost inevitably find their way to international markets soon enough. The range includes plastic crockery, a mini-backpack, rattle plushies, and super-adorable teeny clothing, so you can deck your toddler out as a nearly-walking Nintendo billboard.</p> <p>The app, which is confirmed as coming to Switch and iOS, lets little kiddos goof around with Mario’s face, pulling and stretching the poor plumbers various features, causing him to react in different ways. It sounds super-basic, which is precisely what kids that age will want, reacting to their experimental input. Also, it’ll be free, so they can keep their complaints to themselves.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000616597" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616597"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616597">© Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This new range launches in Japan on August 26, and will include the most beautiful-looking building block sets, but each block is also an amiibo! There’s a Mario, Toad, Yoshi, Luigi and Peach, along with items like&nbsp;? blocks and green pipes, letting your kid build up a gaming scene, or just smash them into each other before chewing on the side of Yoshi’s face until the paint wears away. A Mario picture book looks equally well made, each board page interactive in some form. And oh my goodness, I want to go back in time and get the Mario romper suit with a hoodie for when my boy would fit in such things.</p> <p>There’s also a collection of stop-motion animation videos that’ll appear on the My Mario website when it goes live, each about a minute long telling stories about the mustachioed hero, again aimed at the youngest kids.</p> <p>All the physical objects will initially go on sale in Nintendo stores in Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto, but hopefully Nintendo will see the demand for international customers once everyone realizes those wooden blocks are secret amiibos and adults go insane trying to buy them. It’s unclear if the app will be available in English, but again, it’d be pretty daft not to.</p> <p>I shall never stop finding it incredibly weird that an ambiguously aged, mustache-wearing portly Italian plumber is such a staple of everyone’s lives, and it only gets more strange when aimed at preschoolers. And yet he’s the best! Nintendo’s clearly aiming to ensure kids are fully enculturated before they can even say his name.</p>

            <p>
As the thrills of July make way for the spills of August, Amazon has refreshed its Prime Gaming offerings once more, this time bringing 13 titles to subscribers, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/civilization-iii">Civilization 3</a>.

Then, as the month progresses, there's some chaotic multiplayer infiltration in Filthy Animals: Heist Simulator, fantasy action in FATE: The Traitor Soul, a bit of tactical roguelite deck-building in Necroking, a splash of old-school D&amp;D in the Silver Box Classics bundle, and more.

<p>"Over the past several years, Avalanche Studios Group and Xbox Game Studios Publishing have collaborated on Contraband," reads a <a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/contraband-update">statement</a> Avalanche put out last night. "Active development has now stopped while we evaluate the project’s future. We’re thankful for the excitement we’ve seen from the community since we announced and will give an update on what’s next as soon as we can."</p>
<p>That statement's arrival followed reports from both Bloomberg and <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/breaking-microsoft-stops-development">Game File</a> about Contraband's fate. The former saw Jason Schreier claim that this halt to development isn't just a pause, but a full-blown cancellation decided on by Microsoft. Meanwhile, the latter said that the game has been put "on hold", linking the news to Microsoft's July layoffs - which saw cuts in Xbox’s publishing division that works with outside development studios.</p>
<p>We'd already seen the consequences of those cuts and the call to stop funding several unnanounced games, with Romero Games having funding for their upcoming FPS pulled, leaving them <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/romero-games-have-completely-closed-doors-but-theres-still-hope-for-the-doom-creators-new-fps">searching for a new publisher</a> to get the project over the line. Some third-party games, including Kojima Productions' <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hideo-kojima-is-making-a-horror-game-with-jordan-peele-and-its-called-od">OD</a>, are reportedly unaffected.</p>
<p>Contraband's premise sounds very cool - you and your mates smuggling goods across borders in "the fictional Southeast Asian world of 1970s Bayan". That E3 trailer, which has been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reuri4lT7jI">set to private</a> on Xbox's English YouTube channel (but is still up on the Mexican one), had some Steely Dan in the background.</p>
<p>"Yeah, you go back, Jack, do it again," go the lyrics. "Wheel turnin' 'round and 'round. You go back, Jack, do it again."</p>
<p>We'll have to see where the wheel for Avalanche, over 500 staff at whom <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/over-100-staff-at-just-cause-developers-avalanche-have-unionised">unionised last year</a>, turns next. That's assuming this truly is is the last stop for Contraband's convoy.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-have-halted-development-on-just-cause-devs-70s-co-op-smuggler-contraband]]></content:encoded>

<p>Marvel Rivals has a year’s worth of new characters planned, and preparation 12 months in advance for new heroes is underway, Marvel Rivals Director Guangguang has revealed to Insider Gaming.</p>



<p>New heroes are one of the core features of Marvel Rivals, which has transitioned into introducing a new hero every half-season, and the next 12 months of content are prepared.</p>



<p>Speaking exclusively to Insider Gaming at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-ignite-mid-season-finals-complete-scores-standings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals Ignite Mid-Season Finals</a> in Guangzhou, Guangguang revealed that initial work has begun on characters set to be released this time next year.</p>

<p>It takes “about a year” to bring a new character into <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a>, with a long list of work to be done that includes gameplay aspects, concept art, modelling, animation, and voice acting. Therefore, content is planned for the next 12 months and beyond.</p>



<p>While other games have adopted a yearly roadmap for content drops, highlighting what players can expect in the months ahead, Guangguang explained why the preferred approach for Rivals is to reveal new content at the start of each season to maintain “freshness and surprises.”</p>



<p>This approach also allows the Rivals team to keep a close eye on what the playerbase and Marvel fans are enjoying most, paying attention to their discussions to see how that can inspire the team to see what they can come up with.</p>



<p>One of the most highly requested additions from the community is Deadpool, but Guangguang did not confirm whether Wade Wilson is on the release schedule for the next year, telling fans to “stay tuned” for future reveals.</p>



<p>Which character is at the top of your wishlist in Marvel Rivals? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/3226/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

			<p>For the longest time, I’ve associated Japanese developer MAGES with absolute anime nerd (weab) slop. Now, as a massive weab, I say that in the most endearing and well-meaning way. The dense sci-fi visual novel adventures of Steins;Gate&nbsp;and the schlocky, shocking horror of&nbsp;Corpse Party&nbsp;are some of my favorite games, but in the last year, I’ve come to appreciate MAGES for a series of games that their work on has seemed to be relatively unnoticed. The recent Famicom Detective Club&nbsp;remakes on Nintendo Switch were developed in part by MAGES, including the incredible new entry Emio – The Smiling Man.&nbsp;Delivering an incredibly mature, slow, ominous, and grounded visual novel detective mystery, it ended up as one of my favourite games of 2024. It’s no wonder I ended up loving Iwakura Aria, as it shares so much of that same DNA and style.</p>
<p><iframe title="Iwakura Aria | Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RSiPbhGA-AY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Iwakura Aria wastes no time delivering a drab and dour opening. In 1966, in the wake of the war, Japan is full of orphaned children with no reliable path forward. One such child is our protagonist, Ichiko Kitagawa, who clings to hope as she scrapes by and spends her time illustrating. One day, though, her art catches the eye of a mysterious man, who ends up being the head of the prestigious Iwakura household. Almost on sight, he invites her to join the household as a maid, giving her a home and a path forward, but for seemingly no clear reason or benefit to himself. The dominoes of uncertainty slowly tumble onward from there, as Ichiko gets familiar with the mansion, picks up on the secrets bubbling within it, and begins to bond with Aria, the heiress of the family.</p>



<p>The events of&nbsp;Iwakura Aria&nbsp;don’t immediately have a hostile or ominous air to them, but what makes that sense of dread creep through is the incredible aesthetic of the game. Every character is rendered in a gorgeous, detailed, painterly style that is reminiscent of&nbsp;The House of Fata Morgana.&nbsp;The backgrounds, though, are a bit sharper, a bit more realistic, and swathed with incredibly realistic shadows and lighting. The result is an unsettling tonal clash that kept me with a cold-sweat the entire time I was playing.</p>

<p>In an early scene, Ichiko uncovers a dark and dimly lit room that contains a wardrobe full of knives, hammers, and guns. The way household-head Amane Iwakura’s bright character art contrasts against the dark, foreboding room as he gaslights our protagonist into not worrying about the content of the wardrobe is incredible and sinister.</p>

<p>As the game progresses, Ichiko falls deeper and deeper into the hellish secrets of the Iwakura household. What I appreciated most about this game is that uncovering those secrets and seeing Ichiko’s story through to it’s bitter end doesn’t take long at all. The adventure wraps up in a dozen or so hours, which is light and brief compared to the gargantuan 40-80 hour runtimes of most other mystery VNs, including MAGES own Steins;Gate series. The brief runtime helps paper over some of Iwakura Aria’s weaker points, too – investigation gameplay is here, but often feels more arbitrary or forced than it does engaging or enticing. There’s also a surprising lack of expression variations for character sprites or unique illustrated CGs.</p>
<p>Still, those qualms are minor in the grand scheme of things. Iwakura Aria is an incredibly insightful, grim, and engaging visual novel that doesn’t overstay it’s welcome. The combination of dark subject matter and beautiful character art creates one of the most interesting visual novel experiences I’ve ever played, and is well worth checking out for anyone interested in a more grounded mystery VN experience.</p>
