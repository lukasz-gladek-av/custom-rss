            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>After years of anticipation, Team Cherry announced last week that Hollow Knight: Silksong will <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/21/hollow-knight-silksong-launches-on-september-4">finally be released on September 4</a>. This took many fans and, evidently, other studios by surprise, namely Ysbryd Games. In response to Team Cherry's announcement, the indie publisher has delayed the upcoming tactical RPG <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/07/tactical-rpg-demonschool-will-officially-open-its-doors-in-september">Demonschool</a>, which was planned to launch one day before Silksong.</p><p>In a press release, Ysbryd announces it has pushed Demonschool’s planned September 3 launch to a new release date of November 19. With Silksong arriving next week on the 4th, Ysbyrd read the tea leaves, realizing that releasing a game so close to the most anticipated indie game in recent memory is a bad idea.</p><p>“We have to remind ourselves that gaining visibility for Demonschool is our main goal," says Ysbryd's Brian Kwek in a statement. "Thus, the Ysbryd team strongly believes we would not be doing our game any favors by wading into waters we can clearly see are blood red. If the September period is going to be Silksong's moment, then we need to be elsewhere on the calendar to give Demonschool its own moment to be seen and talked about meaningfully.”</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fazy1L9KXFQ"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fazy1L9KXFQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Ysbyrd states that developer Necrosoft Games will spend the extra two months enhancing and polishing Demonschool. One positive of the delay, according to Ysbyrd, is that the added time allows Necrosoft time to add additional endings and minigames that were originally going to be included in a post-launch patch.</p><p>Similar to Silksong, Demonschool has been in development for some time as well, suffering several delays before this one. It centers on teenage students battling demons in turn-based tactical combat similar to titles such as Into the Breach. We were <a href="https://gameinformer.com/sgf-2025/2025/06/07/the-coolest-games-weve-played-at-summer-game-fest-2025">impressed with the demo we played</a> at Summer Game Fest, &nbsp;and are optimistic about the full release.&nbsp;</p><p>Demonschool launches on November 19 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC for $24.99.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/25/demonschool-delayed-to-avoid-releasing-near-hollow-knight-silksong]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="Demonschool" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c80459b665ebc/demonschool.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ysbryd Games</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Update [<time datetime="2025-08-25T18:51:28+00:00" data-format="D jS M Y, g:ia">Mon 25th Aug 2025, 7:51pm</time>]:</strong></p><p>Developer Necrosoft Games has followed up with a brief statement on Bluesky.</p>
<p>Clarifying the reason for the long delay, Necrosoft <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/necrosoftgames.com/post/3lxak6xi3622r">confirmed that it's more than just Silksong influencing the two month slip</a>, citing Silent Hill f, Final Fantasy Tactics, and the absolutely wild release schedule for October.</p>
<p>"This was not our choice but we understand why the choice was made," the studio states. "We're sorry this is happening."</p>
<hr><p><strong>Original Story:</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/demonschool">Demonschool</a> can't catch a break, can it? The upcoming tactical RPG, inspired by classic Persona, SMT, and Italian cinema, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/tactical-rpg-demonschool-finally-gets-a-launch-date-and-its-real-soon">was due to release on 3rd September 2025</a>, but today, publisher Ysbryd Games has announced that it's pushing Necrosoft Games' release back to <strong>19th November 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Why? One <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, which is launching <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/hollow-knight-silksong-finally-has-a-release-date">the day after Demonschool's previous release date</a>.</p>
<p>In a press release, Ysbryd Games' Brian Kwek says "after much anguished consideration on our part, we’ve made the decision to move the game’s release."</p>
<p>"With 11 years under our belt as an indie publisher, we at Ysbryd Games are reasonably qualified to say that any point of 2025, on balance, has been or will be as brutal as market conditions can get when it comes to releasing a game. Crueler still, that we should find out with such short notice that Hollow Knight: Silksong will launch just one day after our planned release for Demonschool."</p>
<p>The publisher says that "gaining visibility" is the main goal for the game, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/08/tactical-rpg-demonschool-has-been-delayed-yet-again">which has been delayed multiple times</a> since its reveal a few years ago — "If the September period is going to be Silksong's moment, then we need to be elsewhere on the calendar to give Demonschool its own moment to be seen and talked about meaningfully."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/necrosoftgames.com/post/3lwx26vg5cc2r">official Demonschool Bluesky</a> shared this lovely photo of the game on a CRT in response to Silksong's release date, and in retrospect, it's a little amusing:</p>

<p>While the delay will be disappointing to many, Ysbryd Games has revealed that this will allow the developers to include more endings and minigames that they were "originally planned to patch in post-release.</p>
<p>Demonschool isn't the only game to delay itself to avoid Silksong's release window: <strong>CloverPit</strong>, a slot machine roguelike, and <strong>Aeterna Lucis</strong>, the sequel to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/aeterna_noctis">Aeterna Noctis</a>, have both been delayed in response to Team Cherry's hand-drawn Metroidvania release.</p>
<p>September is already jam-packed, so we hope the delay gives Demonschool the breathing room the game deserves.</p>
<p><em>Let us know if you're surprised by the news in the comments.</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/the-riftbreaker-update-2-0-co-op-expanded-campaign/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-riftbreaker-update-2-0-adds-4-player-co-op-an-expanded-campaign-and-more.1280073/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Developer and publisher Exor Studios has just released the latest update for The Riftbreaker, which includes a few significant features for the game. Update 2.0 introduces four-player online co-op to The Riftbreaker, along with an expanded campaign, an overhaul to the loot system, new Omega-Strain creatures, and more.</p>



<p>The update is available right now for PC players through Steam, the Epic Games Store, and GOG, though Windows Store players and players on console will have to wait, as the update will be available there "<em>at a later date</em>," according to the studio in a press release.</p>



<p>Exor Studios also debuted a new trailer for the update, which showcases co-op gameplay, some of the new creatures you'll face, and shots of the expanded campaign for veterans looking for more to do in the endgame.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Riftbreaker - Update 2.0 Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hPdjx2wGPb8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Regarding the expanded campaign, this update introduces a new story arc centering around Megastructures, and is fully voiced with Francesca Meaux and Ryan Laughton returning to their roles as Ashley and Mr. Riggs, respectively. </p>



<p>The Omega-Strain creatures are more powerful versions of existing creatures and enemies you've already faced, though thanks to their added punch, taking them down will score you an even bigger reward. They also feature various elemental types that will encourage you to switch up your approach depending on the situation.</p>



<p>Exor Studios has also overhauled the loot system with Update 2.0, and crafting is no longer the only way to obtain new gear. You'll now see new gear appear as loot from enemy creatures, Biocaches, and Bioanomalies. There's also a number of balance adjustments in the update, including tweaks to weapons, research, quality-of-life improvements, and even a few optimization improvements to help the game perform better on your device.</p>



<p>The Riftbreaker is a base-building action-RPG that<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-riftbreaker-an-ephemeral-paradise/"> first launched in 2021</a>, and has been updated several times since launch, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-riftbreaker-metal-terror-dlc-more-of-the-same/">new expansions</a> and balancing updates. </p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/aaa-simulator-interview-satire</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nepobabies-roguelites-satire-the-inspirations-of-aaa-simulator.1280070/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you follow the gaming industry at all, you know that the last few years have been rough. "Survive to 2025" was a phrase going around last year due to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-14th" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" This Week in Gaming Business - 2024 Layoffs Already Higher than 2023 Total">various layoffs</a>, and the year before that was similar as waves of layoffs hit different companies across the industry. All that gets put under the microscope of satire in&nbsp;<em>AAA Simulator</em>.</p>

<p>While small studios have closed or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chivalry-2-torn-banner-layoffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Chivalry 2 Developer Torn Banner Lays Off an Unknown Number of Devs">had layoffs</a>, more persistent has been the ongoing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Latest Microsoft Layoff Wave Hits Candy Crush and Elder Scrolls Studios">waves of layoffs</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-shuts-down-two-studios-including-concord-creator" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Sony Shuts Down Two Studios Including Concord Creator">cancellations</a> from AAA developers and publishers, and it is from this that the two-person team at Whitelocke Media was inspired to create a game satirizing the corporate gaming environment and industry.</p>

<p>Lead designer Nic&nbsp;Vasudeva-Barkdull was one of those people working on a game that an AAA publisher cancelled, killing the studio and leading to him being laid off at the start of 2024. This prompted plenty of job searching for him, including interviews – many of which had red flags such as requiring spec work or other problems.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“At first, I had plenty of interviews, but each with a thousand red flags. Techland made me create a quest from scratch, unpaid, just to interview for a quest designer (and apparently coder and 3D artist) position. Another studio wouldn't stop going on about how they're free of all the corporate BS and I later saw them in the headlines laying people off. And a third was an Embracer studio, enough said about that.”&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aaa-simulator-interns.jpg?itok=QJZH2akI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aaa-simulator-interns.jpg?itok=ufj-SSLn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Whether it's spec work like Techland proposed, internships with no remuneration, AI replacements, or not paying contractors, many companies cut corners to save a few bucks.</figcaption></figure><p>It wasn’t his own search that served as the final impetus for him to make <em>AAA Simulator</em>. That would come from the wreckage he was seeing around the industry as a whole, though his own frustration inevitably helped fuel it, too.</p>

<p>“If I were to pinpoint an exact moment that compelled me to make <em>AAA Simulator</em>, it was when I found myself so sickened by multi-decade game veterans begging for jobs on LinkedIn, Microsoft's own corporate social media, that I couldn't even bring myself to continue my job search," he said. "I had to make a game, whether someone hired me to make one or not, and I had to do it in a way that ran opposite to everything I was seeing in the industry.”</p>

<p>Unlike most similar simulation games about the games industry, in <em>AAA Simulator </em>you aren’t picking how to make a game or what the game will do. In fact, the only direct thing you really do about the game is naming it, and your primary means of interaction is hiring or firing workers.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aaa-simulator-employee-slider.jpg?itok=2YSt7GCd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aaa-simulator-employee-slider.jpg?itok=HTJYpiR4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Aunt Tara's general view that the only thing that matters is money and board happiness (aka stock price) is far too common in the market today.</figcaption></figure><p>It started from a comment Rod Fergusson <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/diablo-boss-rod-fergusson-don-t-treat-devs-like-knobs-and-dials-" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Diablo boss Rod Fergusson: don't treat devs like 'knobs and dials'">made</a>:&nbsp;“These people aren't knobs and dials," he said in reference to developers. That had Vasudeva-Barkdull ponder that to the company executives, employees are in fact knobs and dials. The culture in the companies had evolved to treat the employees in these major companies that way, all to feed the goals of higher profits and share prices.</p>

<p>Design started with a simple slider to hire and fire people, as well as a crude profit bar that got bigger or smaller based on cost and income. Due to its status as a ubiquitous word, "hype" was quickly added as another metric that impacted sales of games.</p>

<p>“But that mechanic isn't any fun without something to react to, and that reaction needs consequences," Vasudeva-Barkdull said. "It was pretty natural to come to the conclusion that random events should be thrown at the player who can only solve them by hiring or firing people. It simulates a point of view where employees are knobs and dials that you can tweak for profit.”</p>

<p>“As I finish up the game, I’m already going further back to EA Spouse and things like that. I’ve thought about doing #GamerGate, maybe it’s even mandatory, but it might not fit in a satisfying way. Plus, my dissertation started with #GamerGate, and I’m kind of tired of it,"&nbsp;Vasudeva-Barkdull said.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aaa-simulator-ea-spouse-reference.jpg?itok=rChglAcu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aaa-simulator-ea-spouse-reference.jpg?itok=Xs-tm_As 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>EA Spouse happened in 2004 (And the original blog post can be <a href="https://ea-spouse.livejournal.com/" rel="nofollow">read here</a>), but remains <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-development-was-crunch-free-devs-say" rel="nofollow">relevant over 20 years later</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>Said dissertation is of relevance, as Vasudeva-Barkdull has a Ph.D in cultural studies, which helped inform how the team has tackled matters.&nbsp;His expertise, knowledge, and interest in how companies perceive the people in them all resonated with ideas he encountered like Fergusson's comment about workers being treated as knobs and levers.</p>

<p>It’s impacted the design process as well, as the Whitelocke team, consider things like paying contractors in other countries rather than going on Fiverr for the cheapest possible option. As Vasudeva-Barkdull shared, with a new studio, that has often meant hiring no one, and he has done most of the asset creation himself.</p>

<h2>'The Game Industry Is a Roguelite'</h2>

<p>One other aspect of <em>AAA Simulator </em>that is easy to miss at first glance is that it’s actually a roguelite, as eventually, as seems to fit the current state of capitalism, you will fail to make the line of profit go up enough to satisfy your investors. When that happens, your family bails you out, and you get to start again. When I asked Vasudeva-Barkdull about it, he had a fair bit to share with me regarding the design and how it reflects the games industry.</p>

<p>“I realized the game industry is a roguelite. Just look at the Wikipedia for someone like Lars Wingefors. It tells the story of someone failing up in cycles, rebuying, rebranding, resurrecting the name Nordic as it goes bust over and over.&nbsp;He's out at Embracer now, but they're already calling themselves something else and he just keeps getting richer," he said.</p>

<p>"In <em>AAA Simulator</em>, you're a nepobaby because the parent company, some water corporation in Europe, has just bought not one but dozens of AAA studios in an acquisition. Sound familiar? Well, any resemblance to real people or events is purely coincidental, I insist."</p>

<p>Capturing this comes with the fact that the meta progression is represented in the connections you made in the form of experts. It captures the idea of failing up, in part because every time you fail you get to start over, with no consequences other than the loss of what you built.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aaa-simulator-lars.jpg?itok=YzeWD7ha 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aaa-simulator-lars.jpg?itok=d8AteRwK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Any similarities to the Embracer co-founder are purely coincidental.</figcaption></figure><p>A satirical game like <em>AAA Simulator </em>has plenty of opportunities to punch up, tip hats, and toss in jokes or easter eggs. Vasudeva-Barkdull's favorite of it is the Press Release card because of how it captures corporate sentiment around things like diversity. It has poor grammar, obvious insincerity, a pride flag heart, and a bit of text saying, “We support diverse!”</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aaa-simulator-press-release.jpg?itok=1k0Uvoxx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aaa-simulator-press-release.jpg?itok=tIFcXhke 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>While it's small, you can see the Press Release in the bottom left of the image there, and it ready to be used to nullify this event.</figcaption></figure><p>As our discussion was often as much about the industry as a whole as about <em>AAA Simulator</em>, as any discussion of this game is likely to be, I asked him about how the industry should evolve.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“That's a difficult question because it's not only up to me alone to decide that. But I think there are several viable solutions for studios depending on where they are and their particular situation. I've heard in Japan they have legal protections from mass layoffs, and that's a start. Or to cure the sickness rather than the symptoms, changes to the system can be made. Different corporate rules, or if the problem is that C-Level is acting only in the interest of shareholders, make the employees into shareholders," he said.</p>

<p>"It's our art, so we should own it. I can't tell anyone what to do, but I hope as we add developers to our own team, we can do it in some kind of equal partnership or co-op structure. It's not that hard to imagine a business structured less like a feudal kingdom and more like a democracy.”</p>

<p><em>AAA Simulator </em>is currently in development with a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3358040/AAA_Simulator/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="AAA Simulator">demo available on Steam</a>. A release date has yet to be announced.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>REPLACED has been delayed yet again, though its new window is more promising. After a troubled development, as the team was located near the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, there is a bit more hope for the game’s future.</p>



<p>The game, created by indie team Sad Cat Studios, is a cyberpunk action platformer. Rendered in a 2.5D style, REPLACED has been highly anticipated by many since its 2021 reveal. Fortunately, while it won’t come out in 2025, the team has shared some good news on when we will.</p>



<h2 id="h-replaced-eyes-spring-2026-release-with-new-development-update-final-trailer-this-year">REPLACED Eyes Spring 2026 Release With New Development Update, Final Trailer This Year</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPoyEkQePA4">video from IGN</a>, the team at Sad Cat Studios and publisher Thunderful Games goes over many of the improvements since the last update. REPLACED, according to the team, is close to finishing production, but won’t make the planned 2025 release date. Instead, they announced at the end of the video that the game will launch in Spring 2026. </p>



<p>In a statement from game director Yura Zhdanovich, provided via <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/replaced-delayed-to-spring-2026">a press release</a>, he says, </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We know that our community is incredibly excited to play&nbsp;<em>REPLACED</em>&nbsp;and it’s no secret that it’s taken longer than we initially thought to deliver that to you all—we apologize for that,” states Zhdanovich. “We’ve always been trying to do what’s right for the project, which in turn, means delivering to you a truly special experience.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/overwatch-2-developers-say-they%E2%80%99re-leaning-into-what-works.1280055/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The state of <em>Overwatch</em> <em>2</em> in the three-ish years since its release could be mapped onto the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/2555116-its-so-over-were-so-back" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“we’re so back, it’s so over” meme chart</a>. Peaks and valleys, false starts and lost features, and waxing and waning player numbers have plagued Blizzard’s hero shooter sequel, which was promised as one thing and has since morphed into another entirely. The years-long identity crisis <em>Overwatch 2</em> has faced since its 2022 launch has greatly affected its playerbase, and the launch of hero shooter <em>Marvel Rivals</em> last December seemed to take an even bigger chunk out of it.</p><p>Since the start of this year, <em>Overwatch 2 </em>has been moving to reinvent itself, leaning back into its competitive multiplayer core and away from the PvE focus it promised in 2019 and then only half-heartedly fulfilled. Though this new direction may alienate the players who look to <em>Overwatch</em> for lighthearted fare and beloved character stories, it depicts a self-assuredness that the series hasn’t shown in half a decade. After playing over 800 hours of the game, I feel like <em>Overwatch 2</em> knows what it is now, and it’s doubling down.&nbsp;</p><p>Ahead of Season 18, I spoke to game director Aaron Keller and lead gameplay designer Alec Dawson. Although the interview was brief, Keller and Dawson were refreshingly transparent about the developmental hiccups and their plans for the future.&nbsp;</p><p>Since its 2022 launch (when it replaced the original game entirely), <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s focus has pinballed between PvE and PvP. Multiplayer remains a constant, yet dev support for half-baked modes like Hero Mastery Gauntlet disappeared a few seasons ago, and there hasn’t been a new release of extensive, $15 “story missions” (which were pitched as regular content drops) since the first batch released last summer.</p><p>When <em>Overwatch 2</em> was announced at BlizzCon 2019, then-lead director Jeff Kaplan pitched the sequel as an extension of the original game, with a robust PvE mode as its major pillar. That mode, meant to attract players who weren’t into competitive multiplayer (as well as existing <em>Overwatch</em> fans who <a href="https://aftermath.site/overwatch-2-patch-pharah-mercy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">loved the characters</a> and wanted more lore), would offer an in-depth narrative set in the <em>Overwatch </em>universe, and skill trees for each hero that would let players tailor them to their personal preference.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://x.com/jasonschreier/status/1771227101112205572?t=EekP4L-Xaah9XWDUUMfE2Q&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Jason Schreier</a>, PvE was Kaplan’s focus for the sequel. After Kaplan left in 2021, a new team took over and shifted back to PvP, launching an <em>Overwatch 2</em> that was nothing like the initial pitch and seemed caught between two vastly different ideologies. Schreier has also <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/activision-blizzard-reportedly-clashed-with-the-overwatch-team-on-how-to-cope-with-the-hero-shooters-swelling-demands-like-ow2-pushed-for-hundreds-of-hires-to-be-more-call-of-duty-like/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">written</a> that there was an aggressive push to expand <em>Overwatch</em>’s dev team to be more <em>Call of Duty</em>-like, with a larger team size (“hundreds more people”), a push led by former Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick. Kaplan reportedly resisted this push, hoping to maintain the more intimate team structure and dev process.</p><p>You can see that tug-of-war play out in <em>Overwatch 2</em>. It is now August 2025, nearly three years after <em>Overwatch 2</em> launched. Jeff Kaplan is long gone, PvE is long dead, and the team is wholly focused on multiplayer.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Overwatch</em> faced external challenges as well. Not long after the game’s official release out of early access in October 2023, Microsoft completed its acquisition of Activision Blizzard. The company’s new ownership led to several rounds of layoffs, including ones in <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs-survival-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">January</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-lays-off-another-650-people" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 2024</a> that affected <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1ab6e28/overwatch_lead_narrative_designer_got_hit_by_the/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1ffo9rw/comment/lmw9uhq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">members of the game’s narrative</a> team. (Workers on Blizzard’s Story and Franchise Development team <a href="https://aftermath.site/blizzard-union-story-franchise-cwa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unionized this month, joining other unions that have sprung up in the wake of Microsoft’s repeated layoffs.)&nbsp;</a></p><p>Today, <em>Overwatch 2</em> reviews sit at <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2357570/Overwatch_2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“mostly negative” on Steam, and r</a>eported player counts don’t come close to the game at its peak. Players have long felt <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s development process has been indecisive, as if Blizzard has been trying to relearn the ins and outs of its own game for the better part of three years. It’s hard to understand what could have caused such bizarre decisions as replacing<em> Overwatch 1</em> with <em>Overwatch 2</em> after <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2019/11/12/jeff-kaplan-overwatch-isnt-controversial-it-sounds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promising the exact opposite would happen</a>, switching to a free-to-play model (and gating the more sought-after skins behind expensive paywalls), and removing a player from every match.&nbsp;</p><p>When I use the term “indecisiveness” to describe the history of <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s development, Keller doesn’t balk. “I think that's a really fair criticism of the game, especially in previous years,” he says. “Players want to see a cohesive vision for what the game is supposed to be. And I think that’s a lot better this year…boy, I do not want to be the person to put words in players’ mouths, right? But I do feel like they respond a lot when you take big risks with a product, or put big, new pieces of content into a game… That’s something they like to see—as long as it works out right?” He laughs.</p><p>Those big risks were first introduced earlier this year, <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/overwatch-2-season-15-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not long after an <em>Overwatch 2</em> event</a> where the team revealed a set of wild (and some might say game-breaking) changes. The biggest change came in the form of <a href="https://aftermath.site/overwatch-2-perks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">perks</a>, which introduced a level of customization to <em>Overwatch</em>’s roster of heroes and their locked ability kits. Rather than pre-building your hero of choice before a match, playing through a game earns you minor and major perks, which you choose on the fly.&nbsp;</p><p>When coupled with <a href="https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki/Stadium" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stadium</a>, a best-of-five game mode with an MMO-style armory system that lets players power up a select group of heroes with even more absurd perks, <em>Overwatch</em> <em>2</em> began tailoring its experience to players who like to show off their skills, whether that’s experimenting with hero builds, perfecting certain heroes (as swapping characters mid-match loses your progress towards unlocking a perk), or thinking on the fly.&nbsp;</p><p>Keller describes the team’s shift away from PvE modes as a “realignment process” based on feedback and internal monitoring of player behavior. When I ask if there’s a specific moment that incited this shift, Dawson points to <a href="https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki/Junkenstein%27s_Laboratory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Junkenstein’s Lab</a>. The limited-time Halloween game mode, which introduced “mutations” that affected individual heroes or the entire team, is the precursor to perks.</p><p>“As we developed perks, there was some trepidation—we’re changing the core gameplay of <em>Overwatch</em>, that’s super scary, right?” Dawson says. “There’s a lot of weight there. But as we saw the game start to develop, we saw Junkenstein’s Lab and how the community responded to these wacky changes—it was one of our most successful events we’ve ever done—we thought ‘oh, maybe we should really lean into some of this.’”&nbsp;</p><p><em>Overwatch</em> fans were, by and large, wholly unimpressed and immensely frustrated by the rollout of the sequel and its subsequent updates, and at a certain point, the team started listening to a specific group of fans above all else: competitive PvP players.&nbsp;</p><p>In the last six months, we’ve gotten an <em>Overwatch</em> unconcerned with lore codexes and horde-style story missions; once focused instead on sweaty grinders and semi-frustrated casuals who want to use perks to climb competitive ranks or experiment with well-known characters (though Keller and Dawson point out that Stadium is getting a more casual quick play mode to try to make it more approachable).&nbsp;</p><p>This also isn’t an <em>Overwatch</em> struggling to make every potential player happy with half-measures and wonky roll-outs.&nbsp;</p><p>“What is it that our active players are just not playing every day, and what is it that they’re asking for in the game?” Keller says. “We did have this moment where we had to shift the direction for a pretty large part of the team to be really about doubling down on this PvP, competitive hero shooter.”</p><p>When discussing changes to core gameplay and new content additions in the years since launch, Dawson says that the team was too conservative. Keller agrees.&nbsp;</p><p>“That’s a really valid critique you could leverage at <em>Overwatch</em> and the way we developed some of our features in the past,” he says. “And it’s something we’ve let go of. We are trying to take bigger swings, bigger risks, and bring more change to the game faster than we did in the past…that was one of our big takeaways going forward.”&nbsp;</p><p>I ask if there’s a proper way to do these kinds of games: free-to-play, live-service titles that need to somehow generate revenue over years (which usually requires a new product) and draw in new players without alienating a base. Keller won’t speak broadly, but will speak about his own live-service ethos.&nbsp;</p><p>“A lot of people play these types of games as their main hobby or a lifestyle, this isn’t just about ‘can I have fun tonight?’ It’s about giving them the confidence that the time they’re investing is going to pay off, not just over the course of the next month, but maybe the next year,” he says.&nbsp;</p><p>Keller and Dawson both tell me there’s more on the horizon: Not just the slew of new perks and a new support hero coming with Season 18 on August 26, but “bigger things” beyond that. Whether this relatively newfound commitment to competitive PvP gameplay will help recover&nbsp; <em>Overwatch</em>’s lapsed playerbase, or appeal to an entirely new crowd, remains to be seen. But despite the rocky journey to this point, <em>Overwatch</em>’s developers are feeling good.&nbsp;</p><p>“<em>Overwatch </em>is in the best place it’s ever been,” Keller says.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-silksong-gta-vi-elder-scrolls-vi"><h3>What’s Going To Be The Next Silksong?</h3></a><p>"Given that Silksong is real and about to come out, what other super long-awaited games are left?"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/video-game-trailer-capture-director-maker"><h3>A ‘Game Capture Director’ Is The Person Who Gets The Gameplay Footage For A Video Game Trailer</h3></a><p>'The coolest thing I’ve ever done is probably put references to both Jaws and Pac-Mac in a single trailer'</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/overwatch-2-interview-pvp]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>On Sunday, a cameraman inexplicably walked onto the court during a <a href="https://kotaku.com/us-open-tennis-champion-does-video-game-celebration-aft-1847662401">US Open</a> first-round match between tennis pros Daniil Medvedev and Benjamin Bonzi. This led to the judge giving Bonzi a new serve, angering Medvedev and leading to a six-minute delay after he rallied the crowd to boo and yell at his opponent and the decision.</p> <p>On August 24 in New York City’s Louis Armstrong Stadium, Russian player Daniil Medvedev, who won the US Open in 2021, was losing his match against French player Benjamin Bonzi. When Bonzi went to complete his second serve, a cameraman walked onto the court. This forced the match umpire, Greg Allensworth, to stop play and demand that the man leave the court. The umpire then awarded Bonzi a new first serve, <a href="https://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/46068258/bonzi-survives-medvedev-late-surge-chaotic-us-open-match">which <em>ESPN</em> reports</a> is common in professional tennis when situations like this occur. However, Medvedev wasn’t happy about the call and stormed up to Allensworth while yelling at the umpire.</p> <p>“Are you a man? Are you a man? Why are you shaking?” is what Medvedev reportedly shouted at Allensworth. “He wants to go home, guys, he doesn’t like it here. He gets paid by the match, not by the hour.”</p>

 <p>He then referenced another player who <a href="https://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/43733166/reilly-opelka-calls-umpire-suspended-penalty">was fined earlier this year</a> after calling Allensworth the “worst ump on tour,” shouting to the crowd, “What did Reilly Opelka say!?” multiple times and motioning with his arms for the audience to join in on his yelling. And they did exactly that.</p> <p>The US Open crowd jeered, booed, yelled, and chanted, delaying the match for nearly six minutes as Bonzi was unable to serve due to all the screaming and taunting. At multiple points during the yelling, you can see Medvedev cheer on the crowd, though eventually even he started asking them to quiet down. Meanwhile, during all of this, umpire Allensworth begged the crowd to quiet down, but it didn’t work. Eventually, the audience quieted down enough that Bonzi could serve. When the ball crashed into the net, the audience got even louder.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Daniil Medvedev ignites crowd after a photographer walked on the court at match point | 2025 US Open" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oXmpP1kLyxQ?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>While Medvedev rallied after the delay and Bonzi’s failed serve, he would ultimately lose the match to the French player and get knocked out of the US Open.</p> <p>“For me, it’s like my best victory ever,” said Bonzi afterwards, according to <a href="https://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/46068258/bonzi-survives-medvedev-late-surge-chaotic-us-open-match"><em>ESPN</em></a>. He also directly blamed Medvedev for the extended delay and crowd yelling at him, saying that after the crowd reacted poorly to the umpire’s call, “he put oil on the fire.”</p> <div data-testid="paragraph-15"> <p>“It was crazy. I may have got some new fans, but also some new non-fans,”&nbsp; <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sports/tennis/media-mishap-sparks-medvedev-meltdown-russian-exits-us-open-2025-08-25/">said Bonzi, according to the <em>AP</em></a>. “The energy was crazy. Thanks to all who were booing. Thanks for the energy. I’ve never experienced something like that. We waited maybe five minutes before the match point, and it was crazy. There was so much noise.”</p> <p>After losing the first round match, Medvedev—who told reporters later that he didn’t agree with the ump that the cameraman interfered long enough to warrant a new first serve—sat on the side of the court for a few minutes before grabbing a tennis racket and smashing it in anger in front of the remaining audience.</p> </div> <figure id="attachment_2000620047" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000620047"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000620047">©ESPN / US OPEN / Kotaku</figcaption></figure>

                <p>In 2024, Sony <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-shuts-down-concord-permanently-shutters-dev-firewalk-studios/1100-6527460/" data-ref-id="1100-6527460">shut down its live-service shooter Concord after only two weeks</a>, as it became one the publisher's most prominent failures. According to Sony Interactive Entertainment chief executive of studio business Hermen Hulst, the biggest lesson from Concord was that more oversight is needed during the development process.</p><p>"We have since put in place much more rigorous and more frequent testing in very many different ways," Hulst told <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d5859ffc-c4d7-4480-98a6-c1cff07af299" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Financial Times</a>. "The advantage of every failure ... is that people now understand how necessary that [oversight] is."</p><p>Hulst went on to explain that he wants Sony's PlayStation studios to make big swings when conceiving future franchises. However, he would also like to catch the failures before they launch.</p><p>"I don't want teams to always play it safe," noted Hulst. "But I would like for us, when we fail, to fail early and cheaply."</p><p>Following Concord's demise, Sony subsequently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-re-commits-to-live-service-games-says-bungies-marathon-wont-suffer-concords-fate/1100-6532419/" data-ref-id="1100-6532419">re-committed to live-service titles</a>. Regarding future titles in that genre, Hulst downplayed the importance of how many live-service games are available and said, "What is important to me is having a diverse set of player experiences and a set of communities."</p><p>One of Sony's next live-service launches is slated to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marathon/" data-ref-id="5000-589442">Marathon</a>, the new game by Bungie. That title has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/give-marathon-a-chance-former-concord-developer-says/1100-6530862/" data-ref-id="1100-6530862">already drawn unfavorable comparisons to Concord</a>, and it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-delayed-with-no-new-date-announced/1100-6532505/" data-ref-id="1100-6532505">was delayed indefinitely in June</a>. Since then, reports have emerged that Bungie is losing its independence to PlayStation Studios. Last week, Bungie's longtime boss <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/longtime-bungie-boss-pete-parsons-announces-departure-after-two-decades/1100-6534197/" data-ref-id="1100-6534197">Pete Parsons announced his departure</a> from the company after two decades.</p><p>Marathon is expected <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-exec-expects-marathon-to-launch-by-march-31-says-bungies-independence-is-getting-lighter/1100-6533759/" data-ref-id="1100-6533759">to be released before the end of Sony's fiscal year</a>, which runs through March 31, 2026.</p>

<p>The executive went on to say that if any players are struggling, they can "just grind somewhere" and level up their character to become more powerful to help them get past where they are stuck.</p><p>"You will find that things that were hard when you were a little chump will become trivial when you become a badass," Pitchford said. "But we definitely have pushed the challenges quite a lot, especially with bosses and boss fight mechanics."</p><p>Borderlands 4 launches on September 12 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. It comes to Switch 2 on October 3. In other news, Pitchford has said he expects the game to succeed and push the entire Borderlands franchise <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-will-push-franchise-beyond-100-million-sales-gearbox-ceo-says/1100-6534199/" data-ref-id="1100-6534199">above 100 million units.</a></p><p>"We went from an industry that predicted that we would die--that Borderlands would find no audience--to being one of the leading video game franchises in the world. And it's kind of humbling, frankly, to be a part of it," Pitchford told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/borderlands/gearbox-boss-randy-pitchford-says-the-game-industry-once-expected-a-genre-experiment-like-borderlands-to-die-but-it-actually-became-one-of-the-leading-video-game-franchises-in-the-world-its-kind-of-humbling/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar.</a></p><p>A major point of online discussion about Borderlands 4 has been its price--which is $70. Pitchford said the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-would-still-be-worth-it-at-5x-the-price-gearbox-boss-says/1100-6534143/" data-ref-id="1100-6534143">delivers so much value that it would still be worth it if 2K charged $350.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>After playing John Carpenter’s Toxic Commando, I was left doubting my knowledge of the legendary filmmaker’s back catalogue. Was there a zombie-filled Toxic Commando from the mid-80s that he had created? Was this zombie shooter from Saber a licensed reimagining or spiritual sequel? Well, no. While this game is inspired by the tone of some of John Carpenter’s filmography, and a title that’s probably reminding me of Toxic Avenger, this is an original creation. John does love blowing up zombies, though… so it’s a good thing that he’ll get to do just that while playing the game branded with his own name!</p>
<p><iframe title="John Carpenter's Toxic Commando - Gameplay Trailer | Opening Night Live 2025 | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TvdY54M0x5A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The world has been consumed by an outbreak of zombie with glowing eyes, and some chap named Leon is trying to fight back against this. The only problem is he needs some supplies and he can’t get them himself, so why not cook up a way that people on the brink of infection themselves can head out and do this for him? Just slap some glowy blue things on their chest to stall the infection’s progression, and they’ll be good to go!</p>


<p>Of course, we know what a Saber Interactive zombie game entails, and that’s some giant hordes of zombies, but the most tangible difference between <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/09/27/world-war-z-aftermath-review-wwz-ps5-xbox-series-x/">World War Z</a> and Toxic Commando is that you’re presented with more open mission areas, instead of linear levels.</p>
<p>After selecting from a handful of classes and character builds, loadouts and all the usual co-op shooter things, we dropped into an overcast, heavily wooded region to do a bit of Leon’s bidding. The first job was finding and neutralising two hotspots marked on the map, and there’s plenty of options available for you to do so. You can naturally just hoof it on foot, but vehicles are also a great option, whether that’s a basic sedan with half the squad hanging out of its windows blasting away at zombies, or a heavily armoured hummer with a mounted machine gun on top to use.</p>


<p>It feels like a little bit of MudRunner and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/26/roadcraft-review/">RoadCraft</a> has been fed into the game here, albeit in a light and friendly fashion. The hummer is relatively slow, but weaving through the world’s dangers has a slow and methodical feel to it. You also have a tow cable that can be attached to certain fixed points to pull the car up, or to pull open hidden resource caches.</p>
<p>There’s more than just basic zombies to worry about, though they do pack a decent punch when a few of them manage to close the distance to you. A handful of special infected can make an appearance, including some familiar archetypes, but there’s also these mysterious red tendrils that burrow through the earth, block of some paths as they sprout, and can also shoot at you if given the chance.</p>
<p>Reaching a hot spot means fighting to clear the region and completing a mini objective. This could be filling up a generator with gas to activate some kind of gizmo, or blasting away at weak points on some kind of hard shell, eventually revealing a spiky node that you need to approach and rip apart.</p>

<p>With the nodes broken, our search was narrowed to a church in the region, St Goddard’s, but it’s clearly massively in distress as a huge horde of zombies is coming right down on it. Thankfully a massive energy blast is able to buy its defenders some time, but then you have to place defences, man turrets and tackle a fresh wave of zombies coming from all directions.</p>
<p>This is where the World War Z of it all really comes to the fore. You have just a handful of Spare Parts resource points to put towards defences, though you can find more by exploring the map more fully and finding secret caches. At the same time, there’s resource points dotted around that let you spend this same precious resource to open up some class-specific crates or get you new weapons.</p>

<p>It’s four player co-op, so it absolutely makes sense that there’s four classes, loosely in the vein of a Battlefield. The Medic is pretty self explanatory, while the Operator is great for fixing up things, Strike all about damage dealing, and the Defender is able to put down shields for allies. We didn’t really delve too deeply into these archetypes in the single level we played, but there will be the ability to advance and upgrade each of these, alongside weapons and customisable vehicles, to push down different player builds.</p>
<p>Back to the task at hand and the waves come en masse from three directions, one at a time. Instead of arming electric traps and putting up barriers, I’ve gone further ahead to hop onto a mounted machine gun, splitting my attention between blasting away at the ridge line and checking other flanks for any sneaky surprises that the game might be trying to spring on us – and there were a few! It’s still genuinely impressive to see the vast hordes of zombies just flowing over a cliff, down a hill, pilling up and over a fence and then rushing forward, and it’s obvious why this has become a staple of Saber’s games over the past few years –&nbsp;this and trucks with tow cables!</p>

<p>This game is clearly another love letter to the co-op zombie shooter, taking Saber’s established technologies and wrapping it up in a new setting that’s infused with grungey 80s action movie schlock. You get to blast tons of zombies, though, and that’s probably just what John Carpenter ordered.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Roadwarden Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158246/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>Cast your minds back, if you're still able, to the year of our lord 2022 and the release of Moral Anxiety Studio's <em>tremendous</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/roadwarden">Roadwarden</a>. Yes, you know the one, that PC game you may not have played but certainly heard plenty about, as it garnered a whole bunch of Very Nice Reviews™.</p>
<p>And here, to be blunt, is another for the pile. What's the point in mincing words? Who has time in this economy? Roadwarden is a special game, you see, one of those that stays with you long after the fact of having played it. It's been compared, and rightly so, to the likes of the also-rather-good <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/disco_elysium_the_final_cut">Disco Elysium</a>, in how it creates an unflinching world that's absolutely dripping in atmosphere and tiny details, a world that's stuffed to the gills with meaningful encounters, fascinating conversations and choices that embed you in it all. Right up to your eyeballs, my friends.</p>
<figure><a title="Roadwarden Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158242/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Telling the tale of a roadwarden — that's the name given to hardy folk who establish new routes through dangerous territory — the game sets you the task of investigating the disappearance of your predecessor, whilst also engaging in quests and missions for local folk. You arrive at your destination as the game begins, and set out into an uncharted, and apparently quite monster-riddled, peninsula. And, before you can catch a breath, you'll have overburdened yourself with favours for locals and errands you don't have time for, if you're anything like me.</p>
<p>It's a narrative setup that hooks you immediately, partly because the setting and story are atmospheric and engaging to begin with, but chiefly because the writing here is top-drawer stuff. You begin to see how the comparisons to Disco Elysium are so easy to make; it has that level of quality in its conversations and the situations and predicaments in which it places you.</p>
<p>Now, just because I said 'Disco Elysium' a bunch of times, don't go expecting some detective noir thing either. This is much more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/witcher_3_wild_hunt_-_complete_edition">The Witcher</a> in its setting and tone. Indeed, in my silly old brain, I am playing a sort of Witcher character in my runthrough. You know the type: gruff, quietly brave, intensely handsome...that sort of thing. Very tight pants.</p>

<p>Of course, as an RPG of the text-based variety, Roadwarden is much more heavy on the old reading and not so much on the intense action, so it's a good thing the writing is so strong across the board. In fact, the story here, with much less interactivity, would have suited me fine. However! Moral Anxiety Studio has gone much further. You've got big decisions to make and tight time restrictions. It's stressful being a roadwarden.</p>
<p>On the default difficulty setting, you've got 40 days to solve the core mystery and...well...sort of organically be yourself and see what happens. Seriously. There's no wrong way to do this one. Pick what's important to you and work towards it. There's also a casual mode that removes the day counter, as well as a harder mode for returning players.</p>
<p>There's more interactivity than you may expect kicking things off in Roadwarden, too, with a choice of classes for your character, each one presenting you with different abilities and conversational choices, so there's a ton of replayability built in for folk who gel with what's here. I've gone with a mage for my review run, but there's also a fighter and a scholar in there, so you can imagine on a basic level how each of these may differ.</p>

<p>You also need to consider your health. You have little potions to top up alongside whatever rations you can buy or scavenge, and you'll want to manage rest, maintain your appearance (or people will be rude), and make sure your armour and weaponry are good and ready for any dice-based scraps you encounter whilst picking your way through towns and villages, open countryside and dark forests that feel as alive and full of life as any great big AAA game you may have played this year.</p>
<p>I'm at great pains not to spoil anything of the narrative beyond the fact you are a roadwarden jettisoned into a very engaging adventure, you may be able to tell, and my gosh, it's one that you could potentially play for a very long time. You could read guides and find out how to do everything the 'proper' way, or you could, as I recommend, just give yourself over to it. Don't drop it down to casual, accept the challenge of the 40-day time limit, and watch how it just comes alive. And it comes alive because it allows you to properly inhabit your character, to do as you please and set your own agenda - to a point.</p>
<figure><a title="Roadwarden Review - Screenshot 5 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158245/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>You've got so much choice in the storylines that you will, by design, have to sacrifice aspects of the character you wish to role-play. The game doesn't allow you, as so many others do, to paint any sort of complete picture on a singular run. With 40 days to achieve your goals, you need to prioritise the mapping out of this dangerous peninsula — that's the reason you're here after all — but there's also your predecessor's disappearance and, by the time you've visited the first town, a million other pressing issues besides.</p>
<p>'Pressing' in an engaging and intriguing way, mind. It's not Ubisoft stress we're talking about here; you're not sweating a missing scroll or collectible, you're sweating missing some entire other storyline, some other fascinating piece of lore, or a situation or encounter that changes things meaningfully.</p>
<p>You'll navigate towards the things you naturally find most intriguing, and this is the real beauty of Roadwarden, and what makes it so special. You'll want to play it. You want to return to it, to find out more, to reveal further. Battles, when they happen, bring your chosen class skills to the fore, and of course dice rolls come into play as well. It all makes for a narrative adventure that feels like a proper, full-blooded RPG adventure. I'm doing rather well at not spoiling anything here, I reckon. Heck, you even get to freely add text in some investigative instances - it really does let you muck about more than you expect, and the result feels gloriously malleable.</p>

<p>I also love the spartan aspect to the pixel illustrations illuminating us along the way. As you reach new locations, the game presents a visual of the room or road or wherever it is that you find yourself. However, these images only give you a glimpse, a guide, to how things are. They aren't populated, there's no real detail, and so you get a sort of atmospheric baseplate — a little nudge in the right direction tonally — upon which you can then paint freely.</p>
<p>With regards to negatives, I only have one bone to pick, and it's that the UI on Switch is a little funky and slow to use. You need to have patience with it at first. As you play, you'll need to choose responses, use your world map to travel to locations, as well as check your health, stats, use your inventory, and so on. Using the Joy-Con, it all feels a bit too unresponsive for me. Not broken or anything like that, just slow. There are touchscreen controls, mercifully, and these work better. However, they still feel a bit more sluggish than they should. It also takes quite a while for the game to load initially, so perhaps there's a little struggling going on somewhere behind the scenes on Switch 1.</p>
<figure><a title="Roadwarden Review - Screenshot 7 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158243/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Regardless of this issue, though, I feel like Roadwarden is still one of the easiest recommendations I've had to make in ages. It's available for just slightly more than the cost of your lunch (if you eat the same sandwich meal deal as me), and it genuinely delivers in spades the sort of quality that will 100% keep you coming back to try new things, visit new places, and investigate different conversations more deeply.</p>
<p>If you're in line for a deep and addictive text-based RPG adventure, one that's full of great writing, lots of secrets, impactful choices, and fascinating scenarios, step right this way. Just watch out for bandits! And for goodness' sake, wash your face and have a nap.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Roadwarden is a fascinating text-based RPG that delivers top-notch writing, meaningful and impactful choices, and way more interactivity than you may be expecting from a game of this type. Managing your time, health, armour, and more as you explore and map out a dangerous peninsula gives you plenty to consider as you pick and choose the narrative threads and situations that concern you most.</p>
<p>Almost impossible to put down, and definitely something I'll play more than once, this is a genre highlight on Switch that's only slightly let down by a bit of clunkiness on the UI front.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>At Gamescom 2025, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-gamescom-2025-qa-we-just-need-to-keep-working-and-solve-the-problems-we-have-one-of-the-best-survival-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed</a> Dune Awakening Game Director Joel Bylos to discuss the game's launch on PC and the upcoming updates planned for the survival sandbox MMO. Among the various topics, we also inquired about the status of the console versions, which have long been scheduled for release. According to Bylos, the game will debut next year on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series, with an internal estimate that it should take around a year.</p>



<p><em>We're working towards a launch on console sometime next year. We've just begun after launch, and started really digging into it. I've seen it running on a PlayStation 5, but there were a lot of texture issues, still a lot of work to do, and then we have to do all the different requirements for the different consoles and optimize the game shaders to work properly with the different console hardware, so there's work to do. We usually assume that it's going to take us about a year to get it up and running properly on a console. So yeah, sometime next year, now, probably we will have one launch at the same time as GTA VI laughs.</em></p>



<p>If so, Dune Awakening could be available on those platforms sometime in the Summer of 2026. Funcom is still unclear whether it will be able to support cross-play, though it would like to:  </p>



<p><em>It's still on the conversations we're having with Microsoft and PlayStation to decide that, so we haven't actually made a decision, but from our technical standpoint, it's no problem for us because we run these servers and the games will connect to our service. So it's not a problem, but it depends on what the platform holders have to say; we need to have those conversations. We haven't had them yet.</em></p>



<p>It should be noted that Microsoft and Sony (PlayStation) haven't really had a problem with cross-play for at least a couple of years. Nowadays, it has become the standard for new online multiplayer games, so if that's the only obstacle, chances are Dune Awakening players will indeed be able to play in the same version of Arrakis.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metal-gear-solid-3-remake-has-some-weird-shortcomings-on-console.1280001/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em> overhauls the storied PS2 game with modern visuals. <a href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-snake-eater-delta-remake-2000619269">It plays great on PC</a> but the console experience prior to launch is surprisingly bad. The Konami remake can’t hit a consistent 60fps on PlayStation 5 even in performance mode, and the PS5 Pro enhanced mode is especially disappointing. It might not be enough to ruin the experience but it raises concerns and has some wondering if Konami will be able to meaningfully optimize the console version with subsequent updates.</p> <p>Out August 26 for those who buy the Deluxe Edition, <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta</em> doesn’t really have a 60fps mode on PS5. Instead, it has a max target of 60fps, but spends much of the time dipping far below that. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am0ER7iW2lo">A Digital Foundry analysis</a> shows it consistently falling to around 45fps in denser jungle areas, or even lower when swimming underwater. Things are even worse on PS5 Pro, where the <em>Metal Gear Solid 3</em> remake dispenses with having alternate graphics modes and simply smooshes everything into a single performance boost. But in order to hit higher framerates it uses a lower, sub-1080p image resolution resolution to upscale. The results are pretty grimy.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">MAJOR WARNING If you’re planning on playing Metal Gear Solid Delta:</p> <p>The game runs terribly, with PS5/XSX rendering 720p-1080p at 30-50FPS in Performance mode</p> <p>The PS5 Pro somehow runs worse &amp; looks blurrier despite using PSSR</p> <p>Another disastrous Unreal Engine 5 release. <a href="https://t.co/Lnha48T2C6">pic.twitter.com/Lnha48T2C6</a></p> <p>— Synth Potato🥔 (@SynthPotato) <a href="https://twitter.com/SynthPotato/status/1958820771364532707?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Digital Foundry notes that quality mode on PS5 gets players better draw distances for textures and shadows, and improved global illumination for better complex lighting effects, which the jungle-based environment is full of. Unfortunately, despite hitting 30fps most of the time, the quality mode still occasionally buckles below that when blowing up barrels or during the busiest onscreen action sequences. Performance mode is even more inconsistent in terms of framerate, hitting 60fps fine in the starting area but sinking well below that at moments in larger environments. Overall it seems like nothing is quite as smooth as you’d hope or expect for what is essentially an Unreal Engine 5 makeover of an otherwise mostly unchanged PS2 game.</p> <h2><em>Metal Gear Solid 3</em> remake’s PS5 Pro mode is far from perfect</h2> <p>Then there’s the PS5 Pro’s mode which has its own issues. Namely, it’s upscaling from a lower resolution to hit a higher consistent 60fps, leading to even worse visual quality in the distance than on the base PS5’s performance mode. “It’s a win in motion for PS5 Pro with a smarter handling of occlusion artifacts and swaying grass,” Digital Foundry reports. “But if left to settle, the resolved reconstructed image on PS5 Pro seems to struggle to match the clarity of base PS5.” The enhanced mode gets even worse when you account for the PSSR-induced flickering and shimmering effects that PS5 Pro players may remember from <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake.</p> <p>There’s still time to address many of these apparent problems, especially the base PS5 shortcomings, in a day-one patch, though time is running out with the game’s early access launch less than 24 hours away. As for the PS5 Pro experience, well we’ll have to wait and see how that gets addressed in the future. None of the issues surfaced so far seem like deal breakers, but it does suggest anyone who has the option to play<em> Metal Gear Solid Delta</em> on a high-end PC instead should begin there.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has been out of nearly three months, and it’s been one of the fasted-selling consoles ever since it’s June 5 release. And while Nintendo has released games for it and some third party ports are coming, there is still an issue with other developers not being able to get their games onto the new platform due to a lack of dev kits.</p>



<p>In the latest episode of Digital Foundry’s Direct Weekly show, John Linneman&nbsp;and Oliver Mackenzie <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0SW7R5H5wY&amp;t=504s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">spoke about what talks were like</a> at Gamescom in Cologne. Part of those talks were about Nintendo not sending Switch 2 dev kits to a number of developers, including some AAA studios.</p>



<p><strong>“Nintendo seems to be almost discouraging Switch 2 development to some degree, where I’ve spoken with plenty of developers where they were either told that their game, they should just ship it on Switch 1 and rely on backwards compatibility,” </strong>Linneman said. <strong>“There’s a lot of developers that are unable to get Switch 2 dev kits. We talked to&nbsp;a lot&nbsp;of devs at Gamescom this year and so many of them said the same things. They want to ship on Switch 2. They would love to do Switch 2 versions. They can’t get the hardware. It’s really difficult right now.”</strong></p>



<p>From there, Mackenzie added that he had heard “through the grapevine” and from talking to others that there were “some weird exclusions with some big developers struggling to get kits for games.”</p>



<p><strong>“And there were some weird inclusions as well, like some indies were included which is nice to see,”</strong> Mackenzie said. <strong>“But like there’s that campfire game you know the kind of camera campfire game and they’re getting kits and some big developers on the other hand who developed like AAA stuff aren’t necessarily in the pipeline there for kits.”</strong></p>



<p>None of the studios who haven’t been able to get Switch 2 dev kits were mentioned, but they might be able to be guessed, especially if you want to dig into some larger studios without newer games announced for the platform. That said, fans will have to wait and see how third-party support grows on the console in the coming months and years.</p>



<p>What do you think of studios not being able to get Nintendo Switch 2 dev kits? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite Festival has revealed the featured artist for Season 10: Gorillaz. The rhythmic game mode, part of Fortnite’s game launcher, has been going strong since December 2023. Every season brings a new artist, like Billie Eilish, Sabrina Carpenter, and last season’s Bruno Mars. Now, we have confirmation on who is headlining it next with Gorillaz.</p>



<p>The London-based pop band has been going strong since 1998. With 12 Grammy nominations, including one win for Best Pop Collaboration, Gorillaz is no stranger to the limelight. It also helps that the band is fictional, having fake animated bandmates, adding notoriety to their name. They are a natural fit for Fortnite, but that’s not all that’s being added, come it’s rather soon release.</p>



<h2 id="h-gorillaz-headlines-season-10-of-fortnite-festival-starting-august-26th">Gorillaz Headlines Season 10 of Fortnite Festival Starting August 26th</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/gorillaz-enter-a-new-universe-as-fortnite-festival-season-10-icons?lang=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a blog post</a> from Fortnite/Epic Games, Season 10 of Fortnite Festival will launch tomorrow, August 26th. All four band members, Noodle, 2D, Russell, and Murdoc, will be available as Outfits. Noodle and 2D both come with their own Back Blings and weapons and are available until the end of Season 10. In addition, the iconic track “Clint Eastwood” will release onto the shop as a Jam Track. Of course, a new Main Stage has been added, now made to look straight out of a Gorillaz music video.</p>



<p>Patch notes for Fortnite Festival were also revealed in the post. The updates fix some UI issues, as well as sorting in the Main Stage Music Library. The full patch notes can be found below:</p>



<ul>
<li>Adding “Good” notes so that it’s clearer in the UI when you’re just short of “Perfect.” (Hitting a note slightly too early or slightly too late.)
<ul>
<li>You’ll have the option to disable the “Good” visual feedback in the settings.&nbsp;<strong>(Settings &gt; Game &gt; Festival)</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Adjusting the design of lift notes so that it’s easier to tell when to press and when to let go.
<ul>
<li>You’ll have the option to disable this new design (“Lift Notes Connectors”) in the settings.&nbsp;<strong>(Settings &gt; Game &gt; Festival)</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>In the Main Stage Music Library, you’ll be able to sort by&nbsp;<strong>Song Duration</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>Song Intensity</strong>.</li>



<li>You’ll be able to&nbsp;<strong>strum</strong>&nbsp;during the tune-up process, making it easier to test and calibrate your guitar controller.</li>
</ul>

Crueler still, that we should find out with such short notice that <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> will launch just one day after our planned release for <em>Demonschool</em>.</p><p>We have to remind ourselves that gaining visibility for <em>Demonschool</em> is our main goal. Thus, the Ysbryd team strongly believes we would not be doing our game any favors by wading into waters we can clearly see are blood red. If the September period is going to be <em>Silksong</em>‘s moment, then we need to be elsewhere on the calendar to give <em>Demonschool</em> its own moment to be seen and talked about meaningfully.</p><p>We don’t take this decision lightly. <em>Demonschool</em>‘s release has been delayed before, and we want to be clear: there are no more delays after this point. We’ve already distributed Steam keys to press as part of a healthy review program, and had every intention to proudly release on September 3. We hope fans who anticipated the game will forgive us for one final delay.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Between now and November, Necrosoft Games and ourselves will continue to pour our time into enhancing and polishing up the game experience. For example, there will be more endings and minigames that the developers originally planned to patch in post-release, rather than leave them on the cutting floor; now it’ll all be part of the game’s release in November.</p><p>Thank you for your patience and enthusiasm for <em>Demonschool</em>. We truly hope you continue to support Necrosoft Games’ labor of love by showing up for Faye and her madcap band of collegiate demon hunters on November 19!</p><p>—Brian Kwek, Ysbryd Games</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/demonschool-to-november-19]]></content:encoded>

                <p>One of the world's largest libraries will not consider Nintendo Switch 2 Game-Key Cards for preservation. Japan's National Diet Library, which contains over 9,600 video games in its archives, said that it won't recognize titles in the Game-Key Card format because the games' data are not located within the physical media itself.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202508/48598" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Famitsu</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-not-eligible-for-preservation-by-japans-national-diet-library-officials-say/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>), representatives from the National Diet Library said that since "a key card, on its own, does not qualify as content, it falls outside of [the library's] scope for collection and preservation."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Nintendo Switch 2 Console Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Game-Key Cards solely act as authentication keys, allowing the user to download the full game onto their console when inserted. The card must remain in the system in order to play the game, despite the game being installed, but the card can be shared or resold. Several third-party publishers utilize the medium for their Switch 2 releases, including Capcom, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-game-key-cards-are-digital-sales-according-to-capcom/1100-6532342/" data-ref-id="1100-6532342">considers its Game-Key Card titles as digital sales</a>.</p><p>Consumers, preservationists, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2s-game-key-cards-are-a-little-disheartening-for-game-preservation-says-dev/1100-6531262/" data-ref-id="1100-6531262">developers have raised concerns</a> about the format, as ownership of these games is dependent on internet connection and whether Nintendo's eShop and servers are functional. Those concerned cite Nintendo's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-3ds-and-wii-u-eshop-stores-will-shut-down-march-2023/1100-6500734/" data-ref-id="1100-6500734">closure of the Wii U and 3DS eShops in March 2023</a>, which rendered it impossible to purchase titles from those storefronts through any official means. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-wants-to-know-your-thoughts-on-its-divisive-game-key-cards/1100-6533657/" data-ref-id="1100-6533657">Nintendo released a survey this month</a> to its customers asking questions about their preferences for physical games.</p><p>The National Diet Library, comparable to the United States' Library of Congress, has been collecting physical video games since October 2000. The national library's collections, which include books, newspapers, music, maps, and other materials, comprise over 44 million items, making it the eighth-biggest library in the world.</p><p>It's worth noting that the National Diet Library also has an extensive collection of digital materials, including e-books and magazines, but the institution does not include any digital or online-only video games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The last Forza Horizon game, Forza Horizon 5, took drivers to Mexico, after <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forza-horizon-4-take-weather-with-you/">Forza Horizon 4</a> had them racing around the UK countryside. Playground Games and Microsoft have yet to officially say where Forza Horizon 6 will take players, but a deleted Instagram post, a new report, and Tokyo Game Show 2025 seem to have the answer.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forza-horizon-5-review/">Forza Horizon 5</a> launched back in 2021, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-motorsport-forza-horizon-5-continue-support/">despite layoffs in the last month</a>, we're closing in it being high time we heard what's next for the series. A now-deleted Instagram post from car importer Cult and Classic, featuring a Japanese Kei car being photographed for use in the next Forza Horizon game (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-setting-for-the-next-forza-horizon-game-has-seemingly-leaked-via-a-car-company/">VGC</a>), seemingly pointed to Forza Horizon 6 being set in Japan. Especially considering that Kei cars are a model of vehicle that is very rarely found outside of Japan, and is mostly manufactured in Japan.</p>



<p>Now, a report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/forza/report-forza-horizon-6-may-be-announced-this-year-in-the-same-place-the-game-is-set">Windows Central</a> adds that there are "<em>official</em>" documents being circulated that confirm the next entry in the Forza Horizon series will be announced at Tokyo Game Show 2025, which is due to <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-konami-square-enix-and-more-all-confirmed-to-attend-tokyo-game-show-2025/">take place at the end of September</a>. Insider-Gaming's <a href="https://x.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1959683880840999339">Tom Henderson</a> and insider <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1959666173936796128">Nate the Hate</a> both corroborate that they have seen the documents in question, with Nate the Hate adding that he's not seen evidence of a Nintendo Switch 2 version as part of the equation for Forza Horizon 6.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I can confirm that these documents have been floating around for the last week or so. There's one massively disgruntled employee at Xbox lol <a href="https://t.co/wLLoT1nVom">https://t.co/wLLoT1nVom</a></p>— Tom Henderson (@_Tom_Henderson_) <a href="https://twitter.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1959683880840999339?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 24, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>If Forza Horizon 6 is indeed set in Japan, then the Tokyo Game Show makes for the perfect stage on which to unveil the next entry in the series. Even more so when you consider the presence that PlayStation has over Xbox in Japan, and the extreme likelihood, if not surefire conclusion, that the next Forza Horizon game will arrive on PlayStation, if not at launch, then perhaps shortly after, <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-dominates-playstation-q2-top-10-chart-us/">thanks to the success that Forza Horizon 5 has found on the platform</a>.</p>



<p>We'll see what TGS 2025 has in store.</p>

<p>Resurgence may be getting a new map after Call of Duty: Black Ops 7’s release, one rumor claims. The eagerly anticipated next entry in the Call of Duty franchise has many excited, both for the campaign and multiplayer. However, it looks like Warzone fans may have something to look forward to come its November 14th, 2025 launch. </p>



<p>The Resurgence mode in Warzone has been around since Call of Duty Black Ops: Cold War back in 2020. It’s been present in both Warzone 1.0 and Warzone 2.0, as well as at launch for Warzone Mobile. The mode is a different take on the typical Battle Royale mode, with more players and heightened intensity plays. So, the rumored new map is sure to get some back into the Resurgence game.</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>In a tweet from credible Call of Duty leaker <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1960001313422659979">TheGhostofHope</a>, they state that they have learned a new Resurgence map is in the works. Furthermore, it appears to be an extended version of Liberty Falls. The map, which debuted in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 as a Zombies level, is a rather interesting choice. Still, given TheGhostofHope’s track record, like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-releases-november-14/">Black Ops 7’s release date</a>, there’s a strong chance we may hear about it soon. </p>



<p>Currently, the Multiplayer reveal for Black Ops 7 is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cod-next-announced-september-2025/">slated to happen</a> on September 30th, 2025. As the rumor ties to Season 1 of the upcoming shooter, it’s more than likely we’ll get confirmation there. Until then, fans can get into Resurgence in Warzone and practice before the new map comes along.</p>



<p>What do you think about Liberty Falls being the next Resurgence map in Warzone? Was there one you think deserved it more? Let us know in the comments and on the forums. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Amongst my many, many silly ideas, becoming a farmer has to rank pretty high amongst them. My long-suffering partner will roll their eyes out of their sockets when I talk about growing crops, herding the sheep in and working outside, not least because I have zero experience in this field. But not anymore! If Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar is anything to go by, I’ll be very good at being a farmer, not least because I’m willing to push myself to the point of exhaustion, I’ll work in torrential rain, and because a lot of your time seems to be spent chatting.</p>
<p><iframe title="STORY OF SEASONS: Grand Bazaar – Cozy Living Trailer – Nintendo Switch &amp; Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VEr-kUsGhiM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar is both thoroughly new, and thoroughly old, standing as a remake of Harvest Moon DS: Grand Bazaar, a Nintendo DS entry in the series from a time before you could pluck controllers off the side of your console. As all Story of Seasons/Harvest Moon games go, you’ve been given a farm, but it’s mostly full of weeds and rocks, rather than anything you would want to eat. It’s then up to you to tidy the place up, fill it with crops, nurture some of the cutest cows and chickens in gaming and, if you’re lucky, find a husband or wife to spend your farming days with.</p>


<p>In and of itself, that’s plenty of fun for the cosy gamer, but there’s still the Grand Bazaar part of the title to deal with. Your farm is part of a small town that’s a little down on its luck, with the blame firmly laid at the entrance of its failing weekly market. Alongside all the work you have to do for your farm and for your prospective love life, you’re also tasked with revitalising the Bazaar, running your own market stall each week, as well as trying to attract new merchants and entrepreneurs to fill out its empty plots.</p>


<p>If that all sounds like a lot, it is. Time runs especially fast in Grand Bazaar, with each day lasting around ten minutes. In that space of time you will find yourself running around town like a sickle-wielding maniac, desperately trying to talk to or greet every potential love interest, nurture your crops, cuddle your pets, milk the cows, groom the alpacas, shear the sheep, go mining, trim the weeds, collect some flowers, hand out gifts, craft items, go fishing, visit the shops, complete some side quests, and a bunch of other things, all while planning out what you have to do in the next day, or week, ready for the impending punctuation point of the weekly market. If you’re like me, that’s a heady and utterly engrossing mix of busy work, but there’s some clear repetition to those tasks that might not fit with other people.</p>
<p>The growth of your town eases some of that repetition, alongside the occasionally enlightening and often pointed conversations with the townsfolk, through to the semi-regular events that crop up, ranging from pet and crop shows to competitive showjumping events. Besides that, the focus of upgrading your tools, or setting yourself to a particular villager request, means that there are times where you have to step away from your usual routine, and these bring enough change to the formula to keep things interesting.</p>
<p>Your level of activity is limited by your stamina bar. Every major action, like tilling the fields, harvesting crops or mining, takes its toll on your body, and like a regular human being you’ll soon become tired. You can alleviate this by eating a meal, or taking a refreshing shower, but you always need to be aware of pushing yourself too far. Story of Seasons is relatively realistic in that sense, with overwork eventually causing you to collapse, or a late night then causing you to oversleep the next day. Broadly, there’s a lot to juggle each day, and the tight time and stamina constraints mean you can’t ever rest too easily.</p>

<p>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar is horribly addictive, once it’s sunk its crop-clearing sickle into you. I was supposed to play other games this last week, and instead I played Story of Seasons. I was supposed to go out, but instead I played Story of Seasons. Any number of things, including eating, were postponed because I was playing Story of Seasons. I’m not entirely sure it is actually a cosy game, given how far it sinks itself into your psyche and how much of it becomes about doing a job. I think it’s probably more of a farming sim than this year’s Farming Simulator, just with cute graphics, and I have been entirely won over by it.</p>
<p>Visually, it’s not pushing the Switch 2 all that far, but the bright, vibrant art design shines through, and the characters all look and feel like distinct people, aided by the additional artwork that can accompany each conversation. Oddly, you can make the frame rate stutter a tiny bit here and there, generally when you’re using your handy glider to get around, but it doesn’t affect gameplay at all, and one of the joys of the game becomes using the little cut-throughs or jumping across the roofs of houses on your way across town.</p>

<p>The only complaint with Grand Bazaar remains from the original version of the game, which is the annoyances of having three different windmills to craft items in, and having to run between the three of them as you attempt to craft the most lucrative items. Some of that has been lightened by the sprite boxes which let you transport yourself and items around the town, but it does feel like there might still be a better way to ease some of that busy work.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Music has a way of bringing people together. That’s literally the whole point of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a><span>, the anime-inspired musical phenomenon that is </span><a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/most-popular"><span>approaching the top of Netflix’s most-streamed movies of all time</span></a><span>. Its titular trio of demon-slaying songstresses are the latest in a long line of hunters masquerading as a pop act, using the power of their fans’ souls, ignited by their melodies, to push demons back to their hellish prison. A series of limited singalong screenings is both the natural conclusion to its entire thematic foundation, and a correction for the boneheaded business deals that sequestered a truly stunning animated musical to a streaming service.</span></p> <p><span>All that said, I was admittedly pretty underwhelmed with the showing I went to. I dragged my roommate and a visiting friend up from Brooklyn to the Alamo Drafthouse in Lower Manhattan dressed in Huntr/x t-shirts, with my friend having styled her hair to look like rapper Zoey’s signature buns in the film. We’d seen videos of the early screenings at Netflix’s theater in Los Angeles and heard a choir of fans, from adult cosplayers to young children, belting out every song, so we were prepared for a mini-concert to the backdrop of </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>’ stunning visuals. What we got was, well, not that.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000620030" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000620030"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000620030">© Photo by Kenneth Shepard</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The three of us were in the back row of one of Alamo’s smaller theaters as the host of the event tried her damndest to get the crowd more hyped, and Alamo should give that girl a raise for the work she was putting in. Despite the overwhelmingly adult crowd, the few kids were still the most excited to be there. It was pretty clear based on the adult to kid ratio that most of the crowd had not been dragged there by a child who had probably watched Huntr/x’s literal stan war on loop for the past two months, but even so, a lot of them were not playing into the show. They picked up their swag bag of ramen cups and photo cards of their bias, or favorite member of either Huntr/x or the Saja Boys, but the spirit of a singalong wasn’t flowing through the room. Maybe when the film actually started things would pick up? Nope.</span></p>

 <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGsevnbItdU"><span>“How It’s Done,”</span></a><span> the opening song in </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>,</span> <span>is exactly the song that would tell you if the a singalong audience understood the assignment. The fast-paced, rap-heavy tune is so full of swagger and attitude that anyone who was going to sing should have been singing the second Rumi came in with an exhausted sigh and said “you came at a bad time” while the distorted guitar played underneath her. Our fellow moviegoers, however, did not. As the girls started rapping, my friend and I noticed that we were pretty much the only ones singing above a whisper. Yeah, I belted out “fit check for my napalm era” at the top of my lungs to the ceiling through cupped hands, but it quickly became clear the audience we were with was not passing the vibe check.</span></p> <p><span>To view the situation charitably, it can be hard to get past the established social contract of a movie theater even when you’re told that you’re allowed to be rowdy. Most establishments play a whole video telling you to sit down, shut up, and turn your damn phone off before every movie they play. To Alamo’s credit, they had a video before the show that was like, “Turn the fuck up. Queen out. Power the Honmoon.” Well, if the world had been relying on the crowd in my theater, the demons would have overrun Manhattan by dinner time. Maybe if my friend and I had refused to be silenced by a bunch of quiet curmudgeons, a rising tide would have lifted all ships, but everyone else’s relative silence made it awkward. I’ve been to movie experiences like </span><i><span>Avengers: Endgame</span></i><span> where the crowd was absolutely losing their shit, and I guess we were just dealt a bad hand this time around.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000620031" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000620031"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000620031">© Netflix</figcaption></figure> <p><span>At a certain point, my friend and I were mostly just singing along softly in our seats. By the time the bubble-gum sweetness of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=983bBbJx0Mk">“Soda Pop”</a> began and no one was losing their shit about the demon boy band Saja Boys, it became clear to me and my friend that we were the only ones who were really buying into what we paid for, and everyone else was mostly just there to see the movie. This is valid because for most of us, this was the first time any of us had seen the film on the big screen. That’s still a mind-boggling shame.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Still, even with my lukewarm crowd, seeing the movie in a theater cemented how bonkers it is that Sony was so unsure about the movie–which has now become a cultural phenomenon and whose music has hit </span><a href="https://www.billboard.com/lists/huntrx-golden-kpop-demon-hunters-number-1-hot-100/"><span>#1 on the Billboard top 100</span></a><span>–that it partnered with Netflix, who shouldered much of the film’s budget for exclusive rights to distribute it. Sony </span><a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/1941507/sony-made-netflix-kpop-demon-hunters-earnings/"><span>ensured it would make a profit</span></a><span> on </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>through the deal, but lost out on what could have been an absolute cash cow for it down the line.</span></p> <p><span>Even after all the hype and the massive viewer numbers, the people behind the movie still seem to be underestimating it. The Alamo Drafthouses in New York City had four total singalong showings, two on Saturday, August 23, and two more on the following Sunday. Those predictably sold out within days, and by the time my group left our underwhelming screening, Alamo Drafthouse had added another half a dozen to the schedule.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p><span>Because the gremlin in my brain is still singing this movie’s soundtrack, I put my Alamo Drafthouse membership to good use and decided to use it to go see the movie again the following day for no additional cost. Worst case scenario, I get to see a movie I really love on the big screen again. Best case scenario, I find a crowd that will match my freak. I picked a showing with more seats, thus statistically more likely to have sickos, but while it was marginally better, I still felt like most of the audience wasn’t buying in, and I didn’t even have my friend with me this time as a buffer. I still yelled “fit check for my napalm era” and sang to myself in my seat, but with the exception of one young diva who not only sang every song but recited every line, it felt like the singalong event was mostly just another chance to see a movie the way it should have been seen in the first place. It’s a shame that I scroll through my feeds and see videos of the most hype crowds singing along at screenings elsewhere and get FOMO for an event I was literally in attendance for, but at least I got the transcendent experience of hearing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug_pv5-r1js">“What It Sounds Like”</a> booming through the Drafthouse’s sound system.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000620029" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000620029"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000620029">© Netflix</figcaption></figure> <p><span>There was a guy sitting next to me at the second showing who told his friends he’d only seen the first half of the movie in passing, so he braved a singalong event to see the movie for the first time on the big screen. As much as I enjoyed watching </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>on my laptop, I’m always going to envy his experience of seeing it for the first time in that environment. There’s an entire subplot in </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>about Rumi, the half human/half demon lead singer, being told by her caretaker Celine that she must cover up her demonic patterns and hide who she is from the world, and even her best friends. No one could possibly understand, Celine says, and it’s better to be safe than sorry. That same unsure reservation is why </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>’ victory lap of finally getting to be on the big screen is happening months after it’s already etched itself on our culture as much more than a limited-time event. Much like Celine herself, maybe some people at Sony should have had more faith in what they were making. And maybe by the time the eventual sequel comes out, New York City’s moviegoers will step the fuck up and sing along next time.</span></p>
