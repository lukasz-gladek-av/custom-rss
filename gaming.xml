			<p>A new Frame Generation mod for Fallout 4 was released yesterday <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/98208" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Nexus Mods</a>. As you probably remember, modder PureDark released Frame Generation mods for Bethesda's open world RPG, first <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-4-dlss-3-mod-60fps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for NVIDIA DLSS</a> and then for AMD FSR, over two years ago. However, PureDark's mods are still locked behind the paywall of having to be a Patreon subscriber of his.</p>



<p>This mod, on the other hand, is completely free of charge. Created by doodlum, the main coder behind The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim's Community Shaders graphics enhancement suite, it is the modder's second submission after <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-gets-perfect-skies-graphics-mod-long-15-quest-mod-due-december-12/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Perfect Skies for Fallout: New Vegas</a> for the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout-modathon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout 2025 Modathon</a>, a Nexus Mods competition among modders that started on October 23 (Fallout Day) and ends on December 31, 2025.</p>



<p>Doodlum's Fallout 4 Frame Generation mod is powered by AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 3 technology, more specifically through the <a href="https://gpuopen.com/amd-fidelityfx-sdk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publicly available</a> AMD FidelityFX SDK GPUOpen API, and thus uses a DLL signed by AMD. It works through a custom-made DirectX 12 swap chain proxy and is compatible with any DirectX 12-capable graphics card, which is not surprising given that it relies on AMD FSR 3.</p>



<p>The modder says Frame Generation can smooth performance in the most demanding scenarios, such as in cities. Moreover, mods like the popular Sim Settlements 2 can further increase the CPU load, making Frame Generation even more important. You can view a brief video comparison between Fallout 4 vanilla and with this mod installed below.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>By default, the mod only enables itself when detecting monitors with a refresh rate of at least 120Hz; however, users can force it to be enabled in the .ini file.</p>



<p>The mod requires Address Library for F4SE Plugins and High FPS Physics Fix, and also for you to set Fallout 4 to Borderless or Windowed mode in the game's launcher. It is compatible with ENB and also with PureDark's free <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/68586" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout 4 upscaler mod</a>, provided you set the latter to DLAA or native AA. It does not, however, work with the VR version of the game, though that's not an issue since VR's spacewarp already provides a similar and more effective frame generation technique.</p>



<p>Fallout 4 just celebrated its tenth anniversary <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fallout-4-review-a-welcoming-wasteland/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">since its original launch</a> with the release of a new Anniversary Edition (which broke a lot of mods, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-4-anniversary-edition-broke-your-mods-heres-how-to-revert/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prompting some users to revert to the previous version</a>). In other Fallout news, rumors <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-remastered-reportedly-in-the-works-fallout-3-remastered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggest</a> both a Fallout 3 and a Fallout: New Vegas remaster are in the works at Bethesda.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Use these Spin A Brainrot monthly redeem codes for November 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including a variety of Dice and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spin A Brainrot isn’t all that different from all the other brainrot-related games that have been trending on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monsterverze-codes-november-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> over the last many months. With the younger generation consuming more and more brainrot content every day, the likelihood of every brainrot game that comes out gaining massive popularity is quite high.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Spin A Brainrot does have a few minor differences, though, as unlike the other games in the genre, it allows players to acquire brainrot characters by simply spinning a Dice. That’s easier said than done, however, as Dice spins don’t come cheap in this game. To make the grind a little bit smoother, players can make use of the following codes. These codes reward players with different kinds of Dice, making it easier to acquire your favourite brainrot in no time. With items like potions and passive stat upgrades on offer as well, using these codes can help players get ahead of the competition.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Amazon's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">Black Friday deals</a> continue to drop early. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FH16KDQG,B0FH132GYR,B0FH16HB7V,B0FH1NBZKC&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Physical versions of EA Sports FC 26</a> are available at a nice discount after only having just launched a few months ago.

The Switch version is usually listed for $60, while the other three are typically $70. You'll notice that Xbox versions of the game are absent from this list, as they aren't included in the Black Friday sales for the time being. While annual sports games don't typically hold value long after release, a steep discount like this so soon after launch is a welcome deal. The discounts only apply to the standard editions of the game, but the upshot is these versions include the digital pre-order bonuses. The Switch 2 version is notably on a Game-Key Card, meaning none of the game data is on the physical cart, so you'll have to download it onto your console before you can play.</p><div title="EMBARGO Nov. 16 12AM PT: EA Sports FC 26 Black Friday" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4900" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="EMBARGO Nov. 16 12AM PT: EA Sports FC 26 Black Friday" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FH132GYR,B0FH16HB7V,B0FH16KDQG,B0FH1NBZKC&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FH132GYR,B0FH16HB7V,B0FH16KDQG,B0FH1NBZKC&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FH132GYR,B0FH16HB7V,B0FH16KDQG,B0FH1NBZKC&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">EA Sports FC 26 (PS5)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FH132GYR,B0FH16HB7V,B0FH16KDQG,B0FH1NBZKC&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FH132GYR,B0FH16HB7V,B0FH16KDQG,B0FH1NBZKC&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FH132GYR,B0FH16HB7V,B0FH16KDQG,B0FH1NBZKC&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">$35 (was $70)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The PS5 version of EA Sports FC 26 will definitely be the most stable in terms of performance -- It's able to run at a stable 60 frames per second in performance mode.

                <p>You can get Wuchang: Fallen Feathers Day One Edition for a small discount thanks to this early Black Friday deal at Amazon. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F6SRFLCF?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F6RSM3BB?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Series X</a> versions are both currently $40, saving you $10 off the game's original $50 price.

The Day One Edition bonuses are a nice inclusion to an already quality Soulslike experience. We scored the Soulslike action game an 8 in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wuchang-fallen-feathers-review-aint-nuthing-ta-pluck-with/1900-6418385/" data-ref-id="1900-6418385">our review</a> back when it released this past July. The game offers numerous customization options and multiple ways to engage in combat. Unlike other Soulslikes, dying plays a crucial role in both the mechanics and narrative in Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, thanks to the Madness mechanic. You gain Madness by killing enemies or dying, and unlock different abilities the more you have. So instead of just setting you back and dropping some currency after you die, slowly build up Madness. At 100% Madness, you deal more damage--but take more damage, too--and if you die in this state, you'll be reset. It's a high-risk, high-reward system that sets it apart from other Soulslikes.</p><hr><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/meta-quest-3s-vr-headset-best-black-friday-deals/1100-6532962/">Meta Quest 3S Batman Bundle Is $70 Off, Comes With $50 Amazon Gift Card</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-gamecube-third-party-controller-switch-2-pc-amazon-holiday-deal/1100-6532458/">Grab A Wireless GameCube-Style Controller For Switch 1/2 &amp; PC For Only $40</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lunar-remastered-collection-amazon-exclusive-physical-edition-deal-switch-playstation-xbox/1100-6528818/">Amazon-Exclusive Lunar Remastered Collection Gets First Price Cut</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-set-deals-restock-preorder-buying-guide/2900-6271/">Final Fantasy Magic: The Gathering Booster Box Restocked With Huge Discount At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-hunger-games-sunrising-on-the-reaping-gift-edition-book-box-set-deals/1100-6535218/">Sunrise On The Reaping New Collector's Gift Edition Is Already Discounted At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-dc-batman-construction-figure-and-bat-pod-bike-the-dark-knight-amazon-deal/1100-6535073/">Lego DC Batman Figure &amp; Bat-Pod Is Over 50% Off At Amazon, Sold Out Everywhere Else</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/honkai-star-rail-8bitdo-ultimate-2-wireless-controller-collector-bundle-amazon-deal/1100-6534680/">Honkai: Star Rail 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Collector's Bundle Gets First Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-xbox-elite-series-2-wireless-controller-deal-holiday-2025/1100-6535861/">Xbox Elite Series 2 Deal: Save $60 On Microsoft's Premium Wireless Controller</a></li>   </ul> </div>

They're the perfect opportunity for fans of the originals to revisit their old favorites with modern design sensibilities or quality-of-life features, and they aim to introduce new audiences to games that pioneered genres and gave rise to iconic characters. These Tomb Raider remasters achieve exactly that, offering the first six titles in the series. The Tomb Raider franchise jump-started the action platformer genre and inspired games like Naughty Dog's Uncharted games. They all come with updated visuals and performance enhancements in addition to their mechanical improvements.</p><p>For physical game collectors, both of these Deluxe Editions are beautifully packaged, and despite their oversized nature, they don't take up too much space. The height and width of the boxes are slightly larger than regular game cases, so they should fit on your game shelf just fine. The glossy gold and brown colors really help the boxes pop, and at this price, they are great premium items for any fan of the series.</p><hr><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/meta-quest-3s-vr-headset-best-black-friday-deals/1100-6532962/">Meta Quest 3S Batman Bundle Is $70 Off, Comes With $50 Amazon Gift Card</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-gamecube-third-party-controller-switch-2-pc-amazon-holiday-deal/1100-6532458/">Grab A Wireless GameCube-Style Controller For Switch 1/2 &amp; PC For Only $40</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lunar-remastered-collection-amazon-exclusive-physical-edition-deal-switch-playstation-xbox/1100-6528818/">Amazon-Exclusive Lunar Remastered Collection Gets First Price Cut</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-set-deals-restock-preorder-buying-guide/2900-6271/">Final Fantasy Magic: The Gathering Booster Box Restocked With Huge Discount At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-hunger-games-sunrising-on-the-reaping-gift-edition-book-box-set-deals/1100-6535218/">Sunrise On The Reaping New Collector's Gift Edition Is Already Discounted At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-dc-batman-construction-figure-and-bat-pod-bike-the-dark-knight-amazon-deal/1100-6535073/">Lego DC Batman Figure &amp; Bat-Pod Is Over 50% Off At Amazon, Sold Out Everywhere Else</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/honkai-star-rail-8bitdo-ultimate-2-wireless-controller-collector-bundle-amazon-deal/1100-6534680/">Honkai: Star Rail 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Collector's Bundle Gets First Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-xbox-elite-series-2-wireless-controller-deal-holiday-2025/1100-6535861/">Xbox Elite Series 2 Deal: Save $60 On Microsoft's Premium Wireless Controller</a></li>   </ul> </div>

<p>While the announcement already had many cowboys jumping for joy, in case you missed it, Rockstar Games has also confirmed this will be a completely free upgrade for existing owners. This applies to current owners of Red Dead Redemption on the Switch and existing PlayStation and Xbox owners.</p><div><figure data-videoid="nO48QYAS9Kg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nO48QYAS9Kg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytnO48QYAS9Kg" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nO48QYAS9Kg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nO48QYAS9Kg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed362f9fkjozvs&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>You'll even be able to pick up where you left off. Here are the full details about this from <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/258282o585k1ka/red-dead-redemption-coming-to-netflix-ios-android-ps5-xbox-series-and">Rockstar's official announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Current owners on PS4, Nintendo Switch, or the digital backward compatible version on Xbox One will be able to upgrade digitally for free. Anyone who owns the PS4 version can utilize previous PS4 save data to pick up where they left off, and Switch 2 players can continue with their previous save data from the previous Nintendo Switch console."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, if you already have the Switch release, you can update your copy when this upgrade rolls out on <strong>2</strong><strong>nd December 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 version will come packed with the "complete single-player experiences of both games, and also include bonus content from the Game of the Year Edition". Additionally, it features support for DLSS, HDR, mouse controls, and "the same fluid 60 frames per second gameplay at high resolution".</p>
<p>In some other news, the rumour about <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/red_dead_redemption_2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a></strong> potentially coming to the Switch 2 has also resurfaced this week following the latest announcement – with the same podcaster and YouTuber 'NateTheHate' <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/11/14/natethehate-reiterates-red-dead-redemption-2-switch-2-port-is-still-happening/">claiming it's still happening</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s the end of yet another week, and hopefully, you’re maintaining that NYT Connections streak. If you’re just starting out, I’m still here for you, providing the best NYT Connections hints you’ll find anywhere. Today’s puzzle is a trickier one in that respect, as very few of the words seem to relate to one another.</p>



<p>Regardless, I’ve got you covered with the NYT Connections solutions for today’s puzzle. Read on to learn what you need to know.</p>











<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-16">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 16)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #889:</p>



<ul>
<li>RUGBY SHIRT</li>



<li>PEDESTRIAN</li>



<li>APPROACH</li>



<li>AVENUE</li>



<li>BARCODE</li>



<li>EVERYDAY</li>



<li>SCHOOL</li>



<li>TAX</li>



<li>IBM LOGO</li>



<li>BANAL</li>



<li>RAILROAD</li>



<li>PHILOSOPHY</li>



<li>HUMDRUM</li>



<li>ZEBRA</li>



<li>METHOD</li>



<li>PARKING</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think about the way someone “goes about” something, not the thing itself.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>This set sits firmly in the realm of routine and low sparkle.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Don’t just look for animals—think design language and uniform aesthetics.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Zero in on square names, board events, and charges you might encounter while circling the track.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 16.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-november-16-889">NYT Connections Answers for Today, November 16 (#889)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– APPROACH, METHOD, PHILOSOPHY, SCHOOL</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – BANAL, EVERYDAY, HUMDRUM, PEDESTRIAN</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BARCODE, IBM LOGO, RUGBY SHIRT, ZEBRA</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – AVENUE, PARKING, RAILROAD, TAX</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lg-drops-major-black-friday-deal-on-its-240hz-34-inch-curved-oled-monitor-now-at-new-all-time-low-2000644620</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lg%E2%80%99s-240hz-34-inch-curved-oled-monitor-goes-at-new-all-time-low-black-friday-has-started-early.1354942/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s always been a given that gaming monitors come with a high price tag, especially when you’re talking about OLED technology with specs that push the limits of what’s possible. LG’s 34-inch Ultragear has been the reference point for serious gamers, but its $1,399 price kept it out of reach for many enthusiasts. Amazon just drastically upended that equation by dropping this curved beast down to $679, or nearly half off the original price. This all-time low opens up premium OLED gaming to a much wider audience who have been just looking for the right moment to improve their screens.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5610/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>When Curve Meets Speed</h2>
<p>This<strong> 34-inch display features an 800R curvature</strong> that aggressively wraps around your field of view compared to most other curved monitors you might have laid eyes on. LG steepened the curve enough to draw in peripheral vision into the action for an immersive experience not possible with flat-screen monitors. The curve works a treat in racing games or flight simulators where spatial awareness counts. You’ll notice how the edges of the screen stay within your natural viewing angle without requiring constant head movement.</p>
<p>The <strong>OLED panel delivers perfect blacks</strong> because each pixel can turn off completely and creates an infinite contrast ratio in practice. LG rates this at 1.5 million to one, but the real-world impact is in dark game scenes where you can actually distinguish details in shadows. The 1300-nit peak brightness might sound excessive, but it makes HDR content truly pop with highlights that leap off the screen.</p>



<p>The anti-glare coating does a great job <strong>with ambient light for an OLED display</strong>; you can game during the day without fighting reflections from windows or overhead lights. The 3<strong>440 x 1440 resolution gives you 34% more pixels than standard 1440p displays</strong>&nbsp;while the 21:9 aspect ratio expands your horizontal view in supported games. This ultrawide format is particularly great in competitive shooters where you can see more of the battlefield and that will give you an edge</p>
<p>It pushes four times more frames per second <strong>at 240Hz</strong> than the standard 60Hz monitors. This makes quite a difference in fast-paced games in which split-second reactions often make a lot of difference. You notice the difference clearly in the moments of fast panning of the camera or tracking fast-moving objects across the screen. With a <strong>response time of 0.03ms</strong>, you get almost zero motion blur or ghosting during rapid movements.</p>
<p>Both <strong>AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync compatibility</strong> ensure that your gameplay will be silky smooth. These technologies synchronize your GPU’s frame output with the monitor’s refresh rate, thereby eliminating screen tearing and stuttering. You can push frame rates above 200 fps in esports titles and still maintain perfect visual fluidity.</p>
<p>Cloud gaming services such as Nvidia GeForce Now, Amazon Luna and Blacknut run directly from the monitor. You’ll be able to experience demanding game titles without the need for expensive hardware but with a good internet connection and a controller. The USB Type-C port also provides 65W of power delivery so you can charge your laptop while using the monitor as a display.</p>
<p>There is more than one HDMI 2.1 port on this monitor with support f<strong>or complete 4K at 120Hz from both PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles</strong>. You get the full next-generation console experience with variable refresh rate and auto low latency mode working without a hitch. Basic audio is taken care of by onboard speakers, but serious gamers will want dedicated headphones or external speakers for the best sound.</p>
<p>This is a new all time low price on Amazon, make sure you don’t miss it.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Call of Duty Fans Have Strong Opinions on Black Ops 7 Campaign]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-reddit-reactions/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-fans-have-strong-opinions-on-black-ops-7-campaign.1354912/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>With Black Ops 7 now on the market, Call of Duty fans have expressed their opinions on the game’s campaign. However, the reactions are a bit underwhelming than what they expected.</p>







<p>In Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, the campaign brings the series back to the Mason family, particularly David. The family, which was featured from Black Ops to Black Ops 2, has taken a back seat until now. With Black Ops 7, the campaign, fully multiplayer, takes players on a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-story-trailer-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nightmare-induced fever dream</a> where the team, including David, confronts Menendez and The Guild. Compared to other titles, especially last year’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-black-ops-6-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a>, it’s a bit of a crazy one. As you can expect, some have some strong opinions, good and bad, about how things were handled.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-campaign-garbage-lackluster-says-call-of-duty-fans">Black Ops 7 Campaign ‘Garbage’, ‘Lackluster’, Says Call of Duty Fans</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Since Black Ops 7’s release, the Call of Duty Reddit has been going through the motions, in a way. The reactions towards the game have ranged from hot garbage to series-best. However, there is a common thread between them: the game’s co-op campaign is not great. In a Reddit post from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/1ox7epg/cod_the_warzonification_and_zombification_of/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">AdBudget5468</a>, the user argues that the success of other modes like Zombies and Warzone have ‘ruined’ campaigns, with Black Ops 7 being a prime example. </p>



<p>In the comments, many fans expressed the same reaction. For some, like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/1ox7epg/comment/novr5x3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Solid_Snek120</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/1ox7epg/comment/noxcdq6/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Shadowdemon210</a>, it feels reminiscent of 2023’s Modern Warfare 3, which had a very controversial campaign. Others, like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/1ox7epg/comment/novtolj/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Top_Limit_</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/1ox7epg/comment/nowr2da/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SetScary9216</a>, brought up how polished Black Ops 6’s campaign was and how Black Ops 7’s just doesn’t match up. </p>



<p>Currently, the game isn’t doing as hot as Activision may like. As it stands, Black Ops 7 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-day-one-steam-numbers-compare-badly-to-battlefield-6-and-arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hasn’t even reached 100k</a> while rival shooters ARC Raiders and Battlefield 6 still get over 200k and even 300k on Steam. Despite this, the title will likely sell well, though it’s unknown just how well compared to other entries. Hopefully, as someone who enjoys the campaign, the next games can take from Black Ops 6 and Modern Warfare and craft something all can enjoy without being a ploy to earn a battle royale mode.</p>







<p>What do you think of Black Ops 7’s campaign? Is it as bad as people said? Worse? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>.</p>

              <p>Gas generators solve power outages but fill your garage with fumes, wake the neighbors with engine noise and require constant fuel runs that get expensive fast. Portable power stations eliminate all those headaches while delivering clean electricity that works safely indoors during winter storms when you need heat, light, and charged devices the most.</p>
<p>The good news is that the <strong>Jackery Explorer 2000 v2</strong> just <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4831/">dropped to an all-time low of $699 on Amazon, slashed from its usual $1,499 price</a>. This massive 2042Wh battery costs roughly what budget gas generators do, except it runs silently, produces zero emissions and charges from wall outlets or solar panels.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4831/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Crushes Gas Generator Alternatives</h2>
<p>Jackery Explorer 2000 v2 is capable of providing <strong>up to 2200W continuous power via three AC outlets</strong>, and runs multiple appliances at the same time during outages or off-grid. That wattage capacity will run space heaters, electric blankets, mini fridges, laptops, and medical equipment all at once without overloading the system. The 2042Wh translates into real-world runtime that matters during extended winter power outages, keeping a typical space heater running for about four hours and charging laptops 30 times over.</p>
<p>Jackery engineered this unit using Cell-to-Body technology borrowed from electric vehicle manufacturing. CTB optimizes internal space by incorporating battery cells directly into the structural frame. This design approach minimizes wasted space and unnecessary materials, so this massive-capacity power station weighs just 39.5 pounds. That’s a <strong>41% weight reduction and 34% size decrease compared to typical 2kWh LiFePO4 power stations</strong> from competitors.</p>



<p>The secret to differentiating this Jackery from its slower competitors is multiple fast-charging pathways that get you back to full power quickly. Wall outlet AC charging <strong>pushes the battery from zero to 80% in just 66 minutes</strong> and gives you usable power fast when storms approach and you’re racing to prepare. The Emergency Super Charging mode accessible through Jackery’s smartphone app completes a full charge in 102 minutes; this accelerated charging generates more heat and should be reserved for genuine emergencies, though.</p>
<p>Silent Charging mode charges the battery to full capacity in five hours <strong>at whisper-quiet 30dB noise levels</strong> which is quieter than a library or a bedroom at night. This mode proves invaluable for overnight charging sessions where you may be trying to sleep or work without distraction from fan noise. The smart temperature control system constantly monitors internal component temperatures and automatically adjusts cooling fan speeds based on actual thermal load rather than operating fans at maximum speed regardless of conditions.</p>
<p>The<strong> USB-C PD 100W port charges laptops, tablets, and phones</strong> at the maximum possible speed, without separate power adapters that you’d otherwise need to plug into the AC outlets. Two more USB-A ports and a 12V car port handle smaller devices and accessories efficiently. The pure sine wave AC output protects sensitive electronics from the power quality issues that modified sine wave inverters create, and allows safe operation of everything from computers to medical equipment.</p>
<p>For $699, you’re paying budget gas generator prices for clean, quiet, indoor-safe power that charges multiple ways and lasts a decade.</p>

<p>In August, XSEED Games announced the <strong>Corpse Party Tetralogy Pack</strong> was coming "exclusively" to the Nintendo Switch in 2025. This pack was set to include <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/corpse_party">Corpse Party</a> (2001), <strong>Book of Shadows</strong>, <strong>Sweet Sachiko's Hysteric Birthday Base</strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/corpse_party_blood_drive">Blood Drive</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Now, though, it's been cancelled in the west. Multiple games in this pack did not comply with the "current platform guidelines". This has resulted in the physical version of this pack (and digital offerings of previously unreleased titles) being axed. The publisher did not elaborate on this, but it's not the first time something like this has happened with an upcoming Switch release.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067tjwqnz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>Here's the official update about this via the XSEED Games social media account:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Corpse Party fans:</p>
<p>We know how much you were anticipating the release of Corpse Party Tetralogy Pack. Though we previously released entries in the Corpse Party series on console platforms and digital storefronts in the West, we were informed that the contents of several games in the Tetralogy Pack did not comply with current platform guidelines. As a result, we are unable to release these games as intended and have subsequently canceled the physical release of Corpse Party Tetralogy Pack, as well as the digital offerings of previously unreleased Corpse Party games featured in the Tetralogy Pack.</p>
<p>We apologize for any confusion and disappointment this may have caused. We remain committed to working with our partners at MAGES to bring Corpse Party II: Darkness Distortion to the West and will share more details on its release when we can. Thank you for your understanding and continued support of XSEED Games and the Corpse Party franchise.</p>

<p>As noted, XSEED still aims to work with MAGES to release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/corpse_party_ii_darkness_distortion">Corpse Party II: Darkness Distortion</a> locally in the future, so if there are any updates about this, we'll let you know.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dell-dumps-its-vostro-1tb-laptop-for-70-off-now-selling-for-what-generic-budget-laptops-cost-2000644605</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dell-dumps-its-vostro-1tb-laptop-for-70-off-now-selling-for-what-generic-budget-laptops-cost.1354876/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Laptop shopping is overwhelming when you’re staring at options ranging from $200 Chromebooks that barely function to $3,000 premium machines loaded with specs you’ll never use. Most people just need something reliable for everyday tasks like web browsing, document work, video calls and media streaming. The Dell Vostro 15″ <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5607/">1TB model just crashed to an all-time low of $599 on Amazon, slashed from its usual $1,999 sticker</a>, and this 70% discount puts a brand-name business laptop at literally the same price point as generic budget machines.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5607/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Great Value for Money Laptop</h2>
<p>The Vostro 3530 is powered by Intel’s 13th Generation Core i3-1305U, a five-core chip with one performance core and four efficiency cores. It divides the workload smartly between those efficiency and performance cores, depending on how demanding the task is. The performance core <strong>runs at a turbo frequency of as much as 4.5GHz for resource-intensive tasks</strong> such as video editing or a heavy spreadsheet while the efficiency cores do the background work without consuming much power to give you extended battery life.</p>



<p>Dell equipped this laptop with a <strong>massive 32GB of DDR4 RAM, placing it firmly in the realm of a professional workstation</strong> rather than basic consumer laptop specs. That amount of memory lets you run dozens of Chrome tabs, have multiple Microsoft Office documents open, stream background music, host video calls, and still have some headroom left over. Students can research papers with innumerable reference tabs open alongside writing in Word and chatting on Discord without their system choking.</p>



<p>The <strong>1TB PCIe NVMe SSD is plenty to store years</strong> of documents, photos, and videos, and apps in a way that doesn’t require you to live in constant file management or cloud storage subscriptions. Modern SSDs like this one access data at speeds that make traditional hard drives seem prehistoric: they boot Windows 11 Pro within seconds of start-up and load programs almost instantly.</p>
<p>That<strong> 15.6-inch Full HD display refreshes at 120Hz</strong> instead of the more common 60Hz seen on most budget laptops, and it makes motion noticeably smoother as you scroll through documents, web pages, or video content. In practice, that doubled refresh rate reduces eye fatigue during long work sessions because the subtle flicker and stuttering common with lower refresh displays are gone. The anti-glare coating and 250-nit brightness let you work near windows without reflections destroying visibility, while the narrow border design maximizes screen real estate without increasing the laptop’s physical footprint.</p>
<p>With it, <strong>you get Windows 11 Professional pre-installed</strong> rather than the Home edition found on consumer laptops, offering extra security features, remote desktop capability, and business-focused tools that matter for professional environments. The Pro edition supports BitLocker encryption for protecting sensitive data, domain joining for corporate networks, and advanced group policy controls needed by IT departments.</p>
<p>Connectivity options fill both modern and legacy needs with a practical mix of ports. A USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-C handles fast data transfers and can connect to modern docks and displays, while traditional USB-A ports ensure the existing peripherals work without adapters. The RJ-45 Ethernet port provides you with dependable wired network connections that surpass WiFi in stability and speed in a home office or dorm room. External monitors or projectors are connected via HDMI 1.4 output for presentations and expanded workspaces.</p>
<p>You’re getting here 32GB RAM, 1TB storage, a 120Hz display, and Windows 11 Pro for $599, which is what most people pay for basic 8GB Chromebooks.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/xbox-controllers-see-their-first-major-black-friday-deal-now-selling-for-new-all-time-low-on-amazon-2000644601</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-controllers-see-their-first-major-black-friday-deal-now-selling-for-new-all-time-low-on-amazon.1354870/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>First major Black Friday deals just landed on Amazon and Xbox controllers finally joined the discount party with their deepest price cut ever. Gaming controllers take a beating from intense button mashing, thumbstick abuse and the occasional rage-induced floor meeting so having a backup or upgrade becomes essential rather than optional.</p>
<p>The Xbox wireless gaming controller in <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/">Carbon Black just hit an all-time low of $49 on Amazon, slashed from its usual $64 price</a>, and over 20,000 people grabbed one this month as stock moves incredibly fast. This 2025 model works across more devices than any previous Xbox controller which makes it useful beyond just console gaming.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Cross-Platform Gaming</h2>
<p>Microsoft designed this controller with universal compatibility extending well beyond the Xbox consoles, wirelessly <strong>connecting to Windows PCs, Android phones and tablets, iOS devices, FireTV Sticks, smart TVs, and even VR headsets</strong>. This means that you buy one quality controller and use it everywhere, rather than having different gamepads for every different platform you own.</p>
<p>That <strong>Bluetooth connection rapidly pairs with any device</strong> it’s hooked up to, which sidesteps the clutter of dongles and adapters found with older controllers. You can easily toggle between playing Halo on your Series X, streaming games on your phone during your lunch break and changing media on your Fire TV Stick without juggling multiple remotes or controllers.</p>



<p>The ergonomic design refines the proven Xbox controller shape that’s felt natural in gamers’ hands for over two decades with subtle improvements to grip texture and button placement. The textured surfaces on the triggers, bumpers and back casing provide a secure grip even during sweaty gaming sessions or when your hands get slick from snacks. Microsoft positioned the buttons and thumbsticks at distances that reduce hand fatigue during extended play, so you can game for hours without developing cramping or soreness in your thumbs and fingers.</p>



<p>The hybrid D-pad delivers accurate input for fighting games, platformers and any title that requires precise directional commands. This design marries the best aspects of traditional cross-shaped D-pads with the faceted style that most hardcore fighting game players prefer, providing you with tactile feedback for each direction press without mushy or ambiguous inputs. You’ll nail complex move combinations and rapid direction changes more consistently compared to cheaper controllers with spongy or imprecise directional pads.</p>
<p>Textured grips on the triggers and bumpers improve control in those split-second moments of intense gaming that determine victory or defeat. The triggers feature smooth analog travel that works perfectly for racing games where gradual acceleration and braking come into play, while also providing crisp digital clicks for shooters that need instant fire response.</p>



<p><strong>Battery life runs on two AA batteries that are expected to give about 40 hours of gameplay</strong> before needing replacement, giving you weeks of casual gaming or several marathon weekend sessions between battery swaps. The AA battery design lets you choose between disposable batteries for convenience or rechargeable batteries for cost savings and environmental benefits in the long term. You can also connect the controller via USB-C cable for wired play that eliminates any potential wireless latency while simultaneously charging rechargeable batteries if you’re using them.</p>
<p><strong>The 3.5mm headset jack</strong> connects any wired gaming headset directly, thereby routing game audio and chat through your headphones without the need for separate dongles or adapters. This direct connection reduces the audio latency compared to wireless headsets and gives you instant sound feedback, which helps in competitive gaming when hearing the enemy’s footsteps or gunshots a fraction of a second earlier provides strategic advantages.</p>
<p>At $49, you get Microsoft’s official controller quality for less money than most third-party alternatives that lack build quality or platform support.</p>

            <p>
I'm not sure I've ever been so quickly transported back in time than I have in I Write Games Not Tragedies. It's not that I completely relate to what takes place in the game, but its sense of place, of atmosphere and feeling, is one I understand in my soul. The emo amongst you have probably already caught on to the vibe with its title, and for those of you that haven't, the game's aesthetics, writing, and soundscape certainly will.
</p>
<p>
Set in some nowhere British town in the distant past of 2009, you play as Ash, a babby goth who thinks everything in his life is unbearably terrible, and that everyone around him is insufferable and deserving of his (internally narrated) belittlement. The popular kids are much too popular, his parents won't let him hang out on the roof in the rain, and of course there's school, yuck! No one understands him, but when he puts on his red Skullcandy headphones (what a throwback), he can escape into the world of music… which is where this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-10-best-visual-novels-on-pc">visual novel</a> game morphs into a rhythm game, uh, game.
</p>
<p>
Now, this isn't a revolution of rhythm game mechanics. There are three buttons to tap, and you must time your taps to certain words in the lyrics of whatever song is playing. You can jam out at certain moments, but in the demo I couldn't get that to work, a point I'm sure could be solved with some updated tutorialisation.
</p>
<p>
I'm not particularly bothered by the fairly lackluster rhythm mechanics because of the ways it commits to itself in so many other ways. The soundtrack, for one, is composed of tracks from indie punk artists from the UK, Japan, and Hong Kong, which itself is a thematically appropriate commitment to make. The backgrounds look like they were made on Paint circa 2009 (complementary), but there are also cringey anime drawings of Ash's classmates, as well as some of his himself where he looks much too cool. This pencilly, sketchy, crayony vibe translates to certain bits of character art too, albeit a bit more refined, and very much in the vein of something like Scott Pilgrim.
</p><p>
That feeling of cringe permeates a lot of the demo, and presumably the rest of the game. Ash kind of sucks, specifically in the way that teenagers sucked in the late 2000s. He drinks WKD at some canal with a boy he clearly has a crush on, a drink so notoriously unable to get you drunk unless you are literally 14, and one anyone would be mocked for drinking as an adult. I was not Ash, but I've known Ash, and I have cringed at Ash.
</p>
<p>
In the years since knowing my own Ash, or Ashes I supposed, I've since acquired some rose tinted goggles thick enough that at least allow me to look back on such a time and chuckle a little bit, even if it's also a bit embarrassing to think about. That same feeling comes through in I Write Games Not Tragedies, and that might not be for everyone. If you've ever listened to My Chemical Romance and you grew up in some nowhere British town, however, you probably owe it to yourself to give it a go.
</p>
<p>
I Write Games Not Tragedies is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3396670/I_Write_Games_Not_Tragedies/">available on Steam now</a>.

              <p>Virtual reality stopped being a futuristic fantasy the moment Meta cracked the code on affordable and high-quality headsets that actually work without a gaming PC tethered to your head. The <strong>Quest 3S brings premium VR experiences at a fraction of what you’d expect to pay</strong>, and Amazon just dropped both storage configurations to record-low prices for early Black Friday: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5604/">128GB model (including a Gorilla Tag bundle) now costs $249 instead of $299</a>; and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5604/">the 256GB version (including Batman: Arkham Shadow) sits at $329 down from $399</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5604/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why the Quest 3S Destroys the Value Competition</h2>
<p>Meta equipped the Quest 3S with the same core processor inside the flagship Quest 3 <strong>and offers you identical graphical processing capability for significantly less</strong>. That Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chip boasts double the GPU performance of the Quest 2 for rendering virtual environments with sharper textures, smoother frame rates and more complex objects.</p>
<p>The Quest 3S runs <strong>entirely wireless and frees you from the cable management nightmares that plague PC VR setups</strong>. You simply charge the headset, put it on, and jump into experiences without configuring external sensors or worrying about tripping over cords mid-game. This standalone design means you can play in your living room or even outside if you want with the h<strong>eadset tracking your movements</strong> through built-in cameras and sensors. Battery life typically gives you<strong> two to three hours of active play</strong> before needing a recharge which feels about right for VR sessions before eye strain sets in anyway.</p>



<p>Both bundles include<strong> immediate access to more than 40 games</strong>&nbsp;and avoids the sticker shock of buying a headset only to find out you’ll have to spend another hundred bucks on software. The 128GB version includes an exclusive Gorilla Tag bundle, while the 256GB model throws in <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em>, along with a three-month trial of Meta Horizon+, which unlocks even more premium titles.</p>
<p>If there’s one thing that’s become a cultural phenomenon in VR, it’s Gorilla Tag, which lets you swing through environments using only arm movements in a shockingly physical workout disguised as a game. Batman: Arkham Shadow is a full-fledged superhero adventure built specifically for VR with hand-to-hand combat and detective work that feels genuinely immersive.</p>
<p>Storage considerations matter more than you might think with VR headsets, too. Games with detailed environments and high-resolution textures can easily consume 10GB to 20GB each, and the Quest 3S does not support expandable storage. The 128GB model gives you enough room for roughly eight to ten major games plus several smaller experiences, which works fine if you’re comfortable deleting and redownloading titles as you rotate through your library. The 256GB version doubles that capacity and lets you maintain a larger installed library without constant storage management.</p>



<p>The visual experience inside the Quest 3S uses <strong>Fresnel lenses with a resolution of 1832 x 1920 pixels per eye</strong>, and matches the Quest 2’s clarity while benefiting from that doubled processing power. Colors pop with better saturation, black levels deepen in dark scenes, and the overall image feels crisper during gameplay. The Quest 3 does offer slightly better optics with pancake lenses that reduce the headset’s overall bulk, but the visual improvement doesn’t justify the $250 price premium for most users.</p>
<p><strong>Meta’s mixed reality capabilities</strong> transform your real room into a game zone by mapping your furniture and walls, then seamlessly integrating virtual elements. You could place a virtual chess board on your real coffee table, have a movie screen floating above your couch, or defend your living room from virtual invaders crawling across your real furniture.</p>
<p><strong>The Quest 3S weighs about 515 grams</strong> and distributes that mass across your face with adjustable straps that take into account head size and shapes. Comfort will, of course, vary from person to person, but most people can handle hour-plus sessions before taking a break. The included elastic strap works well enough, though more serious VR enthusiasts often upgrade to Meta’s Elite Strap for better weight distribution during longer play.</p>
<p>At these early Black Friday prices, the Quest 3S completely rewrites the entry cost for quality VR. When you’re paying almost double for marginal improvements, the regular Quest 3 simply can’t compete on value. And for PC-based headsets, an expensive computer is needed in addition to the investment into the headset itself. Meta nailed the sweet spot between performance and affordability with this model.</p>

I think <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> was much more of a turning point for Sony than most people really discuss. The argument for PlayStation used to be its exclusives, those tentpole games like Uncharted, Ratchet and Clank, LittleBigPlanet, the list does go on but you get the point. On the PS5, completely original first-party games feel few and far between, as Sony has joined in on the whole intellectual property above all else train that every other company has hopped aboard. So hearing Guerilla Games' studio director Jan-Bart van Beek say the Horizon series was always thought about as a multiplayer game feels like the last piece of the puzzle has been inserted.
</p>
<p>
Here's what van Beek said specifically, in referencing the just announced Horizon MMO <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-an-mmorpg-twist-on-sonys-series-about-plinking-robo-animals-with-arrows-is-coming-to-pc">Steel Frontiers</a>: "From the first moment we imagined Horizon, we always thought about it as a multiplayer game. LEGO Horizon Adventures was our first small step, with Steel Frontiers we’re taking a bigger one. There is much more to come, and we’re excited to show you what is coming."

<p>
Apologies for taking a curmudgeonly attitude towards this, but of course that's how it was always thought about! Well, assuming this is true across the board. I imagine there are plenty who worked on the original that won't feel that way. The top brass feeling that way does make sense, however. Ultimately the goal isn't striving to make something fresh, but something that can keep you playing, and presumably paying, for longer.
</p>
<p>
Live service is constantly on Sony's mind, and it is pretty clear that multiplayer is on Guerilla's. Clearing up some confusion, industry secrets knower <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3m5jd6otif22v">Jason Schreier took to Bluesky</a> to say that the NCSoft developer Horizon Steel Frontiers MMO isn't that rumoured - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/over-12-minutes-of-early-horizon-multiplayer-game-footage-leaks-online">and leaked</a> - Horizon Multiplayer game. That one is still in the works at Guerilla, and is apparently their next big project.
</p><p>
But it's this reality where Horizon was supposedly always meant to be multiplayer that my feelings on the original being a turning point come from. A mobile-only Ratchet and Clank multiplayer shooter was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlblXRS14Mg">just announced this week</a>, for heaven's sake. As much of a farce as the Sony first-party game was, at least every now and then it would offer up something new. Ah well, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pilot-a-shrimp-and-do-battle-with-giant-eldritch-sea-monsters-in-the-armored-core-adjacent-shrimp-game?view=comments">at least we have Shrimp Game</a>.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-flea-market-locked-level-40/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/you-won%E2%80%99t-unlock-the-full-tarkov-flea-market-until-level-40.1354804/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov’s 1.0 update is here, and fans worldwide are enjoying it – or those who can <strong>access the game are</strong>, anyway. It’s the dawn of a new era for the stellar extraction shooter, which has grown over the last decade to become a staple of the industry and a leader of the genre.</p>



<p>The 1.0 update brings stacks of changes, and one that players are struggling to contend with concerns the game’s <strong>Flea Market </strong>mechanic. It has been discovered that ‘categories’ of the Flea Market are locked until you progress to a fairly high level.</p>







<h2 id="h-flea-market-locked-down-again">Flea Market Locked Down Again</h2>



<p>The latest changes to Escape from Tarkov have been a mixed bag. On one hand, the new map, faction, weapons, and 1,000 bug fixes are welcome, but the shattered servers that are having issues hosting the hundreds of thousands of players trying to get into the game, we can do without.</p>



<p>One change that’s proving to be divisive is the alteration made to the game’s Flea Market, the peer-to-peer trading solution that allows users to buy and sell gear they find, craft, or steal.</p>



<p>With 1.0, players are now being forced to hit minimum level requirements to open up sections of the Flea Market, with certain categories remaining under lock for quite some time.&nbsp;The base Flea Market unlocks at Level 15 as always, but there are higher restrictions now in terms of levels.</p>



<p>Here’s what we’ve seen so far:</p>



<ul>
<li>Bolt-action rifles – Level 20</li>



<li>Assault rifles – Level 25</li>



<li>Marksman rifles – Level 25</li>



<li>Backpacks – Level 25</li>



<li>Foregrips – Level 20</li>



<li>Light and laser devices – Level 25</li>



<li>Muzzle devices – Level 20</li>
</ul>



<p>It gets a bit more extreme in some places:</p>



<ul>
<li>Barter items – Level 30</li>



<li>Gear components – Level 30</li>



<li>Injectors – Level 30</li>



<li>Keycards – Level 30</li>
</ul>



<p>And some high-tier ammo will remain locked for a very long time:</p>



<ul>
<li>PS12B – Level 40</li>



<li>M80 – Level 35</li>



<li>Blackout CJB – Level 40</li>
</ul>



<p>(Thanks to <a href="https://x.com/LogicaISoIution/status/1989786400330584192" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LogicalSolutions</a> for the spot)</p>







<p>This is believed to be an effort to counter cheaters trying to participate in RMT (real-money trading), but it has rubbed some fans the wrong way.</p>

            <p>
Video games don't have mysteries any more. There are too many people and too much internet to allow for such a thing, anything without an answer can, must, and will be solved by someone, often in a timeframe faster than developers expect. So I appreciate when developers refuse to divulge details, or indulge individuals in their desire to know exactly how much they have on their checklist, one such developer being Tonda Ros of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-blue-prince">Blue Prince</a> developer Dogubomb.
</p>
<p>
In response to a question from <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/puzzle/i-will-probably-never-fully-acknowledge-whether-or-not-everything-has-been-solved-says-blue-prince-creator-there-are-certainly-mysteries-still-in-the-game/">PC Gamer</a> regarding whether there are any mysteries left to be found in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle</a> game, Ros said that there certainly are, and that "there will probably always be some mysteries in the game. And in order to preserve that mystery, I will probably never fully acknowledge whether or not everything has been solved." Music to my ears!
</p>
<p>
Ros goes further, saying, "I know that for some games, they'll have, like, a canary in the coal mine, right? I think it's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-well">Animal Well</a> that has a website that's like, 'Has everything been found yet?' That kind of serves as a canary." As it turns out, such a website does exist, it's <a href="http://haseverythinginanimalwellbeenfoundyet.com/">haseverythinginanimalwellbeenfoundyet.com</a>, and I'll let you click to find out what the answer is.
</p>
<p>
For Ros, that question of whether everything has been found in Blue Prince is one he thinks people will always ask. "The only thing I will say is that there are still mysteries," he said. "Not to say that they're necessarily things that can be solved in definitive ways, but they are things that you can piece together answers to, oftentimes intuitively."
</p><p>
I truly hope this is something we see more of from developers going forwards. There is such a massive inclination towards complete and utter player satisfaction, but to me there is nothing more satisfying than to be left wanting more, a reason to keep coming back, even if the gaps between return trips end up being days, weeks, months or years at a time. Lay unto me your mysterious developers! I may not solve them, but I will think about them.
</p>
<p>
And while you're here, I'd like to remind you that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-team-behind-blue-prince-puts-out-a-call-to-get-one-of-the-puzzle-games-devs-a-life-saving-kidney">one of the lead playtesters on Blue Prince is in desperate need of a kidney</a>, something you genuinely might be able to help with.

            <p>Escape from Tarkov is sitting on a Mostly Negative rating today after yesterday's eagerly-awaited Steam debuted to stability and performance issues that prevent players even logging in, let alone play.</p>
<p>Acknowledging that players are experiencing "problems connecting to the servers and authorising in the game launcher", developer Battlestate said its "technical team is actively working to stabilise the game servers and authorisation services" and apologised for any inconvenience caused.</p>

<p>It hasn't stopped thousands of unhappy people leaving negative reviews, though, with just 34% of the 7200+ reviews left since yesterday's launch reporting a positive experience. Some claim that they <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199734556695/recommended/3932890/">can't even create an account"</a> due to connection issues and ongoing server/website maintenance.</p><p>"Escape from Tarkov is not a game.

"Booting it up is like willingly inserting your face into a malfunctioning wood chipper. Nothing makes sense. Hit registration behaves completely random. The sound doesn't work, everyone moves absolutely silently. Bosses and Scavs walk through doors like they don't exist. Players are plunged into despair the moment another server error occurs.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>After a lot of negative feedback and tumbling player counts, Bungie have acknowledged that they made some poor decisions with Destiny 2. Here is their statement from this week’s TWAB.</p>
<p><em>“With Edge of Fate, we presented a different vision for the future of Destiny 2’s core game. One intended to refocus our releases and player call-to-action on a familiar but deeper pursuit of Power and ascending to higher Tiers of gear across a wider range of activities supporting customizable challenge and commensurate rewards. &nbsp;</em></p>


<p><em>Very quickly, the feedback made it clear that this was the wrong path for Destiny.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Even if our execution had been perfect, and we see plainly that it was not, it is clear that grinding Power will never be a substitute for earning a trophy. Climbing through throwaway tiers en-route to the gear you want to build around isn’t aspirational. And the Portal itself surrenders too much of Destiny’s feeling of place and exploration. These lessons, and many others besides them, have been taken to heart by our team over the last three months.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>From 9.0.0 on through 9.1.5, our focus across the entire team has been response to player feedback, starting with the fastest changes and working through the more challenging ones. Our focus was on faster, better Rewards, more player agency in activity choice, and removing barriers to playing with friends.</em></p>

<p><em>Since Destiny launched over ten years ago, it has always been a living, reactive world. Through our successes and failures, we are grateful for the opportunities to explore different paths, learn from them, and with that clarity, build an inspiring new vision with, and for, our players. As we work on our plans and communications to address your feedback, thank you for being on this journey with us as we reshape our strategy for the long-term future of the Destiny franchise. “</em></p>
<p>The Portal and the associated power grind had come under heavy criticism as it required players to play the same few activities over and over again just to raise their power levels up before they could start getting decent weapon drops. This meant playing other activities, such as Dares of Eternity was completely pointless, and if you did, the matchmaking was unlikely to find any other players.</p>
<p>Updates 9.5.0 (December 2) and 9.5.0.1 (December 9) will begin to make changes to how the game works.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wider access to Power progression, especially in Expansion content.
<ul>
<li>Players will be able to reach the Power cap directly through Renegades activities if they wish.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Seasonal Power and Featured Gear carrying across Seasons.
<ul>
<li>All Exotic weapons and armor are now featured.</li>
<li>Additionally, we’re moving Power catch-up from a chest needing manual pickup to organic drops: sign in, play Renegades, catapult to 300 Power, and play with your friends.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Vault capacity and upgrades to ease collection pressure.
<ul>
<li>We have increased Vault capacity by an additional 300 slots to 1000, and we’re working on more.</li>
<li>In addition, the Vault now has a revamped filtering system to help find what you’re looking for faster.</li>
</ul>
</li>

			<p>Escape from Tarkov is finally live on Steam with its long-anticipated 1.0 release. To celebrate the occasion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/escape-from-tarkov-1-0-launch-qa-we-have-big-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we brought you an exclusive interview with Nikita Buyanov</a>, Game Director of Battlestate Games, discussing the long journey toward the full launch, the content available in this new version, some of what will be coming in the future, and a few thoughts on the genre as a whole.</p>



<p>Additionally, we also inquired about controller support for the PC version and about a potential launch on console platforms. Here's what Buyanov told us:</p>



<p><em>Yes, we are considering the possibility of porting the game to consoles. I think when we start working on it, we will implement full controller support. It's a very serious and interesting game design challenge – to create comfortable controls while accounting for all of Tarkov's unique mechanics.</em></p>



<p>It does sound like this is still further away, since the studio hasn't even begun working on it yet. It may be quite a while, considering how long it took Battlestate Games to release Escape from Tarkov. Still, it's good news for all those who'd love to play it on consoles, or at least to play it on PC, but with the comfort of a gamepad.</p>

            <p>
I do have to admit that bringing up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a> feels like digging up a dead dog that perished in a horrendous, preventable accident, but it feels important given how quickly it died and what the means for how we engage with it. You see, it seems that this week the largely panned hero <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> was revived through community-run custom servers. Except it seems like this may be over before it truly begins.
</p>
<p>
As reported by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-concord-playable-again-custom-servers/">The Game Post</a>, developers that go by the names Red, open_wizard, and gwog opened up a Discord server where you could try out Concord through said custom servers. This is apparently possible through the trio recreating the game's backend API and thusly reverse engineering it. Some videos were even posted to YouTube showing off these custom servers in action, which is where things have started to go legally iffy.
</p>
<p>
Both videos, as again reported by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-cracks-down-concord-custom-servers-dmca-takedowns/">The Game Post</a>, were taken down through a copyright claim filed by MarkScan Enforcement, most likely on Sony's behalf. I say most likely, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nightmare-kart-is-getting-a-free-dlc-but-sonys-plague-ridden-rats-have-come-for-bloodborne-psx">as MarkScan did the exact same thing to Bloodborne PSX</a> on behalf of Sony earlier this year. It's not surprising the same thing has been done to Concord here, especially as the custom servers won't have much legal ground to stand on.
</p>
<p>
It should be noted that these takedowns are for the videos themselves. So far nothing seems to have been done about the custom servers themselves, but in a statement in the Discord for the project, developer Red said "Due to worrying legal action we’ve decided to pause invites for the time being." At the time of writing, any links to the Discord server no longer work.
</p><p>
This all feels pertinent to the ongoing situation with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-uk-petition-has-been-debated-in-parliament-the-law-works-but-companies-may-need-to-communicate-better">Stop Killing Games</a>, a campaign that seeks to "challenge the legality of publishers destroying video games they have sold to customers." Personally, I don't love the consumerist angle to the campaign, but there is something to be said of the need to protect online-only games from certain doom. 
</p>
<p>
Games like Concord are toys, you smash action figures together in them for ridiculous results, yet you can only do it in the way you've been told to. That stinks! I often think of the success of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a> in particular, and the playful space Valve created with it that allowed for many a machinima. That feels like more important a reason to preserve online games, to allow for a freer sense of play once the corporate overlords have stopped making money from their toy business. Let's see how things play out for new, slightly less legal Concord.
