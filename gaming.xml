            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baldurs-gate-3-mod-tools-september</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/baldurs-gate-3-mod-tools-arrive-with-patch-7-in-september.888006/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baldurs-gate-3-mod-tools-september<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Larian has announced that official&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>mod tools will arrive in September, as will everything else that's coming as part of the hotly-anticipated Patch 7.</p>

<p>We first learned that official mod support for&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>would arrive as part of Patch 7 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baldurs-gate-3-mod-support-patch-7">back in April</a>, but we now know roughly when we can expect it, although no final release date has been revealed yet.</p>

<p>The closed alpha for mod support kicks off today, according to a&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4179982568653520452" rel="noopener" target="_blank">community update on Steam</a>, and another test will open up registrations in July, allowing Larian to work through player feedback for the rest of the summer.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/baldurs-gate-3-mod-tools-aylin.jpg?itok=e2YYe5xO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/baldurs-gate-3-mod-tools-aylin.jpg?itok=WTTD3wh- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>mod tools are just around the corner.</figcaption></figure><p>In the aforementioned community update, Larian also sets out what mod tools and modding support will mean for&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>.</p>

<p>Of course, it's possible to mod&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>right now, but implementing an official mod pipeline should make things much smoother and allow for better compatibility between each mod, as well as between mods and the game itself.</p>

<p>You'll still be able to mod&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>outside of Larian's official system if you want to, of course. Modding will use the <a href="https://mod.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mod.io</a> platform and will be PC-only at first, but Mac support, as well as modding support for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S players, is on the cards too.</p>

<p>With that said, PlayStation and Xbox players won't have access to the&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>mod toolkit, so if you want to make your own mod for the game, you'll need to have a PC to do it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/baldurs-gate-3-mod-tools-party.jpg?itok=1GruCJg0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/baldurs-gate-3-mod-tools-party.jpg?itok=9nLRutF- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll soon be able to mod&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>with Larian's official blessing.</figcaption></figure><p>The toolkit will let you create, edit, and upload mods, as well as loading in-game levels on a read-only basis, accessing internal editors, and more. It's set to be a fully-featured mod toolkit that should help you realize whatever crazy dreams you've got for&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>mods.</p>

<p><em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>is out right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086940/Baldurs_Gate_3/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/baldurs-gate-3/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/baldurs-gate-3/9nd58lqtg09t" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. Modding support is scheduled to arrive this September.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/venom-the-last-dance-trailer-picks-up-after-all-those-wacky-multiverse-post-credits-teases.888003/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24170373/venom-3-trailer-last-dance<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="ebiZue"><em>Venom 3</em>, cheekily subtitled the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23042540/el-muerto-bad-bunny-venom-3-ghostbusters-5-sony-cinemacon"><em>The Last Dance</em></a>, looks like a splashy payoff to one of the superhero movie era’s weirder franchises. Tom Hardy is back as Eddie Brock and on the run from some gun-toting scientists who believe the Venom symbiote must be eradicated for the sake of Earth. Crossing my fingers this is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETPVU0acnrE"><em>The Fugitive</em></a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khVFiUShfR8"><em>Midnight Run</em></a> with a Venom horse.</p>
<p id="gkd7Z0"><em>Venom: The Last Dance</em> appears to pick up where we left Eddie and Venom in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22701590/venom-2-review-let-there-be-carnage"><em>Venom: Let There Be Carnage</em></a>: lying low in the tropics after killing serial killer Cletus and leaving detective Mulligan (Stephen Graham) <a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/22691862/venom-2-blue-eyes-detective-toxin-marvel-symbiote">infected with his own symbiote</a>. But if you are a total dork about this stuff, you might be wondering: Hey, didn’t Eddie and Venom cross over into the Marvel Cinematic Universe in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22701094/venom-2-let-there-be-carnage-after-credits-scene">a post-credits tease at the end of <em>Let There Be Carnage</em></a>? Yes, they did! At least that’s what appeared to happen, a theoretical connection to Doctor Strange’s multiversal spell in <em>Spider-Man: No Way Home</em>. </p>
<p id="BzG3HE">But in the end, only Andrew Garfield’s and Tobey Maguire’s previous Spider-Mans showed up in the crossover movie — no Venom. In fact, Marvel went so far as to undo the whole tease. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22836376/spider-man-no-way-home-post-credits-scenes-venom-doctor-strange">A post-credits scene in <em>No Way Home</em></a> saw Eddie grumbling at a bar over his multiverse displacement, only to be immediately transported back to his walled-off Sony-Marvel timeline in a flash. Nothing mattered! Wild.</p>
<p id="AilrKq">So here we are, <em>The Last Dance</em>, with Eddie and Venom back where they started: on the run, biting heads, and amped for more black-goo hijinks. There are some <a href="https://comicbookmovie.com/venom/venom-let-there-be-carnage/venom-the-last-dance-rumored-plot-leak-claims-to-reveal-the-movies-villains-and-plans-forpeter-parker-a211156">out-there rumors on dubious corners of the internet</a> that Eddie might somehow might be on the hunt for a 10-year-old Peter Parker, but the trailer pretty much dispels the post-credits-inspired hope. We do get a tease of Mulligan’s transformation into Toxin, and while Chiwetel Ejiofor shows up as a big bad, he’s not playing Karl Mordo from <em>Doctor Strange</em> — just some dude in army fatigues who likely bonds with a symbiote for a final fight. <em>Ted Las</em>so<em>’s </em>Juno Temple is also in the cast, and is also rumored to do some symbioting. </p>
<p id="0HBa7S"><em>Venom: The Last Dance</em>, which does not take place in the MCU timeline, is out on Oct. 25.</p>

Larian has a habit of releasing its games unfinished into the hands of its community, and it’ll be doing the same for Patch 7. At first this will be a “closed beta,” where a hand-picked group of the finest vintage of mod creators will be given access, with the intention that these amateur experts will help them iron out major issues and test the tech to see how it works with unofficial mods they’ve already built.</p><p>That all starts today, June 3, with more modders being let behind the secret door as the month goes on. But come July, the crack in the door widens slightly, and 1,000 members of the hoi polloi who register will be allowed through. Over the next couple of months, Larian and this motley crew of unpaid laborers will get things shipshape and hopefully released for the masses in September.</p><p>It’s a studio that certainly seems to understand why a community wants to be able to mod. The recent update states,</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Whether you are turning fireballs pink, boosting the attack damage of a hand-wielded sausage, or bestowing all citizens of Faerûn with a personal handgun, modding lets you alter a game to change how it looks or behaves.</p></blockquote><p>More usefully, the mod tools will allow people to create new classes and subclasses, weapons and armor, spells and skins, and thus craft entire new approaches to the game. It’s a long-running tradition of <em>D&amp;D</em> games, especially those made by BioWare—and most especially <em>Neverwinter Nights</em>—to let the community then create their own stories within (and without) the Forgotten Realms, so it’s great to see it being supported this time too.</p><p>Larian is at pains to say that this doesn’t close down options for the unofficial modding scene that’s already established around <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, which they fully intend to endorse. This will also provide a way for mods that won’t get approval from the license owners to still be possible to create and share. The game will still recognize them and run them, but obviously they won’t be supported.</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> We understand and appreciate the hard work and dedication of the modding community, and have no plans to limit modding to our official pipeline. We are committed to supporting the modding community as comprehensively as we can, and can’t wait to see what ideas you bring to life!</p></blockquote><p>Larian certainly are saying all the right words here. Mods and modding will be launched first for PC via software called Mod.io, with Mac and consoles to follow at an unspecified time. However, mod <em>creation</em> will require a PC. </p><p>The update includes no new information regarding the forthcoming new endings we know are coming to the game, with Larian referring players back to April’s last <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4172097464031362567&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4172097464031362567" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Community Update</a></span>.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The studio is otherwise best known for creating the Uncharted franchise, though this was put to bed with 2016's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/uncharted-4-a-thiefs-end-review">Uncharted 4: A Thief's End</a> and smaller follow-up <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/uncharted-the-lost-legacy-review">The Lost Legacy</a> a year later.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I promise you, we will not be The Last of Us studio forever.</p></div><p>Naughty Dog hasn't released a game since The Last of Us: Part 2 beyond remasters, remakes, and collections, and while the studio confirmed it had decided on its next major title in March 2023, nothing is known about it externally.</p><p>Druckmann's comments suggest it may not be a new The Last of Us game, however, if he's certain Naughty Dog won't be predominantly known for the franchise in the future. It's also entirely possible The Last of Us is just one of these "multiple single player projects" in the works at Naughty Dog. Only time will tell.</p><p>Druckmann didn't say these projects were all in development either, but simply being worked on, meaning several, if not all, could still be in early conceptual phases and far from being worked on proper, never mind released. Projects this early in development are also regularly cancelled or drastically changed.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Every IGN Naughty Dog Game Review</h3></div></output><p>Regardless, Druckmann did say Naughty Dog's incoming games would follow the same principles as the studio's previous. "We create experiences that are steeped in story and character, especially relationships," he said. "The stories have some sort of philosophical core that everything is going to revolve around and feed into."</p><p>These comments will hopefully not be retracted like another media appearance from Druckmann was, as in a bizarre turn of events, Naughty Dog owner <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-pulls-controversial-interview-with-naughty-dogs-neil-druckmann-after-finding-several-significant-errors-and-inaccuracies">Sony published and then deleted an interview with him</a> after several misquotes.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/neil-druckmann-says-naughty-dogs-next-game-could-redefine-mainstream-perceptions-of-gaming-update">Myriad comments from Druckmann were published incorrectly</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/neil-druckmann-did-not-quite-say-naughty-dogs-next-game-could-redefine-mainstream-perceptions-of-gaming">forcing him to release clarifying statements online</a>. "We apologize to Neil for misrepresenting his words and for any negative impact this interview might have caused," Sony said.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter. He'll talk about The Witcher all day.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/06/03/geoff-keighley-says-people-are-setting-themselves-up-for-failure-when-asked-about<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>This year's <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/08/the-2024-summer-gaming-showcase-schedule">Summer Game Fest showcase is happening this week,</a> on Friday, June 7, at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET, and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/16/summer-game-fest-to-have-more-than-55-studios-and-publishers-including-playstation">with more than 55 studios and publishers set to be featured</a> at the event (including Play Days this weekend) this year, fans have been speculating on what they might see. That includes Kingdom Hearts fans, who have been hoping to see something related to Kingdom Hearts IV at SGF this year, given it's been more than two years since its <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/04/10/kingdom-hearts-4-revealed-in-20th-anniversary-trailer">reveal</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, SGF host and creator Geoff Keighley thinks Kingdom Hearts fans should lower their expectations for the show.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"People keep asking about Kingdom Hearts, I don't know why," Keighley says during a recent stream where he answered questions about SGF. "I think it's because we did [Final Fantasy VII Rebirth] last year or something like that. But yeah, people are setting themselves up for failure but you guys can keep hoping."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here's a clip of it, too:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, Keighley could be playing coy, especially with the "but you guys can keep hoping" part at the end, but it's more likely that he's trying to nicely let Kingdom Hearts fans know that if they expect to see Kingdom Hearts IV during SGF, they might be disappointed.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kena-bridge-of-spirits-xbox-release<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ember Lab has announced that a&nbsp;<em>Kena: Bridge of Spirits&nbsp;</em>Xbox release is happening later this year, with the acclaimed action-adventure game set to debut on Microsoft's consoles in August.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Kena: Bridge of Spirits</em>, which debuted on PlayStation in 2021 before <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kena-bridge-of-spirits-steam-release-and-anniversary-update-announced">hitting PC the following year</a>, will arrive on Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One on August 15th.</p>

<p>The Xbox version of the game will, according to Ember Lab, feature Xbox-exclusive goodies, including "Xbox Exclusive pirate-themed Rot hats" and a unique staff for Kena.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kena-bridge-of-spirits-xbox-release-ghosts.jpg?itok=1ppS_RyY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kena-bridge-of-spirits-xbox-release-ghosts.jpg?itok=i6y2Br9W 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kena: Bridge of Spirits&nbsp;</em>is heading to Xbox soon.</figcaption></figure><p>You'll also be able to pick up a physical Premium Edition of&nbsp;<em>Kena: Bridge of Spirits&nbsp;</em>on Xbox, and it'll come with extra stuff like a soundtrack and a sticker sheet, plus the aforementioned Xbox-exclusive bonuses for the game.</p>

<p>Ember Lab COO Josh Grier says the studio is "thrilled" that&nbsp;<em>Kena&nbsp;</em>is heading to Xbox, and that the new platforms represent the chance to "share Kena's journey with more players". It's hard to argue with that.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Kena: Bridge of Spirits</em>, it's an action-adventure game that draws on influences like&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda</em>; in fact, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbMQfaG6lo8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">viral&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em>-themed short film&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbMQfaG6lo8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Terrible Fate</a>&nbsp;</em>was also created by Ember Lab.</p>

<p><em>Kena: Bridge of Spirits&nbsp;</em>has you playing as the titular Kena, a Spirit Guide in search of a sacred mountain shrine. As she searches for the shrine, she must also help the ghosts of a village trapped in the past to move on.</p>

<p><em>Kena: Bridge of Spirits&nbsp;</em>comes to Xbox on August 15th. It's also already available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1954200/Kena_Bridge_of_Spirits/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/kena-bridge-of-spirits/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>.

            <p>Xbox owners will soon be able to get their hands on Kena: Bridge of Spirits.</p>
<p>The game is set to arrive on both Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S on 15th August, priced £34.99 on the Microsoft Store. It will come with exclusive pirate-themed hats for the Rots - the game's timid and elusive spirits - as well as a unique Kena Staff and a Golden Rot Skin (you can check out how the hats look in the video below).</p>

<p>Those on Xbox Series X will also be able to purchase a Premium physical edition of Kena: Bridge of Spirits, which will include a digital soundtrack and a retail exclusive sticker sheet.</p>
<p>Both versions of the game will also come with Kena: Bridge of Spirits' Anniversary DLC update, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kena-bridge-of-spirits-free-anniversary-update-adds-new-game-plus">arrived on PlayStation and PC back in 2022</a>. This update added New Game Plus as a major addition, as well as other additions such as equipable Charmstones that provided adjustments to stats and abilities.</p>
<p>"We're thrilled to bring the story of Kena to a new audience on Xbox platforms," said Josh Grier, COO of the game's developer Ember Lab. "As our debut game, Kena means a great deal to everyone at the studio and the team is excited to share Kena's journey with more players  - we really hope everyone enjoys meeting Kena and her Rot friends!"</p>
<p>Kena: Bridge of Spirits will be available to pre-order both digitally and physically for Xbox "soon", the team said.</p>

<p>We described the game as "a gorgeous yet unoriginal adventure" in our original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kena-bridge-of-spirits-review-gorgeous-looking-yet-wholly-unoriginal">Kena: Bridge of Spirits review</a>.</p>
<p>"If you've played a decent number of games before," Eurogamer contributor Malindy Hetfeld wrote back in 2021, "it's likely you'll tire of the repetition of well-worn ideas here... This is a game that offers beautiful facsimiles of Zelda, Uncharted, The Pathless, and Pikmin that glide by through its 10 to 15 hour running time. But playing Kena gets very boring, very fast."</p>

			<p>We've finally arrived at the <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-june-date-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Summer Game Fest 2024</a> week, and host Geoff Keighley has provided some advance info for fans <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2162199165" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a Twitch Q&amp;A</a>. To begin with, Keighley tried to temper expectations, saying there won't be many shocking announcements this year:</p>
<p><em>One of the things you'll see with the Summer Game Fest show this week is that we've really tried to program some unexpected things with smaller teams and independent studios alongside the sort of big blockbuster games and franchises that you will see in the show as well, but I think what's cool about our industry right now is that it's a great time where small games can really get significant success as we've seen. I think it's going to be a little bit quieter this Summer when it comes to crazy new announcements and shocking surprises and things like that. That's one of the things I always see online: the crazy speculation. Just like last week with the State of Play, people went in with crazy expectations. I see all this stuff, even around Summer Game Fest, and I think it's going to be a good, solid show, but we're not going to have a new GTA 6 trailer for you. I know sometimes when I see the feedback online people have lots of crazy that they get excited about. Hopefully, we will deliver on some of those things, but I'm sure many things we won't. Hopefully what happens is that people tune in and find something that surprises them.</em></p>
<p>Keighley also talked specifically about games that will or won't be at Summer Game Fest 2024. In the first category, gamers can expect to see a new Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 trailer, a new Metaphor: Refantazio trailer, a new Monster Hunter Wilds trailer, and a new Batman: Arkham Shadow trailer. On the other hand, don't get your hopes up to see Kingdom Hearts 4, Metal Gear Solid: Delta, The Wolf Among Us 2, and Hollow Knight: Silksong.</p>
<p>Keighley's Summer Game Fest 2024 will go live on Friday, June 7, at 2 PM Pacific Time across most platforms and social channels. It is expected to last around two hours.</p>

			<p>Ember Lab's <a href="https://emberlab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kena: Bridge of Spirits</a> will finally launch on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S in a few months, almost three years since its release on PlayStation consoles and PC.</p>
<p>The Xbox Series X|S version of the action-adventure game will launch on August 15th worldwide, complete with some exclusive content such as the pirate-themed Rot hats, a unique Kena Staff, and a Golden Rot Skin.</p>
<p>In partnership with Maximum Entertainment, a physical Premium Edition of Kena: Bridge of Spirits will also be released. It will include the Official Digital Soundtrack, a Retail-Exclusive Sticker Sheet, and the exclusive Xbox-themed content available in the digital edition of the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kena Coming to Xbox -  August 15" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rrqpJuUfYKI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Following its release back in September 2021, Kena: Bridge of Spirits was updated the following year with additional content, such as a New Game Plus mode, new trials that further push the limits of some gameplay mechanics, and more. You can learn more about the Anniversary Update in my<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kena-bridge-of-spirits-anniversary-update-review-trials-of-the-mountain-shrine/"> review</a>.</p>
<p><em>Featuring new content that expands the game in some interesting ways and new trials that push the limit of the game's mechanics, the Kena: Bridge of Spirits Anniversary Update has a lot to offer to returning and new players alike. The new additions aren't particularly game-changing, so those who did not like the original release won't change their opinion with the new content. Those who loved the base game, however, will find a lot to like in the Anniversary Update.</em></p>
<p>Kena: Bridge of Spirits is now out on PC, PlayStation 5, and PlayStation 4. It will launch on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on August 15th.</p>

  <p id="WLkOr4">If you were to jump directly from the first episode of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24107999/star-trek-discovery-season-5-preview"><em>Star Trek: Discovery</em></a> to its finale — which just debuted on Paramount Plus — the whiplash would throw you clear out of your seat like your ship had suffered an inertial damper malfunction. Since its first two chapters premiered on CBS All Access in 2017, the series has moved to a different ship and a different century, and has acquired an almost entirely different set of characters. Moreover, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24119983/star-trek-progenitors-discovery-picard-chase"><em>Discovery</em></a> has received a radical tonal refit, evolving in fits and starts from a dark and violent war story to a much sunnier action-adventure serial. </p>
<p id="2Cu42h">Though it never won the mainstream attention or critical acclaim of its spinoff, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23755316/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-lanthanites-pelia-species-carol-kane"><em>Strange New Worlds</em></a><em>,</em> nor the gushing fan adulation of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23620555/worf-star-trek-picard-season-3-michael-dorn-interview"><em>Picard</em>’s <em>Next Gen</em> reunion</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23345284/star-trek-tv-show-best-start"><em>Discovery</em> spearheaded Star Trek’s return to television</a>, the franchise’s maiden voyage into the frontier of premium streaming content. Like any bold pathfinder, <em>Discovery</em> encountered obstacles, suffered losses, and made some major course corrections. But, if you ask the cast and crew, the adventure has been more than worth the tumultuous journey.</p>
<h2 id="XtieQm"><strong>Tacking into the wind</strong></h2>
<p id="Ugaio7">“We were on wobbly legs for a long time,” admits star Sonequa Martin-Green, whose character, Michael Burnham, has had the rug pulled out from under her a number of times over the course of the series. In the first season and backstory alone, Burnham lost her parents, saw her mentor murdered, was tried for mutiny, discovered that her first love is a Klingon sleeper agent, and was betrayed by not one but two Mirror Universe doppelgängers of trusted Starfleet captains.</p>
<p id="R71ZFb">Move over, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23547617/deep-space-nine-star-trek-ds9-watch-analysis"><em>Deep Space Nine</em></a> — this was instantly the grimmest canonical depiction of the Star Trek universe on screen. Season 1 of <em>Discovery</em> was rated TV-MA and featured more blood and gore than the franchise had ever seen, not to mention an instance of graphic Klingon nudity. (Actor Mary Wiseman recalls seeing her co-star Mary Chieffo walking the set wearing prosthetic alien breasts and thinking, <em>What the hell?</em>) The corpse of Michelle Yeoh’s character is cannibalized by Klingons off screen, and her successor, portrayed by Jason Isaacs, turns out to be a manipulative psycho from the Mirror Universe who tries to mold Burnham into his plaything.</p>

<p id="yTFYTX">The bleak, adult-oriented tone was not the only sticking point with Star Trek purists, as <em>Discovery</em> would take place a decade before the original 1960s <em>Star Trek</em> but have a design aesthetic much closer to that of the 2009 movie reboot, leading to some irreconcilable clashes with continuity. The show’s serialized, season-long arcs were a far cry from the familiar “planet of the week” stories of most previous incarnations of the franchise. Then there was Burnham’s backstory as the never-before-mentioned human foster sister to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23824684/star-trek-spock-strange-new-worlds-actors">Trek’s iconic Vulcan Spock</a>, a creative decision that has “clueless studio note” written all over it. Even ahead of its debut, <em>Discovery</em> faced vocal opposition from the fan base for straying so far from their notion of what Star Trek was supposed to be. (Not to mention the revolting but quite vocal faction of fans who were incensed that Star Trek had “gone woke,” as if it hadn’t been that way the whole time.) Many of <em>Discovery</em>’s detractors flocked toward <em>The Orville</em>, a Fox series starring and created by Seth MacFarlane that was essentially ’90s-style Star Trek with the occasional dick joke thrown in. <em>The Orville </em>offered fans alienated by <em>Discovery</em>’s vastly different approach to Star Trek a more familiar (but far less ambitious) alternative. </p>
<p id="OeE52Z">The grim Klingon War story was the brainchild of co-creator Bryan Fuller, who had been a member of the <em>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</em> and <em>Voyager </em>writers rooms before creating cult series like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22967661/pushing-daisies-bryan-fuller-genre-aids"><em>Pushing Daisies</em></a> and <em>Hannibal</em>. Fuller would end up <a href="https://ew.com/tv/2017/07/28/bryan-fuller-star-trek-discovery/">departing Team Discovery</a> before production even began, asked to resign after a string of creative differences with the studio. New showrunners Aaron Harberts and Gretchen J. Berg carried out a version of Fuller’s plans without him, and then oversaw the show’s first major pivot. <em>Discovery</em>’s second season was immediately brighter, more colorful, and cozier with established Star Trek lore. (This is the arc that would introduce <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23057405/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-creator-anson-mount-pike-masculinity">the versions of Pike</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/2/28/18245209/spock-star-trek-discovery-season-2-changes">Spock</a>, and Number One who now lead <em>Strange New Worlds</em>.) But things weren’t so sunny behind the scenes — <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/star-trek-discovery-showrunners-alex-kurtzman-take-1120416/">Harberts and Berg were fired</a> midway through the season after writers accused the duo of creating an abusive work environment.</p>
<p id="6unkV0">As different as <em>Discovery</em> would eventually stray from the HBO-style drama of its first season, co-creator Alex Kurtzman feels that the mission of the series has never changed. </p>
<p id="0IRyNW">“One of the things that we set up in season 1 is that we knew that Burnham would start as a mutineer and end up a captain,” says Kurtzman. “What was exciting about that is that we knew it would take time.”</p>

<p id="IrZcz7">It was after Harberts and Berg’s departure that Kurtzman, who had remained involved but been primarily occupied with the development of the growing television Star Trek franchise as a whole, took the helm of <em>Discovery</em> himself. Before long, he would promote writer and co-executive producer Michelle Paradise to the role of co-showrunner, which she would retain for the remainder of the series. Just as the late, great Michael Piller did during the third season of <em>The Next Generation</em>, Paradise brought a sense of stability and confidence to <em>Discovery</em>, which reverberated onto set.</p>
<p id="Z0YCgd">“I commend Michelle Paradise and the rest of the writers because this show <em>evolved</em>,” says Martin-Green. “Our initial showrunners, Aaron Harberts and Gretchen Berg, they made their impact and that’ll never be erased, but landing where we did with Michelle co-showrunning with Alex Kurtzman, jumping farther than any Trek had gone before, I feel that’s when our feet were solid on the ground and when we really established our identity.”</p>
<p id="Cb976A">Season 2 fell into a steady rhythm that felt more in tune with Kurtzman’s “movie every week” philosophy, never far in tone from the reboot film trilogy on which Kurtzman served as a writer and producer. The steady presence of Michelle Yeoh’s deliciously amoral Emperor Georgiou was a major boon, essentially becoming Star Trek’s answer to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23069583/buffy-spuffy-elysian-fields-fanfiction"><em>Buffy</em>’s Spike</a> or <em>Dragon Ball Z</em>’s Vegeta. However, <em>Discovery</em> was also undeniably borrowing clout from legacy characters Pike and Spock, and the constant friction with established canon wasn’t sitting well with Kurtzman or the audience.</p>
<p id="lBBM7E">The season ended with a surprising twist that resolved the continuity problems but also changed the entire nature of the show. The titular starship and its crew would be propelled 930 years into the future, past the furthest fixed point in Star Trek’s continuity. No longer forced to tiptoe around the sacred canon, <em>Discovery</em> was free to sprint in a bold new direction. Once again and in a more tangible way, it was a whole new show.</p>
<p id="7Z4xNc">“If the folks who came in had sort of taken us off the rails that would have been a very different experience,” says Anthony Rapp, who portrays the prickly Commander Paul Stamets. “But Michelle Paradise came through as such a shining light and a beautiful presence in our lives. She took the show into this territory of being able to have the heart in its center in a way that felt very grounded and meaningful, and really helped us to make that transition.”</p>

<p id="Qt68Bb">Season 3 of <em>Discovery</em> offered Kurtzman, Paradise, producing director Olatunde Osunsanmi, and the rest of the creative team <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24107999/star-trek-discovery-season-5-preview">a rare opportunity to completely rewrite Star Trek’s galactic map</a>. Not since the launch of <em>The Next Generation</em> in 1987 had a writers room been able to venture onto such “fresh snow,” as Paradise puts it. In the 32nd century, beyond the furthest point explored in the established Trek canon, the righteous United Federation of Planets has all but collapsed in the aftermath of “the Burn,” a mysterious space calamity. Some longtime friends are now adversaries, and even Earth has become an isolationist state. The USS Discovery, displaced in time, becomes the means by which to reconnect the shattered galaxy. It’s not hard to read this as a mission statement for Star Trek as a whole — a relic from another time, back to offer hope to a bleak present.</p>
<p id="vCsiV0">Season 3’s 13-episode arc restored a bit of Star Trek’s space Western roots, with warp drive a rare and costly luxury in the ravaged 32nd century and half the galaxy dominated by a vast criminal empire known as the Emerald Chain. Michael Burnham spent much of the season out of uniform, having found a new purpose as a more roguish freelance courier alongside the sweet and savvy Cleveland Booker (David Ajala). This is arguably the most interesting version of the show, as Michael questions whether or not Starfleet — the institution whose trust she has worked so hard to restore — is still her home.</p>
<p id="QrdSe7">By the end of the season (and right on schedule with Fuller and Kurtzman’s original plans), Michael Burnham finally accepts her destiny and becomes captain of Discovery. More subtly, this altered the premise of the show for a third time, as the central question of “Will Michael ever become captain?” had been answered in the affirmative. But, since she’d already been the central character and a figure of improbable cosmic import, the change was mostly cosmetic. And symbolic — Martin-Green considers her presence “being Black, and a woman, and a captain sitting in that chair” to be her greatest contribution to Star Trek. After three seasons of struggle and uncertainty, Burnham could now be as aspirational a character as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22957090/jean-luc-picard-romance-tng">Picard</a>, Sisko, or <a href="https://www.polygon.com/features/22870436/star-trek-prodigy-cameos-spock-uhura-kobayashi-episode">Janeway</a>.</p>
<p id="FGIWj8">The tone on which the show settled at the end of season 3 would be the one that finally stuck. Where the series had initially been bloody and brooding, it was now squarely an adventure show featuring a cast of characters with a boundless and demonstrative love for each other. The crew would face mortal danger each episode and a galactic-level threat each season, bolstered by very expensive-looking visual effects and a rousing score. At the same time, many conflicts both large and small would eventually be resolved by characters talking through their feelings and finding common ground. This was exhausting as often as it was compelling, but it was consistent. For its final two seasons, viewers could finally know what to expect from <em>Star Trek: Discovery</em>.</p>
<h2 id="EGuRvE"><strong>Discovering itself</strong></h2>
<p id="V1bjxn"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/22924014/star-trek-discovery-character-emotions">This “feelings over phasers” approach</a> was not for everyone, but it was never intended to be. Even from the outset, before Paramount began pumping out more Star Trek series to target different facets of the fan base, <em>Discovery</em> was never meant to be a definitive Star Trek experience that checked every box.</p>
<p id="SPj4Dq">“You’ll never be able to be everything to everybody,” says Michelle Paradise. “The goal was always to make the best version of <em>Discovery</em>. It’s a different kind of Star Trek. It’s serialized, it’s fewer episodes, it’s a movie every week. That’s a thing that will appeal to many people, and for some people it won’t be their cup of tea.”</p>

<p id="CZZ4WU"><em>Discovery</em> has bounced up and down my personal ranking of Star Trek series a number of times during its run, more than any of its past or present siblings. I have begun each season of the show with great excitement, and that excitement is frequently exhausted by season’s end. Most Trek series have good years and bad years. To me, <em>Discovery</em> suffers from being simultaneously brilliant, innovative, lazy, cringe, inspiring, and eye-rolling at all times, only in different measures. It features the franchise’s strongest lead actor since Patrick Stewart, and a supporting cast that has never been leveraged to my satisfaction. In my career, I have written more words about <em>Star Trek: Discovery</em> than any other television series, and I still haven’t made up my mind about it. For as many cheerleaders and haters as the show must have, I imagine there are many more viewers who feel the way I do — it’s a show that I wanted to love, but never fully fell in love with.</p>
<p id="V0r8GI">As <em>Discovery</em> disappears in the aft viewport, some will bid it a fond farewell, some will be blowing it raspberries, and some will turn away with total disinterest. But regardless of how well <em>Discovery</em> itself is remembered in the coming years, it has already made a substantial impact on the franchise. It paved the way for every Trek series that followed, including <em>three</em> direct spinoffs. Its second season was the incubator for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23799328/star-trek-kirk-spock-snw-strange-new-worlds"><em>Strange New Worlds</em></a>, now the most acclaimed Trek series in a generation. Michelle Yeoh had such fun in her recurring role on <em>Discovery</em> that, even <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23636975/oscars-2023-michelle-yeoh-best-actress-speech">after winning an Academy Award</a>, she was still <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23637514/star-trek-michelle-yeoh-section-31-show-release">keen to return for the upcoming <em>Section 31</em> TV movie</a>. <em>Discovery</em>’s 32nd-century setting will continue to be explored in the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23663131/star-trek-starfleet-academy-show-paramount-plus-release">new <em>Starfleet Academy</em> series</a>, leaving the door open for some of its characters to return.</p>
<p id="F1TwWO">Even the new shows that have no direct relationship to <em>Discovery</em> have benefitted from the precedent it set by being different from what came before. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23735961/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-season-2-trailer-lower-decks"><em>Lower Decks</em></a> is an animated sitcom, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22753008/star-trek-prodigy-review-kate-mulgrew-janeway"><em>Prodigy</em> is a kid-targeted cartoon</a>, <em>Picard</em> is… <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23691934/picard-season-3-finale-review">a bunch of different things that don’t work together</a>, but they are all different shows. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-trek">Star Trek</a> was one thing, and beginning with <em>Discovery</em>, it became many things. And for Star Trek, an institution that preaches the value of infinite diversity in infinite combinations, that’s a legacy to be proud of. </p>
<p id="4CSt25"><small><em>Star Trek: Discovery</em></small><small> is now streaming in full on Paramount Plus. </small></p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/baldursgate3/status/1797586744088621138" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on Twitter/X, the Baldur’s Gate 3 team announced that the anticipated Patch 7 update will arrive sometime in September 2024, adding official modding tools.</p>



<p>The post adds that a closed alpha begins today, and that a closed beta is coming in July. The Beta will be capped at about 1,000 players. Larian previously <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-will-introduce-first-official-modding-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced in April</a> that Patch 7 will introduce the first official modding tools. </p>



<p>During a community update, the devs explained that players will get to “change up visuals, animations, sounds, stats, and more.”</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Coming to you this September, Patch 7 will introduce an official modding toolkit so you can bring your wildest ideas to life!</p><p>💬Closed Alpha Begins Today<br>🗓️Closed Beta – July<br>🛠️Modding FAQ</p><p>Read more in Community Update #27 – Official Modding Support: <a href="https://t.co/lwdOkUUUOa">https://t.co/lwdOkUUUOa</a> <a href="https://t.co/EOwNFqh3gt">pic.twitter.com/EOwNFqh3gt</a></p></div>— Baldur's Gate 3 (@baldursgate3) <a href="https://twitter.com/baldursgate3/status/1797586744088621138?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 3, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>In community update 27 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4179982568653520452" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Steam</a>, the devs elaborated on further details. The devs reiterated plans for fixes, Crossplay, and an in-game Photo Mode. However, they also teased some “anniversary extravagance.” </p>



<p>For Patch 7, the devs confirmed that PC players will be the first to use and install mods. Then, they will be available for “Mac players, as well as PlayStation and Xbox consoles” later on. Today’s post does not confirm exact release dates.</p>



<p>However, fans playing Baldur’s Gate 3 on console will only get to browse existing mods, rather than modding their own.  The devs confirmed that “the official modding tools themselves will not be available to those playing on console.”</p>



<p>Today’s post also mentions that the toolkit will include “a subset of our internal development tools.” This will allow players to edit mods, upload to mod.io servers, get access to supported asset types, and more.</p>



<p>Baldur’s Gate 3 developer Larian Studios also recently announced it is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-3-developer-larian-studios-opening-new-studio-in-warsaw/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opening a seventh studio</a> located in Warsaw. The announcement comes as Larian looks ahead to two ambitious new RPGs.</p>

But on the downside, this is a world in which magic is a bit embarrassing.</p><p>Still, you’ve got something special. You alone have the ability to use Leximancy, a hitherto unimaginable power driven by something as fascinating as it is enchanting: language.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Leximancy is an endlessly fun branch of magic, but it is also a risk of buttock-clenching magnitude. Years ago you caused THINGS to happen, and ever since then you’ve been banished to the school basement with the other failures- I mean learners.</p><p>Your life as a humble basement-wizard is interrupted as Academy Elementinia is attacked by someone with a baffling agenda and a huge set of fireballs.</p><p>Don your trusty hat, ready your lexicon, become the outcast that saves the school.

Summon. Soothe. Enlarge. Enrage. Explode. Have a little sleep. Succeed strangely, or sit back and enjoy your failures. There are hundreds of different ways to play this game, and the best way is your way.</li><li><strong>Go Explore</strong> – It’s an absolute situation out there. The magical wilds are delirious with magic, the people of the cities hate wizards like you, and there are prisons.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Last of Us Part II Remastered - Features Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>After Naughty Dog canceled The Last of Us Online in 2023, the developer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dog-has-two-single-player-games-in-development-described-as-ambitious-and-brand-new/1100-6519980/" data-ref-id="1100-6519980">confirmed it had multiple single-player games in development.</a> These games remain unannounced, but Druckmann has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-sounds-more-likely-than-ever/1100-6520812/" data-ref-id="1100-6520812">strongly suggested one will be The Last of Us: Part III.</a></p><p>"I've been thinking--is there a concept there [for The Last of Us 3]? For, now years, I haven't been able to find that concept. But recently that's changed," he said in comments published in 2024. "I don't have a story. But I do have that concept that is, to me, as exciting as 1, as exciting as 2. As its own thing, and yet has this throughline for all three. So it does feel like there's probably one more chapter to this story."</p><p>Beyond another entry in The Last of Us series, could Naughty Dog return to the Uncharted series? Don't get your hopes up for that, as Naughty Dog has said it is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dog-is-done-with-uncharted-and-might-not-make-last-of-us-3-neil-druckmann-says/1100-6510879/" data-ref-id="1100-6510879">"done" with the franchise </a>(though a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/uncharted-5-could-happen-with-another-developer-di/1100-6438426/" data-ref-id="1100-6438426">different team could, of course, make Uncharted 5</a>).</p><p>Druckmann is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-director-confirms-hes-writing-and-directing-a-new-game/1100-6516818/" data-ref-id="1100-6516818">writing and directing a new game</a>, but he can't say what it is just yet. "I know the fans really want The Last of Us: Part III, I hear about it all the time," Druckmann said in 2023. "All I can say is that we're already into our next project, the decision has already been made. I can't say what it is."</p><p>Some also believe that Naughty Dog might turn its attention to a totally new genre, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fans-think-the-last-of-us-part-1-is-teasing-naughty-dogs-next-ip/1100-6507123/" data-ref-id="1100-6507123">fantasy</a>, for its next game, which could be a new IP.</p><p>Druckmann recently made headlines for calling out the editing of an interview he did with his own company. While Sony removed the interview from its website, <a href="https://x.com/Neil_Druckmann/status/1794187395279253837" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Druckmann uploaded his raw, unedited answers</a>, in which he said he is currently working on a "dream" project. He said, "It's maybe the most excited I've been for a project yet."</p><p>Sony's recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/state-of-play-may-2024-all-the-biggest-ps5-announcements-and-games/2900-5435/" data-ref-id="2900-5435">State of Play briefing</a> had no details on any future Naughty Dog games. Many are expecting Sony to conduct its next PlayStation Showcase later this year, and if that happens, it could be a venue for Naughty Dog to announce a new project, but this is just speculation.</p>

        <p>Exec will discuss the potential for expanding IP across all forms of entertainment with games investor Jon Goldman</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>The organisers of Gamescom Latam have announced David Alpert, CEO of Skybound Entertainment, as its inaugural keynote speaker.</p>
<p>Alpert — who is also known as the executive producer behind The Walking Dead and Invincible — will take part in a fireside chat with video games investor Jon Goldman on June 28, midway through the first ever Gamescom Latam.</p>
<p>During their session, entitled 'Expansion of IP and games', the pair will discuss the state of the games industry, as well as the opportunities for video games IP in other forms of entertainment (and vice versa).</p>
<p>"Being the keynote speaker at Gamescom Latam is an honor," said Alpert. "This inaugural event is a testament to the global reach of gaming culture, which never fails to bring together diverse communities to foster the future of games.</p>
<p>"We've reached a critical time in the industry where expanding our intellectual properties across movies, TV, games, and immersive realities is about more than just entertainment; it's about creating interconnected universes that immerse audiences in storytelling like never before."</p>
<p>Gamescom Latam CEO Gustavo Steinberg added:  "David and Jon's involvement marks a pivotal moment for Gamescom Latam as we explore the intersection of storytelling and gaming.</p>
<p>"The expansion of intellectual properties across platforms is not merely a trend but a fundamental shift in how we engage with content. David's profound knowledge of this phenomenon will undoubtedly enrich our audience's understanding and inspire new avenues of creative exploration."</p>
<p>Announced earlier this year, Gamescom Latam is a brand new event that encompasses and builds on the foundations of the BIG Festival in Brazil.</p>
<p>It will run from June 26 to 30 in São Paulo, Brazil, and is the product of a partnership between Gamecom organiser Koelnmesse, German trade body Game, BIG Festival, and pop culture and events firm Omelete Company.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/gamescom-latam-launching-in-2024-merging-with-big-festival">we spoke to the organisers</a> to find out more about their ambitions for the event.</p>
<section><p>GamesIndustry.biz is a media partner for Gamescom Latam and will be attending with the support of the organisers.</p></section>

What inspired the creation of this game? Why explore egg frying in a chilly future?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Keven Brown</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: So frying eggs in the future was definitely not what I initially set out to do. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Arctic Eggs</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> began as a much larger and more complex project. The initial idea was that you are actually a fast-food worker working night shifts, hoping to save up enough money for a plane ticket to Antarctica. It was meant to feature tons of cooking activities and ingredients, but after months and months of work, nothing really felt fun in a meaningful way except for just flipping eggs around in a pan. At the time, I really didn't believe I could make a full game with just that one mechanic, so I moved on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Later, as I was knee-deep in another project, I played </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tales From Off-Peak City</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a game where all you do is make pizzas, talk to people, and explore the world. It is deceptively simple and I loved it. I figured once I was done with this bigger project I would try to make something like this with the frying pan mechanic I made prior. As luck would have it, shortly afterward, Youtuber Dunkey announced he was hosting a two-week-long game jam, and I figured this would be a quick way to get this idea out of my system.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The futuristic part of the game wasn't well thought out at first. While working on another project called </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ettare</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, I met CDbunker2. He is not only a skilled 3D artist but also an incredibly fast worker. Because of this, I knew if I wanted to make something really interesting I needed his help on the project. I doubted I would be able to convince him to abandon </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ettare</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for a few weeks to help out on a random cooking game. So, in order to maybe create a bit more intrigue around the idea, I decided to just tack on some sort of sci-fi twist to the whole thing. Thankfully, this was just enough to spark his interest and get him excited about the entire prospect. And just as I hoped, bringing him on board transformed the game into something special and unique. It became as much about storytelling as it was about cooking.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Can you tell us the thoughts that went into the game's complex frying system and tying that action to mouse movements?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So, the frying itself is extremely simple. You move your mouse, and it tilts the pan, and you need to keep the pan moving to generate heat. I had to fight really hard with myself to keep it that way throughout development because I think that's where the success of the game comes from. The lack of options allows anyone, in less than a few seconds, to be completely ready for any challenge I throw at you, allowing the actual levels to be pretty open in how you decide to navigate them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Also, this lack of complexity in the frying pan forces you to pay much more attention to the food itself. The shape and positioning are incredibly important, and throughout the game, you learn what each food is capable of and how best to maneuver it. Because of this, though, that means that the challenge of the game is completely dependent on you, because there are no tricks/upgrades/stats to make the game easier. It's all about your understanding of the frying pan and what you have to do to best maneuver what's inside it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What challenges went into making this control scheme feel comfortable and getting the motion of flipping eggs and other foods to feel somewhat intuitive?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So, the biggest challenge, as I mentioned before, was sticking to the incredibly simple control scheme because moving the mouse to tilt the pan was, thankfully, a very intuitive process right from the start, and I was worried I would mess that up if I kept adding to it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the jam version of the game, you will notice some features that were present that got removed in the final version that's releasing soon. A big one was the ability to use WASD to move the pan around a little bit. My thinking was that if you flipped something poorly, you would get the chance to try to catch the falling food by adjusting your pan’s position. Granted, this did work for the most part; however (and you can see even see this in Dunkey’s stream of the game), players would mistakenly think that WASD was more important than mouse movement, leading to some extreme frustration early on, where they would just be mashing WASD hoping that the egg would hit the edge of the pan just right and with enough momentum to flip it over.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This, and one or two other pan abilities, just kind of muddied the waters, in my opinion. It was like I was telling players that there is a way to circumnavigate learning the ins and outs of the pan/physics when, in reality, there is not, and any time spent trying something different is time wasted in my eyes.</span></p><p>Images via The Water Museum.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What thoughts went into creating the different (sometimes odd) cooking requests the characters will ask the player? How did you design these around challenging the player with your cooking systems?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When coming up with new ingredients for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Arctic Eggs</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, it always began with the question of, “How can I add a new challenge that gets in the way of egg flipping?” and then thinking of a food item or object that would justify that challenge.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the most basic challenges in most other cooking games is “don’t burn the food” and that was the first challenge I tried for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Arctic Eggs</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as well. That is pretty easy to add—the part that really matters, though, is how this is communicated to the player. The video game-y thing to do would be to make some sort of UI element that indicates a food's health. I attempted this, but I hated everything I tried. It felt like it was no longer the frying pan and I taking on this world; it was me, the frying pan, and this out-of-place little UI hovering above the food babying me. That is when the cigarette ingredient was born. It provided a unique and UI-free method to indicate the remaining time via how much of the cigarette is left. And since I made this so early on in development (I think it was the first thing I made after the eggs), it really set the tone for the rest of the game. I decided any additional ingredient I make should make sense visually with the challenge at hand without any UI.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“I want an ingredient that you have to be more careful with.” Okay… Maybe a beer that you don't want tipping over and spilling everywhere? “I want an ingredient that you have to fight to keep in the pan.” Maybe a cockroach that scurries to the edge and tries to jump out? “I want an ingredient that you have to toss OUT of the pan.” Maybe a bullet that explodes if it gets too hot?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There were so many non-food related ideas I had that were built on top of the egg-flipping foundation, and since the cigarette itself&nbsp;is introduced so early on in the game I think players are very willing to accept it as a valid request in this world.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What thoughts went into the design of this grim Antarctic settlement? What feelings did you want the environments to evoke as the player wandered through here and fed people?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So, to get myself in a sci-fi headspace, I watched a ton of Cowboy Bebop (fantastic anime if you have never watched it) during the game jam, and I remember feeling a bit stuck on what the city should feel like near the beginning. Frustrated, I just decided to watch the show with my full attention instead of just having it off to the side. The Jupiter Jazz episodes just happened to be playing at the time. The city in those specific episodes is very cold and sparse, but because of how isolating it is, it feels as lifeless as a desert. The people there are all pretty indifferent towards their situation and each other. They aren't really sad; it just seems like the only glint of happiness they feel is when they are just hanging out together in the bar, listening to some guy play his saxophone. After watching these episodes, I remember thinking how perfectly that aligned with what I wanted to do.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The somewhat depressing brutalist aesthetic of the outer city was definitely born just out of necessity for the game jam. I didn't really think too much of it at the time. It is relatively easy to achieve a convincing brutalist city look with a couple of cement textures and some windowed rectangles. The city in the Jupiter Jazz episodes did have a ton of detail to them—ads hung up everywhere, pipes wrapping around other pipes—but with less than a week to finish everything, that type of busy look would have taken too long.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, what’s interesting is what happened after the jam. I tried going back and sprucing things up, making things more “interesting,” but anything I tried just felt dishonest to the world. You are in Antarctica, the people are cold, hungry, and smoking cigarettes constantly. Something is clearly wrong here and making the environments more suited for people didn't feel right. The people barely belong here.&nbsp;I think the harshness of the environment is what really motivates players as well. Ultimately, you, as the player in the world, are inconsequential. You aren't trying to be a hero or kill the bad guy. You are just feeding people. I think that almost feels more important than saving the day when in contrast with the environment. Like you are just trying to be a tiny little moment of warmth for individuals in this cold, uninviting city.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Likewise, what ideas went into the designs of the characters players would be cooking for?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The initial idea for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Arctic Eggs</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> involved people at a rooftop party in a future Antarctic city. They needed cold-weather clothes but still looked like they'd come to have a good time. Above all else, I wanted them to be a little bit strange and off-putting on first impression to justify the weird stuff they ingest throughout the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">CDbunker2 handled most of the character modeling in the game, and he writes this about their design/look: “The characters owe a heavy debt to fashion designers like Walter Van Beirendonck as well as comic books like Transmetropolitan and the hyper-detailed background characters in the works of Geoff Darrow. The nose tubes, cyborg parts, and random details are all attempts to suggest a typical cyberpunk future where people take part in extreme fads with drugs and body modification.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As the game developed its own feel, I tried to make the characters suggest a disaffected, disassociated sort of mood. They're contemplative, maybe bored, and always waiting to be fed, entertained, or to smoke another cigarette. Also, most importantly, as a designer, they had to look interesting. The players should want to come up to them. Even the menacing soldiers.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What drew you to explore storytelling through food and cooking for people? How did you weave frying eggs into the stories that people tell you as you cook for them in </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Arctic Eggs</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Storytelling is one of the main things I wanted to explore with the game. Cooking in video games has been represented in many different ways already, whether it is used to demonstrate the technical intricacies of the culinary arts, explore a certain culture, or even just as a low-stakes break from a game’s main focus. But, in my opinion, the social aspect of cooking/eating has been kind of put on the back burner in most cooking games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Cooking or eating makes for an incredibly welcoming setting when trying to tell a story because functionally when eating or cooking in a group setting, you are meant to just sit for a long period of time and mingle. As an inexperienced writer, I find it hard to tell a complex story naturally because I never want to come across as preachy, especially when it comes to lore. In real life, when was the last time you got a huge exposition dump about the history of our world from someone you just met? Or even someone you have known for awhile? I rarely do. In games, whenever this happens, I find myself skipping the dialogue. I feel like it's easy to see that it's not a real world I am learning about, it's just a writer going “Look at me! I am writing something interesting! Look!”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rarely in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Arctic Eggs</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> does someone say anything outwardly important to you because these are strangers who don't really know you. This created an atmosphere that I think a lot of people found refreshing in the game. This is a setting where people are eating, so mingling with them feels natural—there is a story, but you genuinely don't have to engage with it if you don't want to because these characters have far more to say about mundane things they deal with every day.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The game is like being at a cookout, I think. The food is definitely the main selling point but it's really all just an excuse to get a big group together and socialize.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What interested you about exploring human connection and condition in a bleak future through cooking for people? What is it about cooking and eating that can help weave unique shared connections between people all over the world, and how did you want to use those feelings in </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Arctic Eggs</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I think many cooking games do a fantastic job at exploring human connection through cooking. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Venba</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Nainai’s Recipe</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> come to mind. Both are incredibly beautiful games about culture, heritage, and reconnecting with something or someone through the act of making food. Cooking is a uniquely human ritual where we are expected to slow down and mingle, so it is unsurprising that so many cooking games are able to tell incredibly personal and emotional stories.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Arctic Eggs</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is also about connecting with others, but I think what sets it apart is the emphasis is taken off of the food itself. Most of the food in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Arctic Eggs</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is kinda gross and unappetizing. The ingredients used are also repeated throughout at varying quantities, so it's hard to really make a connection with it. Because of this, though, the emphasis is on what the character says before you feed them (and sometimes after). This stranger who you would have probably walked right by (if you weren't specifically looking for another mouth to feed) has a life and you get a glimpse at what they care/worry about.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Arctic Eggs</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the food might not be appealing, but it's the vehicle that brings players into these unique exchanges with people you would have never connected with otherwise. Each interaction adds a layer to the story, making the mundane act of feeding someone a profound experience of connection and understanding.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/06/03/neil-druckmann-says-naughty-dog-will-not-be-the-last-of-us-studio-forever-multiple<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Naughty Dog won't be The Last of Us studio forever, according to studio president Neil Druckmann. He told the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/l-a-influential/story/2024-06-02/neil-druckmann-the-last-of-us-video-game"><em>LA Times</em></a>&nbsp;this in a new interview, which is where he also said the studio has multiple single-player projects in development, as reported by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/we-will-not-be-the-last-of-us-studio-forever-naughty-dogs-neil-druckmann-says/"><em>VideoGamesChronicle</em></a>.</p>

<p>"I promise you, we will not be The Last of Us studio forever," Druckmann said, revealing the team is working on "multiple single-player projects." He continued, adding, "We create experiences that are steeped in story and characters, especially relationships. The stories have some sort of philosophical core that everything is going to revolve around and feed into."</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CpqyeBP-_14" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Elsewhere in the interview, Druckmann told the&nbsp;<em>LA Times</em>&nbsp;he came up with the idea about a man and a girl crossing a post-apocalyptic landscape – the premise of The Last of Us – in college. He planned to get that story out of his head one day as a graphic novel. Even after getting hired at Naughty Dog, he didn't bring up this story to the studio, he said. Instead, he was given the task of recreating <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/games/jak_and_daxter_collection/b/ps3/archive/2012/02/07/jak-and-daxter-collection-updates-a-classic-ps2-trilogy.aspx">Jak and Daxter</a> into "something more reality-based," the publication writes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, he and those on the task were struggling. They went to Naughty Dog's then-president Evan Wells, who retired last year, and asked, "Do we need to do Jak and Daxter?" Wells said no, and Druckmann told the&nbsp;<em>LA Times</em>, "Immediately the lightbulb went off" as the time for what would become The Last of Us had arrived. And the rest is history.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HKFJhbjlJaw" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>This interview follows Druckmann's recent interview with PlayStation, which resulted in a public rebuttal of the interview by Druckmann, with him claiming he was heavily misquoted, and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/29/update-sony-pulls-down-heavily-misquoted-neil-druckmann-interview-and-apologizes-for">PlayStation eventually pulling the interview down completely</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Word of multiple single-player projects in development at Naughty Dog follows news from last December where <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/12/14/naughty-dog-ceases-development-of-the-last-of-us-online">Naughty Dog canceled its Last of Us live-service multiplayer project after years of development</a>.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/mw3-players-are-sick-of-old-guns-getting-nerfed-into-the-ground-every-season/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=mw3-players-are-sick-of-old-guns-getting-nerfed-into-the-ground-every-season<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="244" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It started off as a meme, grew into a theory, and now is widely accepted by the community: When new guns are added into <em>Modern Warfare 3</em>, Sledgehammer makes them way too powerful and nerf older guns into the ground, and players are sick of it. </p> <p data-characters="357" data-current-count="357" data-injectable="false">Every season, Sledgehammer will introduce at least one new weapon to the game, giving completionists a weapon to rank up. This is a good idea in theory, but what you find is that any new gun added is immediately the best in the game, and dominates the meta for weeks, while older guns that have been in the game before have their effectiveness turned down. </p> <p data-characters="152" data-current-count="509" data-injectable="true">This causes great frustration among fans, and FlowKom took specific offense to this on Reddit, complaining about how the launch of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-kar98k-loadout-in-mw3-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kar98k</a> has gone. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>It’s been a controversial return for the Kar98k. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="251" data-current-count="551" data-injectable="true">“New gun=good, Old gun=bad,” wrote the <em>CoD </em>fan. “That’s their entire philosophy for balance. There’s no reason for the SP-R and SA-B to be utterly useless while the Kar98k is the new best sniper in the entire game.”</p>
 <p data-characters="244" data-current-count="244" data-injectable="false">FlowKom made their point by showing the effective damage range for the Kar98k and the SP-R208. While the Kar98k is powerful up to 50.8m, the SPR208 only has a damage range of 13m, which is almost four times less powerful than the new inclusion.</p> <p data-characters="507" data-current-count="751" data-injectable="true">Unsurprisingly, the comments were largely in agreement with the post, with one fan writing: “I get they want to make the new guns better than the old ones, but they didn’t have to make the old ones that bad,” while another questioned the process entirely: “I personally don’t see the point in making your new gun [overpowered] when we know it’ll get nerfed into the ground later. Is the appeal that you get a couple of weeks of enjoyment where you feel like a god?”</p>
 <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="326" data-injectable="false">It’s having a clear effect though. As shown by <a href="https://wzstats.gg/mw3/meta" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WZStats.gg</a>, the Kar98k is currently the most-picked weapon in the game at 5.37%. The SP-R208’s pickrate? 0.02%. Clearly, something isn’t quite right with Sledgehammer’s balancing principles, and I, along with other <em>MW3</em> fans, would love to see it changed. </p>

			<p>Witches cast curses on you, fawns walk the streets, and you’ve found a missing glass slipper. You might think you know the rest of this particular story, but the question that Fabledom poses for you is whether to return that glass slipper to its owner or pawn it to swell your kingdom’s coffers. Fabledom is a city builder with a severe case of the bedtime stories, merging a traditional dose of laying down pathways, houses and woodcutters with princesses, dragons and evil witches. It’s an approachable and fun take on a genre that often takes itself a bit too seriously, and it’s all the better for it.</p>
<p><iframe title="FABLEDOM - 1.0 Launch &amp; Console Preorder Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NtCwO_YUbKQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>When I say that Fabledom is a traditional city-builder, that’s perhaps selling it short. Sure, the first thing you have to do is start chopping down trees and building houses, but there’s a series of well though-out wrinkles to the formula to make you sit up and take notice. Building a house, or several other structures, requires you to build corresponding attachments, whether that’s a garden, which you can lay out with a selection of different furniture, or a storage unit’s palettes of useful material. It immediately means that your little hamlet looks more unique, and more lively, and that your Fablings have a much more interesting home to tootle about in.</p>


<p>There’s a surprising level of additional depth to the building shenanigans too, bringing in more advanced features like ensuring that homes have access to water and sanitation and that your kingdom has a decent stock of coal in preparation for the winter. You also have to consider the attractiveness of an area if you’re going to build homes there. Pop down a bakery and everyone in the vicinity will be happier. If it’s a sawmill instead, be prepared for some unhappy faces, and far less chance you’ll attract new citizens to join you.</p>


<p>Those new citizens are the lifeblood of your domain, as they provide daily taxes with which you expand your reach, and as the workers in your key locations. It’s often a juggling act, as you reach the limits of your undeniably cute workforce, but need to continue expanding or stocking up for the winter. This is where Fabledom takes things a little too slowly, and I often found myself punching the game speed to the highest rate while I waited for a woodcutter to decide to chop enough trees down, or a mason to pump out enough stone bricks. I’m all for relaxed, but the developer might need to make a few tweaks here to the output levels of some structures.</p>
<p>Once you’ve laid the foundations of your kingdom, there’s a real push to beautify and titivate your land with flowers, gardens and additional furniture. You’ll finish up with a city that’s far more attractive than in any other city builder. The cute visuals are more in the vein of The Settlers, or its recent spiritual successor Pioneers of Pagonia, and when you add in the fairytale aspects as well I can see this being a huge success with younger gamers, particularly when it arrives on console later in the year. That said, there’s a lot to balance here so they might need some adult assistance along the way.</p>

<p>So, where do the fables come in? Once you’ve reached a certain point in proceedings, you unlock a Hero. This mighty knight can be equipped with all manner of equipment that you find along the way, and while he’s your greatest warrior he’s also something of a busybody, heading out to explore your kingdom and sticking his nose into all manner of fairytale nonsense. You’re generally presented with a choice of how to proceed, so a talking tree you encounter might offer a boon to the growth of your trees, or you can chop him down for a big payday. There’s a fun and slightly tongue-in-cheek tone to everything in Fabledom, and I really enjoyed its mildly subversive take on some classic fairytale stories.</p>
<p>There are, of course, battles to be won as well. As a city builder you must raise an army to protect your lands, and perhaps to conquer others. However, you can simply try to stay safe within the walls of your kingdom, building immense structures and siting weaponry on top of them to keep the invaders out. It’s hugely appealing, and just as with the rest of the experience, there’s a steady stream of upgrades to keep everything moving forward.</p>

            <p>
Baldur's Gate 3 will finally add official mod support in September, after a summer of ongoing testing - which begins today.
</p>
<p>
Patch 7, which will include the game's modding toolkit, begins testing now via a closed alpha which will run for around a month. In July, a further 1000 players will be added, as part of a closed beta. 
</p>
<p>
The idea is that the alpha test will develop mod tools and bring over existing mods, while the beta test will then provide feedback on these. That should then take everyone through to September, when Patch 7 rolls out for everyone.

<p>
"With the intention of working through your feedback throughout the summer, it will give us time to polish off Patch 7 ready for release in September," Larian wrote today in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4179982568653520452">blog post</a> on Steam. 
</p>
<p>
"In the meantime, we still have plenty coming your way, including some anniversary extravagance as we look back on the months since release. We're also still pressing on with the development of an in-game photo mode, crossplay, and more fixes that will arrive later down the line!"
</p>
<p>
The blog post goes into detail on why the modding support is important - to avoid issues with game stability and compatibility - and detail how it will work, using Mod.io to enable support for all platforms. 
</p>
<p>
"Releasing first on PC, we expect to roll out the support to the wider community and various platforms shortly after - including for Mac players, as well as PlayStation and Xbox consoles," Larian continued.
</p>
<p>
There's detail too on which mods may fall foul of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons license.
</p>
<p>
"Our goal with mod.io and our partners is to strike a balance that allows for extensive modding while keeping the guidelines in mind," Larian wrote. "While some NSFW mods and certain script-heavy modifications may not be supported through the official pipeline, modding outside of our pipeline will still be an option."
</p>
<p>
Larian Studios boss Swen Vincke recently discussed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-studios-ceo-says-we-did-have-to-do-a-bit-of-crunch-making-baldurs-gate-3">the need to "do a bit of crunch" making Baldur's Gate 3</a>, but only "very, very, very rarely".

            <p>I'm sure you could fill a bottomless pit with the things Larian decided not to add to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a>. One of those things was, in fact, a bottomless pit. Not just a bottomless pit, but a conveniently portable, Looney Tunes-esque hole into which you could seemingly chuck everything from items and equipment to characters. Speaking to me during the same interview in which they discussed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-baldurs-gate-3-might-have-brought-back-candlekeep-the-library-fortress-where-baldurs-gate-began">long-abandoned plans for bringing back Baldur’s Gate 1’s Candlekeep</a>, Larian CEO Swen Vincke and Baldur’s Gate 3 lead writer Adam Smith (RPS in peace) touched on the subject with tantalising brevity. Argh, if only I hadn’t had to run off and catch a taxi, I’d still be there now, discussing the many applications of a portable hole. Bypassing carrying capacity limits would just be the start of it.</p>
<p>The hole came up during a discussion of whether Larian have considered testing any smaller, more focussed videogame concepts, perhaps to let younger developers try their wits on something less sprawling than a Baldur’s Gate. “Oh, you mean within Larian in terms of incubation? But there's always stuff happening that you never see,” Vincke began. “I think people still underestimate how much work these big <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPGs</a> are already, and how many components there are in there - you never see a lot of small things that are being done, but there's a lot of innovation happening, other things that never see the daylight.”</p>
<p>“You see small groups, and juniors in those small groups, you know, they'll bring the things that they care about,” Adam added. “You can see, I think, in Baldur’s Gate 3 that there a lot of scripters who are immersive sim fans, and who are bringing ideas from elsewhere. The world is sandboxy, and within that they are playing with their favourite genres. I get to play with horror, you know, one of my favourite genres, in the storytelling. An RPG of that scale, you’re kind of making lots of things all at the same time. So there's definitely the space to do that.”</p>
<p>There’d have been even more space if one particular cosmic impossibility hadn’t been left on the cutting room floor. “There's one mechanic in particular that I'm thinking of that they brought in,” said Vincke, apparently in reference to the aforesaid scripters. “It was fantastic. It was just we couldn't make it work in all cases, so we had to remove it, but it was fantastic. And it was a portable hole, which is like a mechanic, so you could basically throw down a hole, you can throw people in it, and then you could do start doing all kinds of abusive mechanics in the game.” My audio is a bit smudgy here – Vincke may have said “abusive” or “abuse of mechanics”, both of which would make sense in context.</p>
<p>Larian’s QA staff ultimately “vetoed” the idea, which strikes me as a display of utmost sanity and powerful self-respect from testers who do not wish to spend the rest of their mortal lives hotfixing a pocket-sized infinity. “When you see all the things that [our QA director] had to go through just to be able to test this game - really, adding anything else to that would have been a crime against humanity,” Vincke noted.</p>
<p>Still, we players do not have to worry about patching out bugs and exploits, and are free to mourn the hole-based playthroughs that might have been. Seriously, I can think of <em>any</em> number of uses for a portable bottomless pit and barely any of them are sexual. The obvious one is trying to dump the entirety of Baldur's Gate 3 inside it – mindflayers, tieflings, cheese, Medallions of +5 Whatever, rehaired cats, cities, the Underdark, etcetera.</p>
<p>I can imagine an endgame version of the Sword Coast that consists of Tav balancing on the last remaining barrel, hole in hand, surrounded by coruscating silver strands of pure absence. Tav catches your gaze and winks. Then they stuff <em>themselves</em> into the hole, from ankle to head, reaching out as they vanish to grab the barrel and yank it into the hole as though corking a bottle. Years later, while playing Larian's next game (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-dont-know-what-their-next-game-is-yet-but-it-wont-be-baldurs-gate-4-or-baldurs-gate-3-dlc">not Baldur's Gate 4</a>), you notice a strange little dark spot. You right-click the spot and the entirety of Baldur's Gate 3 appears in your inventory. Hopefully, we'll have bigger SSDs by then.</p>

            <p>
Abubakar Salim, creator of the recent Tales of Kenzera: Zau, has addressed the "fever pitch" of "constant targeted harassment" the studio has received since the release of the game.
</p>
<p>
The game is inspired by Salim's own story of grief and set in an Afrofuturist world based on Bantu Tales and African folklore.
</p>
<p>
However, in a video posted to X, Salim responded to the abuse received and announced a price drop for the game on Switch.

<p>
"We are being faced with constant targeted harassment from people who see diversity as a threat, from people who look across the vast landscape of modern media and decide that anything that doesn't speak to them or centres around them is unnecessary and inauthentic," he said.
</p>
<p>
"There's always a reason diverse stories can't exist. It's either we're doing it the wrong way or it's just there to tick boxes. And it's just beginning to feel like there is no right way, these exclusionary rules just continue to stack up and the goalposts continue to shift until me, my studio, people who look like us just sit down, be quiet and just accept the fact that you're outsiders. But I won't do that."
</p>
<p>
He continued: "If there are people who aren't like you in a game, I want you to know that game is still for you. If the characters are a different race, or a different gender, or a different ideology, or a different perspective, that doesn't mean the game isn't for you. It can still be for you. It's an opportunity to live in rich new worlds, to explore different perspectives, to explore different cultures... you just need to be open to it."
</p>
<p>
In response, Salim has worked with Nintendo to drop the price of Tales of Kenzera: Zau in the US until the end of June, which he intends to do across all platforms.
</p>
<p>
"I really believe games are for everyone, that's why I insisted on setting Zau's cost at the price of a pizza," said Salim.
</p>
<p>
"I genuinely believe in the power that games have to bring us closer together," he surmised. "Diverse games are not about taking something away from you, they're about adding something in. Because there's room for all of us."

<p>
Sadly, since the release of the video, Salim and the development team have received further abuse accusing them of faking the harassment as a marketing ploy.
</p>
<p>
Salim has addressed this in a further thread.
</p>
<p>
"Since the first moments of creating this game, the focus was on my father's legacy and what I wanted it to leave behind to represent that," he said. "Since announcing, we steered away from race as a subject matter as much as possible, because the game isn't about that. It's about the human journey of grief. 
</p>
<p>
"This didn't stop the harassment that came our way. And I knew that as soon as I chose to address the subject of race, the legacy of this game would be diluted. But something had to be said. Suffering in silence wasn't an option. It needed to be addressed. Because by not speaking to it, countless others out there who would also suffer in silence and not see the power they have to tell stories through their unique perspectives, whether they choose to make the race of the character a key focus or not."
</p>

<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">I’ve been reading&nbsp; a lot of comments and opinions on the video I posted Friday and I want to thank those who have shown their support. I’m aware that the world doesn’t revolve around social media, but there is something to be said about seeing that love and support come from so…</p>— Abubakar Salim (@Abzybabzy) <a href="https://twitter.com/Abzybabzy/status/1797351024685944996?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 2, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
Salim has been refreshingly open about the development of the game in the run up to its launch and ever since. 
</p>
<p>
"There are all sorts of obstacles you have to go through [to make a game], but I feel like that knowledge needs to be shared," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/abubakar-salim-on-metroidvanias-as-a-vehicle-for-grief-and-storytelling">he previously told Eurogamer about his transparency</a>. "I think it's important to be quite open and talk about this and I think we're getting there, we're slowly moving towards that kind of position."

</p>
<p>
Salim's comments follow a new wave of anti-diverse sentiment that's seeped into the gaming community, particularly after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-alan-wake-ridiculous-fishing-devs-speak-up-in-support-of-consultancy-studio-sweet-baby-inc">work of diversity consultancy Sweet Baby Inc.</a>, which has been wrongly accused by some of pushing a "woke agenda" in the games industry. 

</p>
<p>
"I've not played a game like Tales of Kenzera before because this type of setting isn't seen enough in gaming, whether due to under-representation in the industry or perceived lack of interest from players," I wrote in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tales-of-kenzera-review">Eurogamer Tales of Kenzera: Zau review</a>. "But these stories deserve to be told and Salim deserves praise for creating a game with a world that feels so fresh and unique."

			<p>The third and final entry in the Final Fantasy VII Remake series may end up being a very different game than its predecessors, judging from some recent statements from the development team.</p>
<p>Speaking in a new episode of <a href="https://youtu.be/j4fE8ATUr3s">Inside Square Enix</a> focusing on Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, battle director Teruki Endo revealed how he is thinking about how to give players even more freedom, suggesting a further push towards an action-based combat system, a push that was already evident in the INTERmission expansion and Rebirth with the inclusion of Precision Guard and improved aerial combat.</p>
<p>It's not only combat that will likely feel different in the third part of the Final Fantasy VII Remake over its predecessors. Director Naoki Hamaguchi commented on the conclusion of the series, saying that they want to give the fans a different kind of gameplay experience than what they had in the previous two games, suggesting that even the open-world formula introduced in Rebirth is going to be shaken up to offer this different type of experience.</p>
<p><iframe title="シナリオ×ワールド×バトル 『ファイナルファンタジーVII リバース』 こだわりの掛け算と限界への挑戦【#スクエニの創りかた】#FF7リバース #FF7R" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j4fE8ATUr3s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>No matter what, it will be a few years before we can experience the conclusion of the Final Fantasy VII Remake series, as it will take at least three more years to come out. Given Rebirth's ending, it will be very interesting to see which direction the story will take in the third and final part of the series and how everything will be wrapped up in a game that promises to be epic.</p>
<p>The second entry in the Final Fantasy VII Remake series, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, is now available on PlayStation 5. You can learn more about it by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review.</a></p>

			<p>Microsoft's next Xbox console is said to feature an AI accelerator to handle AI tasks.</p>
<p>At least, that's what WindowsCentral's Jez Corden <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/the-enormity-of-microsofts-windows-phone-shut-down-mistake-is-becoming-increasingly-clear-in-the-ai-era" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writes</a> to have heard from reliable sources in a freshly-published feature article about Windows Phone. According to Corden, this neural processing unit&nbsp;(NPU) inside Microsoft's next hardware will be able to perform some AI tasks, including Auto SR - <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsofts-automatic-super-resolution-upscaling-limited-to-copilot-pcs-select-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft's own resolution upscaling tech</a>. "Reliable sources tell us that the next Xbox will sport an NPU for handling some AI tasks, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/microsoft-demos-baldurs-gate-3-borderlands-running-at-30-fps-on-the-new-snapdragon-x-elite-windows-on-arm-platform-with-auto-super-resolution-support-in-tow" data-analytics-id="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/microsoft-demos-baldurs-gate-3-borderlands-running-at-30-fps-on-the-new-snapdragon-x-elite-windows-on-arm-platform-with-auto-super-resolution-support-in-tow" data-component-tracked="1" data-hl-processed="none" data-custom-tracking-id="2826340130651112283" data-hawk-tracked="hawklinks" data-google-interstitial="false" data-label="automatic Super Resolution">automatic Super Resolution</a>, for example, without detracting from the CPU or GPU", Corden writes. "The next Xbox will also have some form of Copilot, offering guidance in-game without having to use websites like ours (<em>RIP Windows Central</em>). Still, the amount of people likely to use these tools on Xbox is minuscule compared to the default setting on iOS or Android."</p>
<p>Although Corden initially said the AI accelerator (NPU) would come from Qualcomm, he later clarified that the manufacturer isn't known at this point.&nbsp; "<em>Currently, the manufacturer is unknown at my end, but it's most likely AMD", </em>he later added.</p>
<p>Further details haven't been shared by Corden, but it's interesting information nonetheless. As covered last week, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-reference-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft's next Xbox console is said to be very different from the current console and will be a "reference design" for manufacturers</a> to make their own game devices.</p>
<p>Back in April of this year, we reported that Microsoft is seemingly working on an Xbox AI chatbot that helps automate certain tasks. According to The Verge, this bot can, for instance,&nbsp; help automate game refunds. Whether this AI Chatbot is related to the copilot that Corden mentioned, is not entirely clear. "“We are testing an Xbox Support Virtual Agent, an internal prototype of an animated character that can query Xbox Support topics with voice or text,” Xbox general manager of gaming AI, Haiyan Zhang, told the Verge last month. “The prototype makes it easier and quicker for players to get help with support topics using natural language, taking information from existing Xbox Support pages.”</p>
<p>We'll update you as soon as we learn about Microsoft's next Xbox.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/asus-rog-ally-x-is-official-pre-orders-are-now-live.887886/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/rog-ally-x-launch-specifications/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>The Asus ROG Ally X has officially been revealed, and pre-orders are now live! Here’s more information about the handheld console, including specifications, pricing, and availability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The handheld gaming community has been growing steadily in recent times, with manufacturers releasing new devices and refreshes more frequently. The latest refresh comes for arguably the most used handheld console in the industry right now: the Asus ROG Ally. The Asus ROG Ally X is the successor to the handheld console, and it brings a few exciting upgrades. However, it isn’t a complete overhaul that many might be expecting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ROG Ally X vs ROG Ally</p>



<p>There are some notable enhancements for the ROG Ally X, including a lot more RAM, coming in at 24GB LPDDR5 – 7500 MT/s, compared to last gen’s 16GB LPDDR5 – 6400 MT/s. This upgrade will help with performance through the increased RAM and faster speeds. The next big change is its storage, which has doubled from last-gen’s 512GB to 1TB M.2 2280 NVMe PCIe Gen 4 SSD this time around. This means you can fit even more games on your device when traveling (how convenient!)</p>

<p>Moreover, the one change that fans will be the most excited about is the battery, as Asus has listened to the community and doubled the capacity from 40Wh to 80Wh, which is exciting, to say the least. Lastly, there are minor tweaks to the body, such as enhancements for the handles, the chassis, and the joysticks. Also, the ROG XG Mobile port has been discarded for USB 4 ports on the new device. However, the APU is the same one from the last gen, which is AMD Ryzen 1 Extreme. Check out the full specifications of the ROG Ally X below.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>A DIY engineer has created a realistic tank simulator that puts the average haptic controller to shame. The mechanical monster is jury-rigged to the top of an office desk and must be reloaded with a new shell after every shot. The recoil is terrifying. It's operated by three people: one person drives the tank with a steering wheel and levers, another uses cranks to aim the gun barrel, and a third reloads the shells that eject automatically from the chamber after every desk-lifting blast. The "shells" in question are 2-litre bottles of fizzy drink, and the crew has set up a whole rack of these bottles for panicked reloading. If you are the kind of person who yearns for the immersion of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel_Battalion#/media/File:Steel_Battalion_controllers.jpg">legendary Steel Battalion controller</a> then you will get a definite buzz from watching the death machine in action below. </p>

<p>Just look at that smoke. This is a reupload to YouTube - the original video was posted by homebrew engineer "malublyat" on Chinese <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Qw4m1U7q3/">video sharing site BiliBili</a>. The video includes a link to World of Tanks, the free-to-play tank sim by Wargaming. That's what the crew appear to be playing on the monitor, you see. It's possible developers Wargaming have partnered with the engineer in a classic act of viral marketing, however the video description doesn't say so outright. So it's also possible the engineer is doing his usual thing. Because this is not the first ludicrous machine to come from this user's channel.</p>
<p>Malublyat is described in Chinese articles as a "well-known tech uploader" (thanks to Jeremy for the translation). The engineer has a strong record of creating wild video game controllers and funny devices. Here he is building <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Jz4y1Y7tB/">a mounted machine gun that glows so hot you can light a cigarette on it</a>. And here is an <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1qk4y1x72X/">anti-aircraft gun that can swivel around</a> as you fire into the digital skies. You may have already seen this viral video on TikTok: a  <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@malublyat/video/7073337519273790763">desk with built-in recoil to be paired with CS:GO</a>.</p>
<p>Marketing stunt or not, I respect and fear the human ability to engineer wild (possibly unsafe) controllers for the purposes of entertainment. If you like this sort of thing, there were many other weird controllers and games on display at EGX a couple of years ago, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kcOaSy0vnE">a game played with a Morse code machine and a warped pool table</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/naughty-dog-wont-just-keep-farming-the-last-of-us-games-says-druckmann/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In a statement relayed <a href="https://www.latimes.com/l-a-influential/story/2024-06-02/neil-druckmann-the-last-of-us-video-game" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to the Los Angeles Times</a>, Naughty Dog co-president Neil Druckmann confirmed the studio will create games other than The Last of Us sequels.</p>
<p>This is not very surprising. The Santa Monica-based developer owned by Sony Interactive Entertainment has a history of switching franchises between console generations. It all started with Crash Bandicoot with the original PlayStation console. Despite the great success, Naughty Dog decided to create a new IP when the PlayStation 2 was launched: Jak &amp; Daxter.</p>
<p>The same happened with the PlayStation 3. At this point, Naughty Dog left behind not only the IP but also the platform genre, targeting a more mature audience with Uncharted. Just a few months before the launch of the PlayStation 4, the studio launched The Last of Us, its most acclaimed and best-selling franchise to date. Uncharted wasn't immediately abandoned like Crash Bandicoot and Jak &amp; Daxter, appearing for two more games with Uncharted 4 and Lost Legacy, but it is pretty much on the back burner now. The same could eventually happen with The Last of Us, too, despite the success of HBO's TV show. The studio is now working on 'multiple projects, ' almost certainly brand new intellectual properties.</p>
<p>First, of course, fans are expecting The Last of Us Part III. Druckmann <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-3-story-outline-already-drafted-but-the-game-isnt-being-made-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> over three years ago that a story draft was ready, although the game wasn't in development yet. Back then, Naughty Dog was still focusing on The Last of Us Online, which got <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-canceled-naughty-dog-live-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canned</a> earlier this year as the studio chose to maintain its single player story-driven focus.</p>
<p>In February, Druckmann publicly <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-iii-exciting-concept-decided-druckmann-tommy-story-shelved/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> that Naughty Dog had found an exciting concept for The Last of Us Part III while also teasing it might be the last chapter in the saga. More recently, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/naughty-dog-druckmann-new-project-is-the-most-thrilling-yet-may-redefine-mainstreams-perception-of-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> the game they're now making is 'fresh,' and he's excited about how the world will react to it.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Naughty Dog Will Not be a The Last of Us Studio Forever, Says Neil Druckmann]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/naughty-dog-the-last-of-us/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/naughty-dog-will-not-be-a-the-last-of-us-studio-forever-says-neil-druckmann.887856/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/naughty-dog-the-last-of-us/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a new interview, Neil Druckmann has said that Naughty Dog will not remain a The Last of Us studio forever. </p>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/l-a-influential/story/2024-06-02/neil-druckmann-the-last-of-us-video-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview</a>, Druckmann said that the studio is working on “multiple single-player projects”, and that “I promise you, we will not be ‘The Last of Us’ studio forever.”</p>



<p>“We create experiences that are steeped in story and character, especially relationships,” Druckmann said. “The stories have some sort of philosophical core that everything is going to revolve around and feed into.”</p>



<p>Following the success of The Last of Us HBO TV series, many fans thought that Part 3 of the game would soon be coming. However, in an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/naughty-dog-will-develop-the-last-of-us-part-3-if-they-can-come-up-with-a-compelling-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview in early 2023</a>, Druckmann implied that might not be the case. Using the Uncharted series as an example, Druckmann said, “Just because something is successful, people think there’s all this pressure and we have to make a sequel. That’s not the case. For us, Uncharted was insanely successful — Uncharted 4 was one of our best-selling games — and we’re able to put our final brushstroke on that story and say that we’re done. We’re moving on.”</p>



<p>On Part 3, he continued, “Our process is the same thing we did when we did Part 2, which is if we can come up with a compelling story that has this universal message and statement about love — just like the first and second game did — then we will tell that story. If we can’t come up with something, we have a very strong ending with Part 2, and that will be the end.”</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/last-of-us-part-3-next-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rumors from late 2022</a> have already suggested that The Last of Us Part 3 is already in development and with the success of the TV series, and of course multiple single-player titles in the works at Naughty Dog, it’s hard to imagine that a Part 3 is not in development.</p>



<p>Waht do you think of Naughty Dog’s future? Will you welcome The Last of Us Part 3? Let us know in the comments below! </p>

        <p>Fans praise "perfect" potential casting as Lord Shimura.</p>

            <p>
The legendary Horiyuki Sanada, star of hit Amazon TV series Shogun, is in talks for a role in the upcoming Ghost of Tsushima film.
</p>
<p>
That's according to veteran movie tipster <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/105254279?utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_source=android">DanielRPK</a>, who shared word of the discussions over the weekend. 
</p>
<p>
Sanada, who played Toranaga-sama in Shogun, is also known for his roles in The Last Samurai, Sunshine and Lost. He's next set to appear on cinema screens in another video game adaptation: Mortal Kombat 2.

<p>
While this isn't yet a confirmation of Sanada's involvement by PlayStation Studios itself, fans are already celebrating the actor's potential involvement - and speculating who he might play. 
</p>
<p>
The obvious choice is Lord Shimura, the uncle and protector to Ghost of Tsushima's protagonist Jin. 
</p>
<p>
"As much as I want the cast of the game to reprise their roles, he would be a killer Shimura," one fan wrote on reddit.
</p>
<p>
"He's pretty much perfect as Lord Shimura," wrote another. "I would be very surprised if he was cast as anyone else."
</p>
<p>
Sony <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/john-wick-director-making-ghost-of-tsushima-movie">announced a film adaptation of Ghost of Tsushima in 2021</a>, helmed by Chad Stahelski (director of John Wick: Chapter 4 - which also stars Sanada).
</p>
<p>
Progress on the project has been relatively slow, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-ghost-of-tsushima-movie-adaptation-names-its-writer">Takashi Doscher named as its writer in 2022</a>. But Stahelski has continued to discuss the project, and has said his desire is for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-tsushima-movie-will-be-a-complete-japanese-cast-in-japanese">"a complete Japanese cast, [speaking] in Japanese" throughout</a>.
</p>
<p>
Developed by Sony's Sucker Punch studio, Ghost of Tsushima originally launched for PlayStation 4 in 2020, and finally arrived for PC last month. As ever, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-ghost-of-tsushima-on-pc-delivers-impressive-upgrades-over-ps5">Digital Foundry has cast its beady eyes over the Ghost of Tsushima PC port</a>.

This week is the week of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/summer-game-fest-2024">Summer Game Fest 2024</a>. Ah, SGF! The Geoffers, as they call it down Los Angeles way. The Not-E3s. The Midsomer Keighleys. Jumping G.K's Game-a-Palooza. The AAAArghs. The Second Fall Of Babel. Trailarmageddon. The Sparkling Stink. SGF is sort of already in motion - last week, Sony kicked off the proceedings with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-concord-and-more-everything-pc-relevant-announced-at-playstation-state-of-play-may-2024">their latest State of Play showcase</a>, but you can expect the majority of new videogame announcements from Friday 7th June with the Summer Game Fest 2024 Opening Showcase, a two-hour livestreamed event which starts at 10pm UK, 5pm ET and 2pm PT. I'll be out there covering the whole sorry affair in LA from Thursday to Monday while the remainder of Rock Paper Shotgun hold the fort on London time.

<p>
It's a period of frightful bounty for the Maw, our resident Hadean icon of videogame news consumption. Look forward to trailers, celeb cameos, surprise demo releases, around a million hours of interlude music, and hands-on impressions fresh from the creaking furnace chambers of my jetlagged brain. Still, SGF isn't All She Wrote this week. A few brave developers and publishers are releasing new games alongside the event, like individual rockets plunging into Uncle Geoff's Fervid Fireworks Show. Here are a few that have caught our eyes.
</p>
<p>
Monday 3rd June sees the release of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/306130/The_Elder_Scrolls_Online/">Elder Scrolls Online's Gold Road expansion</a>, which Katharine (RPS in peace) considers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-onlines-new-gold-road-expansion-might-just-make-me-an-mmo-convert">a solid gateway drug to MMOs in general</a>, together with lurid 90s room-escaper <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1484760/Tamarindos_Freaking_Dinner/">Tamarindos Freaking Dinner</a>, in which you deliver pizza to a mansion full of Tim Burton-esque munsters. On Tuesday 4th June, there's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2336880/Destiny_2_The_Final_Shape/">Destiny 2's Final Shape expansion</a>, a project whose success or lack thereof will <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-face-a-full-sony-takeover-and-more-layoffs-if-destiny-2-the-final-shape-flops-according-to-reports">reportedly determine whether Sony mounts a full takeover of Bungie</a>, together with a pair of fairly handsome strategy games, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2195410/Songs_of_Silence/">Songs Of Silence</a> (which looks a bit like a deck of Tarot cards) and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1985050/Field_of_Glory_Kingdoms/">Field Of Glory: Kingdoms</a> (which looks a bit like a medieval manuscript). There's also asymmetrical horror outing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1556100/Killer_Klowns_from_Outer_Space_The_Game/">Killer Klowns from Outer Space: The Game</a>, which Nic will be upset if I don't mention. Wednesday 6th June sees the release of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1113010/Chornobyl_Liquidators/">Chornobyl Liquidators</a>, which is "not a fantastic tale of exploring the Zone" but "a story about real people facing a real threat", and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1206410/Kristala/">Kristala</a>, a Soulslike with a touch of Robin Jarvis. And on 7th June, finally, the "deceptively cute" (aren't they always?) factory sim <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1955110/Star_Stuff/">Star Stuff</a>.
</p>
<p>
As ever, let me know if we've missed anything I would feel deeply embarrassed about missing, and enjoy the week. You can follow our routine news coverage in the liveblog below, which I'm going to extend into Sunday so you can follow the deterioration of my writing abilities in real-time. Onward, to SGF! Keighley &amp; Friends! The Endless June! The Geoffervescent Circus!

        <p>The funding round was led by Play Ventures</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Hypersonic Laboratories has raised $7 million in a series A round led by Play Ventures.</p>
<p>AppWorks, WTIC, KB Investment, and Alex Ekvall also contributed to the round, with the funding going towards further development of Helix.</p>
<p>The sandbox platform aims at facilitating the creation of role-playing mods and servers. Helix is due to launch in a closed alpha later this year.</p>
<p>Helix initially launched as a web3 platform with an NFT marketplace, but the team recently switched to web2 and removed any blockchain and NFTs.</p>
<p>Hypersonic previously raised $4 million, having been founded in 2019 by CEO Jack 'Maker' Kim.</p>
<p>He commented: "It shouldn’t be that hard for the millions of people out there who want to mod or play modded games, but until Helix, there’s just never been a professional toolset or platform built by modders, for modding.</p>
<p>"Our team, cumulatively, has built mods and modding frameworks with more than 100 million total downloads – all in their own free time. Imagine what they can do now that they’re actually being paid to do it!"</p>

            <p>June has arrived and with it comes the usual cavalcade of video game announcements, all presented in a series of livestreamed showcases.</p>
<p>The season technically kicked off last week with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/astro-bot-and-concord-bookend-playstations-state-of-play-showcase">PlayStation's State of Play</a>, but the barrage of trailers will ramp up from Thursday, with Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest showing on the following day, culminating with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-forward-set-for-june-10-news-in-brief">Ubisoft Forward on Monday, June 10</a>.</p>
<p>In between, we'll see the latest announcements from Xbox, IGN Live, Devolver Digital, Wholesome Games, and more.</p>
<p>Nintendo has also confirmed it <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-breaks-silence-on-switch-2-promises-announcement-by-april-2025">will release a Nintendo Direct at some point in June</a>, which will show off titles it has coming to Switch in the second half of 2024. The platform holder has said this broadcast will not mention the console's upcoming successor.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/welcome-to-cooking-week-<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="captioned-content"><p><span>Kirby image via Nintendo.</span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Food and cooking mechanics have a long history in video games, evolving from health power-ups to sidequest and mini-games and eventually into a creative pillar holding up entire genres. As we start out our week focusing on cooking games and restaurant simulators, let’s examine some of the most popular themes across the genre and explore what developers can learn and apply to their own delicious side dishes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some of the earliest uses of food in video games come from the classics; in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pac-Man</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (1980), we saw fruit used to award points based on how long the player could survive in a level. In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Burgertime</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (1982), food preparation is at the core of a challenge rooted in skill, with players stacking different ingredients like lettuce and tomato to assemble a hamburger. In games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Gauntlet</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (1985), large chunks of meat are used in health restoration, inspiring the classic and oft-quoted line: “Warrior needs food badly.” Whatever the era in gaming, food and cooking have served many design goals.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As games grew in complexity, so did our context for the use of food, leading eventually to games that allowed you not to just eat but to cook. Among the earliest were games like the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cooking Mama</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (2006) on the Nintendo DS, which simplified the process of cooking down to easy visual steps and used the device’s second screen touchpad to mimic techniques like slicing or chopping vegetables. Another, 2012’s </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cook, Serve, Delicious!</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (based on the 1999 PlayStation title </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ore no Ryouri</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which we explore in an interview with developer David Galindo later this week) used cooking as more of a concept, focusing on quick time button sequences to mimic the preparation and assemblage of a dish.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the years since open-world survival games have risen in popularity, so too has the concept of in-game cooking. It can be seen as a staple in games as broad as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Don’t Starve</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (2013) to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, with a wide range in complexity. Some cooking games focus on gameifying the techniques of cooking. Others focus on the utility of food, like power-ups or health items while others still use it to reinforce a game’s crafting systems, adding an element of worldbuilding by teaching the player the regional flora and fauna.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Why does cooking in games appeal to us, both as players and game makers, so much? Well, on the more obvious side, human beings have evolved to take cues about a food’s texture, flavor, and freshness from its appearance, and our appetites rely on that appeal. Think of the entire industries that have sprung up around food plating and presentation, be it the factory that manufactures food models for restaurant displays or fancy Michelin-starred restaurants that incorporate elements of traditional visual arts into each dish. What we see is a big part of enjoying what we eat.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This visual aspect combined with personal tastes can also turn cooking into a mode of self-expression. What we cook is a reflection of our skills, our opinions, our resources, and our history. As with other art forms, the joy is as much in its creation as the final product. (This topic is evoked briefly in our upcoming interview with the developers of TapBlaze later this week, “</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Good Pizza, Great Pizza</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> would not exist if not for Costco.”)</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But there are many themes that cooking touches on, each speaking to its different roles. Cooking is a part of our everyday lives, a symbol of routine, stability, even boredom. It’s also a part of our special occasions, our holidays and family gatherings: times that call for scarce ingredients and hours of tedious but worthwhile labor. With that in mind, here are some of the themes, mechanics, and stories we'll explore in full this week.</span></p><p>Image via Visai Games.</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Food, family and heritage">Food, family and heritage</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Venba</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a strong recent example of a game that depicts the complicated intersection of cooking and family, touching on racism, identity, and parental sacrifice while walking us through a trial-and-error process that reinforces the procedure of certain techniques in Tamil cooking. On top of crafting game mechanics out of dishes and cooking equipment unique to Indian cuisine, Venba also gave opportunities for the player to think about why we cook, and the emotions that are poured into the act of service, whether we’re connecting with our roots or sacrificing our time and energy for the benefit of someone we love.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One title that more directly attempts to educate players about a culture is the upcoming </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rooster</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a point-and-click adventure game that celebrates Chinese culture through its visual style, music and ancillary features like papercrafting and cooking. Developer Deborah Chantson opined on this topic in “</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-upside-of-using-culture-and-personal-stories-as-game-pillars">The Upside of Using Culture and Personal Stories as Game Pillars</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">” earlier this year, discussing the merits of using personal heritage in game design.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another game to take this approach is </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://creativags.itch.io/cacaocafe">Cacao Café</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which replicates the agricultural and culinary practices around the production of chocolate in ancient Mexica culture. We discuss this more in the article, “Exploring ancient Mexica culture through cooking in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cacao Café</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">” later this week.</span><br></p><p>Coffee Talk also bears an element of self-expression, allowing players to create foam art on the drinks they serve to customers. Image via Toge Productions.</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Food, community and socializing">Food, community and socializing</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Community can be many things, but the act of communing itself is well depicted within games, where service and hospitality often play a key part not only in our perception of this act but our role within it. In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/914800/Coffee_Talk/">Coffee Talk</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the player is a barista whose job is in part that of a confidante, similar to that of the bartender in games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/447530/VA11_HallA_Cyberpunk_Bartender_Action/">VA-11 HALL-A</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. As you listen to a customer’s story and pour them a coffee, there’s a lovely mirror between the thought and care put into actively listening to them and the drink you make based on their verbal tip-offs and emotional cues.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Other games use cooking to reflect relationships in other ways; take for example </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pokémon Sword</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shield</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which let the player set up camp and make curry for their Pokémon, choosing different ingredients based on the strengths of their team to build stronger friendships, in turn giving the player a superior edge in battle.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another aspect explored in food and community is its role in socializing. One dish that shows up in many indie games is hot pot, traditionally a meal that is served for a group of people,&nbsp; becoming a metaphor about the unique stresses of eating as a group, as seen in games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://keanerie.itch.io/hot-pot-panic">Hot Pot Panic</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. This is somewhat subverted in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://rachelqxl.itch.io/hot-pot-for-one">Hot Pot for One</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which depicts the loneliness of being an ex-pat in a new city by walking players through the sad experience of having all the ingredients for a social dinner, and not enough friends to share it with.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This topic is explored more this week in the Q&amp;A, “Why </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Arctic Eggs</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are a dish best served cold”, where developer Keven Brown discusses why they chose to create a game that reflects more on the social aspects of eating and cooking than the technical logistics, and what it says about the utility of eating versus the camaraderie of its creation. It is also warmly dissected in our upcoming Featured Blog from senior editor Bryant Francis, entitled “Strategy games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Against the Storm</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> let us think about the bigger picture of cooking,” similarly reminiscing about the value placed on food outside of its immediate necessity, and how </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Against the Storm</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> supports that through its design.</span></p><p>In Cook, Serve, Delicious! 2, players manage not only incoming orders but the janitorial and kitchen responsibilities of running a restaurant, too. Image via Vertigo Gaming Inc.</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Cooking and performance anxiety">Cooking and performance anxiety</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At the other end of the spectrum are the games where the focus is timing, performance and successful execution of a specific skill. There are many series that model this by combining a light facsimile of actual food preparation with the frenzy of fast-paced restaurants, sometimes contextualized as a simulation (like</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> Chef Life: A Restaurant Simulator</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/deep-dive-balancing-the-authentic-culinary-experience-with-chef-life-a-restaurant-simulator">whose developers shared with us their formula for achieving that balance in 2023</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">). Sacrificing authenticity for simplicity, these games center on customer service, challenging players to master timing as each ingredient is prepped, cooked, plated, and served.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Interesting to note that it’s often the addition of selling labor that adds the element of stress; whereas </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Venba</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or the cat cafe game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Calico</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> evoke comfort and safety, restaurant and food prep sims like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cook, Serve, Delicious!</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Overcooked</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are all about performing in high-pressure situations. This is taken to an extreme with the surreal horror game</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1851380/Happys_Humble_Burger_Barn/">Happy’s Humble Burger Farm</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, where players who botch too many orders will find themselves attacked by a violent fast food mascot. We can also see that dynamic subverted by the antics of games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1977530/Onearmed_cook/">One-armed Cook</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, where the challenge of cooking is played for comedy by limiting the player’s skills to the use of a single arm, to frustrating but slapstick results.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Stressful though they may be, these simulators also reflect another of cooking’s many sources of appeal: the fantasy of self-sufficiency, be it as a Pizza Tycoon managing a restaurant or the pride and sense of accomplishment in preparing food for yourself. This is depicted to a certain extent with games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Sims</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, where learning to cook provides better benefits in terms of your character’s needs but also, by way of ingredients either collected or grown, can reflect their interests and economic security. (For a little Sims-related fun, read my blog post later this week, called “This ain’t your</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> Sims 3 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">French Toast”, exploring the world of fan culture surrounding video game cooking with a recipe from my personal oeuvre).&nbsp;</span></p><p>Image via Nintendo.</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Cooking and worldbuilding">Cooking and worldbuilding</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In-game cooking also serves a role in telling the player about the world around them, giving game designers, artists, narrative designers, and writers a powerful tool for crafting living and believable worlds.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Take, for example, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Battle Chef Brigade</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a match-3 game where recipes aren’t so much cooked as they are strategically assembled by collecting sets of the same ingredient. While the game doesn’t give any insight into the cooking process or what a recipe looks like, its core premise does rely on the aesthetic appeal of food, using the game’s combat sequences and the gathered ingredients of each “dish” to tell us key things about wildlife within its universe.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This use of cooking also frequently factors into open-world games, where its purpose as a performance booster is also supplemented by what it tells the player about the environment. In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Breath of the Wild</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, plants reflect their region and in turn, create potions and meals that strengthen Link’s resistance to the most immediate elements. In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fallout 76</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, flora reflects not just the imagined effects on local vegetation in post-nuclear Appalachia but also the influence of pollution, geology, and other aspects of the area’s real history. Closely related to both is the world of potions that also dominates game lore, not just in RPGs and survival games but in other genres as well; in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hades II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the heroine Melinoe collects resources to produce Incantations at her camp’s giant cauldron, not only adding permanent beneficial boosts to the game but also supplementing key stories from Greek mythology to further explore the complicated relationships within its pantheon.</span></p><div data-testid="content-paragraph"><p><span data-testid="content-text">All these themes will be dissected in more detail through interviews, blogs, and features that highlight how cooking is used in games and why. Keep an eye out for these articles as the week progresses.</span></p><p><span data-testid="content-text">Q&amp;A: Why </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Arctic Eggs</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are a dish best served cold</span></p></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Featured Blog: Strategy games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Against the Storm</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> let us think about the bigger picture of cooking</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Deep Dive: Cooking up a palatable food prep experience in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fruitbus</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Q&amp;A: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Good Pizza, Great Pizza</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> would not exist if not for Costco</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Featured Blog: This ain't your </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sims 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> baked French toast</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Feature: How </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ore no Ryoumi</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> inspired </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cook, Serve, Delicious!</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> An interview with David Galindo</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Q&amp;A: Exploring ancient Mexica culture through cooking in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cacao Café</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And don’t forget, if you have a cooking-related topic you’d like to write out, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a0c8cfccccd98ec7d2c5c5cee0c9cec6cfd2cdc18ec3cfcd">reach out</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or submit a post through our </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://reg.gdconf.com/blog-submission">blog submission form</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">; we would love to feature your article during Cooking Week.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
