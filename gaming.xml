            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>My friends and I spent 10 hours dying to last week’s Everdark Sovereign overhaul of the Gaping Jaw  before finally killing the lightning bird late one night, long past the point when we should have all gone to bed. Now <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> is back with a new boss for players to take on, but thankfully this one is a lot easier. It took us only two tries, in part due to a completely over-powered relic <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-gaping-jaw-everdark-sovereign-1851784820&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-gaping-jaw-everdark-sovereign-1851784820">we unlocked from defeating last week’s terror</a></span>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196307" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="10 Minutes From The Last Of Us Part II’s Roguelike Mode " data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="657" data-playlist="196307,196909,195891" data-current="196307"><div><p>10 Minutes From The Last Of Us Part II’s Roguelike Mode </p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196307/196307_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196307/196307_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196307/196307_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196307/196307_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21857.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The new Everdark Sovereign players have to face is the centaur-like Darkdrift Knight. He was one of the main game’s tougher Nightlords, so fans were worreid they were in for another brutal stomping. Instead, he’s a more powerful but not altogether different version of the base boss fight, just with a mean new AoE holy attack that’s tough to dodge. As I did with his original form, I played Guardian to soak up all his physical attacks with my shield while my teammates picked him apart. </p><p>But we made even quicker work of him this time thanks to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1lg9759/new_relic_is_busted/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1lg9759/new_relic_is_busted/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Grand Luminous Scene relic</a></span> we unlocked after beating the Gaping Jaw Everdark Sovereign. The new merchant outside the keep sells it in exchange for a few sigils and it includes the permanent attack power buff for defeating Evergaol prisoners, an extra Stonesword Key and a treasure map to boot. These perks are usually only found on separate relics, taking up multiple slots. The new relic streamlines that, letting you run the Evergaol strat while also buffing other stats and unique character abilities.</p><p>For anyone who hasn’t been running the Evergaol strat, it’s a gamechanger during <em>Nightreign</em>’s farming phase. Each Evergaol prisoner you defeat gives a 5 percent bonus to attack, up to 35 percent. The prisoner fights themselves give very generous runes, making it easy to consistently hit level 14 or 15 before night three without having to worry about things like whether Bell Bearing Hunter is at the bottom of the castle or which field bosses you get. If everyone on your team runs it, everyone’s getting the buff and everyone has extra keys to start, cutting down on the hassle of hunting for all of them out in the wild. The treasure map is just a nice bonus that gives some extra insurance against not getting the right loot during the run. </p><p>It’s probably hands-down the most busted strat in <em>Nightreign</em> at the moment. While other ones might have higher skill ceilings, the Evergaol buffs are pound-for-pound the best way to brute force your way through any fights. That’s why some players <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1lj5nee/imo_they_should_nerf_the_evergaol_buff_relic/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1lj5nee/imo_they_should_nerf_the_evergaol_buff_relic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">think they should be nerfed</a></span>. The fact that FromSoftware just streamlined it by selling the Grand Luminous Scene Relic to every player who beat the Gaping Jaw makes me wonder if it even cares. Of course, if you missed out on that fight, you’ll have to wait until you beat the new version of Darkdrift Knight to unlock it. <br></p><p>Bandai Namco previously confirmed that Everdark Sovereigns will continue rotating each week through the summer, suggesting we’ll eventually see a tougher form of all of the existing Nightlords. Given the game’s ongoing popularity, I expect we’ll eventually see some entirely new boss fights as well. Whether they’ll be free updates or paid DLC remains to be seen. But at just $40 I’ve already gotten way more than my fair share of time well spent out of <em>Nightreign</em>. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-evergaol-key-darkdrift-relic-1851785161]]></content:encoded>

The Luna Coven is the most capable of all the clans at preparing strong units for the endgame. The main mechanic for the Coven is the phases of the moon, which switches between New and Full after every turn, or by playing a card with the Phase effect. </p><p>During these different phases, you can get additional effects for both spells and units. One particularly notable one is the Shadeguard, which gains max health and attack for each combat phase that ends in New Moon.</p><p>In addition to this mechanic, there are also quite a few ways to gain Conduit, a status that makes your spells more powerful. Combined with the zero ember cost card that starts in your deck, Witchweave, boosting your magic power can be a great way to deal damage and heal your units for free.</p><h2 id="h109704"><a id=""></a>The Lazarus League are the Sultans of Sustain</h2><p>While the Luna Coven are great at building up to deal damage, the mad scientists of the Lazarus League are great at keeping units alive with various effects. Using both equipment and spells, there’s a myriad of ways to keep your team alive.</p><p>A particularly powerful one to use is Reanimate. When a unit has Reanimate, the first time it would die, it instead resurrects with 1 health. This combines especially well with units from other clans. For instance, having active stacks of Valor from the Banished in addition to Reanimate can let a unit revive with 1 health, but gain armor shortly after.</p><p>In addition to this, there’s plenty of other defensive techniques. You can get Spikes to deal damage back to the attackers who hit you, and Lifesteal to drain health from your enemies and add it to your pool. These defensive effects make the Lazarus League a particularly helpful clan as a secondary clan, as they can complement nearly every other clan in an effective way.</p><hr><p><br><em>Monster Train 2 </em>is available now on Steam, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox Game Pass.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/monster-train-2-best-clans-lazarus-luna-coven-1851784966]]></content:encoded>

Some players didn’t believe their eyes at first when the Hulks started hopping around after the stealth update went live. “I thought this was one of those jank asf physics moment at first, D e a r g o d,” wrote one player on Reddit. “Bots went full <em>Titanfall</em> on us,” wrote another.

PlayStation eventually backed off of certain region-locking requirements on Steam, allowing players from countries without official PSN account support to rejoin the fight. “We always felt it was something to give away once regions returned,” Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani wrote on Discord last week. “PS has been working hard on this, so a cape to celebrate is in order.”</p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-jetpack-hulk-major-order-titanfall-1851785152]]></content:encoded>

Its run from the ‘90s to the mid-2010s was marked by the kind of dazzling creative output that makes you believe art isn’t dead and was so inspiring, it no doubt made many consider pivoting careers into animation. The decade that’s followed has been pretty uneven, and as a result, Pixar’s place at the top of the animation industry has felt tenuous as of late. Disney’s internal animation studio was picking up some real steam as Pixar was faltering and in the last decade, it’s arguably eclipsed the <em>Toy Story </em>studio in terms of cultural cachet. Disney has also buried a handful of Pixar’s releases, relegating them to Disney+ rather than giving them real theatrical releases following the covid-19 pandemic. Pixar isn’t the cultural juggernaut it once was, but looking at its body of work as a whole, it’s still got an impressive portfolio of heartfelt stories and gorgeous animation. But which movies are the best of the best? Here’s our ranking of Pixar’s feature films.</p></div><div><p>Talk about trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. <em>Cars 2 </em>is an awkward mismatch of a movie that takes an already established, marketable franchise and drops a spy film into it, a genre Pixar probably would have been better off exploring in a brand new setting. The <em>Cars </em>world, in which vehicles are living, breathing people, is already a poor foundation for a spy story, which typically benefits from nimbleness of character and narrative, but to then put Mater, played by country-boy comic Larry the Cable Guy, at the center of it all makes the whole thing feel like a single joke stretched way beyond the point it stops being funny. In theory, this could have made <em>Cars 2 </em>work as a spoof of more serious spy films, injecting its least-likely hero into a story he’s categorically unfit for, but the film just doesn’t have the juice to meld these ideas together into a cohesive vision. When <em>Cars 2 </em>gets serious, it feels comical. When it’s trying to be funny, it hydroplanes into silly. Ultimately, it feels like a movie made to sell toy cars and little else. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p><em>The Good Dinosaur </em>is probably Pixar’s most forgettable film. It’s not the hot mess that <em>Cars 2 </em>is, but it has pretty much come and gone without leaving so much as a cultural footprint. Despite being lost in the annals of the studio’s history, <em>The Good Dinosaur </em>is mostly fine. The survival story is surprisingly brutal to its co-protagonists, Arlo and Spot, a young dinosaur and caveman who go from enemies to friends as they try to make their way home after being swept up in a violent stream and separated from their families. As the two face the harsh elements of the film’s alternate-history world in which dinosaurs never went extinct, they form a close bond, one that takes some unexpectedly dark turns for a Pixar film. It’s fine. It probably didn’t deserve to be Pixar’s first box-office bomb. But it also felt like a turning point for the studio, which had, up to this point, created mostly certified bangers. — KS</p></div><div><p><em>Finding Dory </em>had to prove that Ellen DeGeneres’ Dory, who was the surprise breakout star of the original <em>Finding Nemo,</em> could hold a film on her own, lest it instead demonstrate that her ditzy amnesiac personality worked best in a supporting role. For whatever it’s worth, the sequel is pretty successful in making Dory the star of her own story, and it turns out she can still deliver an hour and a half’s worth of laugh-out-loud bits and still find a truly profound conclusion waiting for her at the end of it all. The problem with <em>Finding Dory </em>is that its final act is such a chaotic, nonsensical, obnoxious culmination of everything the movie introduces that it can barely get a handle on itself by the time it slams its foot on the brakes and just kind of…stops. Pixar also can’t quite stick the landing here as it struggles to reconcile its secretly sentient aquatic world with a human one in which somehow the presence of sea creatures causing havoc and mayhem on the surface world doesn’t make headlines, and <em>Finding Dory</em>’s third act is one of the most damning examples of the studio having more ideas than it can concisely bring together in the end. — KS</p></div><div><p>Admittedly, I’m probably more charitable to Pixar’s attempt to make a “movie within a movie” than the average viewer, but <em>Lightyear</em>’s biggest problem isn’t that it’s not an interesting thought experiment in the <em>Toy Story </em>universe; it’s that it’s dreadfully dull. I do like the beginning and end of this movie. Chris Evans puts on his best not-Captain-America voice to give us a pretty great portrayal of a duty-bound space ranger who is so fixated on protecting people in the abstract that he forgets to care for flesh and blood people in his life. <em>Lightyear </em>begins with its titular hero repeatedly subjecting himself to a time-dilating space trip in an effort to help save a marooned space colony. He literally blinks his life away trying to fix one fuck up, and then faces a living manifestation of his obsession in the closing act. The beginning and end of <em>Lightyear </em>form a really tight full-circle moment that I found truly satisfying, and if all the stuff in the middle were half as compelling as the film’s foundations, it<em> </em>could have been one of the studio’s greats. Unfortunately, it’s not. <em>Lightyear </em>is surprisingly dreary, even when it has characters as likable as Keke Palmer’s spritely space ranger Izzy and the merchandise-ready robot cat Sox. As interesting as it is to see Pixar lean into a more serious tone with high stakes, <em>Lightyear </em>is almost entirely devoid of joy. — KS</p></div><div><p>Damn, we waited 14 years for that, huh? <em>Incredibles 2 </em>manages to recapture the original superhero film’s family dynamic to a T, and that’s an impressive feat after over a decade away. The trouble is the sequel’s story is nowhere near as strong as the original’s. <em>Incredibles 2</em>’s brainwashing villain, the Screenslaver, is the personification of a boomer telling you that “it’s ‘cause you always be on that damn phone” without a drop of irony. Yes, there’s some actual depth under the facade, but to come off a truly stellar modern classic in the superhero genre, one with complex familial relationships, nuanced political commentary, and some of the studio’s best character work, and release something that felt like so paint-by-numbers and curmudgeonly is one of Pixar’s most tragic falls from grace. — KS</p></div><div><p>When <em>Brave </em>premiered in 2012, it should have been a huge deal for Pixar. It was the first movie the studio released with a woman protagonist, and Princess Merida was the first (and thus far, only) time Pixar got to create an official Disney Princess. A big part of her premise was that she would be a subversion of the exaggerated perception that Disney Princesses were meek damsels waiting for a soldier to come save them. She didn’t need no man, could save herself, and wasn’t going to listen to her mother’s demands for her to fall in line and marry some halfwit dweeb whom she could easily outshoot…then she goes on a transformative adventure with her mother, and they find common ground. But not the kind that lets Merida continue to carve her own path. Instead, she concedes to her mother’s desires and agrees to follow a traditional path. What a waste. — KS</p></div><div><p>The third <em>Cars </em>movie feels like a more honest sequel to the original than the second one did. It gets back to the NASCAR-inspired roots that were the heart and soul of the first film, and instead of just cashing in on the love people have for Owen Wilson’s Lightning McQueen, it actually reckons with the often tragic end stages of being a professional athlete. Lightning is getting older, and at a certain point, you have to let go of your position at the top to make space for those you helped pave the way for. It’s still a pretty mid Pixar movie, as I don’t think even the best of these films manages to reach the highs of the team’s best work. But at least it had ideas beyond just riffing on the franchise’s bizarre premise of living cars. — KS</p></div><div><p><em>Soul </em>is a tough movie to sum up and rank because, on paper, it’s great. In its story of protagonist Joe Gardner nearly dying and having to reckon with his belief in determinism, it has a lovely premise. Joe spent his whole life believing that he was meant to be a jazz musician, and was so steadfast in the notion that it was the reason he was put on the earth that he forgot to stop and smell the roses. It has things to say and is rooted in its protagonist’s life as a Black man, but trips up in its handling of some of these ideas. It falls into the unfortunate trend in animated movies of not letting people of color be the star without <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.mic.com/p/why-do-animators-keep-turning-people-of-color-into-animals-65481570&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.mic.com/p/why-do-animators-keep-turning-people-of-color-into-animals-65481570" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">transforming them into some kind of animal or creature</a></span>, and then for swaths of the film when we finally do see Joe on screen as himself instead of as a disembodied soul, his body has been overtaken by Tina Fey’s 22, so a white woman’s voice is coming out of his mouth. <em>Soul </em>stumbles on its way to saying something meaningful, and the victim is the same Black protagonist Pixar took decades to finally put in the lead. — KS</p></div><div><p>I don’t think <em>Cars </em>is a good movie. It’s more like a clever bit that Pixar stretched out into a two-hour feature film. <em>Cars </em>is mostly a long worldbuilding gag that dares to ask the question, “What would the world look like if vehicles were at the top of the food chain and were somehow able to create an entire civilization with infrastructure despite lacking opposable thumbs?” The strength of <em>Cars</em> is that it’s so earnestly committed to its wild premise that you eventually buy into its world of sentient cars without the movie having to look at the camera and explain to you how this is logistically possible. But is that a good film? Is there really much to this story of a cocky racecar getting citizen-arrested by a bunch of podunk hillbillies because he accidentally caused some property damage? It’s fine. The movie’s fine. Certainly wasn’t good enough to merit the multimedia franchise it became, but those toy cars aren’t going to sell themselves. — KS</p></div><div><p><em>Elemental </em>is a classic example of Pixar having a strong core thesis that is too smothered by its overly clever setting to shine as brightly as it could. The film’s world of people made up of earth, wind, fire, and water is gorgeous to look at, clearly has a lot of thought put into the logistics of its pretty much segregated setting, and facilitates a pretty touching story of two people finding their way back to each other after societal pressures nearly tore them apart. Its leads, the fiery second-gen immigrant Ember and sentimental rich boy Wade, are star-crossed lovers whose struggles give rise to some pretty meaningful commentary on the xenophobic nature of our world, but <em>Elemental </em>spends so much time indulging in visual spectacle and world-building that it loses the plot. It’s an enjoyable film whose tale is sometimes frustratingly told, but I suppose that can sometimes happen when you dress up real-world issues in a world that is so detached from our own it requires several asides to explain how its society works. — KS</p></div><div><p><em>Onward </em>is a mostly fine movie saved by a really excellent ending. Chris Pratt and Tom Holland playing the elven brother duo of Barley and Ian is the most 2020-ass casting Pixar could’ve concocted. They basically play themselves as they go on a magical road trip to try and complete a spell that will let them spend a day with their deceased father. Like many of Pixar’s movies, <em>Onward </em>spends a lot of time showcasing its original setting, but it’s a fun enough romp until its incredibly affecting ending in which Holland’s character realizes that he hasn’t been lacking a father figure because his big brother stepped the fuck up. It ends with a poignant moment in which Pratt’s character gets to speak briefly with his revived father before the spell wears off, but the audience is kept at a distance, unable to hear the words exchanged. That moment is for Barley, and Ian is our protagonist, so we’re stuck in his perspective. <em>Onward </em>denies the audience catharsis when it counts and for that, it gets a sizable bump on this list. — KS</p></div><div><p>If you made a list of “movies that don’t need to exist,” <em>Toy Story 4 </em>would belong near the top. But is it bad? Nah, it’s pretty good, to be honest. The most unnecessary film in Pixar’s catalog answers the question of why Annie Potts’ Bo Peep was missing from the stellar third film, and it allows Tom Hanks’s Woody to reflect a little more on what he wants out of life beyond his job of being a toy. This comes at the expense of pretty much every other old character in the film, but as a love story between two toys who were nearly separated by fate and a lack of work/life balance? It could have been worse. And it was a major box office success, so we’ll get a fifth one and continue to trample on <em>Toy Story 3</em>’s ending. Hurray. — KS</p></div><div><p>Pixar’s latest film is for the weird kids who hyperfixate. <em>Elio</em>’s story of an outcast child who has lost everyone who’s important to him and is seeking anyone, anywhere who might accept him, is the science fiction isekai every little kid wishing for friends imagines growing up. The titular orphan dreams of leaving Earth for the stars to find friends and family beyond this floating rock. Through a series of happy coincidences he manages to make his way to a galactic community that loves him, albeit under a guise of being Earth’s leader and representative, and his attempts to maintain the facade lead to some life-threatening antics. But as he finds his people in space, he grows to appreciate what he’s left behind. It’s a heartwarming story about a character who’s making the best of what he’s got, even as a child who has endured more than he should have had to at such a young age. — KS</p></div><div><p><em>Monsters University </em>doesn’t hit as hard as the original, but it’s one of Pixar’s best straight-up comedies. The prequel landed while I was in college, and the barrage of nonstop hilarious university gags hit hard. That universal experience every college student has when they go to a school with big dreams makes the movie surprisingly timeless. Yeah, it’ll entertain kids, but the target audience feels like it’s actually college graduates who are distanced enough from the hazing and hokey school spirit to be able to laugh at it. It’s one of the most fun romps Pixar’s put on the big screen and is surprisingly underrated. — KS</p></div><div><p>Almost nothing in <em>Inside Out 2 </em>is as memorable as the best moments of the original. However, the franchise’s core concept of personifying every complex thought pattern the human brain experiences is still one of Pixar’s most interesting premises. Hence, it still had the juice for a sequel. Riley’s emotions are going into overdrive as she enters adolescence. Thus, her entire mindspace is changing with new characters, new personifications of thought, and ultimately an incredibly powerful representation of an anxiety attack within the visual language of these films. Like <em>Toy Story 4</em>, we probably didn’t need it, but it does well enough as a continuation of the original’s excellent concept. — KS</p></div><div><p>Pixar’s second film is often forgotten because its release was sandwiched between those of the first two <em>Toy Story </em>movies, but <em>A Bug’s Life </em>remains remarkably prescient nearly 30 years later. The film is a story of class issues, and a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLbWnJGlyMU&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLbWnJGlyMU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">speech from villain Hopper (who’s unfortunately voiced by Kevin Spacey) </a></span>about how the ants may be weak on their own, but when united, they would easily overthrow the grasshopper gang is still a remarkably succinct reminder that while the ruling class may hold power, the working class could rise up and seize it for themselves. <em>A Bug’s Life </em>was pretty beloved at the time, but it feels even more important now. While it’s not considered Pixar’s most foundational work, it’s easily one of its most profound. — KS</p></div><div><p><em>Toy Story 2 </em>had quite the legacy to live up to after the original film launched to universal praise, but the sequel delivered, riffing on the initial premise of “what if toys were sentient” by exploring new dreams, horrors, and heartbreak for the toys that we love as children but leave behind as we grow up. It’s particularly impressive how well <em>Toy Story 2 </em>ended up coming together considering <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://thenextweb.com/news/how-pixars-toy-story-2-was-deleted-twice-once-by-technology-and-again-for-its-own-good&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/how-pixars-toy-story-2-was-deleted-twice-once-by-technology-and-again-for-its-own-good" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">its reported development woes</a></span>, but Pixar managed to pull it off. — KS</p></div><div><p>I think the best Pixar movies are the ones that take a simple concept and dig in to create something both unique and memorable. <em>Monsters, Inc.</em> is a great example of this type of Pixar flick. Most kids have experienced the terror of thinking, no, <em>believing</em>, that a monster is hiding in their closet or living under their bed. <em>Monsters, Inc.</em> goes, “Yeah, there were monsters in your closet, and they live in their own world and use closet doors as magical portals to show up, scare you, and suck a bit of your energy away in the process to keep their TVs and cars running.” It’s such a great idea that it would have worked with any actors voicing the main characters of Mike and Sully. But Pixar brought in the always great John Goodman and equally talented Billy Crystal to bring these two monster pals to life in what is both a workplace comedy and a weird sci-fi comedy romp. It really only misses the top 10 because Pixar has made so many great films that really good movies can still land in the middle of the pack. - Zack Zwiezen</p></div><div><p>The original <em>Toy Story </em>isn’t just important and foundational within Pixar’s catalog; it’s one of the most important movies in animation history. Looking back on it after 30 years, the film is surprisingly dark. The life and times of a toy on the verge of being forgotten are kind of harrowing when you think about it. <em>Toy Story </em>manages to expertly blend genres of comedy, horror, and drama, all within a premise that was incredibly novel in 1995. It was such a successful execution that it informed decades of Pixar’s output. The lessons the studio learned here haven’t worked out every time, but <em>Toy Story </em>paved the way for the next three decades of animation both in and out of Pixar, and even if it doesn’t look as mind-blowing as it once did, it still holds up pretty damn well. — KS</p></div><div><p><em>Turning Red </em>feels like Pixar’s second shot at exploring themes it first broached with <em>Brave</em>, but<em> </em>without the same stumbles that made the 2012 film fall short. The movie stars a teenage Chinese-Canadian girl named Mei who discovers that once they reach puberty, members of her family are cursed to turn into giant, mystical red pandas when they have giant bursts of emotion. When your relationship with your mother is already tense enough for all the normal reasons teenagers go through, adding something as disruptive as an uncontrollable transformation into a giant fluffball is only going to make things more challenging. <em>Turning Red </em>succeeds in exploring these tumultous child/parent relationships because its underlying message isn’t “do what your parents tell you”; rather, it explores the fact that even the most perfectionist of parents are still growing and trying to figure things out themselves. Mei’s mother is dealing with her own traumas while trying her best to help her daughter not make the same mistakes she did, and the film wisely recognizes that no parent or child is beyond learning something new from the other. — KS</p></div><div><p>If <em>Luca </em>had been released theatrically rather than shoved onto Disney+ during the height of the covid-19 pandemic, I still don’t think it would have been the cultural event some of Pixar’s best films have been. It’s an understated story of friendship and being true to yourself whose main characters happen to be sea monsters who just want to be like everyone else. Even with that sea monster element, <em>Luca </em>is one of the most human stories Pixar’s written. It isn’t so fixated on the elaborate worldbuilding that often bogs down the studio’s stories, and instead its more focused fantasy elements are an extension of its characters’ humanity, rather than a constant distraction that pulls us away from the story it wants to tell. <em>Luca</em> represents one of Pixar’s most effective uses of an otherworldly element to talk about the real world. Sure, it’s no <em>Incredibles</em>-level epic or <em>Coco</em>-level tearjerker, but it is one of Pixar’s most consistently heartwarming works. It’s also pretty cool that Pixar artist Kenna Jean Harris <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tumblr.com/sourgrapelaffytaffy/738540103751892992/luca-alberto-fanart-from-co-director-kenna-jean&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tumblr.com/sourgrapelaffytaffy/738540103751892992/luca-alberto-fanart-from-co-director-kenna-jean" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gave us unsanctioned fan art</a></span> confirming we weren’t all crazy for believing Luca and Alberto would grow up to be more than friends. — KS</p></div><div><p>A rat that controls a person by hiding under their chef’s hat and pulling their hair. That’s a weird concept for a film. Even weirder, the rat is smart and loves cooking, despite his fellow brethren being trash-eating animals. And even weirder, this all comes together to deliver one of Pixar’s best original films. The idea that anyone can cook, that anyone can do more than they think, is a nice message that is threaded throughout the film. If you love food and cooking, you need to find some time to watch <em>Ratatouille</em>. If you like movies that deal with critics, yeah, watch this flick. And if you like Patton Oswalt, who voices the main rat Remy, you should watch this movie, too. Really, everyone should watch <em>Ratatouille</em>. — ZZ</p></div><div><p>If we were just ranking openings, <em>Up </em>would not only be at the top of this list, it would probably rank pretty high in a list of best film openings of the 21st century. <em>Up </em>is a kind of messy film to try and sum up because it has so many disparate elements that, out of context, sound like they’re coming from multiple unrelated films rather than a singular cohesive work. But its opening, in which we watch married couple Carl and Ellie grow old together, could be a short film on its own. Ellie’s passing is the spark that ignites her husband’s grief-driven adventure to move their marital home, by way of thousands of balloons, to the remote Paradise Falls waterfall in South America, and the screenplay provides a masterclass in what it means for a character to “haunt the narrative.” The minutiae of how Carl treks toward his destination are entertaining and gave us some of the most memorable characters in Pixar history, like the speaking golden retriever Dug, so we can forgive it being a bit messy en route to its powerful finale in which Carl, with Ellie’s posthumous blessing, is able to move forward and past their old dreams. Ah, fuck, I got choked up thinking about it. Anyway, <em>Up </em>good. — KS</p></div><div><p>When you open a movie with a fish losing all but one child to a barracuda attack, you immediately set the stakes for that baby fish’s safety. And when Nemo, the sole survivor of the attack, is captured by scuba divers, his father Marlin ends up going on an ocean-spanning journey to find his son and bring him home. <em>Finding Nemo </em>manages to weave Marlin’s trauma into a story that somehow manages to be an absolute hoot while never diminishing what the guy has been through. Marlin plays the straight man to some of Pixar’s most iconic characters, many of whom have had a long-lasting impact, such as the amnesiac Dory, who would go on to get her own movie 13 years later, Bruce the pacifist(?) shark, and Crush, the surfer dude turtle who helps them along the way. Meanwhile, Nemo is taken under the fin by several other captive fish in a dentist’s office, and they’re all tied up in their own trauma after being captured themselves. <em>Finding Nemo </em>is a story of fish people trying to make the most of the life they’ve been given while also being desperate to hold onto it by any means necessary. But as Marlin comes to learn, if you love something, you let it go. It will come back if you stop holding on so hard. — KS</p></div><div><p>You can’t say “Take her to the moon for me” to most Pixar fans without them either falling to their knees and sobbing or shoving you away and telling you to shut the fuck up. <em>Inside Out</em>’s emotionally devastating moments are among the most memorable in Pixar’s portfolio, but the film also arguably marks Pixar’s most clever and effective use of the “secret life of X” formula that it’s been utilizing since the original <em>Toy Story</em>. The 2015 film follows a cast of “emotions” inside a young girl’s head who are doing the best they can to help her navigate this beautiful, sometimes miserable thing we call life. If you were to cut out all of the segments following the emotions, you’d still get an emotionally earnest story of a child struggling with the world around her. But what makes <em>Inside Out </em>so good is how it has a visual concept for just about every dumb thought and struggle we have in our heads. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpQZ8svdqp0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpQZ8svdqp0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Imagination Land</a></span> is a dumping ground for every creative or silly daydream you’ve ever had, your <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPoKJ3ni4Ew&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPoKJ3ni4Ew" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">train of thought</a></span> is a literal locomotive, and when you forget something, it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZNHcCfwWw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZNHcCfwWw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">disappears into a void</a></span>, never to be seen again. <em>Inside Out </em>is full of so many brilliant nods like this that it somehow manages to build an incredible sense of place inside the human brain. — KS</p></div><div><p>The higher we get on this list, the more I realize that the best movies in Pixar’s line-up have some major tearjerker moments. There probably isn’t one quite as well-known as <em>Toy Story 3</em>’s finale, but even if we didn’t all collectively lose it watching Woody, Buzz, and the rest of their toy pals nearly accept their death as they went down an incinerator, <em>Toy Story 3 </em>is still an incredible film that tugs at the heartstrings of all the kids who grew up alongside Andy and his toys. Pushing aside <em>Toy Story 4</em>’s existence with all our might, <em>Toy Story 3</em> was a perfect closer to the story Pixar began in the ‘90s. Andy has grown up, and all his childhood toys are locked up in storage. Everyone who has ever formed an overly sentimental attachment to a toy knows what it’s like to finally get rid of them or store them somewhere out of sight. Yeah, you feel like you’re too grown up for them, but those are your childhood memories given tangible form. To store them means that the carefree era in your life is over, and maybe another kid could love those toys the way you did. Letting go of that childlike bliss is never easy, and when <em>Toy Story 3 </em>premiered in 2010, a lot of long-time fans who’d grown up with the films were now old enough to be dealing with this same inner struggle. For those of us in that group, it was gut-wrenching to watch, and for that same reason, it was a perfect ending. If only it actually had been the conclusion. — KS</p></div><div><p>It’s been 17 years since Pixar released its post-apocalyptic romance film, and <em>WALL-E</em> feels more apt than ever. The movie’s titular little robot hero starts the movie wandering a desecrated Earth and trying to clean up the mess humanity left behind. Humans have completely abandoned the planet as it became uninhabitable for all the reasons environmentalists are still warning us about today. Corporate interests are prioritized over the health of the planet, and eventually, that will catch up to all of us who aren’t even benefiting from it in the short term. <em>WALL-E</em>’s spacefaring robot romance is full of adorable moments and humorous takes on the apocalypse and is still gorgeous to look at nearly 20 years later, but perhaps what keeps it resonating after all this time is the knowledge that we are still barreling toward its dystopian future. But at the center of its story is a hope that not all is lost, and that is a message that carries just as much weight. — KS</p></div><div><p>When I saw <em>Coco </em>in a theater, at the very end, I looked around and saw everyone tearing up and crying. Kids, adults, elderly people, that weirdo with two sodas for himself. Everyone was crying at a quiet moment between a young boy and his grandma. A moment where, thanks to music and surviving an otherworldly adventure through the afterlife, that boy is able to connect to his grandma one more time and make her smile. He sings her a song that was always meant for her, from someone she loved a lot. It proves that Pixar, more than most other studios, understands that a good family movie doesn’t have to be fart jokes and pop songs. Instead, you can tell a truly heartwarming story about a young Mexican boy trying to find his place in the world and landing back at home happier than ever, with a family who now understands him better. And if you do it well enough, people will cry while two totally CG characters interact. — ZZ</p></div><div><p>In 2025, Marvel is finally making an MCU <em>Fantastic Four </em>film. It looks cool. But nothing will beat the best <em>Fantastic Four</em> movie ever made: <em>The Incredbiles</em>. In fact, this 2004 animated adventure about a family of superheroes hiding their powers and then working together to save the day might just be one of the best comic book movies ever made. And ironically, it’s not based on an actual comic book.</p><p>There are a lot of reasons<em> The Incredibles </em>works so well. It has a unique art style that blends the vibes of golden age superheroes with a retro-futuristic world. It tells a story that, for all its twists and turns, is incredibly (see what I did there…) relatable. Bob Parr, the movie’s knock-off Superman, is struggling with his age and feeling like he’s stuck in a rut. Meanwhile, his children are struggling with their powers while also dealing with all the problems that come with growing up. And finally, Helen Parr—who has the ability to stretch—is trying to keep everything together while wondering if Bob has found someone new and more exciting.</p><p>Keep in mind, this is a movie primarily designed for kids and families about colorful superheroes. So Pixar and director Brad Bird have to <em>very </em>carefully balance how much they lean into these themes while still keeping things mostly lighthearted and fun. Somehow, they pulled it off. The end result? <em>The Incredibles</em> is not only Pixar’s best movie, but one of the best Disney movies ever made, and arguably a true classic that will be talked about and watched decades from now. Oh, and Disney: Please don’t do a live-action remake. Please. — ZZ</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pixar-best-movies-toy-story-nemo-incredibles-inside-out-1851785148]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Kojima Productions fans can’t stop talking about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> load times, with many calling them the "fastest" they’ve "ever seen in a video game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hideo Kojima’s strand-game sequel launched to stellar reviews, including our own, where we called <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review">Death Stranding 2's post-apocalyptic take on Australia “hauntingly beautiful.”</a> While there are many elements to praise, it’s the visuals that have been almost unanimously celebrated. Death Stranding 2 is quite the visual showcase, so seeing loading screens last less than a second before dropping protagonist Sam Porter Bridges into wide-open fields is quite the sight to behold.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Videos of players showcasing the quick load times have already flooded social media feeds since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-global-release-times-confirmed"><u>early access launch arrived June 24</u></a>, and the results are hard to deny. Pressing the “Continue” button on the main menu presents a flash of a black screen before picking up exactly where players left off. Loading another save while already in-game presents similar results. Some of the phrases being thrown around include “blink or you’ll miss it,” “instant,” and “the fastest load times I’ve ever seen.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kojima’s secret to the unbelievable load times in Death Stranding 2 has yet to be revealed, but one popular X/Twitter post has a theory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Okay but actually how the f**k,” user <a href="https://x.com/RealBugAubrey/status/1937501463661437029" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@RealBugAubrey</a> said. “Either everyone else is not so secretly terrible at their job or Kojima Productions is making deals with spirits and demons.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— KAMI (@Okami13_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Okami13_/status/1937298687602172194?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 23, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>It’s been mentioned already but the load times in Death Stranding 2 are unbelievably fast, like the fastest I’ve ever seen in any game ever.</p><p>Genuinely how did they do this?? <a href="https://t.co/GmxbaF3ijH" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/GmxbaF3ijH</a></p></div>— Synth Potato🥔 (@SynthPotato) <a href="https://twitter.com/SynthPotato/status/1938203860490981644?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 26, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The essentially non-existent Death Stranding 2 load times are only impressive because so many other games on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S still feature loading screens that can last for up 30 seconds or even minutes long. Even without sitting down for a side-by-side comparison, many believe Death Stranding 2 might feature the most impressive load times for a game of this caliber ever. However, there are a few other shining examples that players believe might give Sam Porter Bridges a run for his money.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Insomniac Games’ 2023 title, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/spider-man-2">Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</a>, famously features similarly fast loading times on PS5, with players able to teleport to any location in New York City.

<figure><a title="fantasy life i changes pre-launch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/24c2c40240c75/fantasy-life-i-changes-pre-launch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Level-5 has certainly been riding quite the high of late with the release of its very well-received <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a>. We gave the game a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time">9/10 in both its Switch and Switch 2 forms</a>, so we can confirm it's a bit of a banger.</p>
<p>Now, straight off the back of all this success, Level-5 CEO Akihiro Hino has revealed that a huge aspect of the game’s positive reception is actually due to some crucial and very clever changes the dev team started implementing into the adventure just a year ago!</p><div><figure data-videoid="vhRubWa3khQ" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vhRubWa3khQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vhRubWa3khQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vhRubWa3khQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed598179gzswvl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRubWa3khQ" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>During a chat with YouTube talk show <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAKdDS6N0SE">Denfaminicogamer</a>, and <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-owes-its-success-to-critical-game-design-changes-made-only-1-year-before-launch-level-5-ceo-says/">reported by Automaton</a>, Hino, who's also been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/level-5-ceo-sees-ai-as-tool-for-communication-and-efficiency-improvement">chatting about AI recently</a> said that that at one point during its development, the team felt as though the game played in a very "suffocating" manner, in that it was "trying to extend playtime at the expense of making things stressful,” and so his team, very late in the day, decided to “practically remake” the whole game, as he puts it. Cools as cucumbers.</p>

<p>Hino highlights that the game's map and original movement system were of particular concern, which had previously consisted of just a small world map without any parkouring. Thankfully, this was then replaced with the large open world and slick traversal we now have, as the team “thoroughly removed anything that made the game feel stressful.”</p>
<p>Amazingly, Hino also says his team managed to create the finished open world map in just two months, which seems ridiculous - and it would have been, if the team hadn't created its own bespoke system to turn 2D artwork into 3D terrain.</p>
<p>As the Level-5 boss says, “In the final version of the game, you can chop a tree, climb up somewhere high, chop a three while you’re up there, climb back down, run around – and just performing these simple actions feels good and comfortable." Yes, we have to agree with you there, mate.</p>
<p>Fantasy Life i faced many challenges throughout development, with previous <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/fantasy-life-i-development-was-restructured-in-2024-as-keiji-inafune-left-company">producer Keiji Inafune leaving the company in 2024</a> and Hino having to step it. It seems like many of these changes were as a result of that departure, and we're glad things worked out for the team!</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Glad that Level 5 decided to make some drastic overhauls before it launched Fantasy Life i? Make sure to let us know how you're finding the game, too!</em></p>

            <p>
I think <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nuclear-throne">Nuclear Throne</a> is one of those games that will always be at least just a little bit relevant, in some shape or form. There are other indie games I'd rather play more than it from its era, but it kind of feels like the best representation of that period in indie games too. Throwback pixel art, a unique spin on both bullet hells and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a>, a bangin' soundtrack, it's got the right mix of things to help it stand the test of time. And here we are now, the game approaching its 10th anniversary, arriving with a new update.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
To be specific, it's a new beta build, so it's only there if you want to try it out, but it is available right now. Don't go expecting massive features or additions or anything though, this is a quality of life update. To that end, here's what it includes! For starters there's now 60 or 120fps support, for those of you that care about that sort of thing (look, most games just don't need 60fps, alright). 
</p>

<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>
There's also new aspect ratios, and a new controls menu too, but to find out the exact changes there you'll have to take a look for yourself. "Oh, and a new Melting loading screen tip", the post rounds off, alongside a very cool emoji wearing sunglasses.
</p>
<p>
If you want access to this update, your steps are pretty simple: right click on Nuclear Throne in your Steam library, click properties, then betas, then select "openbeta_win64", and Bob's your uncle, the update is ready and waiting for you.
</p>
<p>
Vlambeer explain in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/242680/view/528724684296945991?l=english">Steam post</a> announcing the update that they plan to add all these improvements into the main game too, as well as more than what's mentioned above, so don't feel like you have to rush for it.

        <p>OK, but please do a martial art now and then, Sloclap</p>

  </p>

    

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Sloclap’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/latest-foot-to-ball-visualisation">foot-to-ball</a> game Rematch is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rematch-review">very good</a>, and has been doing very well, with over three million sales to date, but some of us yet grieve for a time when kicks were reserved for torsos and limbs. Which is to say, some of us have been hoping that Sloclap might return to the martial arts realm in which it has hitherto made waves.</p> <!--more-->
<p>If it happens, it will not happen in the form of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sifu">Sifu</a> 2 or even a sequel to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/absolver">Absolver</a>, Sloclap’s chain-punching debut. For you see, creative director Pierre Tarno is of the opinion that “chasing safe bets is a death sentence” and that "gamers are on the lookout for new, original experiences." He’s got better things to do than develop sequels, and I’m sure no video game publishers brandishing huge sacks of rubies will persuade him otherwise.</p>
<p>That’s from a new Edge interview sliced into sandwich-sized slablets by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/sports/as-rematch-fires-past-3-million-players-devs-say-they-werent-planning-to-follow-up-their-cult-kung-fu-game-sifu-chasing-safe-bets-is-a-death-sentence/">Gamesradar</a>. According to Tarno, he pitched Rematch after Sloclap finished Absolver, but the studio were too small at the time to handle more than one project, and Sifu won the coin toss. Still, Sloclap were already prototyping the football game almost a year before Sifu’s release.</p>
<p>Again, Rematch has done very well. Extraordinarily well, for a game braving a sports genre dominated by essentially one series, the artist formerly known as FIFA. I’ve enjoyed what I’ve played of it – you can feel the dev’s past games in the tuned-up leather-walloping SFX, which make EA Sports FC seem anodyne. I also enjoy that, for all the souped-up holographic stadiums, each match is basically a neighbourhood kickabout with loosened rules and no referee.</p>
<p>Still, I wouldn’t mind playing another Absolver, or some other, very stylish experience in which feet are a means of speedy jaw removal rather than being used to abuse innocent, air-filled orbs. Hmm, what other things can you kick? I do kick this computer now and then when I'm doing my tax returns, but I'm not sure you could get a whole game out of that.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/there-shall-be-no-sifu-2-says-rematch-dev-because-chasing-safe-bets-is-a-death-sentence]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Shrimp Industries has released a brand new trailer for Roll The Bones, which is described as dice rolling action roguelite in a fantasy setting. Oh, and there is some bullet hell mixed in there for good measure too. You can see all of this chaos in the trailer below which also shows some of the dice action that makes up the core of the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Roll The Bones - Official Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4hDAL7Gjm1s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Roll The Bones players can use customisable spell dice, which can have a different spell on each face, to take on the hand crafted dungeons alongside the challenge floors. The dice can also be upgraded with new materials which will alter spells and their impact on critical rolls. Additionally, certain combos will trigger the Artifacts which can further alter how a run goes in Roll The Bones. Artifacts can add burn effects or trigger meteor strikes.</p>
<p>Shrimp Industries is aiming to release Roll The Bones later this year for PC, with PS5 and Xbox Series XS ports expected further down the line.</p>

			<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/we-need-our-studios-to-believe-they">The Game Business</a> also provides data from Ampere Analysis, which includes player numbers for June's more notable releases like MindsEye, FBC: Firebreak, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-update-1-1-0-0-adds-deep-desert-and-vehicle-changes-removes-sietch-visiting-restrictions-and-more/">Dune: Awakening</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rematch-review-an-excellent-football-game-thats-been-tackled-at-the-knees/">Rematch</a>.</p>
<p>MindsEye's launch has been a very public mess, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-is-giving-players-refunds-for-mindseye/">players getting refunds on PlayStation</a> over the major technical issues the game has, and developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-reportedly-beginning-mass-layoff-process-potentially-impacting-over-100-employees/">Build a Rocket Boy confirming it has begun the process of laying off potentially 100 employees</a>.</p>
<p>According to Ampere Analysis, MindsEye has just under 250K players, with approximately 150K of those players on PlayStation. On Steam, however, the only platform where MindsEye's player creation platform is available, Ampere reports only 35,000 players.</p>
<p>MindsEye currently has the distinction of being the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mindseye/">worst-reviewed game of 2025 so far</a>, and while Build a Rocket Boy has been <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/mindseyes-second-hotfix-is-now-live-as-its-developer-races-to-fix-its-disastrous-launch/">pushing out hotfixes as fast as it can</a>, it's currently unclear if there is a true path to redemption for the studio's debut game. Especially if what's supposed to be its main source of growth, its user-generated content platform, is playable only to the smallest portion of its player base.</p>
<p>The Game Business also designates FBC: Firebreak as the other game that's struggling at launch, even though its total player base across platforms is approximately 1.3 million players. A little less than 800K players on Xbox, 541K players on PlayStation, and only 54K players on Steam.</p>
<p>For a multiplayer-focused game, those are admittedly not the kinds of numbers developers want or necessarily need to see, and the game's inclusion on Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus means many of those players also don't equal direct game sales. That said, this is Remedy's first major foray into multiplayer games, and in its <a href="https://x.com/ControlRemedy/status/1938250909093663145">message acknowledging the 1M+ players milestone</a>, the studio stands firm in its commitment to supporting Firebreak.</p>
<p>"<em>We know there is still a lot of work ahead of us, and we are super motivated about it. We have a lot of exciting things cooking for Firebreak players! More about that soon,</em>" Remedy writes on X.</p>
<p>The other games mentioned in The Game Business' report are classed as successes for their June launches, including Dune: Awakening, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rematch-suprasses-1-million-units-sold-and-3-million-unique-players/">Rematch</a>, and Aggro Crab and Landfall's indie hit, Peak, which <a href="https://x.com/LandfallGames/status/1936734056089100646">sold over 1 million copies in its first week</a>.</p>
<p>Ampere Analysis's updated player counts for Dune: Awakening have it at over 1.2 million following <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-1-million-copies-sold-creative-director-announces-major-changes-deep-desert-pve-pvp/">Funcom's report</a>, while Peak has now reached more than 2.2 million players, according to Ampere.</p>
<p>Ampere also reports that most of Rematch's player base is, unsurprisingly, on Xbox due to its availability on Xbox Game Pass, with 1.58 million players. On PlayStation, Rematch sits just under 800K players, while the PC version has reached more than 1.1 million players. When Sloclap is able to add <a href="https://wccftech.com/sloclap-rematch-wont-support-cross-play-at-launch/">crossplay support</a>, it'll be interesting to see how the game grows from its strong start without it.</p>

Eventually, Stitch sees a “2" on a building and decides he wants that, too. He then does donuts in the parking lot. The camera reveals that his tire tracks spell out “<em>Lilo and Stitch 2,</em>” with Disney adding an “is in development” on the screen after that. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/lilo-and-stitch-2-live-action-movie-sequel-1236300074/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/lilo-and-stitch-2-live-action-movie-sequel-1236300074/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Announcing it on Thursday wasn’t random</a></span>. It was June 26 or 6-26, aka Stitch’s ID code in the movie. The  news of a <em>Lilo and Stitch</em> sequel isn’t really surprising, considering most film industry experts and reporters expected a follow-up to this year’s extremely successful remake to be revealed soon. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lilo-stitch-remake-live-action-box-office-record-mi8-1851782470?_gl=1*8vfk2q*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTA5NDQ3NTYkbzE1MCRnMSR0MTc1MDk1NTM2NiRqMTQkbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lilo-stitch-remake-live-action-box-office-record-mi8-1851782470?_gl=1*8vfk2q*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTA5NDQ3NTYkbzE1MCRnMSR0MTc1MDk1NTM2NiRqMTQkbDAkaDA.">The recently released live-action adaptation of the original 2002 animated film was a massive box-office hit</a></span>. It made over $920 million globally on a budget of just about $100 million. That’s a big return on investment in an era when a lot of blockbusters cost upwards of $200 million. </p><p>For Disney, the <em>Lilo and Stitch</em> remake’s success comes at a time when it’s been struggling to consistently produce big hit movies. <em>Elio </em>is floundering. Recent Marvel movies have failed to perform as well as past installments. And it’s years away from a new <em>Star Wars</em> movie. So <em>Lilo and Stitch</em>’s runaway success at the box office has likely been a big deal for the company, especially considering its small budget. The remake was originally planned for release on Disney+, but the Mickey Mouse empire’s leaders decided to give it a shot in theaters, and it paid off. </p><p>No information about the sequel’s plot or characters has been revealed, and we don’t have a release window yet, either. But Stitch is back. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lilo-stitch-live-action-disney-nani-jumba-controversy-1851782507?_gl=1*1ymu8n0*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTA5NDQ3NTYkbzE1MCRnMSR0MTc1MDk1NTM2NiRqMTQkbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lilo-stitch-live-action-disney-nani-jumba-controversy-1851782507?_gl=1*1ymu8n0*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTA5NDQ3NTYkbzE1MCRnMSR0MTc1MDk1NTM2NiRqMTQkbDAkaDA.">Hopefully, he and Disney figure out a way to improve on the remake’s lousy ending</a></span>.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/lilo-and-stitch-2-sequel-announced-teaser-disney-626-1851785144]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Peak has officially become a sleeper hit with gamers. The co-op climbing game recently reached over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/co-op-climbing-game-peak-has-exploded-on-steam-with-huge-player-numbers/1100-6532633/" data-ref-id="1100-6532633">one million sales in under a week</a> and is in the <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">top 40 of the most-streamed games</a> of the past few months. The game was created as a partnership between Another Crab's Treasure developer Aggro Crab and Content Warning creators from Landfall, with most of the development taking place during a month-long jam session.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/peak-devs-say-the-hit-comedy-climber-was-pitched-in-a-swedish-hot-tub-and-developed-in-a-frantic-4-week-korean-game-jam-we-brought-our-computers-to-an-airbnb-in-hongdae-and-locked-tf-in-for-a-month/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, Aggro Crab studio head Nick Kaman talked about the making of the game and being jealous of Landfall's whirlwind method with Content Warning that he felt "turned everything we know about game development upside-down."</p><p>At the time, Aggro Crab was about to launch its biggest game ever, Another Crab’s Treasure, an intense three-year-plus-long project that he felt burned out his team. "While it was a success, Content Warning was a much bigger one made in much less time," Kaman said via email. Lucky for Kaman's team, there was already an established friendly relationship between the studios, so when he asked if they could join the other team in Seoul, they got an enthusiastic yes.</p><p>"We brought our computers to an Airbnb in Hongdae and locked tf in for a month. As soon as we landed, we beelined straight for the nearest IKEA and spent the day assembling office chairs and desks," Kaman added.</p><p>It should be noted that Peak wasn't built entirely from scratch during those four weeks, as Aggro Crab creative director Caelan Rashby-Pollock had already pitched the idea a year ago in Sweden. "The concept was a lot more vague then and much closer to an open-world survival thingy, but we all quickly got excited about being a group of lost scouts on an island, and the macabre slapstick that can come from that." From there, it was all systems go.</p><p>"Basically, any given moment was either working on Peak or getting food while talking more about Peak," Kaman continued. "While it was pretty intense, it was also the most fun I've ever had working on a game. On a silly multiplayer game like this, the player experience often mirrors the development," Kaman said. "Most of the design was driven by the question: 'Wouldn’t it be funny if <em>this</em> happened?' And now every TikTok I've seen of a great moment in Peak reminds me of the great moment we had while implementing it."</p><p>Peak is available now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>And it completely changes the look of some of the images</p>
</section><div><section>

<p>So, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/front_mission_3_remake">Front Mission 3: Remake</a> is finally out today, 26th June 2025, and it should be a day of celebration for fans of the PS1 original, right? Well, sadly not, as it looks like the remake has replaced many of the games 2D art assets with AI-generated and AI-upscaled versions. And some of the results are pretty awful.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/feature/17799-you-need-to-see-front-mission-3-remakes-redone-network-graphics-photograph">RPGSite's Cullen Black</a>, who also reviewed the game for <a href="https://www.nintendo-insider.com/front-mission-3-remake-review/">Nintendo Insider</a>, has put together a piece comparing many of the game's backgrounds, in-game landing pages, and character portraits from the 1999 original and the 2025 remake from Forever Entertainment and Megapixel Studios.</p>
<p>All the results in the article are from the beginning of the game, and the results speak for themselves. As Black states, it seems that the publisher and developer — who also worked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/front_mission_1st_remake">Front Mission 1st: Remake</a> — "decided to feed all of the game's original 2D art assets into some form of upscale algorithm to clean them up".</p>
<p>Some of the images look completely different from the originals, which you can see for yourselves below.</p>

<p>Hands look contorted, shadows appear in places where they look out of place on buildings, and in some instances, entirely new assets have been added that look out of place. There's even one image where it looks like a car and a plane have merged together.</p>
<figure><a title="Front Mission 3: Remake" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/57b23186f4932/front-mission-3-remake.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>You can't <em>quite</em> see it here, but the gun the soldier is holding looks... weird. And those helicopters are blending in together a little. — <em>Image: Forever Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Fans are understandably not happy about this, especially given that the original game is beloved by many, <em>and</em> there were various issues with both Front Mission 1 and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/front_mission_2_remake">2's Remakes</a>; the former was criticised for control issues, RNG, and being a bit too "straight" or a remake, while the latter (developed by a different studio) received a bad localisation.</p>
<p>Just... look at this plane. It doesn't look flight safe, does it?</p>

<p>We're currently working on our own review of Front Mission 3: Remake, so we'll report back when we have the full verdict. But this isn't a great look. And, as a reminder, the publisher here — Forever Entertainment — is the same studio that worked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/donkey_kong_country_returns_hd">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a> on Switch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft’s “This is an Xbox” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24296420/microsoft-this-is-an-xbox-marketing-campaign-xbox-everywhere">marketing campaign</a> in November always felt a little too early. If you ask a friend or family member what an Xbox is, the response is likely going to be “it’s a game console.” Xbox is ingrained in popular culture as a box under your TV that you play games on, but Microsoft’s ads over the past six months have been attempting to redefine the Xbox as a platform that spans across phones, laptops, TVs, handheld gaming PCs, and even VR headsets. </p><p>The ads did a great job of drawing attention to the platform, but the perception of the Xbox brand as just a console is still a huge challenge that Microsoft needs to overcome if its latest strategy is going to be successful. I can already sense some trouble ahead. </p><p>Ever since Microsoft unveiled its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682009/microsoft-asus-rog-xbox-ally-devices-new-windows-xbox-experience">ROG Xbox Ally handheld devices</a> earlier this month, I keep hearing from friends that are asking about an “Xbox handheld.” YouTubers with millions of followers have positioned these handheld gaming PCs as “the first Xbox handheld,” which is true if you believe in Microsoft’s marketing, but false in reality because they don’t natively run Xbox games, only PC versions.</p><p>Microsoft’s answer to this potential confusion is that the Xbox Ally devices will be able to stream your library of Xbox games from the cloud or another Xbox console. That’s not the type of experience I want when I’m spending hundreds of dollars on a piece of hardware that’s capable of running games without an internet connection. In reality, I get the sense that Microsoft is willing to gamble on the potential confusion here, because what it really wants to do is turn Xbox into Steam.</p><p>The Xbox Ally devices are the beginning of a next-generation gaming platform — a platform that looks increasingly like it will revolve around Windows. Xbox president <strong>Sarah Bond</strong> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/688407/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-cloud-amd">confirmed last week</a> that Microsoft’s next console is “not locked to a single store,” just like Windows isn’t. Bond went even further, revealing that Microsoft wants to ensure “Windows is the number one platform for gaming.”</p><p>Microsoft has also started calling the Xbox app on Windows simply “Xbox PC,” in a clear bid to position it as a Steam competitor or alternative. This Xbox PC branding has appeared in trailers for games in recent weeks, but even Microsoft can’t decide whether it’s “Xbox PC” or “Xbox on PC” as it has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/25/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-enhanced-update/">used both recently</a>. Either way has risk: Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22827140/microsoft-pc-game-pass-naming-rebrand">rebranded</a> its Xbox Game Pass for PC subscription to just PC Game Pass four years ago because people were getting confused, so Xbox PC feels like it could be another source of confusion.</p><p>Bond’s video also shed some light on how the Xbox PC initiative will allow you to play Xbox games. While Bond largely talked about an AMD partnership for co-engineering silicon, she also confirmed that this next generation of Xbox devices includes “maintaining compatibility with your existing library of Xbox games.” That’s a promise that Microsoft hasn’t been able to deliver for the Xbox Ally devices, and it makes it seem like the company is confident it will deliver some form of Xbox game emulation on Windows for its next generation of devices.</p><p>Bond’s video wasn’t the only interesting Xbox release last week. AMD CEO <strong>Lisa Su </strong>also appeared in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kprpRvsOua0">short video</a> and essentially laid bare Microsoft’s next-gen Xbox strategy: “Moving forward, AMD will go beyond building custom chips for Xbox consoles to designing a full roadmap of gaming-optimized chips, combining the power of Ryzen and Radeon for consoles, handhelds, PCs, and the cloud,” Su said.</p><p>That sure sounds like AMD and Microsoft are co-engineering chips for Microsoft’s own next-gen Xbox console, as well as third-party devices that will also be branded as Xbox consoles. Su also specifically revealed these chips will include the hardware support needed for backward compatibility, which suggests that you’ll need one of these chips for whatever emulation solution Microsoft is working on. I fully expect these next-gen chips will also form the basis for how Microsoft plans to license the software powering this Xbox experience to OEMs.</p><p>It feels like this future work with AMD is really what Microsoft means when it says, “This is an Xbox.” It’s an ambitious vision where Xbox games can be played across multiple devices, all with cloud saves so you can pick up where you left off. It’s also a clear reaction to SteamOS and the fact that OEMs are starting to show interest in Valve’s efforts to span its game library across console-like devices.</p><p>The challenge for Microsoft is making its own vision a reality and learning from its mistakes of challenging Steam in the past. In 2006, Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/source/2006/05/09/bill-gates-declares-10-million-unit-head-start-for-xbox-360-and-outlines-future-of-interactive-entertainment/">outlined a similar vision</a> for Xbox dubbed “Live Anywhere,” where Xbox experiences would come to Windows-based PCs. It was a response, at the time, to Valve’s launch of Steam a few years prior.</p><p>Microsoft launched its Games for Windows Live initiative with Windows Vista in 2007, designed as a way to unify the gaming experience across PC and Xbox 360 with achievements, online multiplayer, a friends list, and marketplace. Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/8/16/4627194/games-for-windows-live-marketplace-shuts-august-22nd">shut down the service</a> six years later, after lackluster ports of Xbox titles and DRM mechanisms left PC gamers building up their library in Steam instead.</p><p>Nearly 20 years later, a lot of what Microsoft is saying today sounds like Bill Gates’ vision for Windows and the Xbox 360. The big difference this time around is that Microsoft isn’t in a position of strength in the console market like it was with the Xbox 360. That means it has to take a more open approach to overhaul what an Xbox is, like embracing rival stores on its next-generation devices or allowing OEMs to build their own Xbox devices. Microsoft’s opportunity here is to boot millions of Xbox devices into its own Xbox PC store and try to sell games and subscriptions directly to people instead of them turning to Steam.</p><p>There’s a clear revenue benefit to Microsoft here, especially if it can convert even a small percentage of Steam users into buying games from its own store instead of handing over a 30 percent cut to Valve. It will all come down to the console-like experience, with the “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682011/microsoft-windows-xbox-pc-combination-features-rog-xbox-ally-devices">Xbox full screen experience</a>” on Windows being a big first test.</p><p>If Microsoft can pull off this big bet of changing what an Xbox is, then these “This is an Xbox” ads will look like a prophecy. If it fails, then Microsoft risks damaging its last successful consumer brand, potentially beyond repair. The stakes for Xbox couldn’t be higher.</p><div><p id="the-pad"><h2>The pad:</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><strong>Microsoft is planning “major” Xbox layoffs next week. </strong>I hinted that more Microsoft layoffs were coming earlier this month, and some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/microsoft-xbox/691967/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-job-cuts-rumor">major cuts are going to impact Xbox</a> next week. Some managers have been briefed about the plans, and I keep hearing there will be significant layoffs impacting Microsoft Gaming. There’s <a href="https://x.com/georgebsocial/status/1938051752223232193">online speculation</a> that entire studios could be closed, and I’ve heard from sources that Turn 10, the studio behind <em>Forza Motorsport</em>, is bracing for cuts.</span></li><li><span><strong>Windows is getting rid of the Blue Screen of Death after 40 years. </strong>Microsoft revealed earlier this year that it was overhauling its Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) error message in Windows 11, and it has now confirmed that it will <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/692648/microsoft-bsod-black-screen-of-death-color-change-official">soon be known as the Black Screen of Death</a>. The new design drops the traditional blue color, frowning face, and QR code in favor of a simplified black screen. I think that means we can still call it a BSOD, but it’s going to look a lot more like a regular Windows update screen than before.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft makes Windows 10 extended security updates free, but there’s a catch. </strong>Microsoft originally wanted to charge people $30 for an extra year of Windows 10 security updates, but now it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/691811/microsoft-windows-10-free-extended-security-updates">offering a free option</a> — with a catch. If you’re willing to enable Windows Backup, which syncs your Documents folder and settings to the cloud, you can get Extended Security Updates for Windows 10 until October 13th, 2026. The only issue is you’ll need to ensure your Documents folder isn’t full of files, otherwise you’ll go over the 5GB of free OneDrive storage — and I’m sure Microsoft would love to sell you more space.</span></li><li><span><strong>Discord is working on a Windows on Arm app. </strong>Great news for Qualcomm Copilot Plus PC owners: a native Arm64 version of Discord is on the way. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/692551/discord-windows-on-arm-app-arm64-version-development">Discord confirmed its plans </a>to <em>The Verge</em> earlier this week, but it’s not clear exactly when the Windows on Arm version will be released. The current app is very slow and laggy through emulation; I’ve been testing the native version of Discord on a Surface Pro 12-inch, and the difference is night and day. I’m still waiting for a native version of Premiere Pro, but Discord moving to Arm64 plugs another hole in the Windows on Arm universe.</span></li><li><span><strong>A week in Xbox VR with Microsoft and Meta’s new $399 headset. </strong>I’ve spent the past week testing out an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/690978/meta-quest-3s-xbox-edition-vr-headset-release-date-pricing">Xbox-branded Quest VR headset</a>. It went on sale for $399.99 earlier this week and comes bundled with an Xbox wireless controller, matching Touch Plus controllers, and three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. While it’s not a true Xbox VR experience, the Xbox Cloud Gaming app is good enough if you really want to play Xbox games without a screen and dedicated console. This is yet another device that’s part of Microsoft’s “This is an Xbox” initiative.</span></li><li><span><strong>Windows 11’s indicators for volume and brightness can soon be moved out of the way. </strong>Microsoft has started testing a new feature in Windows 11 that will <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/691779/microsoft-windows-11-hardware-indicators-customization">let you move hardware indicator pop-ups like volume and screen brightness</a>. At the moment, they’re stuck at the bottom-center of a screen, but you’ll soon be able to move them to the top-left or top-center positions. It’s part of an update that also includes a new Recall homepage, which lists the top three apps and websites you’ve used in a 24-hour period.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft’s new small language model is Mu. </strong>Microsoft has introduced a new <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2025/06/23/introducing-mu-language-model-and-how-it-enabled-the-agent-in-windows-settings/">on-device Mu model</a> this week, and it’s going to power Windows 11’s new Settings AI agent. “Mu is fully offloaded onto the Neural Processing Unit (NPU) and responds at over 100 tokens per second, meeting the demanding UX requirements of the agent in Settings scenario,” says <strong>Vivek Pradeep</strong>, vice president and distinguished engineer at Windows applied sciences.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft’s Xbox UI update lets you pin games and customize your homescreen. </strong>Microsoft is rolling out a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/691287/xbox-home-ui-pin-favorite-games-apps-rolling-out">new update to its Xbox Home UI</a> that allows Xbox owners to pin apps and games on the homescreen. You can also customize the Xbox Home UI even further to hide system apps and reduce the number of apps and games listed. This should make it easier to see more of those Xbox Dynamic Backgrounds.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft adds Steam games to its Xbox PC app on Windows. </strong>Microsoft is starting to test its new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/690967/microsoft-xbox-app-windows-steam-games-aggregated-library-support-beta">aggregated gaming library in its Xbox PC app</a> on Windows. Xbox Insiders will be able to start testing this single launcher experience on Windows this week, and it will be identical to what ships on the ROG Xbox Ally handhelds later this year.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft is blocking Google Chrome through its family safety feature. </strong>Microsoft’s Family Safety feature, primarily used by parents and schools as a set of parental controls and filters, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/690179/microsoft-block-google-chrome-family-safety-feature">started randomly blocking Google’s Chrome browser</a> from opening on Windows earlier this month. Microsoft has now acknowledged the issue and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-24h2">provided a workaround</a> while it works on a fix.</span></li><li><span><strong>Bill Gates and Linus Torvalds meet for the first time. </strong>Microsoft cofounder <strong>Bill Gates</strong> and Linux kernel creator <strong>Linus Torvalds</strong> have surprisingly never met before. Sysinternals creator <strong>Mark Russinovich</strong> hosted the pair and <strong>Dave Cutler</strong>, Microsoft technical fellow and Windows NT lead developer, at a dinner party recently. Cutler and Gates both got to meet Torvalds for the first time, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/markrussinovich_i-had-the-thrill-of-a-lifetime-hosting-dinner-activity-7341857033932914691-f5Kw/">Russinovich joked</a> that “no major kernel decisions were made.”</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft struggles to sell Copilot as businesses want ChatGPT instead</strong>. <em>Bloomberg</em> has taken a deep dive into the reality of Microsoft 365 Copilot and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-24/chatgpt-vs-copilot-inside-the-openai-and-microsoft-rivalry">which businesses are actually paying to use it</a>. Some have switched to OpenAI’s ChatGPT instead, putting Microsoft salespeople on the back foot in an increasingly complicated relationship between OpenAI and Microsoft.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft starts to move antivirus providers out of the Windows kernel. </strong>A faulty CrowdStrike update took down 8.5 million Windows machines nearly a year ago, and now Microsoft is taking some big steps to make sure that never happens again. It’s starting to preview <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/692637/microsoft-windows-kernel-antivirus-changes">new Windows changes that will move antivirus</a> (AV) and endpoint detection and response (EDR) apps out of the Windows kernel. It’s going to take some time to get this right, and Microsoft says it’s working closely with security vendors to make sure that the APIs it develops work well for these third-party solutions.</span></li></ul></div><p>There won’t be a Notepad issue next week as I’ll be out on vacation, but I’m always keen to hear from readers, so please drop a comment here, or you can reach me at <a href="mailto:notepad@theverge.com">notepad@theverge.com</a> if you want to discuss anything else.</p><p>If you’ve heard about any of Microsoft’s secret projects, you can reach me via email at <a href="mailto:notepad@theverge.com">notepad@theverge.com</a> or speak to me confidentially on the Signal messaging app, where <a href="https://signal.me/#eu/soK8N9/6J1KVh2/ZZblbDEGXHNH1gK0Q+RaxJQ7vUxDDTYvxX8hARqMZfjuz3Egj">I’m tomwarren.01</a>.

            <p>This article on a free update for train factory <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> Railgrade is the absolute height of presumption, for we have never actually covered <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/railgrade">Railgrade</a> before, even though it came out ONE MILLION YEARS AGO in October 2023.</p>
<p>I cannot hear your cries of outrage and scorn, however, for my ears are filled with the otherworldly whistle of speeding locomotives. The locos wail to me of a brand new campaign encompassing 11 missions and nine hours of playtime. Did you play Railgrade? Do you wish there were more of it? Well, stop carping about our spotty coverage and get this patch down your trousers, then.</p><!--more-->
<p>The campaign in question is Rapid Repo Rescue. As <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1355090/view/803443087671039134?l=english">detailed on Steam</a>, it takes you to a brand new colony planet except that, oops, it turns out the colony ship accidentally landed on a planet owned by a rival corporation. As such, you'll now need to rush-develop a factory network in order to recharge your space launcher before the legal goons arrive and suitcase the entire site from orbit.</p>
<p>The new campaign is the work of a Railgrade player, Mortiz, who is currently studying at university. Railgrade devs Minakata Dynamics commissioned him - in the form of cash, scandalously enough, rather than the standard creative industry currency of exposure - in light of his past work for the mapmaking community. A few Discord group members have pitched in with playtesting, seemingly for free. I frown upon devs who enlist their players as unpaid testers, but in fairness, this appears to have been a more informal community production.</p>
<p>If you own Railgrade, you'll find Rapid Repo Rescue on the bonus campaign menu. "We gave Mortiz access to every yet-unused asset in the game," lead programmer Daniel Dressler notes. "This meant new trains, new industry, and new resources." The latter bits include "a Natural Gas &amp; Hydrogen set of energy production chains", a new Gas Powerplant, and Offshore Gas Wells.</p>
<p>If you never played Railgrade, because you think trains are the work of the Devil, you may be more interested in the developer's forthcoming <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2489330/Whiskerwood/">Whiskerwood</a>. It's about building factory-colonies of mice and sending shipments of goods to villainous cats overseas - a pleasantly concussed reimagining of European colonialism, plus jolly pirate ships. We'll try to write about that one when it actually comes out.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cool-train-strategy-game-railgrade-gets-a-free-campaign-about-escaping-a-rival-corporations-planet]]></content:encoded>
