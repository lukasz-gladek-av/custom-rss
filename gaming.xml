            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has released its financial results for the first quarter of the 2025-26 fiscal year, and both sales and profits for the publisher are up, driven largely by strong sales for&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>and its associated titles.</p>

<p>As revealed in its <a href="https://www.bandainamco.co.jp/files/ir/financialstatements/pdf/20250805_en_Result.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">latest financial statement</a>, Bandai Namco's net sales have risen by 7% when compared to the same period last year, and its operating profit is up by 18%. These rises are more modest than those of last year, but that's to be expected given that the&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>DLC&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-sales" rel="nofollow">landed in that period</a>.</p>

<p>In an accompanying <a href="https://www.bandainamco.co.jp/files/ir/financialstatements/pdf/20250805_Presentation.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">presentation</a> (which is in Japanese, so we're using additional reporting by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/elden-ring-nightreigns-strong-sales-drive-bandai-namcos-game-sector-profits-in-first-quarter/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>), Bandai Namco attributes this quarter's success at least partly to&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, which was revealed last month to have sold <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-nightreign-sales" rel="nofollow">over five million copies</a>.</p>

<p>With regards to the future, meanwhile, Bandai Namco has a number of big releases on the horizon. These include the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/blood-of-dawnwalker-ex-witcher-devs" rel="nofollow"><em>The Blood of Dawnwalker</em></a>, a major RPG developed by ex-<em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>staffers, and&nbsp;<em>Code Vein II</em>, a followup to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/code-vein" rel="nofollow">anime-inflected 2019 Soulslike</a>.</p>

<p>Another big Bandai Namco release coming in the next few months is, of course,&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares III</em>, the third major installment in the&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares&nbsp;</em>series of side-scrolling horror platformers. It's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/little-nightmares-iii-release-date" rel="nofollow">currently due to land in October</a>.</p>

<p>That's despite <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/supermassive-games-layoffs-directive-8020-delayed" rel="nofollow">layoffs at developer Supermassive Games</a>; when said layoffs were announced, the studio made it clear development on&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares III&nbsp;</em>would be unaffected, although sci-fi adventure&nbsp;<em>Directive 8020&nbsp;</em>has been delayed.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[3 Essential Tips For Getting Started In Broken Arrow]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/broken-arrow-tips-starter-deck-recon-infantry-2000614583</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/3-essential-tips-for-getting-started-in-broken-arrow.1262250/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Though you’re not controlling thousands of individual units, <i>Broken Arrow</i> still requires a basic grasp of combined arms tactics. You’ll soar overhead with attack helicopters, slink through the underbrush with stealthy sniper units, and roam the plains in force with a battalion of armored tanks. Your army is an extension of your will. Knowing how to effectively use each unit, stomp opponents, and take control of sectors is the difference between yet another loss and the coveted win.</p> <h2>Use a starter deck initially</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614585" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614585"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614585">© Screenshot: Steel Balalaika / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I have a long, storied history in the real-time strategy and tactics genre, and yet, in titles such as <i>Warno</i>, <i>Steel Division 2</i>, and now <i>Broken Arrow</i>, I’ve always been terrible at creating decks. I want to bring everything, to wield every toy in the arsenal, and I wind up with choice paralysis. Ultimately, I opt for the strongest or the most aesthetically pleasing units, and that’s my downfall.</p> <p>If you’re a new player, especially to the whole genre, then <i>Broken Arrow</i> may feel overwhelming with all of its mechanics and macro/micro tactics. To enter the scene and delve straight into deck-building can lead to disaster.</p>

 <p>There are two starter decks: US and Russian. They both approach the 10,000 point limit, with the Russian hitting the cap straight off the bat, and both include an array of units from all disciplines, including recon, infantry, helicopter, and air. They’re both well-rounded, with units designed for introductory gameplay.</p> <h2>Utilize your recon strategically</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614586" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614586"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614586">© Screenshot: Steel Balalaika / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I cannot begin to tell you the number of players I’ve met online who chose to outright bumrush opponents instead of wielding all of the tools at their disposal effectively. Namely, recon units. You have access to an array of recon that can hide in dense forests and, so long as they have line of sight, they’ll provide advance notice when enemy units approach.</p> <p><b>Place your recon units strategically.</b> Look at your map, identify chokepoints and ingress points, then note key cover locations for your recon. Get them there quickly.</p>

 <p>Place your recon at the edge of the forest, then hold ‘Alt’ on your keyboard to activate the line of sight tool and ensure your units have a clear field of vision. Second,<b> turn off the ‘Return Fire’ command, which disables auto-fire targeting, allowing them to remain stealthy.</b></p> <h2>Your infantry is an effective tool, but only when used properly</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614587" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614587"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614587">© Screenshot: Steel Balalaika / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Many new players will resort to a “safe” tactic by deploying mass groups of infantry, thinking the overwhelming force will dominate control points. It’s much easier than controlling tanks, helicopters, and infantry simultaneously, right? Yes, but also no. If you bunch up your infantry, a single bombing run from a jet overhead, or a well-placed artillery/mortar shot, will decimate the entire group.</p> <p>Instead, use your infantry as a pseudo-guerrilla force. Send your infantry toward multiple control points, just to make it seem like you’re spread out across the map in a way that will force your opponent to divert forces elsewhere. Then, flank with your most powerful units, like tanks and helicopters, once the enemy’s forces thin out. If your micro game is on point, you can kite enemies with your infantry to keep them out of harm’s way long enough for reinforcements to push forward. The ol’ bait and switch!</p> <hr> <p><i>Broken Arrow</i> is available now exclusively on Windows PCs.</p>

      </div>
<p>Preloading for the Battlefield 6 beta is available on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S as well, along with the EA app, so the Steam numbers represent just a fraction of the total audience.</p><p>The Battlefield 6 open beta begins on August 7 for a select group of people, including those who signed up for Battlefield Labs by July 31, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-is-not-on-game-pass-but-is-coming-to-a-subscription-service/1100-6533658/" data-ref-id="1100-6533658">EA Play Pro members</a>, and those who obtained a code from watching a Twitch streamer playing the game. The beta then opens to anyone August 9-10, and then for a second weekend August 14-17. For more, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-release-date-time/1100-6533515/" data-ref-id="1100-6533515">GameSpot's Battlefield 6 open beta breakdown.</a></p><p>The full game, meanwhile, launches on October 10 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The release date is about a month before Activision's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> is rumored to launch on November 14.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://eci.ec.europa.eu/045/public/#/screen/home/disabled">Stop Destroying Videogames citizens' initiative</a>, the petition asking EU lawmakers to look into the issue of publishers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-never-owned-the-game-insist-ubisoft-to-the-crew-players-that-are-suing-the-publisher">rendering online games unplayable when official support runs its course</a>, hit its deadline at the end of last month looking like it'd amassed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-eu-petition-hits-a-million-signatures-but-a-significant-number-could-be-fake">more than enough signatures</a>. With that phase over, the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Killing Games</a> campaign that's vocally supported efforts like this is left to await the outcomes, whatever they might be.</p>
<p>That's given YouTuber Ross Scott, who's become the loudest voice publicising this worldwide push for action on consumer rights when it comes to these sorts of server shutdowns, a chance to take stock of how things have gone to this point. He's keen to take a break, but will first have to see how things pan out with the multiple irons Stop Killing Games and their adjacent groups have in the fire.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Since the signing period is over, we're entering a phase where things like counter lobbying and political connections are most important," Scott said in a 'wrap up' video posted to his channel Accursed Farms. "Frankly, that is not my department. I know nothing about that, though some political insiders do, and they're advising the official organizers [of the EU petition]. I'm not even aware of all their plans."</p>
<p>So, that means "a whole lot of the campaign now involves waiting", though Scott did still encourage those who're keen to support it to carry on doing things like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/european-parliament-vice-president-throws-his-support-behind-stop-killing-games-campaign">contacting MEPs about the issue</a>, or helping the initiative's organisers get in contact with EU admin staff if they can.</p>
<p>Looking back on the campaign's efforts and general strategy to this point, Scott reckons those behind it have done well in terms of having "maximized our chances to push back against the issue of games being destroyed on almost every front". While he acknowledged that the group's efforts in a number of countries, such as the USA and Brazil, having hit brick walls in some form or another, Scott said he believes the campaign's "done about as well as is humanly possible given the landscape."</p>

<p>"I think France, Germany, Australia, and the EU as a whole are the heavyweights in this," the YouTuber reasoned, with measures in these places all currently waiting action or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/campaign-asking-eu-to-stop-publishers-destroying-online-games-hit-by-anonymous-transparency-complaint">responses from the bodies</a> they're directed at. "As long as we get a major market prohibiting game destruction, I think we'll largely win this globally...I don't see lots of new stuff on the horizon later. I think we either win on at least one of these or if they all fail, then it's over."</p>
<p>With things now at that stage, Scott's aiming to soon take a "standby break" from his volunteering to help promote this cause, only popping up if something happens with the campaign that he thinks would benefit from his intervention.</p>
<p>"I know a lot of people found out about Stop Killing Games just recently, but I've been going at it hard for over a year and a half now, and I wasn't exactly well rested prior to that," the YouTuber said, adding that he ironically hasn't "had time to play a game for close to a couple months now". Here's hoping he is able to take that proper break, while we all wait to see what the outcomes of these bits of action are.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/with-stop-killing-games-supported-eu-petition-now-closed-the-campaigns-loudest-voice-reckons-its-done-about-as-well-as-is-humanly-possible]]></content:encoded>

              <p>It’s a rule of the universe that if you release a successful indie game, there will almost immediately be crappy mobile knock-offs and a version built in&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em>. That’s as true as ever for&nbsp;<em>Peak</em>, the adorable co-op climbing game about scaling a mountain with your friends (<a href="https://kotaku.com/peak-cannibalism-patch-notes-bug-fixes-steam-1851787299">and sometimes eating them</a>), with a <em>Roblox</em> rip-off called&nbsp;<em>Cliff</em>. And&nbsp;<em>Peak</em> developers Aggro Crab are clearly not impressed.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/peak-steam-reviews-lethal-company-aggro-crab-1851786254"><em>Peak</em></a> came out on June 16, and has quickly gone on to be a summer smash. From the developers of 2024’s&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/another-crabs-treasure-review-1851435745"><em>Another Crab’s Treasure</em></a>, the indie co-op climbing sim has become massive, peaking at almost 115,000 simultaneous players, and still has 20,000 people playing right now. It’s been a splendid and well-deserved success. So of course, there are knock-offs. But my goodness,&nbsp;<em>Cliff</em>‘s is beyond blatant. And Aggro Crab aren’t delighted about the situation.</p> <p>“tbh would rather you pirate our game than play this microtransaction-riddled @Roblox slop ripoff,” says a post from Aggro Crab’s official X account, spotted by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/peak/roblox-ripoff"><em>PCGN</em></a>.</p>

The same goes for how the games play, the floating hands for climbing, the plane crash start with the suitcases on the beach, pretty much everything.

But seeing their creativity reduced to a cash-in knock-off must be incredibly galling, not least when people could be playing the far superior game for a low up-front fee, and never have to spend another cent.</p> <p>Oh, and really, <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-child-account-safety-settings-danger-1851680045">no one should be going anywhere near&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em> in the first place.</a></p>

                <p>Since its debut near the end of March, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grow-a-garden/" data-ref-id="5000-681260">Grow a Garden</a> has been a breakout hit on the Roblox platform. Now, players will be able to cook the vegetables they grow and earn rewards in the game's latest update.    </p><p>The new update revolves around Chris P, a literal pig who has his own kitchen. Chris P's thought balloon reveals what he's craving at any particular moment, from candy to pizza. And if players are able to satisfy Chris P's cravings, then they'll be able to get an assortment of new seeds, new gear, and new in-game pets.</p><p>Some of the new seeds added to the game include onions, jalapenos, crown melon, and tacofern. Grow a Garden has also revamped its trading capabilities. Previously, some players were allowed to essentially rob their trading partners by disconnecting before coming through with their end of the bargain. Now, players need to get a trade ticket from the gear shop in order to complete a transaction.</p><p>Earlier this summer, Grow a Garden reached <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-roblox-game-is-blowing-up-in-popularity/1100-6531728/" data-ref-id="1100-6531728">5 million concurrent players</a>, before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-single-roblox-game-has-toppled-pubgs-all-time-concurrent-player-record/1100-6532006/" data-ref-id="1100-6532006">hitting nearly 12 million concurrent players</a> in July. The game was created by a teenage Roblox user who has yet to come forward publicly. However, production of the game and its updates is currently being handled by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/grow-a-garden-roblox-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a studio called Splitting Point</a>.</p><p>Grow a Garden's success is the best example yet of The Roblox Corporation's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-lays-out-grand-plans-to-transform-the-platform/1100-6526340/" data-ref-id="1100-6526340">grand plans for the platform</a>. As laid out at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/roblox/" data-ref-id="5005-152">Roblox</a> Developers Conference in 2024, the company unveiled a new revenue-sharing plan for developers who create premium experiences using Roblox's game creation tools. So far, Grow a Garden is easily the most popular fan-made experience on Roblox. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">It looks like EA may have a hit on its hands after over 9,000 people were sitting on the Battlefield 6 open beta on Steam after the pre-load went live.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You could pre-load the game as early as 8am PT yesterday, August 4, letting fans download the Battlefield 6 open beta ahead of early access opening at 1am PT on August 7 (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/battlefield-6/BF6_Open_Beta_Guide">here’s IGN’s guide on how to get in on the action</a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3081410/charts/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SteamDB data</a>, there was enough interest for the Battlefield 6 open beta to hit 9,463 concurrent “players” — days before the open beta itself goes live. At the time of this article’s publication, the beta had 3,805 concurrent users.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So what are people doing with the open beta? Lots of players are getting ahead of the game and setting their options, taking 30 minutes or so to edit user interface colors and weapon Field of View, for example.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Others are just using it to share their excitement with friends. “I have 6.4 hours in the beta total so far,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1mhx7pe/a_lot_of_people_just_sitting_in_the_preload_menu/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said redditor gruggers1</a>. “I literally just sat in the lobby and chatted with friends in the in game voice chat.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some are reporting having to spend time getting around EA’s frustrating restrictions on PC launch. It looks like unless you have Secure Boot turned on in your BIOS, the Battlefield 6 open beta won’t run at all, so there may be players trying to sort that out, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So nice to be able to test if the game boot up, set everything up and be prepared for the most exciting moment,” added redditor rafahuel.</p><div id="every-battlefield-game-ranked" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Every Battlefield game, ranked.</h3><h3>Every Battlefield game, ranked.</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As many have pointed out, there were nearly as many people sitting on the Battlefield 6 Open Beta’s menu screen as there were people actually playing the last Battlefield game, 2042, on Steam, which is quite something. (9,463 24-hour peak for the Battlefield 6 open beta versus 11,245 24-hour peak for 2042).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what does this mean for Battlefield 6? From EA’s perspective, it suggests there’s significant interest in the game. EA has said it’s all-in on Battlefield 6, so there’s significant pressure on it to perform. It will be interesting to see the concurrent figures on Steam when the open beta goes live.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Battlefield 6 producer Jeremy Chubb has said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-producer-admits-2042-was-missing-the-excellence-of-predecessor-battlefield-bad-company-2">fan-favorite <u>Battlefield: Bad Company 2</u> was a "huge inspiration" for developing the shooter's upcoming instalment</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>When you get down to it, a lot of people would probably quite like to be a racoon that can ride a BMX bike, but what about being a BMX-riding racoon that’s also in consistent employment? That’s the dream Tanuki Pon’s Summer sells you, giving you control of a furry little chap and his bicycle as he attempts to deliver everyone’s mail, while pulling off a sick trick or two. It’s cute, cuddly and quite silly, and it’s undoubtedly utterly charming too.</p>
<p><iframe title="TANUKI: Pon's Summer — New Demo Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LTBIgHgJpHQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Pon, your tanuki hero, is lazing about on a bench at the start of the game, and it’s only the voice of the narrator – or is it his conscience? – that gets him moving, nabbing his BMX and setting off down the road. You find a bunch of the different elements that you’re going to experience down this country path, from Torii Gates that act as waypoints or finishing lines, obstacles to bunny hop over, and, most excitingly, different places to pull off tricks.</p>


<p>There is, in fact, a handy skate park thrown into your journey back to civilisation, and here you find that your raccoon is a furry little Dave Mirra, chucking out a tail flip or Superman with ease. Just like your favourite gaming extreme sports heroes, you can chain these moves together for higher scores, though you do, of course, have to nail the landing. It’s possible to chuck yourself off your bike, and you’ll have to run over and grab it if that happens. Which it undoubtedly will.</p>


<p>Pon has to spend the summer earning money in order to decorate and repair the local Tanuki Shrine, which sits at the centre of the island, all leading up to the Matsuri Festival which happens every 50 years. Pon doesn’t necessarily seem like the ideal candidate – he’d much rather spend his time sleeping or grinding rails – but he sets to work, nonetheless, becoming the island’s delivery boy, working for the Post Office to raise the cash.</p>
<p>Our hands-on covered Pon’s first week on the job, working his way through the first town, which presumably means that there’s multiple towns that will need your delivery services.</p>
<p>The first step is to pick up the packages. This is a game in itself, as the packages arrive in all sorts of different shapes, and you have to fit them neatly into your bag, packing the Tetris-like shapes together in the most sensible way.</p>
<p>Once you’ve stacked the packages into the basket on your bike, it’s off to work, but this isn’t really the kind of behaviour you’d expect from a FedEx employee. While you have to ride around finding the recipients, there’s a stack of Letter Quests to work your way through, from collecting all the TANUKI letters, to backflipping over the statue in the centre of town. I’d quite like to see our local Amazon delivery guys spicing things up by pulling off BMX tricks, but they’d probably break all the air fryers in the process, so best to leave it to the raccoons.</p>

<p>Tanuki Pon’s Summer is cute. It has an adorable aesthetic, with a colourful Japanese countryside setting, and chunky architecture that really brings the island to life. I love the characters here though, from the podgy Pon, with his cute walk and oversized Post Office hat, to the exceedingly loud Bunta and kind Fumi, the workers at the Post Office, and Tetsuo, the former sumo wrestler who longs for the old days.</p>
<p>Tetsuo convinces you to train in sumo, and that opens up another diversion, becoming the first tanuki to fight in sumo. Here, you stomp to charge up your stamina for the fight, use hand slaps to push the opponent back quickly, dodging at the right time to keep up your momentum, and big belly smashes to force them out of the ring. It’s another great little aside, that keeps you guessing as to where Tanuki Pon’s Summer might take you.</p>
<p>You get an insight into the recipient’s interests and mindset, chatting with them while dropping off their package, or being drawn into an unexpected activity, and it gives Pon’s world a grounding and reality that you probably shouldn’t get from one with a tanuki on a bicycle. It’s all thoroughly charming, and I can see why Microsoft chose to highlight it in their upcoming indie schedule. Breezing about the town, performing tricks while racing between different deliveries just feels like a lot of fun.</p>

<p>At the moment, the only downside is your compass becoming immediately filled with package notifications, and there’s currently no way to pop down a pin or marker on the map to help you stay focused on that particular one.</p>
<p>Tanuki Pon’s Summer is a cute and charming indie adventure, where deliveries, diversions and BMX tricks lie around every corner. We can’t wait to see more when it reaches final release for PC, Switch, and the Xbox family of consoles later this year.</p>

			<p>Grand Theft Auto VI may break records in the gaming industry not only in terms of profits, but also in terms of price tags, as a known analyst believes the game will cost more than any other title on the market.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/08/03/grand-theft-auto-online-safety-laws/">The Telegraph</a>, Wedbush Securities' Michael Patcher, known for making some bold predictions in the past, said that he expects a high price, $100, for the new entry in the series by Rockstar Games at launch, which would make it the first video game to be sold at such a high price, not counting special or limited editions. Still, no matter the price point, Patcher expects the game to be immensely profitable, likely generating $10 billion in lifetime and $500 million annually from <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-online-age-verification/">GTA Online</a>. Commenting on the game's budget, Patcher's estimates are more in line with what we have heard from other analysts, placing them in the $1.5 billion range, also including marketing costs.</p>



<p>Although predictions may vary, the consensus among analysts is that Grand Theft Auto VI is going to be one of the biggest video game releases of all time, if not the biggest.<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-7-billion-revenue-60-days/"> Last month</a>, Konvoy's Managing Partner Josh Chapman confirmed the firm's prediction that the game will generate $7.6 billion in revenue in the first two months of availability, with Take-Two recouping a potential $2 billion investment within a month from release. Even by other metrics, such as number of copies sold, player count, and viewership, the new entry in the series is expected to be a <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/">record-shattering release. </a></p>



<p>Grand Theft Auto VI launches on <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">May 26, 2026,</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. A PC version has yet to be confirmed, but going from past Rockstar Games titles' launches, we should expect the game to make its debut on the platform sometime in 2027.</p>

<figure><a title="Sonic Timberlands" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4a1224762b865/sonic-timberlands.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>After <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/05/these-sonic-the-hedgehog-crocs-are-kinda-horrific-and-theyre-out-now">collaborating on a pair of Crocs</a> back in 2023, SEGA is continuing its streak of 'Footwear That Would Be Inappropriate For Sonic The Hedgehog' with a new pair of Sonic-inspired Timberland kicks.</p>
<p>Let's manage those expectations right from the jump. It's unlikely that most of us will ever get our hands on a pair of these bad boys. The collab is in celebration of the upcoming grand opening of SEGA's flagship store in Japan, and will <em>only</em> be available at the nearby Shibuya PARCO Timberland store from 9th August.</p>
<p>Now that we know we're never going to see the range in the flesh, let's collectively cry over how cool it all looks. The highlight item is, of course, a pair of Timbs, which takes the classic "yellow" boot design and throws in some sneaky Sonic nods for good measure. There's a small picture of the blue blur himself etched onto the outer material, the Sonic the Hedgehog icon adorns the inner side, and get a look at those laces!</p>

<p>According to the collaboration announcement on the <a href="https://www.timberland.co.jp/news-250805_sega.html">Japanese Timberland website</a>, the boots will set you back ¥38,500 (roughly £196 / $261) and there are <em>apparently</em> only 30 pairs available. Yep, we're sure people will behave totally normally in the queues for these...</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are some other items in the range besides the boots. The collaboration also introduces two long- and short-sleeve t-shirts, available in black or white. Both tops sport the rather snazzy collab icon of Sonic in his Timbs, with the brand logos on the sleeve/chest.</p>

<p>And just to rub it in even more, anyone lucky enough to pick up an item in the range will <em>also</em> land an exclusive postcard and sticker of the boot-wearing hedgehog. Damn, we're suckers for a good sticker...</p>
<p>As we say, it's unlikely that we'll ever see much of the range in person thanks to the ol' Japanese exclusivity, but who knows, perhaps it'll be so popular that it gets a bigger release in the future. We doubt it, but let us dream!</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s open beta kicks off later this week, and EA have now painted a picture of what you can expect maps/modes-wise, as well as in terms of the changes the devs have made based on Battlefield Labs playtest feedback.</p>
<p>Plus, there's a new trailer that features yet more folks in camo running about amid booms. I'm glad to report that no helicopters, at least at a glance, look to have been harmed in the run up to this one.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As detailed in Battlefield 6's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-full-multiplayer-reveal-sees-ea-trying-to-rebottle-the-lightning-of-battlefield-3-and-4">multiplayer reveal last week</a>, the open beta will mainly run across two weekend-ish windows, August 9th-10th and August 14th -17th. Because big video game in 2025, there'll also be open beta early access running from August 7th into the first weekend, limited to folks who've subscribed to EA Play Pro or registered for Battlefield Labs before July 31st.</p>
<p>During <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/everything-you-need-to-know-for-the-open-beta">the first weekend</a>, you'll be able to jump into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-three-deafening-hours-of-its-multiplayer-battlefield-6-sure-looks-like-a-battlefield-game">three different maps and three different game modes</a>. Siege of Cairo will offer urban battles likely involving much crouch-walking, Liberation Peak takes you to the countryside of Tajikistan's mountains for what sounds like more open action with jet and chopper dogfight potential, and Iberian Offensive takes you back to tight streets, but this time in Gibraltar.</p>

<p>The three modes for that opening weekend are conquest, breakthrough, and closed weapons breakthrough. For weekend two, the Empire State map will be wheeled out so infantryfolks can thoroughly wreck Brooklyn, with rush and squad deathmatch also arriving to make it five modes in total.</p>
<p>Lest you think EA haven't taken anything on board from those who've already dived into the game's Battlefield Labs testing, the publishers have put out a full Tweeter essay outlining how that feedback's shaped changes for the beta and beyond. For this open play specifically, they want you to give a closed weapon conquest playlist a go as part of plans to let folks "choose between closed and open weapon modes", while maps like Siege of Cairo have had several aspects revamped with an eye to ensuring the flow of murder-deathing and balance of battles is closer to the ideal.</p> <div>

<p>The sorts of Time-to-Kill and Time-to-Death debates that'll still be going on around multiplayer shooters in the year 5025 have led EA to balance damage "across the weapon pool". The weapon customisation menus have also been made more clear, and signature weapons have been introduced. The latter means, for example, recon classers will get extra advantages with the sniper rifles that I assume they'll be using to 360 no-scope fools from across the map.</p>
<p>More in-depth changes for all four of the game's main classes - assault, engineer, support, and recon - are already planned and detailed in the essay, but won't be coming in until after this open beta's concluded. That means you'll have to hop into more Labs testing if you want to try something closer to the "final adaptation" of the class system <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-pc-specs-dont-look-too-lofty-despite-all-the-booms-and-steam-players-wont-need-the-pesky-ea-app">ahead of release</a>.</p>
<p>Once the open beta's done, EA'll be putting out "an overview of further changes we’re making on the road towards launch", because the tweakage can never stop.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-maps-and-modes-shared-as-ea-write-an-essay-about-tweaks-based-on-labs-feedback]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Are you the sort of player that would rather drop a game altogether than simply bump the difficulty down (if such an option exists?) If so, then you might be in better company than you think - at least that's what the developer of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-first-berserker-khazan">The First Berserker: Khazan</a> has deduced from poring over its player data, anyway.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2680010/view/543360749096928012?l=english">In an update on Steam</a>, Neople revealed some interesting information about the behaviour of players that picked up its hardcore action role-playing game since its release in March 2025.</p>
<!-- code from Primis - Eurogamer.net - eurogamer.net -->
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</div>
<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>As part of the game's big June update, Junho Lee (Khazan's creative director) posted a big rundown of the thinking behind the game's difficulty rework that explained the reasons for adding a 'Beginner' mode to the game. Whilst the update is a couple of weeks old now, I've seen the statement doing the rounds in dev Discords and message boards this morning, and thought it was worth bringing to attention more broadly.</p>
<p>"At launch, we set our intended standard experience as 'Normal' and added a more accessible option labeled 'Easy'," wrote Lee. "We figured that if players found the game too difficult, they'd simply switch to Easy. But when we looked at the data, we saw that many players just quit the game without ever changing the difficulty."</p>
<p>Per Lee and the team's research, there was a simple reason for this: he believes players feel like "[they'd] rather quit with dignity than drop it down to Easy."</p>
<p>It's a fascinating study of player psychology. Just look towards something like Bloodborne or Sekiro - games that launched without a second difficulty mode - and the fervent conversation that kicks up every single time someone suggests slapping an 'Easy' mode in those games. People get very defensive about their ability to master difficult games like these, and see it as a mark of pride that they can take on the (in some cases) extreme challenge that comes with the action-RPG genre. Just think back to the discourse around <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fromsoftware/comments/1fep4zc/radahn_is_actually_a_great_boss_after_this_patch/">beating 'pre-patch Radahn'</a> in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a>, for example.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Did the game's difficulty drive you Berserk? | <span>Image credit: <cite>Neople / Nexon</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Lee continues: "Some also said that if the default had been called 'Hard' instead, they would've felt okay about switching down to 'Normal'." Again, this demonstrates player ego more than anything else - did Neople's decision to call its difficulty modes 'Normal' and 'Easy' affect player retention? It would seem so.</p>
<p>"Difficulty is subjective, and each player experiences Khazan's challenges differently," muses Lee. "That's why we offered multiple difficulty options from the start. We wanted more people to enjoy Khazan, and we thought it would be better to let players freely adjust the challenge. We thought it was up to the player to lower it if it's too hard or raise it if it's too easy.</p>
<p>"That's one of the biggest lessons I've learned from all of you."</p>
<p>The result? In the June update, Neople added in both 'Beginner' and 'Hardcore' difficulty modes. 'Beginner' was a result of people claiming "Sure, there's an 'Easy' mode... but it's the hardest Easy mode I've ever played," per Lee, that doesn't just make enemies easier to kill and make your character more hardy,  also adds accessibility elements (allowing you to engage at your own discretion better). 'Hardcore', meanwhile, rolls out the bosses in the game in their "purest form": bastard-hard versions of the encounters that are more true to the prototyped versions from earlier on in the dev cycle.</p>
<p>This is the polar opposite approach compared to a creator like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hidetaka-miyazaki">Hidetaka Miyazaki</a>, creator of Dark Souls. He has gone on the record as saying turning down <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>'s difficulty would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/turning-down-elden-rings-difficulty-would-break-the-game-itself-says-miyazaki">"break the game itself"</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is actually enduring complaints about the opposite end of the spectrum at the moment, with veteran players <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-revised-roadmap">clamouring for harder fights</a> in the post-game. Newly-released Wuchang: Fallen Feathers devs are using post-launch patches<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wuchang-fallen-feathers-studio-to-continue-optimising-performance-and-rebalance-cheap-difficulty"> to address 'cheap difficulty' in its fights</a>. It's somewhat impossible to get the balance right the first time, clearly.</p>
<p>I appreciate the transparency of the developers, here. I think Neople's assessment and reaction to player behaviour is a fascinating look behind the curtain of game development, and something more developers should endeavour to communicate. Regarding game development, I'd rather this than something a little more underhanded, like you see in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-res4-ps2">Resident Evil 4</a> - which will quietly bump the difficulty down without telling you if you're struggling with a certain section (see the video below for more information on that little nugget).</p>

<p>Difficulty in hard games is not a new conversation. In fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-video-game-difficulty-became-a-cultural-battleground">it's something of a cultural battleground</a>. Only recently, our own Ed mused on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-overture-difficulty-options">the positive impact difficulty options had on his experience with Lies of P Overture</a>. We've spoken about how achingly fine-tuned balance in video games <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-is-massively-imbalanced-but-balance-is-overrated-anwyay">can often be a bore, if we're honest</a>.</p>
<p>What's your opinion? Are you more likely to pick up The First Berserker: Khazan knowing that there are more difficulty options now available? Or do you like your games as masochistic as they come (roll on, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nioh-3-announced-and-theres-a-demo-out-now">Nioh 3</a>)?</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/would-you-rather-stop-playing-a-game-than-lower-the-difficulty-the-first-berserker-khazan-devs-reckon-you-would]]></content:encoded>

On Steam, the download size is 39.24 GB. In case you're wondering about the PC system requirements, they can be found <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-pc-requirements-relatively-mild/">here</a>, and they're not that scary if you have built a PC in the last four or five years or so. </p>



<p>The official Battlefield account on X also <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1952412102871994565" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted</a> an overview of how the Open Beta test will differ from the Battlefield Labs testing and the final game. The Assault class has had some of its abilities reworked to be team-oriented; for example, Commanding Presence has replaced Enhanced Mobility as the new Signature Trait, speeding up capturing objectives for nearby squad members and taking the team out of combat status faster. Moreover, the Spawn Beacon has been transferred from the Recon class to the Assault class. Although the Deploy Beacon has traditionally been a Recon class staple, it has had its challenges there. By moving it to the Assault class for Battlefield 6, the developers hope to make it a teamplay tool for frontline flanking and coordinated squad movement. The Deploy Beacon can now only be used a finite number of times per squad, and it will self-destruct if the Assault player spawns on it. Finally, the Assault Ladder is a new gadget that provides squads access to previously unreachable areas. Depending on the deployment angle, it can function as a ladder or a ramp. As a powerful teamplay gadget, it allows Assault players to help their entire team overcome obstacles, gain height advantages, and surprise the enemy.</p>



<p>According to feedback, the Engineer works well right now and will not be receiving changes at this time. The Support, however, may get some minor tweaks to the refresh rate of supply crates and how well its signature weapon buffs contribute to the game's flow. The Recon has had one of its training options, Pathfinder, replaced by Spec Ops:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Spec Ops 0</strong>:<strong> </strong>Your base class training, available from the start and allows quieter takedowns, crouch and prone movement.</li>



<li><strong>Spec Ops 1</strong>: Spots nearby enemy gadgets (except when sprinting).</li>



<li><strong>Spec Ops 2</strong>:<strong> </strong>Going prone takes you out of combat much faster and removes the spot on self.</li>
</ul>



<p>Moreover, the Recon class now features an Active Ability at Level 3 that lets players call in a UAV to a marked position for passive spotting.</p>



<p>Lastly, as mentioned in the headline, the developers confirmed in a press briefing (as <a href="https://twitter.com/undefined/status/1952011658143924686?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1952011658143924686%7Ctwgr%5E668771305845d75d42a62ab4f1f2512df684bf6c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dexerto.com%2Fbattlefield%2Fbattlefield-6-confirmed-to-have-skill-based-matchmaking-no-server-browser-3233524%2F">reported by CharlieIntel</a>) that matchmaking in Battlefield 6 will be based on a series of factors, including ping, player location, server availability, and some skill checks. It is unclear on which criteria this will be based, but the goal is clearly to deliver a more evenly balanced experience between players with relatively similar skills.</p>

<p>Out this December</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Last week, during Nintendo's partner showcase, Square Enix lifted the lid on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a> - a new entry in the HD-2D series where you'll customise and play as your own character.</p>
<p>Square Enix has already shared quite a bit about this upcoming release, and now it seems it's been rated by the Entertainment Software Rating Board ahead of its arrival this December. It's 'T' for "Teen" and contains blood, fantasy violence, language and suggestive themes.</p>
<p>Here's the official ESRB description, which goes into detail about all of the themes mentioned in the classification:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> is rated T for Teen by the ESRB with Blood, Fantasy Violence, Language, and Suggestive Themes. This is a role-playing game in which players assume the role of a traveler searching for sacred rings. As players explore a fantastical world, they assemble companions to engage in turn-based battles against human, animal, and monster enemies. Graphics are highly pixelated, with gameplay and cutscenes taking place from a distant perspective. Players use bladed weapons and elemental attacks to deplete opponents' health/hit points; combat is highlighted by impact sounds and light effects. Cutscenes depict additional violence involving small, pixelated characters: characters holding knives to their throats; cultists repeatedly stabbing a character; a man strangling a woman; a villain killing an unarmed civilian. Some characters are depicted with bloodstained clothing; a handful of scenes depict rooms with bloodstained corpses. The game contains some suggestive/sexual material: text describing a prostitute character (e.g., “sold their little sister to a brothel in a far-off land...In a distant land, their sister sold her body for coin.”); other dialogue (e.g., “Did you pleasure my old man last night you dirty wh*re”); stylized female monsters wearing revealing outfits (e.g., large amounts of cleavage/breasts). The word “sh*t” appears in the game."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As previously mentioned, the Switch 2 release is a Game-Key Card, and Square Enix says there are no plans to allow the Switch version to be upgraded in the future.</p>
<p>Octopath Traveler 0 will release on the Switch, Switch 2 and multiple other platforms on <strong>4th December 2025</strong>.</p>

<p>Drop in this week</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>One of the many announcements during last week's Nintendo's Partner showcase was the Switch 2 upgrade for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>.</p>
<p>With the game now available for the Switch 2 this week, Respawn Entertainment has outlined the game's performance details on this new platform. Here's the full rundown along with some information about the download process:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Enjoy up to <strong>60 FPS</strong>, depending on monitor/hardware capability and compatibility (<strong>1920x1080 docked</strong>, <strong>1792x1008 undocked</strong>)</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>- When you login, you’ll be redirected to the eShop to download Apex Legends on Nintendo Switch 2. You’ll be able to delete “Apex Legends for Nintendo Switch” after you login to the updated version.</p>
