                <p>Crash Bandicoot may not be as popular as he used to be, but three decades ago he was one of PlayStation's first breakout original characters. But when former Sony executive Shuji Utsumi attempted to get Hollywood interested in making a Crash Bandicoot movie, he was given the cold shoulder by film executives.</p><p>Utsumi--who is currently the CEO of Sega of America--told <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/reviving-sega-will-be-the-greatest" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a> about his attempt to bring Crash Bandicoot to the big screen. Despite the success of the games--from 1996 to 2010, Sony released a Crash-related game nearly every year--no one seemed to share Utsumi's vision for what the film could be.</p><p>"When I started to get involved in the video game business, I picked up Crash Bandicoot and started asking some of the movie studios if they were interested in turning that property into a movie," recalled Utsumi. "But I was treated like, 'hey, video games is like a toy business.' They didn't really take it seriously."</p><p>Utsumi went on to note that the Sonic the Hedgehog movies have proven to be very successful for both Hollywood--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-film-franchise-races-past-1-billion-at-the-box-office/1100-6528632/" data-ref-id="1100-6528632">the film franchise has pulled in more than $1 billion</a>--and for Sega itself in terms of boosting game sales and Sonic's status as an iconic character. Crash Bandicoot, however, has seen better days. Developer Toys for Bob made <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/crash-bandicoot-4-review-/1900-6417574/" data-ref-id="1900-6417574">Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time</a> in 2020, but the studio reportedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/crash-bandicoot-artist-says-fifth-game-was-canceled/1100-6524957/" data-ref-id="1100-6524957">canceled plans to produce Crash Bandicoot 5</a>.</p><p>Although the Crash Bandicoot games were originally developed by Naughty Dog, the rights to the character are currently held by Microsoft after its purchase of Activision Blizzard. Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/want-a-crash-bandicoot-movie-ask-xbox-the-last-of-us-boss-says/1100-6531823/" data-ref-id="1100-6531823">expressed his support for a Crash Bandicoot movie</a>, but he also reiterated that it's Microsoft's call whether to actually pursue that project.</p>

            <p>It'll soon be time for another season of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a>, the super-duper Overwotlike and thirsty delivery vehicle for every variation of Marvel character known to the human mind. What's coming in season three? Wesley Snipes and a bloody great burning bird lady. By which I mean, Blade and Phoenix. They'll be matching wits with Hera, goddess of death, who has palled up with Knull, god of symbioties, aka the wriggly black pyjamas sported by Venom.</p>
<p>All of this may seem frightening and bizarre if you're here because you accidentally hit auto-complete while googling "Marks &amp; Spencers opening times", so here's a swift trailer to fill you in.</p><!--more-->

<p>How about that? Nicely surgical bit of techno, I thought, definitely has me <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZuZZzvJxR8">itching for the dance floor</a>. The new season begins on 11th July. Here's some official blurb for that trailer.</p>
<blockquote><p>"In the wake of the Timestream Entanglement, Knull stirs deep within Klyntar's core, stretching his shadowed hands across the cosmos. Power promised by the dark symbiote god beckons the awakening of a new queen. The Phoenix arrives from across the stars to erase Klyntar before the darkness can rise again! However, she'll require unlikely aid from a warrior of two worlds who lives to fight against the tide of night."</p> </blockquote>
<p>"As the god of the symbiotes and the Phoenix Force collide, will you burn with the light of creation or embrace the darkness?" the trailer blurb concludes. I choose to translate this as: do you want Phoenix Force skins or Symbiote skins? As for how the new characters play, <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/massive-marvel-rivals-leak-confirms-season-3-theme-with-new-hero-battle-pass-and-more/">leaks suggest</a> that they're both DPS roles. There's also talk of new hero team-ups and some "anti-heal" mechanics, given away by new voice lines. It's probable one of the new heroes has the power to shut down health replenishment.</p>
<p>We've not covered Marvel Rivals much lately due to a shortage of hands at the wheel and greymass for the ever-expanding hero roster. It remains a popular game, with 56,735 people playing at the time of writing.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blade-and-phoenix-are-coming-to-marvel-rivals-this-july-in-season-3-along-with-rumoured-anti-heal-mechanics]]></content:encoded>

While the original group were facing serious issues of systemic corruption, and here it appears they’re facing a petty criminal with a pro-wrestler name, it’s not quite the downgrade it seems. The Subway Slammer, also known as Takeyuki Kiuchi, is a disgraced baseball player who has since retired from the sport and gone to work at a corporate desk job. His athletic career ended after a sexual harassment scandal, and now all his misogynistic tendencies are manifesting in violent acts in Tokyo subway stations, because his “Shadow” in the metaverse is out of control.</p><p>Surely this must be dealt with, and the Phantom Thieves with their ability to enter the Metaverse and face these distorted villains are the ones to do it. But the over-the-top self-seriousness with which <em>The Phantom X </em>treats a guy with such a crass nickname, who so cartoonishly shoulder checks people on the subway, has made it perfect meme fodder for <em>Persona </em>fans. <em>The Phantom X </em>has been out overseas since last year, so some <em>Persona </em>fans were already well aware of this storyline. Now that it’s out worldwide, everyone is in on the joke.</p><p>To be fair, the issue <em>The Phantom X </em>is depicting here is an important one. There are plenty of real-world reports of subway station violence in big cities, sometimes ending in casualties as victims are pushed onto the tracks. The problem is that the game is depicting Kiuchi’s crimes in such a way that it lends itself to the kind of unintentional meme-bait that makes it hard to take seriously. X (formerly Twitter) user <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/DeJected_Axe/status/1939373198505623932&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/DeJected_Axe/status/1939373198505623932" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DeJected_Axe put it best</a></span> when they said calling him the Subway Slammer feels like giving him a “<em>Scooby-Doo </em>villain” nickname. It feels like the game isn’t treating his crimes with the gravity they deserve. How am I supposed to hear a grown man say “The whole subway’s mine for the slammin’” and not giggle softly to myself?</p><p>All that being said, it sounds like <em>The Phantom X</em>’s story probably gets better <em>later</em>. Yusuke Nitta, who worked as a scenario planner on the original <em>Persona 5</em> and its extended <em>Royal </em>edition, and as a writer on the tactical RPG <em>Tactica</em>, said in a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/personaphantomx/comments/1lnt17q/in_a_deleted_twitter_post_yusuke_nitta_revealed/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/personaphantomx/comments/1lnt17q/in_a_deleted_twitter_post_yusuke_nitta_revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deleted X post</a></span> that he wasn’t involved in the Subway Slammer story, and was brought on to write for the game in its third chapter. He apparently removed the post after he got “emotional” seeing the reaction to the Subway Slammer storyline, and said, “Rest assured, <em>P5X</em> will get more and more interesting from now on.”</p><p>I haven’t had a chance to boot up my copy of <em>Persona 5: The Phantom X</em>, but I <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/persona-5-the-phantom-x-gacha-rolls-preview-mobile-pc-1851783773&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/persona-5-the-phantom-x-gacha-rolls-preview-mobile-pc-1851783773">did play a chunk of the Subway Slammer section</a></span> before the game launched. I don’t know if this makes me want to play the full game more or less. Maybe more? I gotta take down the greatest villain in <em>Persona </em>history, right?</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/persona-5-phantom-x-subway-slammer-villain-clips-gacha-1851785428]]></content:encoded>

This third-person action title features five classes and multiple chaotic modes, promising plenty of frenetic shootouts within an alternate future. It's fast, fun, and easy to dive into, so it's all but certain to remain a popular multiplayer option for fans of the genre.</p><p>And since Mecha Break is available on both Xbox and PC (with a PS5 version on the way at an unspecified later date), you may find that you want to team up with a friend who uses a different platform than you. That's where cross-platform functionality comes in. We've got some good news and bad news for you below, so let's dive in and take a look at how Mecha Break handles cross-platform play and cross-progression.</p>

free-to-play shooter doesn't have this beloved feature. Luckily, that's not a problem with Mecha Break. If you want to kick giant robot butts with your friends on other platforms, you'll be excited to know that <strong>Mecha Break fully supports cross-play between Xbox and PC</strong>.</p><p>Once the game goes live, we'll update this guide to go over the specifics of how to group of with friends and players on other platforms, as games are known to handle this in one of a variety of ways. Since the PS5 version isn't available until later, we can't confirm that cross-play functionality will be available on Sony's platform, but chances seem high that it will be supported. We'll be sure to revisit this with an update when we have confirmation, though.</p><h2>Does Mecha Break have cross-progression?</h2><p>Cross-progression is another major feature that is becoming more and more normalized in the world of free-to-play games, so it's always nice to see it available in a new title. But in an unfortunate turn of events, <strong>Mecha Break does not support cross-progression</strong>. As a result, you won't be able to carry your progress from Xbox to PC or vice versa. Instead, if you start an account on one, you'll need to create an entirely new account on the other.</p><p>While cross-progression is no doubt a highly desirable feature to have in a free-to-play shooter like Mecha Break, developer Amazing Seasun Games hasn't mentioned any plans to add it in future updates. That doesn't mean it's bound to always be without the feature, of course, but we wouldn't expect it any time soon, if at all. As always, stay tuned here for any news we hear about this feature down the line.</p><p>Mecha Break is available now on Xbox Series X/S and PC, and it is Steam Deck verified. Also, if you have a Game Pass subscription, you can access some unique cosmetics for your pilot and mech, so don't let that pass you by.</p>

<p>Boom, waka-waka!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Bandai Namco has revealed a new pre-order trailer for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/shadow-labyrinth-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Shadow Labyrinth</a> on the Switch 2, confirming that the game will run at 4K/60fps when docked.</p>
<p>Not only that, but if you wish to purchase the game on the Switch 1 for the time being, you can rest easy knowing that a free upgrade to the Switch 2 version will be available when you eventually nab Nintendo's new console. Bosh!</p>
<p>Launching on <strong>18th July 2025</strong>, Shadow Labyrinth represents a radical departure for the Pac-Man franchise, moving the action firmly into the metroidvania genre with dark overtones and spooky creatures. It looks neat! And it'll look even neater at 4K with silky-smooth gameplay.</p>
<p>Let's remind ourselves of the general premise:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"As Swordsman No. 8, awoken by a floating yellow orb, PUCK, on a mysterious planet amidst relics of wars past, you are chosen to become the instrument of its will.</p>
<p>"To survive you will discover many secrets, consume your enemies, and grow from prey to the apex predator as you embrace your true purpose."</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-game-ready-driver-mecha-break/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nvidia-releases-new-geforce-game-ready-driver-for-mecha-break-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-comes-to-nte.1233072/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, NVIDIA has released a new GeForce Game Ready driver (version 576.88) to support the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-officially-unveils-geforce-rtx-5050-desktop-graphics-card/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RTX 5050</a> graphics cards. This driver is also optimized for the launch of Mecha BREAK, the multiplayer mech-themed third-person hero shooter game that's out today on PC and Xbox Series S|X. The game features 3v3, 6v6, and even PvPvE modes like Mashmak, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/mecha-break-open-beta-mashmak-pc-hands-on-preview-extracted-core/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previewed</a> by Kai Tatsumoto at a recent press hands-on event:</p>



<p><em>The real star of the show that Amazing Seasun Games invited us out to play was their new extraction mode, Mashmak. This loot-and-scoot PvPvE mode is all about airdropping onto a massive 16x16 km map, scouting for resources, taking out rival squads and NPC bosses, and making it out alive with whatever you can carry with you. Despite having a large map, the actual gameplay is limited to up to ten squads of three players, with empty spots filled by NPCs. To force players to keep moving and not camp out in one remote corner of the map, extraction points slowly start to appear at the ten-minute mark with more dropping every five minutes; once one has been used, it’s gone for good for the rest of that match. Not only do players have to contend with enemy players potentially camping these extraction points out, but there’s a constantly shrinking field of engagement as Corite Pulse Storms slowly engulf the battlefield. This field can disable weapon lock-ons and also inflict a constant drain on both mech health and fluid armor.</em></p>



<p>Mecha BREAK releases today with built-in support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, DLSS Frame Generation, and DLSS Super Resolution. Using DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation and DLSS Super Resolution set to Performance Mode, GeForce RTX 50 Series players can see their frame rate boosted by an average of 4.6x while running the game at 4K resolution with max settings.</p>



<p>On the flagship GeForce RTX 5090 GPU, Mecha BREAK runs at an average of 456 FPS, and even the much more affordable GeForce RTX 5070 surpasses 200 frames per second.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Today also marks the debut of Diablo IV: Seasons of Horadrim, the ninth season of the game's live service. The update brings many new features and content and also adds NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation to the game's settings, whereas GeForce RTX 50 Series owners previously had to enable that through the NVIDIA app.</p>



<p>Recently, The Chinese Room's first-person horror game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/still-wakes-the-deep/">Still Wakes the Deep</a> received the premium Siren's Rest expansion. The free update that launched last week also added NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, and DLSS Super Resolution can be upgraded to the most recent transformer model with the NVIDIA app override.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Lastly, it was confirmed that NTE (<a href="https://wccftech.com/neverness-to-everness-anime-gta/">Neverness to Everness</a>), the online action RPG in development at Hotta Studio, will support DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation already in the upcoming Closed Beta slated to begin this Thursday and scheduled to end on July 16. When the game was first announced in July 2024, the Unreal Engine 5 powered open world game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/neverness-to-everness-is-a-new-gacha-open-world-rpg-from-tower-of-fantasy-devs-powered-by-ue5-with-nvidia-dlss-rtx/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> to support both NVIDIA DLSS and ray tracing. The latter isn't mentioned in the new brief, but it could still be added at a later time.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>There are times in all of our lives when we not only feel compelled to try something new, but burn with an irrepressible desire to break free from the chains of our mundane misery by experiencing a thing which we've not yet experienced.</p>
<p>For some people, that thing might be skydiving or baking a pistachio layer cake with cream cheese buttercream. For me, at one point last year, it was to watch the 1977 film Smokey and the Bandit. For Hideo Kojima, developer of games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>, it is to go to space, and make a game in space. Please, someone just stick him in a rocket already.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I make this plea following Mr Kojima's recent interview with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/jun/19/were-all-connected-but-its-not-the-connection-i-imagined-hideo-kojima-on-death-stranding-2">The Guardian</a>, in which he once again voiced a desire to go to space and then make a game while in space. He's wanted this, or some variation of it, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hideo-kojima-wants-someone-to-send-him-to-space-so-he-can-make-a-game-to-play-in-space">for</a> <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/hey-jeff-bezos-send-hideo-kojima-to-space-already/">years</a>.</p>
<p>People keep putting microphones and bits of paper in front of him, and he keeps telling them he wants it soooooooooo badly. Then, we all go 'Oh aye Hideo, you're so quirky' and move on.</p>
<p>"I want to train properly, learn how to do the docking, go to the International Space Station and stay there for a few months," the space-starved soul said in this latest instance of cosmic craving, "I’m not a scientist, but I could probably make games in space. I want to be the first. There are a lot of astronauts over 60, so I guess it’s possible."</p>
<p>He also mentioned in this interview that he's suffering from, er, "Tom Cruise disease". Basically, he wants to risk his life in a way that would give him a feeling of really being alive. Sounds very Breaking Bad, and I'll be honest, it's underlined the seriousness of the situation in my eyes.</p>
<p>We need to get this man up there to space. I don't care how it goes, whether it ends well for Kojima or not. We know he's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/heres-a-morbid-one-kojima-has-a-usb-stick-full-of-ideas-for-kojima-productions-to-use-after-he-dies">prepared for the worst</a>. He wants it so badly that we desperately need to let him eff around, so he can finally find out. Maybe it won't be all he's imagined it to be. Maybe he'll come running back to Earth and spend long evenings whispering to Geoff Keighley and several famous acting people about how much of a letdown it was.</p>
<p>The worst part is, given how long Kojima's been saying this stuff, we clearly can't rely on the governments or billionaires who currently have access to spacecraft or the means to send people up there to accomplish it.</p>
<p>There's only one solution I can see. If we all stand on each other's shoulders, and I mean the entire population of the planet here, we can form a huge flesh ladder which can convey Hideo to the heavens.</p>
<p>No, before you ask, I don't volunteer to be the person at the very bottom.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/someone-please-just-send-him-up-there-already]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 | Official Cinematic Teaser Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Black Ops 2 is known for having some of the best competitive maps in Call of Duty history, such as Yemen, Raid, Standoff, and Slums. It's very possible Metten is teasing part of the map pool for Black Ops 7, especially as Treyarch is tasked with developing back-to-back Black Ops titles.</p><p dir="ltr">2023's Modern Warfare 3 was a direct follow-up to Modern Warfare 2, and the game launched with a remastered map pool from the original Modern Warfare 2 game. It's possible Black Ops 7 will follow the same formula with remastered maps at launch, giving more time to develop brand-new multiplayer maps for post-launch content.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, Metten discussed the over-40-year time jump between the Black Ops 6 and Black Ops 7 storylines. "Not being tied to a previous era has really given us a lot of creative freedom that you're going to feel and experience in our maps and our weapons and our gear," the developer said.</p><p>Black Ops 7 launches later this year for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC. Activision hasn't announced a specific release date, but the game's full reveal is coming later this summer.

<p>Launching this October</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you're into games that go hard on frenetic fun and stylish visuals, then you might want to keep an eye on Full Metal Schoolgirl, a new title headed for the Switch 2 from Yuke's, the developers behind <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/earth_defense_force_world_brothers_2">EARTH DEFENSE FORCE: World Brothers 2</a>.</p>
<p>Launching on <strong>23rd October 2025</strong>, Full Metal Schoolgirl takes place within a dystopian Japan, where you must face off against Meternal Jobz, a corrupt corporate superpower. Climbing the heights of an ever-shifting 100-story skyscraper, you'll be mowing down hordes of undead salarymen with massive guns as you work to enact your sweet revenge.</p>
<p>It looks pretty cool; we love the colourful visuals, the awesome enemy designs, and of course, the gigantic weapons. We only hope the gameplay brings enough variety to keep us occupied for the entire runtime, but so far, early impressions are pretty positive.</p>
<p>Let's check out the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- Take Revenge as a Fully-Mechanized Schoolgirl:</strong> Step into the role of a cyborg heroine armed with an arsenal of high-powered weaponry and cutting-edge mechanical upgrades in this exhilarating action shooter. Infiltrate Meternal Jobz, the world’s most ruthless mega-corporation, and fight back against undead “Working Dead”, the relentless corporate grunts that will stop at nothing to protect their employer. Show no mercy – scrap them all!</p>
<p><strong>- Engage in Close-Quarters Combat in an Ever-Changing Skyscraper:</strong> Enter a towering 100-story skyscraper where the evil CEO awaits on the top floor. Climb higher while navigating an evolving structure as each new run introduces changing layouts and obstacles from its trap-like security system. Own the battlefield to reach the top!</p>
<p><strong>- Fund Upgrades with Live-Streamed Battles:</strong> Use the power of content creation to win the favor of viewers! Obtain materials and rewards by defeating enemies to improve your character and earn donations for upgrades by live-streaming to a captivated audience. As the number of viewers increases, so does the support. Even in the face of defeat, remember you are not alone… the viewers of your livestream are cheering you on!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We'll have more information on Full Metal Schoolgirl as we get closer to its October release date.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>NetEase has released the first trailer for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>Season 3, and while it's just an animated teaser, it does reveal who the next two playable characters to join the roster will be.</p>

<p>The trailer sees none other than Phoenix, also known as Jean Grey, battling a "new queen" awakened by the symbiotic supervillain Knull. The story for the season will see Grey and the Phoenix Force battling "the god of the symbiotes".</p>

<p>However, she won't be able to do battle with Knull alone, according to NetEase. She's going to need the help of "a warrior of two worlds who lives to fight against the tide of night", which, if you haven't guessed yet, refers to the vampire hunter Blade.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-season-3-blade.jpg?itok=xSRu1x6j 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-season-3-blade.jpg?itok=9Av-xEIg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>Season 3 will bring Blade and Phoenix with it.</figcaption></figure><p>There's been talk about whether Blade would make his debut as a playable character in&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>ever since the vampire hunter was featured in one of the game's earlier seasons, but this will be his first time joining other playable heroes like Iron Man, Captain America, and Black Widow.</p>

<p>Phoenix and Blade's presence won't come as a surprise to anyone who's been paying attention to the discourse; both characters were <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/1lml6bd/twitch_leaked_the_next_two_marvel_rivals/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">leaked</a>, along with their full movesets, a few days ago.</p>

<p><em>Marvel Rivals</em>' third season, also called The Abyss Awakens, is set to arrive on July 11th, bringing the aforementioned two playable characters with it. If <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-season-2-emma-frost-ultron" rel="nofollow">previous</a>&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-modding-clampdown" rel="nofollow">seasons</a> are anything to go by, there will probably be a host of balance changes too.</p>




<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>itself, it's an<i>&nbsp;Overwatch</i>-style hero shooter that features a roster full of Marvel characters, some of whom are more obscure than others.</p>

<p>On the one hand, favorites like the aforementioned Iron Man and Black Widow, as well as others like Spider-Man and Thor, are present, but you'll also find more off-the-beaten-path characters like Magik and Jeff the Land Shark here.</p>

<p><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>is available to play for free right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2767030/Marvel_Rivals/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/marvel-rivals/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/marvel-rivals/9n8pmw7qmd3d" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <p>A few days ago, while walking in the woods, I allowed a mosquito to suck blood from my hand for about 20 seconds. Holding my arm extended like a sweaty middle-aged messiah, I watched as the insect tapped methodically at my skin, watched as it pushed its needle nose into the flesh between my smallest knuckles, watched as its hitherto-imperceptible belly bulged and turned a shiny, jubilant red.</p> <!--more-->
<p>Later, I googled West Nile disease and felt like a fool. I'll not be making a habit of this. Still, it was fascinating to see another creature treat my blood like a resource, to see my vital fluids coalesce into a tiny crystal outside my body and fly off to (eventually) form part of some waterborne larvae, deep in the forest. If you get bitten by a mosquito near Watford in the next few days, apologies - there's a non-zero chance that was "one of mine".</p>

<p>This is my overlong, wince-worthy introduction to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/worship">Worship</a>, a mix of Pikmin and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cult-of-the-lamb">Cult Of The Lamb</a> in which you can wreak all <em>kinds</em> of havoc with your casually dispensed body fluids. Devised by Chasing Rats Games, the game casts you as a hooded zealot roaming a usefully colourless realm of warring eldritch gods. The core mechanic is slicing your hand so that you can paint the ground with your blood trail. The shapes you draw with your gore have supernatural properties.</p>
<p>Scrawl a circle around a clump of villagers and they'll be converted to your cause, their pale, unbelieving bodies turning a bold, occult black. Other shapes let you prep and fire off spells to smoosh enemy cultists and shatter obstacles. The catch, of course, is that your character will eventually run out of blood, aka life, but don't worry, you can hold a button to hoover up all of your claret doodles without, it seems, exposing yourself to a cocktail of bacterial infections. Say what you like about occultists, but they're both surprisingly hygienic and thrifty.</p>
<p>Once converted, villagers serve much the same purpose as Pikmin. You can lob them at things you want beaten up, and have them carry things such as the sinister gemstones you need to sow the land with your cursed altars. You can also slash them open and use their <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Dril">victory wine</a> for sorcery, if you're feeling a touch anaemic.</p>
<p>Find <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1548180/Worship/">a demo for Worship</a> on Steam. The full game - out 16th July 2025 - includes four-player support, and I will absolutely give a prize to whichever co-op team can write out the URL for the UK government advice on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mosquito-bite-avoidance-for-travellers">mosquito bite avoidance</a> in their own gore.

It’s also one that has had a mixed reputation over multiple entries. I groan and grumble every time I unintentionally activate it; but using it correctly with the right weapons and skills feels amazing.</p><h2 id="h193731"><a id=""></a>How does Sliding work?</h2><p>There are quite a few ways to activate this maneuver. <strong>The most common way to make your hunter slide is by running or rolling down a steep slope.</strong> While running downhill, <strong>take notice when the hunter’s animation changes to them trying to straighten their body out.</strong> This lasts for just a second before they begin sliding. If you want to trigger it even faster, rolling during a run will immediately transition to the slide animation.</p><p><strong>Certain weapon attacks can also combine with the sliding state, as long as they’re performed on a sloped surface.</strong> Ironically enough, no attacks that feature your hunter sliding on the ground during the animation will work. The following weapons can trigger a slide in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-best-weapon-the-charge-blade-guide-1851769340&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-best-weapon-the-charge-blade-guide-1851769340">Charge Blade’s</a></span> Forward Slash</li><li>Dual Blades’ Demon Flurry Rush</li><li>Gunlance’s Lunging Upthrust</li><li>Hammer’s Charge</li><li>Lance’s Dash Attack</li><li>Sword &amp; Shield’s Advancing Slash</li></ul><p>If any of the above has sent you zooming down a hill, it might help to know that this maneuver does have a purpose. Every weapon has unique actions that can be performed while sliding. Some are simple aerial attacks that are best used for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-how-to-mount-master-mounter-1851775446&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-how-to-mount-master-mounter-1851775446">mounting</a></span>, while others, like the Sword &amp; Shield, have multiple options and follow-ups. My personal favorite is getting crazy air with the Dual Blades and then spinning down a monster’s back to inflict some major damage. These are all pretty fun once you get the hang of them.</p><h2 id="h193732"><a id=""></a>How to master Sliding</h2><figure id="" data-id="5e9ff074ead72fab2610db85900f82a7" data-recommend-id="image://5e9ff074ead72fab2610db85900f82a7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Change Equipment screen, highlighting the Buttery Leathercraft Group Skill, Affinity Sliding." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Change Equipment screen, highlighting the Buttery Leathercraft Group Skill, Affinity Sliding." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5e9ff074ead72fab2610db85900f82a7" data-recommend-id="image://5e9ff074ead72fab2610db85900f82a7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Change Equipment screen, highlighting the Buttery Leathercraft Group Skill, Affinity Sliding." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The most important tip I can give here is to be aware of what slopes might trigger a slide. The incline in the back of the Training Area is an excellent example. When you’re out gathering or hunting a monster, go ahead and experiment by rolling down some hills. This will be handy knowledge for future hunts so that you don’t slide when you don’t mean to. I know I wasn’t the only person to accidentally rush down the Windward Plains’ desert dunes while hunting <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-mon-hun-arch-tempered-rey-dau-1851782762&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-mon-hun-arch-tempered-rey-dau-1851782762">Arch-Tempered Rey Dau</a></span>.</p><p>Once you feel confident about using this technique when you intend to, it’s time to consider increasing its offensive power. Affinity Sliding is a skill that provides a boost to your <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-affinity-meaning-negative-upgrade-1851775744&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-affinity-meaning-negative-upgrade-1851775744">Affinity</a></span> when sliding on terrain. This is another case where the skill’s description fails to convey just how amazing a buff you receive. I’ve confirmed through testing that it provides a massive 30 percent Affinity boost that lasts for 30 seconds. No matter if your build is low on Affinity or already boasts a high percentage, this is an impressive upgrade.</p><p>The main drawback is that this is tied to the Buttery Leathercraft Group Skill, which is unfortunately attached to some weaker armors. If you’re going to hunt a monster in a hilly area and want high Affinity, including it in a build might be a good strategy. Just try not to activate this buff when you’re too close to a monster, since the skill won’t kick in until you’ve been sliding for about a second.</p><p>I can’t blame anyone who gets annoyed by this mechanic. Sliding past an enemy is a huge inconvenience, especially if you have to run back up a big hill to continue the fight. Understanding how to trigger it and the benefits of doing so will be a big help going forward.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mhw-slide-hill-how-to-attack-1851785365]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Gaming industry veteran Hideo Kojima has commented on the semi-recent trend of remote working in the video game business, saying it might not be the ideal way to work but forcing people back to the office isn't a good option either.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/jun/19/were-all-connected-but-its-not-the-connection-i-imagined-hideo-kojima-on-death-stranding-2" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Guardian</a>, Kojima said remote work is "almost like a fast food chain" in that people are "just concentrating on one thing instead of the whole project." The publication further reported that Kojima said working remotely as opposed to being in an office together with colleagues can be inefficient for a variety of reasons, including the lack of back-and-forth with people working at a desk next to each other.</p><p>"Only 1% of yourself is on show during [online] meetings," he said. "This is not like building a team. Think about football. You hire someone, he comes to your squad--but you can't play together remotely. So that person doesn't change the way they played before; they won't fit in."</p><p>However, Kojima said he acknowledges that "you can't force people back to the office, you can only persuade them."</p><p>For Kojima Productions specifically, Kojima said "not everyone came back" to the office to work on Death Stranding 2: On the Beach but the "main members" did.</p><p>Beyond the people working on the game, Kojima said he encountered some challenges with the cast for Death Stranding 2: On the Beach. He said it was "quite difficult" to communicate to the actors how they should perform in a particular scene, adding that this was "almost impossible" to do over Zoom.</p><p>Kojima previously said the original Death Stranding, which was released in 2019, was made based on the theme of, "We're in danger of being divided and isolated, so let's connect."</p><p>Then the COVID pandemic began in 2020. Having lived through the pandemic, Kojima said he's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-how-kojimas-experience-with-covid-impacted-the-game/1100-6531399/" data-ref-id="1100-6531399">changed his way of thinking when it comes to connection.</a></p><p>"After actually experiencing that, I felt that maybe it's not such a good thing to connect so much. That feeling is foreshadowed in lots of different scenes and settings [in Death Stranding 2]. I think there are portions that players will only understand once they reach the end of the game. What I felt during the pandemic is quite strongly reflected within this title," he said of Death Stranding 2.</p><p>Many video game development studios embraced remote working during the pandemic, and some companies even used it as a selling point to hire new staff. Now, however, some companies are pulling back and asking people to return to the office--if not for a full week, at least partially. Mega-publisher EA, for example, has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-announces-full-return-to-office-effectively-ending-remote-work/1100-6531579/" data-ref-id="1100-6531579">effectively ended remote working, which has upset some staffers.</a> Rockstar Games, meanwhile, has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-reportedly-now-in-final-stages-of-development-as-workers-speak-out-against-return-to-office-plans/1100-6521477/" data-ref-id="1100-6521477">required people to return to the office to finish GTA 6, which also prompted a backlash.</a></p><p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is out now on PS5. If you're just getting started with the game, be sure to read GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/death-stranding-2-review-tied-up/1900-6418377/" data-ref-id="1900-6418377">Death Stranding 2 review</a> and consult our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-guides-hub/1100-6532611/" data-ref-id="1100-6532611">Death Stranding 2 guides hub</a> to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/death-stranding-2-tips-beginners-guide/2900-6684/" data-ref-id="2900-6684">help yourself get off to a good start.</a></p><p>In addition to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kojima-wants-to-be-the-first-person-to-make-a-game-in-space/1100-6532868/" data-ref-id="1100-6532868">Kojima's plans to make a game in space</a>, he and his team are working on multiple upcoming new games, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/od/">OD</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/physint/">Physint.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/ash-parrish">Ash Parrish</a> <span>is a reporter who covers the business, culture, and communities of video games, with a focus on marginalized gamers and the quirky, horny culture of video game communities.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/694183/donkey-kong-bananza-preview-switch-2">previews for <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a> come in ahead of the game’s July 17th release date, one tidbit has stood out on the development of this game. It’s been nearly eight years since <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, and now we know what that team has been up to, as Nintendo has officially revealed that the developers of <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/642699/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-preview-switch-2">Donkey Kong Bananza</a></em> are the same team that made<em> Odyssey</em>.</p><p>Nintendo has a good track record of retaining and training up talent. Developers that worked on early entries in the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/31/23663707/kirby-interview-gdc-2023-kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo"><em>Kirby</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24112724/super-mario-bros-wonder-interview-nintendo-switch"><em>Mario</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24115898/tears-of-the-kingdom-physics-gameplay-design-gdc-2024"><em>Zelda</em></a> franchises have stuck around to work on or lead the development of subsequent titles. The result has been relative consistency across Nintendo first-party titles, which has allowed the company to weather the last two years a bit better than its competitors. <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> was one of the top five bestselling games for the original Switch, so <em>Bananza</em> is in more than capable hands.</p><p>According to <em>The Verge</em>’s Cameron Faulkner, <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is its own game with a unique identity. But <em>Odyssey</em>’s development team has added a bit of Mario’s 3D platforming DNA to Donkey Kong’s first 3D platformer since <em>Donkey Kong 64</em>. And while the mystery of <em>Bananza</em>’s developer has been solved, a new one has taken its place: will there also be a 3D <em>Mario </em>game coming soon to the Switch 2, or is it just <em>Bananza</em> for now?</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/695726/donkey-kong-bananza-developers-super-mario-odyssey]]></content:encoded>
