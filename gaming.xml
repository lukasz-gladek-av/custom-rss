			<p>It's been announced today by <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/04/helldivers-2-servants-of-freedom-warbond-launches-february-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Katherine Baskin</a>, Social Media and Community Manager of Arrowhead Game Studios, that the next Warbond to be added to <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-wins-goty-at-tiga-awards-2024/">award-winning</a> Helldivers 2 will be released on February 6. Its full title is Warbond: Servants of Freedom. Helldivers 2 is already an incredibly chaotic game, but now even more chaos will be unleashed with the addition of Portable Hellbombs, which you can carry around as a backpack before dropping it off and setting it to blow. You only have ten seconds to clear out, so make it quick.</p>
<p>If you want to see what you can expect from this update, make sure to check out the trailer below, which is just under a minute long.</p>
<p><iframe title="Helldivers 2 - Servants of Freedom Warbond | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7s2Es5g7fwA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Sickle can now do even more, as the LAS-17 Double-Edge Sickle burns both the wielder and the ones on the receiving end of the weapon. It's a bit of a niche choice when it comes to weaponry, but it may just be something that you find plenty of enjoyment in. Alongside the Portable Hellbombs and the Sickle, you can now equip a grenade pistol. Known simply as the Ultimatum, you can launch grenades like never before. Instead of shooting them further away, the Ultimatum is designed for close-range use. However, it still packs an almighty punch, so be careful where you aim it.</p>
<p>A new throwable has been added in this Helldivers 2 Warbond. Named the G-50 Seeker, it's a small drone that follows after you and then explodes near enemies when detected. It can also be used to target pinged enemies and hunt them down to then detonate when found.</p>
<p>Weapons aren't the only thing being added in the Helldivers 2: Servants of Freedom Warbond, as there is new armor for you to try out. The IE-3 Martyr and the IE-12 Righteous medium armors come equipped with the Integrated Explosives passive.</p>
<p>To be able to access this Servants of Freedom Warbond when it releases, you will, of course, need to own Helldivers 2. It also requires a paid purchase of Super Credits and game progression to unlock.</p>
<p>Will you be purchasing this Warbond when it releases on February 6? Let us know in the comments what you're excited for with this new update.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-profits-plummet-switch-150m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-profits-plummet-as-switch-crosses-150m-sales.1099692/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-profits-plummet-switch-150m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has released its financial statement for the nine-month period between April and December 2024, and although the Switch has hit a new sales milestone, profits and sales are down overall.</p>

<p>In its financial <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250204_3e.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">presentation</a>, Nintendo acknowledges that sales are down by 31.4% and net profit has fallen by 41.9% when compared to the same nine-month period last year, with sales of both hardware and software plummeting.</p>

<p>Despite this, the company also reveals that the Switch has reached 150 million lifetime sales, putting it within throwing distance of the Nintendo DS family (around 154 million) and perhaps even the all-time title holder, Sony's PS2 (160 million).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-financials.jpg?itok=Lp-eUizf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-financials.jpg?itok=Qhm9YWCG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Super Mario Party Jamboree&nbsp;</em>was one of Nintendo's best-selling games over the nine months between April and December.</figcaption></figure><p>In terms of software sales, while overall figures fell,&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Party Jamboree&nbsp;</em>emerged as a big seller for Nintendo, reaching 6.17 million units sold in the nine-month time period.</p>

<p>Newcomer&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>sold almost 4 million copies, while&nbsp;<em>Nintendo Switch Sports&nbsp;</em>picked up another 2.63 million sales for itself. Incredibly,&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&nbsp;</em>sold 5.38 million units during this time period. Could there still be Switch owners out there who don't own this game?</p>

<p>Of course, there's one big, massive exclamation point hanging over these figures, and that's the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">recent announcement</a> of the Nintendo Switch 2, which will be unveiled in full during a Nintendo Direct showcase in April.</p>

<p>While the console itself wasn't revealed until January, Nintendo did reveal in May that a Switch 2 announcement <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation" rel="nofollow">would come before April 2025</a>, suggesting that many consumers may have been holding off on buying a Switch in order to wait for the new machine to appear.</p>




<p>&nbsp;With regards to its future, Nintendo points to a number of games it's releasing in the coming months, including the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-announced" rel="nofollow">remastered version of&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em></a>, which is due to land in March.</p>

<p>The publisher also recommits to 2025 releases for&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-a-announced" rel="nofollow">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metroid-prime-4-beyond-2025" rel="nofollow"><em>Metroid Prime 4</em></a>, both of which are apparently still slated to come to the original Switch (although I wouldn't be surprised to see Switch 2 ports for both).</p>

<p>You can check out Nintendo's full <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250204e.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">financial results document right here</a> if you want to get super-nerdy with stats and figures.</p>

<p>Support for the original Nintendo Switch isn’t going to end just because its successor, Nintendo Switch 2, is heading to market. During its Q3 FY2025 earnings call on Tuesday, Nintendo said that they will continue to support the console if demand requires.</p>



<p>As part of their latest earnings call on Tuesday, Nintendo gave an update on the Switch business as a whole. The company announced that the console had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-has-now-sold-over-150-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surpassed 150 million units sold</a>, creeping closer to the 160M of the PlayStation 2. It was also revealed, however, that sales have slowed quicker than the company expected. That required Nintendo to lower its operating profit by 22% due to Switch sales falling by 30% for the quarter.</p>



<p>As far as why the drop, Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa doesn’t believe the announcement of the Switch 2 has led to a slower sales rate of the original console.</p>



<p>“We don’t think the impact of the reluctance to buy is that great, and we think that it is solid for the eighth year, but we have not been able to reach the plan,” he said according to <a href="https://www.sankei.com/article/20250204-KB2S2JK245IALH4D6JO4NVHOZU/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sankei</a>.</p>



<p>Going back to support for the original Switch, it’s not out of the norm for Nintendo to support a console for at least a few years after its predecessor made it to market. The Nintendo Wii was released in 2006, but Nintendo kept services online until May 2014. For the Wii U and Nintendo 3DS, online services lasted until April 2024. Whether continued online services means games will still be releasing for the original Switch two, three, or more years after Switch 2’s launch remains to be seen.</p>



<p>How long do you think Nintendo will continue to support the original Nintendo Switch? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

                <p>Metroid Prime fans are a patient lot, and after almost a decade of waiting, 2025 looks like it'll be their year.

There's still a lot that we don't know about Metroid Prime 4, but as we get closer to its eventual release, it's highly likely that Nintendo will start to drop a few trailers detailing what fans can expect when they step back into Samus Aran's power-armor.</p><p>In related news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-breaks-13-year-sales-record/1100-6529214/">Nintendo just broke a 13-year record</a> with its Switch console sales figures and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-selling-nintendo-switch-games-of-all-time/2900-5070/">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe continues to be a major commercial hit</a> for the company.

            <p>
Microsoft has announced its line-up of Xbox Game Pass titles for the beginning of February. 
</p>
<p>
The selection is, as you'd expect, headlined by this month's big <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/xbox-game-studios">Xbox Game Studios</a> arrival Avowed, the fresh role-playing game from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a> developer Obsidian.
</p>
<p>
But, of course, you'll only get the game on 18th February - its launch date - if you have either PC Game Pass or Game Pass Ultimate.
</p>
<p>
Here's the full line-up of Xbox Game Pass titles for February:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Far Cry: New Dawn - 4th February (Standard, Ultimate, PC)</li>
<li>Another Crab's Treasure - 5th February (Now with Standard)</li>
<li>Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes - 5th February (Now with Standard)</li>
<li>Starfield - 5th February (Now with Standard)</li>
<li>Madden NFL 25 - 6th February (Ultimate, PC)</li>
<li>Kingdom Two Crowns - 13th February (Now with Standard)</li>
<li>Avowed - 18th February (Ultimate, PC)</li>
</ul>

</figure>
<p>
If you're already on Ultimate or PC Game Pass, your other new additions this month include Far Cry spin-off New Dawn, a follow-up to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/far-cry-5">Far Cry 5</a>, and the arrival of this year's Madden NFL installment from EA Sports.
</p>
<p>
Subscribers to the newer Standard tier now join Ultimate and PC subscribers in gaining access to Bethesda's space RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a>, plus Another Crab's Treasure,  <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eiyuden-chronicle-hundred-heroes-review">Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes</a> and Kingdom: Two Crowns.
</p>
<p>
As ever, whenever Microsoft giveth, it also taketh away. Seven games are set to leave Xbox Game Pass on 15th February, in case you want to give them a quick bash before they go:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A Little to the Left (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Bloodstained Ritual of the Night (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>EA Sports UFC 3 (Console via EA Play)</li>
<li>Indivisible (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Merge and Blade (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Return to Grace (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Tales of Arise (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you want to keep playing these games after they leave Game Pass, you'll need to purchase them. On the plus side, Game Pass subscribers get a 20 percent discount.
</p>

</p>
<p>
Last week, Microsoft gave us a glimpse at Doom: The Dark Ages, Ninja Gaiden 4 and South of Midnight as part of its Xbox Developer Direct. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-is-positioned-to-save-the-xbox-console-business">It's taken eight years, but could  Game Pass finally be positioned to save the Xbox console business and give Xbox a point?</a>

<p>As part of an NVIDIA DLSS news round-up, NVIDIA said that the Unreal Engine 5 powered <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-2-black-the-edge-of-the-dragon-sword/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a> remaster supports DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation, though the DLSS Override functionality isn't enabled for either the new transformer AI model or Multi Frame Generation. The same goes for Level Zero: Extraction, the multiplayer extraction horror shooter developed by Doghowl Games and published by tinyBuild, which has recently launched out of early access with standard DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation integration.&nbsp;In two days, developer Aesir Interactive and publisher NACON will release Ambulance Life: A Paramedic Simulator, which is described as the first paramedic simulation game. This title also supports standard DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation.</p>
<p>Square Enix's Final Fantasy VII Rebirth supports standard DLSS Super Resolution (you can turn it into DLAA by simply setting both maximum and minimum Dynamic Resolution Scaling values to 100%).

<p>Lastly, Warhorse's excellent (as evidenced by <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our perfect score review</a>) Kingdom Come: Deliverance II launches today with built-in support for NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and DLAA. Through the NVIDIA app, users can activate the DLSS Override to force the transformer AI model to take over for improved image quality.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/relic-knights-is-getting-relaunch-courtesy-of-ignition-core-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Relic Knights</em> is coming back under new management. The license for the anime-inspired miniatures skirmish game series, which went dormant after a controversial crowdfunding campaign, has been picked up by Ignition Core Games. Better still, it will be on sale at this year's Adepticon.</p>



<p>According to a press release, Ignition Core Games, Relic Knights will relaunch on the 27th of March at Adepticon at the Ignition Core Games/ Scale 75 USA booth.&nbsp; They will offer a 2-Player Starter Set and three additional miniatures to expand the units in the starter set. Those miniatures are Combat Armor Cordelia, Alabaster Automata, and Infiltrator Candy.</p>

If you want to know how it plays before you buy, you'll have plenty of opportunities.</p>

<p>The releases will not end there. Throughout 2025, Relic Knights will have faction releases for Shattered Sword, Black Diamond, and Cerci Speed Circuit.&nbsp; Everything offered will be available via direct sale, at conventions, or on Ignition Core Games' website from a stock of on-hand inventory.</p>

<p>A discount is possible if you were a backer of the <em>Relic Knights Second Edition</em> Kickstarter campaign. If you directly email Ignition Core Games, you can get a "steep discount" on anything in the product line you pledged for during the campaign.</p>

<p>To quote the press release directly, "It's not a perfect solution but we will provide you with your pledged items at the lowest prices possible."</p>

<p>This is important since the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sodapopminiatures/relic-knights-2nd-edition/description" rel="nofollow"><em>Relic Knights Second Edition</em> Kickstarter</a> campaign ended in disaster. It was originally developed by Soda Pop Miniatures and published by Ninja Division, the same studio behind <em>Super Dungeon Explore</em>.</p>

<p>Despite the campaign raising an impressive $386,826, production was stalled and stopped for several years. Ultimately, all Kickstarter Backers were left with nothing as <a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2024/03/11/thousands-of-kickstarter-backers-left-out-of-pocket-as-super-dungeon-explore-publisher-ninja-division-files-for-bankruptcy/" rel="nofollow">Ninja Division filed for bankruptcy</a>.</p>

<p>For those still interested in enjoying the anime-inspired action of <em>Relic Knights,</em> Adepticon is a few months away.</p>

<p>According to the latest announcement, Dragon Ball Sparking Zero has sold more than 5 million units globally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bandai Namco’s 2024 3D arena fighter, the latest instalment in a decade-old game series, has hit a major sales milestone. Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, the successor to the iconic Budokai Tenkaichi series, has sold over 5 million units across PlayStation, Xbox Series X/S, and PC since October 8, 2024 (less than 4 months since release). The developers have <a href="https://x.com/dragonballgames/status/1886686193535848650" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">thanked</a> the fans for their passion and support in helping them achieve this milestone. </p>



<p>Moreover, Dragon Ball Sparking Zero has shown no signs of slowing down. The developers have already released the first DLC, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zeros-hero-of-justice-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hero of Justice</a>. The latest expansion introduces 11 new playable characters, with the likes of Beast Gohan, Orange Piccolo, Cell Max and more from Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero movie joining the roster. The developers have also released a new game mode and fresh cosmetics with the new DLC. 2 more DLCs are planned, introducing more than 20 characters to the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are several reasons why Dragon Ball Sparking Zero has sold 5 million units. Most importantly, fans appreciate that the developers stayed faithful to the source material. They built upon the already perfected gameplay from the Budokai Tenkaichi series by enhancing it with stunning visuals, destructible arenas, and a roster of nearly 200 characters. Additionally, the game’s multiplayer aspect is easy to access, and the story mode offers a refreshing experience with new Episode Battles and Custom Battles.</p>



<p>In other news, Dragon Ball Sparking Zero is one of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sparking-zero-is-one-of-the-best-selling-bandai-namco-games-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bandai Namco’s best-selling games</a>.

<p>VALORANT is one of the most popular online multiplayer titles in gaming, attracting thousands of players a day to the tactical shooter genre. With so many agents and abilities, the game consistently receives fixes when these abilities aren’t working properly, like the one in today’s 10.02 patch.</p>



<p>Here’s the full breakdown of bug fixes coming to <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VALORANT</a> in Patch 10.02.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-valorant-10-02-patch-notes">VALORANT 10.02 Patch Notes</h2>



<p>VALORANT Patch 10.02 doesn’t feature any significant gameplay changes or improvements, save for one to Killjoy’s Alarmbot. It features a number of bug fixes, primarily targeting agent abilities that were bugged. Here are those changes:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Vyse</strong>: Fixed an issue where Arc Rose and Razorvine were visible when placedon specific water surfaces.</li>



<li><strong>Tejo</strong>: Fixed an issue where players could rarely survive running straight through the full duration of Armageddon.</li>



<li><strong>Killjoy: </strong>Fixed an issue where Killjoy’s recall minimap indicator could get stuck in a state where it was invisible.</li>



<li><strong>Killjoy: </strong>Alarmbot logic has been updated to be more intelligent.
<ul>
<li>In niche circumstances, <strong>the Alarmbot will now path towards players if they are on ledges and explode on them</strong> if they would be hit by the size of the explosion rather than trying to run extremely long paths around the map.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where certain types of damage could leave players with Regen Shields at 1 HP when the damage should have been lethal.
<ul>
<li>This also fixed issues where <strong>Clove</strong> could tank lethal damage specifically when Regen Shield and Pick Me Up were active at the same time.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Fixed a bug where Observers were seeing inconsistent player team outline colors.</li>
</ul>



<p>The following fixes to Premier, VALORANT’s seasonal competitive mode, apply only to PC players: </p>



<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where long team names could overlap each other on the playoff bracket screen.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where dropdowns on the standings sometimes cut off text.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where the division name text was not always correctly aligned on the match history screen</li>
</ul>



<p>Since his arrival at the start of the season, Tejo has become a popular fixture amongst competitive and pro players. However, his destructive ultimate Armageddon was sometimes not killing players caught in it’s full blast. Now, thanks to patch 10.02, players caught in the full duration will die.</p>



<p>Arguably the biggest change in VALORANT Patch 10.02 is the improved intelligence of Killjoy’s Alarmbot. Players are no longer safe from the Alarmbot if it they’re up on a ledge above it.</p>



<p>What changes do you want to see added to VALORANT in a future patch? Let us know down below and on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

It will launch in 2025. <span id="more-941729"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Atari:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>Breakout Beyond</em> is a vibrant new reimagining of the <em>Breakout</em> series that invites players to break on through to the other side. This new entry into <em>Breakout</em> lore will challenge players not just to break every brick, but to creatively breach the wall with score-building combos. <em>Breakout Beyond</em> features a whole new sideways perspective, 72 levels for players to blast through, and two-player <a title="Genres > Co-Op [229 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a> play, designed to share the high-octane brick-breaking with a friend.</p><p>In this neon-infused twist on the classic 1976 <a title="Genres > Arcade [68 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/arcade">arcade game</a>, players smash through each puzzle by clearing bricks to reach the final goal. However, the script has been flipped—literally! Players now progress sideways, breaking through barriers and building up combos that ramp up the intensity of the effects, rewarding the most skilled players with a dazzling light show. Breaking special blocks offers powerful advantages, like massive brick-clearing blasts, a protective barrier to shield the ball, and a laser cannon to carve a path forward. Each one unleashes stunning dynamic effects, delivering dazzling visuals never seen before in <em>Breakout</em>.</p><p>Featuring 72 challenging levels, players’ brick-blasting skills will be pushed to the brink—but they won’t need to face the challenge alone. Block-breakers can forgo going solo and team up with a friend for local two-player cooperative play and tackle the mayhem together. Alternatively, a new focus mode slows down time, sacrificing a higher score for greater control.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li>Unlockable endless mode with an online global leaderboard.</li><li>72 challenging levels that will put players’ brick-breaking skills to the test.</li><li>Two-player cooperative play to manage (or ramp up) the chaos with a friend.</li><li>Procedural audio and visual effects that increase in intensity with each combo.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

                <p>Elgato has announced a brand-new version of its free digital audio mixer took, dubbed Wave Link 2.0. Like the original software, the 2.0 version is designed to give content creators a flexible suite of options for managing their audio feeds while also adding in several quality-of-life upgrades designed to address the challenges that streamers and podcasters regularly run into.</p><p>One of the big new features is Voice Focus, which Elgato says was developed in collaboration with audio company AI-Coustics and can be used to remove unwanted noise, room reverb, and echo. At the same time, Elgato claims that a user's voice can be isolated and elevated to "professional" quality standards and this toolset is designed to deliver high-quality results in seconds. Essentially, if you're in a rush to get started on on your project and you don't want to tweak audio settings, this can potentially make you sound like a pro with minimal input needed from you.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4438403-wave_link_software_shadow.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4438403" data-ratio="0.60703125" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4438403-wave_link_software_shadow.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4438403"></a><figcaption>Wave Link 2.0</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4438403-wave_link_software_shadow.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4438405-wave_link_software_hero_macos.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4438407-wave_link_software_hero_windows.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4438408-wave_link_software_vst_open.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4438405,1300-4438407,1300-4438408" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4438405-wave_link_software_hero_macos.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4438407-wave_link_software_hero_windows.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4438408-wave_link_software_vst_open.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4438405-wave_link_software_hero_macos.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4438407-wave_link_software_hero_windows.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4438408-wave_link_software_vst_open.jpg"></figure><p>Managing multiple audio channels should also be easier with the new simplified layout in Wave Link 2.0. The overhaul includes one-click audio-routing allows users to instantly assign apps to channels, app-grouping for better organization, and input channel-renaming to streamline your layout. Additionally, digital tools like a compressor, de-esser, equalizer, and reverb adjuster have been retained and you'll still be able to use third-party audio plug-ins.</p><p>Naturally, Wave Link 2.0 is designed to work best with Elgato hardware--the current version can be used with other microphones if you prefer--and the company says it is aiming to introduce meaningful user experience improvements with the new software. If you're looking to get into livestreaming or podcasting, Elgato's gear is recommended as it has a very user-friendly design and offers high-quality results at a reasonable price.</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-Wave-Microphone-Podcasting-Capacitive/dp/B088HHWC47?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Elgato Wave 3 condenser microphone</a> is a favorite amongst streamers for its plug-and-play design, while the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09RMXK59C?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Stream Deck</a> is pretty great for livestreams as this is a 15-button customizable panel that you can assign specific functions to.

But it wasn’t made for the PlayStation console you might have played in the ‘90s. Instead, it was developed for the failed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-play-station-prototype-will-be-auctioned-off-i-1840485537&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-play-station-prototype-will-be-auctioned-off-i-1840485537">Nintendo PlayStation</a></span>—a proposed device that would let the SNES play CD games. </p><p>“The first thing they showed us was that  Nintendo Sony PlayStation, like a [working] prototype,” said Yoshida. “And also they had almost finished a game on it and I got to play the game on the system  the day I joined.”</p><p>According to Yoshida, the game was a 2.5D or 3D space-shooter-like thing and used the power of the CD to stream in assets to create something similar to the Sega CD title <em>Silpheed</em>. Sadly, Yoshida doesn’t remember who developed it, suggesting it might have been a team in the U.S. or Japan. When asked if it’s possible that this never-before-seen Nintendo PlayStation space shooter game still existed somewhere within Sony’s archives, Yoshida seemed to think it was. </p><p>“I wouldn’t be surprised if [the game was saved]. You know it was like [on a] CD so yeah,” explained the former PlayStation Studios president. </p><p>Now someone within Sony just needs to find that game and dump the rom online. Or maybe that will be one of the secrets buried in the next <em>Astro Bot</em> game. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Nintendo has revealed new Switch sales figures from the first nine months of the current financial year--ending on March 31, 2025--and while sales of the console and its games have been below expectations, there is a silver lining here. The Switch has sold over 150 million units since launch, making it the first console to do so in 13 years.</p><p>The last video game console to reach these numbers was also a Nintendo device (<a href="https://x.com/stealth40k/status/1886674034206593488" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as spotted by Stealth on X</a>), specifically the Nintendo DS. The dual-screen handheld had numerous hardware revisions over its lifespan, ranging from the original futuristic clamshell model to a streamlined design before the Nintendo 3DS eventually succeeded it, and it was quite popular with Nintendo fans thanks to its strong library of games and affordable pricing.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="433242744" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

Nintendo DS. The top spot still belongs to Sony's PlayStation 2, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-many-ps2s-sony-made-in-its-lifetime/1100-6528175/" data-ref-id="1100-6528175">as after its lifetime sales were updated</a>, it was revealed that over 160 million of these consoles were sold in total.</p><p>In other Nintendo news, <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/index.html" rel="nofollow ">the company has now sold over 1.3 billion units of software</a>, with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe continuing to be a hit with 5.38 million sales in the latest period and 67.35 million overall. Overall sales on Switch hardware were down by 30.6% year-on-year, while game sales declined by 24.4% year-on-year.

            <p>
Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa has said that fan expectation around <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> isn't the primary cause of Switch 1's plummeting sales.
</p>
<p>
Earlier today, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-admits-sales-below-expectations-as-wait-for-switch-2-continues">Nintendo admitted it had failed to hit its own targets for Switch 1</a> over the course of 2024. The company has revised its finacial forecast as console sales dipped by 30 percent, and sales of Switch 1 software also slumped.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to investors following the announcement, Furukawa dismissed the suggestion that anticipation for Switch 2 was to blame. 
</p>
<p>
"We don't think the impact of refraining from purchasing [because of Switch 2] is that great," Furukawa said, as repoted by Japanese newspaper <a href="https://www.sankei.com/article/20250204-KB2S2JK245IALH4D6JO4NVHOZU/">The Sankei Shimbun</a>. "We think it's a solid eighth year, but we haven't reached our target."

</div><figcaption>Nintendo Switch 2 and Mario Kart 9 have been revealed - but questions remain.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyPgPcxLlIk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
It's fair to suggest that, after eight years, any console maker should expect sales to be in decline - as indeed they have for Switch 1 since the console's sales peak, back in 2022.
</p>
<p>
2024 was also a much quieter year for Switch 1 software releases overall, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> and Mario Party Jamboree selling well but not as strongly as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-bros-wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a> back in 2023.
</p><p>
And while the internet may be hanging on Nintendo's every word for news on Switch 2, there's still a large audience of Switch owners who are less engaged with Nintendo's preparations for what's next. Regardless, Nintendo has seen a steeper drop off in Switch 1 sales this year than any previous - and more than the company  had predicted.
</p>
<p>
That said, it's clear Nintendo will continue to push its hugely-successful Switch 1 - for the time being. Furukawa noted the company would continue Switch 1 support "as long as there is demand". 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo has previously said similar ahead of launching new hardware in the past - and it's not a surprise. The company already has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beloved-wii-u-exclusive-xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-coming-to-nintendo-switch">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition due in March</a>, before <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a> and Pokémon Legends Z-A arrive on Switch 1 later this year.

			<p>Beyond the recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-developers-and-writers-have-been-laid-off-while-development-of-next-mass-effect-continues-under-the-leadership-of-series-veterans/">laid-off</a> employees, a number of former <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> developers at BioWare are now said to be allocated "permanently" to other projects by EA, a shocking move for the employees involved.</p>
<p>The report comes from Jason Schreier (<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-31/electronic-arts-slashes-bioware-after-dragon-age-sales-miss?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTczODM1MTgzMSwiZXhwIjoxNzM4OTU2NjMxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTUVlXVThUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.91ztnslkcG02JwTwRRfVCXIJp8FOdqGBjCNQgz-bE8k&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">via Bloomberg</a>), who says that BioWare initially claimed that the employees were meant for a temporary transfer, but later on, EA decided to make this permanent without informing the individuals involved.</p>
<p data-component="paragraph"><em>But this week, the group was informed that the loans had morphed into permanent relocations, according to people familiar with what happened. They were no longer BioWare employees who were temporarily on assignment elsewhere; now, they worked for whichever EA subsidiary had borrowed them.&nbsp; </em><em>If they want to work at BioWare again in the future, they would have to look for job openings and re-apply.</em></p>
<p><em>- Bloomberg</em></p>
<p data-component="paragraph">This is a pretty interesting development, considering that BioWare already suffered a round of layoffs last year. According to Bloomberg, BioWare now has less than 100 employees, which is certainly a lot less than you'd expect from a triple-A studio. In a statement from EA to IGN, the publisher provided a vague response:</p>
<p data-component="paragraph"><em>The studio's priority was Dragon Age. During this time there were people continuing to build the vision for the next Mass Effect. Now that The Veilguard has shipped, the studio's full focus is Mass Effect. While we're not sharing numbers, the studio has the right number of people in the right roles to work on Mass Effect at this stage of development</em></p>
<p data-component="paragraph"><em>- EA via <a href="https://pk.ign.com/dragon-age-4/235195/news/dragon-age-developers-reveal-theyve-been-laid-off-after-bioware-puts-full-focus-on-mass-effect">IGN</a></em></p>
<p data-component="paragraph">BioWare fans are no doubt very disappointed by the news. It will be interesting to see how such decisions impact ongoing projects like the next Mass Effect title, which can potentially decide the studio's future in general. The once-beloved developer likely cannot afford another commercial disappointment.</p>

<p>According to the latest earnings release, the Nintendo Switch is now a step closer to the PlayStation 2 in sales, having sold more than 150 million units.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/02/switch-worldwide-sales-top-150-86-million-super-mario-party-jamboree-tops-6-17-million" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gematsu</a>, the Nintendo Switch sold 150.86 million units as of December 31, 2024, just 10 million shy of the best-selling video game console of all time, PlayStation 2. The 2017 console sold 4.82 million hardware units and 53.7 million units at this time. Interestingly, Nintendo has yet to beat DS’s sales numbers with the Switch, as the former has sold 154.02 million units in its lifetime.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-best-selling-first-party-nintendo-switch-games">Best Selling First-Party Nintendo Switch Games</h2>



<p>Nintendo also released its best-selling first-party Switch games, with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe still leading the pack, selling 67.35 million units. The next three in the list feature Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, selling 47.44 million, 35.88 million and 32.62 million units, respectively. The last title in the top 5 best-selling games for Nintendo Switch is Super Mario Odyssey, with 29.04 million units sold.

<p>Nintendo also revealed sales numbers for its newly announced first-party games, with Switch Sports selling 15.74 million units. Newer games like Super Mario Party Jamboree and Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership have sold 6.17 million and 1.84 million units, respectively. Other recent games, such as The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, sold 3.91 million units, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door sold 2.06 million, and Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD sold 1.80 million units.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-revises-forecast-again-nbsp">Nintendo Revises Forecast Again&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Nintendo sold 9.54 million hardware units, a 30.6% decrease year over year. On the software side, 123.98 million units were sold, a 24.4% decrease year over year. Hence, the console manufacturers have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-lowers-annual-forecast-after-switch-sales-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revised their financial forecast </a>for March 2025 again. This change was made “in consideration of the sales trend through the nine months ended on December 31, 2024.” The hardware and software unit sales forecasts have also been revised.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new estimates for net sales are 1.19 billion yen, down from 1.28 billion yen. The operating profit forecast was decreased from 360 million yen to 280 million yen. The ordinary and net profit estimates have also changed, down from 420 million yen and 300 million yen to 370 million yen and 270 million yen, respectively.&nbsp;</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Elden Ring Nightreign Details to be Released Next Week]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-details/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-elden-ring-nightreign-details-to-be-released-next-week.1099569/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-details/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Insider Gaming has learned that new Elden Ring Nightreign details are scheduled to be released next week, including a release date.</p>



<p>That’s according to source familiar with the games plans, who said that information will be released on February 12. It’s understood that the announcement will include media previews and a final release date for the game, which is currently slated for the end of May.</p>



<p>For those out of the loop, the timing could make a lot of sense, too, as a recent rumor has also suggested that a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-february/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation State of Play could be taking place in the same week</a> (although it could just be a coincidence). </p>



<p>But likely, the announcements and embargos are because of the Elden Ring <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-will-have-a-network-test-starting-february-14/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nightreign network test</a>, which takes place on February 14 – 17, which is undoubtedly going to see the games contents leak online. So it would make sense for FromSoftware to get ahead of the them with official announcements.</p>



<p>Announced during The Game Awards 2024, Nightreign is a cooperative experience that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-solo-or-trio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">can only be played solo or in a trio</a>. FromSoftware has already confirmed that the game cannot be played as a duo.</p>



<p>Elden Ring’s Game Director Junya Ishizaki clarified why such a decision was made, ““The reason that we went with a three-player focus was that we wanted to retain that sense of accomplishment you get from battling a boss together or from conquering a map together and that sense of enjoyment, but we wanted to recreate that in a fresh way. And we felt like focusing on a three-player co-op experience would provide a brand new sense of accomplishment with it.”</p>



<p>The game is scheduled to release on the PlayStation 4, Play7sTation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, and PC.</p>

That’s pretty wild. What the hell are they doing??”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bloodborne is of course one of the biggest conundrums in the video game industry. The FromSoftware masterpiece launched on PS4 to critical and commercial acclaim, but since then Sony hasn’t touched it. Fans are desperate for an official next-gen patch that would make the game run at 60fps, up from 30fps, but there are also calls for a remaster and a sequel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Recently, fans managed to get PS4 emulators to deliver something akin to a remaster on PC. The tech experts at <a href="https://youtu.be/-zjzBbdl7hk?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Digital Foundry released a video</u></a> covering “a breakthrough in PS4 emulation” via ShadPS4, which means Bloodborne is now fully playable start to finish in 60fps. Could this breakthrough have triggered an aggressive response from Sony? IGN has asked Sony for comment, but it has yet to respond.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">McDonald <a href="https://x.com/manfightdragon/status/1886240870560899319" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">offered</a> what he called his “copium theory,” though: that Sony could be working on an official remake.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“My copium theory is that Sony DMCAed the 60fps patch and the video about the Bloodborne demake so that when they announce a 60fps remake, google searching for ‘bloodborne 60fps’ and ‘Bloodborne remake’ won’t have collisions with our fan projects,” McDonald said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Let me cope.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then: “Like if they plan on trademarking ‘bloodborne 60fps’ and ‘Bloodborne remake’ they need to actually clean up in order to actually file a trademark request. Right??”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite these latest aggressive actions by Sony, the company has so far offered no indication that it plans to return to Bloodborne in any way. Last month, former PlayStation executive Shuhei <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-hasnt-sony-done-anything-more-with-bloodborne-playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-has-a-personal-theory"><u>Yoshida delivered his Bloodborne no-show theory</u></a> in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/jMsGB2PItes?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an interview with Kinda Funny Games</u></a>:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Bloodborne has always been the most asked thing,” Yoshida began. “And people wonder why we haven’t really done anything, even an update or a remaster. Should be easy, right? The company is known for doing so many remasters, right, some people get frustrated.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I have only my personal theory to that situation. I left first-party so I don’t know what’s going on, but my theory is, you know because I remember, you know, Miyazaki-san really, really loved Bloodborne, you know, what he created. So I think he is interested, but he’s so successful and he’s so busy, so he doesn’t want, he cannot do himself, but he does not want anyone else to touch it. So that’s my theory. And the PlayStation team respect his wish. So that’s my guess, right? Theory. I am not revealing any secret information, to be clear.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot is Bloodborne remains dormant nearly 10 years after the first game came out. But is there hope? In interviews, Miyazaki often deflects questions about Bloodborne, pointing to the fact FromSoftware does not own the IP. But in February last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftwares-miyazaki-responds-to-calls-for-bloodborne-remake-on-ps5"><u>Miyazaki at least admitted the game would benefit from a release on more modern hardware</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-mod-ray-traced-global-illumination/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Final Fantasy VII Rebirth mod now available for download introduces ray-traced global illumination and significantly improves lighting, but with a barrier of entry.</p>
<p>The FF7 Rebirth RTGI Remake-Grading ReShade preset, now available on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/222?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, addresses what is possibly one of the game's most glaring issues, the lighting, which makes the image look washed out and is a considerable step down from Final Fantasy VII Remake's lighting. The aim of the preset created by ShinObi12 is to bring the contrast and tone closer to that of Remake, which was used as a reference, and tame the adaption to feel more natural while adding RT bounce lighting. Judging from the comparison screenshot, the preset definitely achieves what it sets out to do, giving the game a more natural look in both indoor and outdoor locations.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this ReShade preset is not exactly available for free, as it requires Pascal Gilcher's iMMERSE Pro shader, which can be downloaded by subscribing to the developer's <a href="https://www.patreon.com/mcflypg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patreon</a> Ray Tracers tier. On the other hand, the cost of the subscription is only $5, which is definitely worth the visual improvements the shader can bring to a lot of games both old and new.</p>
<p>Despite some issues besides the downgraded lighting system over Remake, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is doing great on PC, as the game was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-had-great-steam-launch-best-selling-game-of-the-week-ending-jan-25/">best-selling game on Steam for the week ending January 25th</a>. The game's success is totally deserved, as it is an excellent continuation of the series, as highlighted by Kai in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review</a> of the PlayStation 5 version.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide.</p>
