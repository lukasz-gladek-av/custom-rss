		<p>Back in February during Sony’s State of Play <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/12/mindseye-revealed-and-it-looks-pretty-darn-fantastic/">MindsEye was revealed</a>, with the game being in development by Build A Rocket Boy and published by IOI Partners. Today, more exciting news has surfaced as the release date for MindsEye has been confirmed and you will not have to wait long. On June 10th, MindsEye will be available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S with pre-orders being available right now.</p>
<p><iframe title="MindsEye - Welcome to Redrock - Official Story Trailer | 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oprmuMXtfAo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<em>unravel.”</em> said Leslie Benzies, Game Director of MindsEye.</p>
<p>The story of MindsEye takes place in Redrock City, a near future metropolis in which humans and machines battle for power and control, which is shown through the power struggle between Mayor Shiva Vega and tech genius Marco Silva, who is also the founder of the technology firm Silva Industries. Shiva wants to make Redrock City the safest place on the planet, but through controlling the population, while Silva wants to use technology to alter humanity. Caught between all of this is main character Jacob Diaz, who is a on a mission to figure out his past.</p>


<p>MindsEye has been given a price of $59,99 /€59.99/£54,99, and those who pre-order will get a free upgrade to the deluxe edition. This is available for both digital and physical pre-orders.

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>We last wrote about immersive sim sequel <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/system-shock">System Shock</a> 3 back in 2020, when then-developers Otherside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-take-over-system-shock-3">sold the franchise to megapublisher Tencent</a>. Development of the series later passed to remaster specialists Nightdive Studios, who’ve already overhauled the first game and are currently working on a remaster of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/system-shock-2">System Shock 2</a> for release in June.</p>
<p>Now, NightDive have popped up with news that the System Shock 3 project survives, in some form, and that we could get clarification as to its status “potentially within a year”. Don’t call it a comeback, do call it a sign of life.</p><!--more-->
<p>“The situation around System Shock 3 is very complicated,” Nightdive’s director of business development Larry Kuperman hedged at GDC this week, in comments published by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nightdive-offers-hopeful-update-on-system-shock-3s-future/">VGC</a>. </p>
<p>Can we expect a proper update anytime soon? “Not as yet, not as yet,” Kuperman went on. “I don’t know when it’s going to clarify, but it could potentially be within a year. It could be, or it could take longer. That said, what I can say is that we have visions of what we can do within what we control.</p>
<p>“You’re going to see a remaster of System Shock 2,” he added. “I’ve been asked twice earlier today why we didn’t do a remake, and I said, ‘are you somehow under the impression that because we do a remaster that we won’t be able to do a remake in the future?’ That might be something that I can either confirm or deny. But there’s going to be content coming out.”</p>
<p>So there’s your bonus headline here: Nightdive might do a System Shock 2 remake after the remaster. Asked about the future of the series beyond retreads of the existing games, Kuperman said: “We’ll see what happens. I mean, there’s stuff that we can do within the first and the second.” Some expansions then?</p>
<p>It’s all very… non-enlightening. But I’m happy with any sign that System Shock has a future beyond high-fi retreads of the classics, and Nightdive seem like they could hack a threequel. In our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/system-shock-review">review of their System Shock remake</a>, Jeremy Peel called it “a breathtakingly beautiful and astonishingly faithful remake that proves the enduring power of Looking Glass design.”</p>
<p>Jeremy’s also got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-system-shock-2-made-stephen-kick-and-nightdive-studios%E2%80%9D">an interview with Nightdive</a> detailing how the studio got their hands on the license, beginning with a phone chat with an insurance company and ending with Nightdive’s acquisition by Atari.</p>
<p>As for Otherside – the studio co-founded by original System Shock devs Paul Neurath and Warren Spector - they’re currently working on a new immersive sim, Thick As Thieves.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-desert-online-ending-support-for-last-gen-consoles/</link>

<p>Developer Pearl Abyss has announced that it is ending support for Black Desert Online on last-gen consoles.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.console.playblackdesert.com/News/Notice/Detail?boardNo=19140&amp;countryType=en-US&amp;boardType=0&amp;searchType=&amp;searchText=%C2%A4tPage=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">video going over</a> the plans, the studio revealed that the game’s native update for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S will launch on June 26, 2025. At that point, the game will “shift to an exclusive PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S service”. This will result in support for the game on the Xbox One and PlayStation 4—both of which received the game in 2019—officially coming to an end.</p>



<p>“Gameplay on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One will no longer be available after the porting update on June 26,” said Brian Choi, Black Desert console’s live service manager.</p>



<p>He continued to assure players that all game data will be saved and stored. Account information as well as all entitlements to Black Desert Online will be accessible when players decide to make the jump to the current-gen console version of the game.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>“We understand that this news may be disappointing to many of you,” Choi said. “Black Desert has been consistently updated to provide a better experience for adventurers. However, as we mentioned in our previous video, despite the ongoing efforts to optimize and update content for older generation consoles, we have reached the point where hardware limitations make it increasingly difficult to deliver the latest content smoothly.”</p>



<p>When the update is released, it will be available at no additional cost for players who are making the jump to the current-gen systems.</p>



<p>What do you think of support for Black Desert Online on last-gen consoles ending? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>

that 23% of the cheaters were removed before they played their first match.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the new changes is the updated UI for Season 3. Activision says that a large portion of player-reported incidents are inaccurate and often console players. The report suggests that some of the inaccuracy might come from kills by players who used in-game intel like a Recon Scout perk or live ping. So, Season 3 will give players more detail on the KillCams to allow them to see if their opponent was using various game elements at the time of the kill.</p><p dir="ltr">Details in the KillCam widget will include:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">List of attackers who dealt damage with their username, weapon, damage, and hits</li><li dir="ltr">Affected by Live Ping: If the enemy had you pinged via line-of-sight</li><li dir="ltr">Affected by UAV: If the enemy had you pinged on the minimap via UAV, UAV Tower, or</li><li dir="ltr">Advanced UAV</li><li dir="ltr">Affected by unsuppressed weapon: When firing your weapon revealed your location on</li><li dir="ltr">the minimap to nearby enemies</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Season 3 will work to further improve the Ranked Play experience, which has previously been a hotspot for cheaters. The team will introduce a new system shortly after the launch of Season 3 that will help counter the impact a banned cheater had on the Ranked Play system with retroactive SR adjustments.</p><p dir="ltr">These actions include:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">When a Ranked Play cheater is banned, anyone they've recently defeated in Ranked Play will receive a SR Refund for those matches (to start, we will examine the last two weeks of matches but will continue to monitor if this timing needs to be adjusted)</li><li dir="ltr">Players who we detect playing with cheaters may have SR for those wins taken away</li></ul><p dir="ltr">A leaderboard scrub will also be performed before the end of Season 2 to remove any cheaters who gained SR illegitimately.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4467268-bo6-wz-season-03-returntoverdansk-002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467268" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4467268-bo6-wz-season-03-returntoverdansk-002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467268"></a><figcaption>Verdansk returns with improved graphics and lighting</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4467268-bo6-wz-season-03-returntoverdansk-002.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Additionally, Season 3 is bringing updates to the team's aimbot detections and the machine-learning system that analyzes game replays to identify suspicious gameplay for manual enforcement.</p><p dir="ltr">Changes are also coming to the account linking process in Season 3. Any account that links to a new platform may be required to complete a new security challenge to verify they are in control of the account. Failure to complete the challenge will block gameplay on that platform.</p><p dir="ltr">Activision also warned players against actions that could get them in trouble. This includes intentionally "teaming" to work with other squads to either grief other teams or account boost, as this is against the Call of Duty Code of Conduct and Security and Enforcement Policy. Activision recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-issues-an-extreme-warning-to-cheaters/1100-6530183/">warned players about account buying and selling</a>, as any account that has been knowingly sold will be permanently banned.</p><p dir="ltr">Lastly, players can expect several new layers to Call of Duty's anti-cheat efforts with Season 3, but to avoid giving away all the details too early, Activision says it will release an updated report on these new anti-cheat efforts closer to the Season 3 Reloaded update.</p><p dir="ltr">The publisher has recently hyped up the return of Warzone's Verdansk map, such as releasing an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzones-og-map-verdansk-returns-very-soon-see-a-new-trailer-now/1100-6529994/">OG Verdansk trailer</a> and bringing back nostalgic weapons and operators. Hopefully, these new anti-cheat efforts will be enough to hold the cheaters back and not ruin all the nostalgic fun.</p><p dir="ltr">For more news, make sure to check out the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-season-3-adds-iconic-mp-map-new-zombies-plus-jay-and-silent-bob/2900-6380/#1">highlights for Season 3 of Black Ops 6</a>, which showcase the new Shattered Veil Zombies map, several multiplayer maps, and Jay and Silent Bob operator bundles. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-warzone-season-3-roadmap-highlights-verdansk-event-omnimovement-changes-and-bots/2900-6375/">Warzone's Season 3 content is showcased here</a>, including the classic features and vehicles returning with Verdansk.</p>

                <p>What happens when you die in InZoi? It's a question that was somewhat explained by Krafton prior to the release of its life sim game. While there are up to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inzoi-has-16-different-types-of-death-including-shocking-and-unexpected-ones/1100-6530241/" data-ref-id="1100-6530241">16 ways to die in InZoi</a>, there are a limited number of options for what comes after death, including becoming a ghost and navigating the afterlife. Before you make your decision on whether to contend with the afterlife or simply reload an earlier save, we've got all you need to know on how it works.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#The_afterlife">The afterlife</a></li><li><a href="#How_to_die_in_InZoi">How to die in InZoi</a><ul><li><a href="#Types_of_InZoi_death">Types of InZoi death</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 id="The_afterlife">The afterlife</h2><p>When your Zoi dies, you'll be given the option to go on to the afterlife or reload an earlier save. The latter is self-explanatory, but what exactly is the afterlife?</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4467133-died.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467133" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4467133-died.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467133"></a><figcaption>The death tooltip</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4467133-died.jpg"></figure><p>Depending on your Zoi's Karma score at the time of death, you may be able to pass on peacefully, or you may be forced to roam the city as a ghost until your Karma score improves. While Krafton hasn't fully implemented the ghost system at the early access release date, we do know how it works thanks to the in-game tooltips that appear.</p><p>If you've been living a life of crime, maybe you decided to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-rob-an-atm-in-inzoi/1100-6530448/" data-ref-id="1100-6530448">rob an ATM</a> or two, maybe you interacted negatively with other Zois, or maybe you've been forced to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-out-of-jail-in-inzoi/1100-6530449/" data-ref-id="1100-6530449">get out of jail</a> more than once, then your Karma score won't be good. If this is the case, when you turn into a ghost you'll need to commit good deeds to raise your Karma score to "good" in order to peacefully pass on.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4467136-ghost.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467136" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4467136-ghost.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467136"></a><figcaption>Nyx the cat will guide you through the afterlife.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4467136-ghost.jpg"></figure><p>If there are too many ghosts in your city, you will find that it's difficult to create other Zois to move in. Other citizens will also be creeped out because, well, you're a ghost. While the ghost system isn't yet active in-game, it's unclear which good deeds will raise your Karma as a ghost. We're hoping there will be actions exclusive to ghosts, but that hasn't been confirmed yet. Ghosts are due to be added to the game around August 2025.</p><p>You'll also be given the option to go back in time. This way, you can save your Zoi from death before it's too late.</p><h2 id="How_to_die_in_InZoi">How to die in InZoi</h2><p>In our case, we were deliberately trying to murder our Zoi by starving him to death, just to see how this system works. It took three full in-game days of no food and approximately six "12 hours left" warnings before he finally passed away, so if your Zoi does die, it seems like you'll have gone well out of your way to make it happen depending on the manner of their dying. It's difficult to kill off a Zoi, at least through starvation or exhaustion, though it's a bit easier to be electrocuted while you try to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-rob-an-atm-in-inzoi/1100-6530448/" data-ref-id="1100-6530448">rob an ATM in InZoi</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4467138-starvation.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467138" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4467138-starvation.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467138"></a><figcaption>You'll be warned before your Zoi dies.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4467138-starvation.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Types_of_InZoi_death">Types of InZoi death</h3><p>While the developer says there are plentiful ways to die, including car accidents, even when running headfirst into traffic we didn't suffer so much as a scratch. Here are all of the ways we've discovered to die in InZoi so far:</p><ul><li>Starvation - Not eating for an extended period of time</li><li>Exhaustion - Not sleeping for an extended period of time</li><li>Pollution - Repeated exposure to high levels of pollution for a long time</li><li>Disease - If a Zoi gets a disease and remains untreated</li><li>Car Accident - When in a vehicle and experiencing a high-speed collision with another car</li><li>Loneliness - No social interaction or recognition</li><li>Slipping - Wet surfaces are a hazard</li><li>Electric Shock - Breaking into an ATM or repairing broken electronics can result in electrocution</li><li>Burning - Sims fans will be familiar with their characters dying in a fire</li><li>Embarrassment - While we haven't seen this ourselves yet, Krafton has mentioned Zois can actually die of embarrassment.</li><li>Old Age - The natural way</li></ul><p>Krafton has stated it will not add murder to the game, as it doesn't agree with it. However, it has said that if one Zoi accidentally starts a fire, and another Zoi is near that fire, they're likely to pass away. Make of that what you will.</p>

            <p>MindsEye, the new game from former GTA producer Leslie Benzies, has finally been given a release date.</p>
<p>The game was originally revealed as part of the Everywhere project from Benzies' studio Build A Rocket Boy; then in October last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-studio-to-publish-former-rockstar-and-gta-producers-mysterious-blockbuster-mindseye">Hitman developer IO Interactive announced it would be publishing MindsEye</a>.</p>
<p>Now it has a firm release date: 10th June 2025, across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. And there's a new story trailer to go with it too.</p>

<p>The trailer for the action-adventure thriller introduces the near-future desert metropolis of Redrock City, as well as the eccentric tech boss Marco Silva eager to change the course of human evolution.</p>
<p>"We can’t wait for players to immerse themselves in our tightly crafted game, MindsEye, with a thought-provoking story where technology and ambition collide, and the inevitable consequences unravel," said Benzies.</p>
<p>Adam Whiting, assistant game director at Build A Rocket Boy, told Eurogamer the team isn't worried about a June release clashing with the traditional E3 and Summer Game Fest period. "It maybe allows us to actually talk to players, engage with players around that time in a meaningful way," he said. "We're just very excited for players to finally get the chance to play."</p>
<p>Further, Whiting confirmed that the developer is still working on Everywhere. "MindsEye is a standalone game, but it is kind of connected," he said. "You can access it through Everywhere as a platform, but mostly we're really focused on MindsEye."</p>
<p>Everywhere was first revealed at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> in 2022, though its purpose confused players and rumours swirled around cryptocurrency and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/nfts">NFTs</a>. Benzies flatly denied this to Eurogamer during a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-producers-not-crypto-project-everywhere-is-part-episodic-blockbuster-part-roblox-rival">preview of the project in March 2023</a>.</p>
<p>It is, essentially, a platform for user-generated content, akin to Roblox, with MindsEye as a primary example from the developer itself of what can be achieved. More recently, MindsEye has taken centre stage with Everywhere humming away in the background.</p>
<p>MindsEye will be available as a standalone game for £54.99 / $59,99 / €59.99.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/layoffs-hit-gta-producers-everywhere-studio">company was hit by layoffs in early 2024</a>, a month after completing a fresh $110m funding round from investor NetEase.</p>
<p>Whiting noted to Eurogamer the industry's rapid expansion during the Covid-19 pandemic, which was followed by global layoffs. "We're seeing a lot of that stuff happening in the industry right now and it makes me sad because the games industry is full of so many very talented, very lovely people," he said. "But it's this period of the ebbs and flows, the peaks and troughs, and maybe it's in a bit of a trough now, but I'm sure it'll peak again soon."</p>
<p>He also noted that NetEase's recent, apparent pullback from video games hasn't affected the studio negatively. "Certainly, there's nothing that's let us to make any compromises or anything like that," he said.</p>
<p>"You know Leslie, he's a visionary, and he doesn't want to compromise on that vision for anything at all."</p>

I think the idea of a chill, cosy, and/or “Zen” factory <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a> is among the most pernicious to ever dribble from a game developer’s earhole, but I can’t deny how... soothing it can be to look down on a world of symmetrically nested conveyor belts. At least till your iron smelting district backs up. Modulus seems zouper-douper Zen. It also has a pleasing consistency: in this factory game, you shape and manufacture pieces for buildings which, as far as I can tell from the devlog below, can then be used to manufacture pieces for other buildings.

These building parts aren’t generic, liquid resources that magically add up into an airport or similar, once you’ve met the requirements. You can trace them within the architecture of the resulting construction. Rather than growing them from a given recipe, you’ll also sculpt these building parts from clumps of smaller cubes. You can venture inside each production facility to rotate, colour, stamp and trim these cubes to satisfaction, a mechanic that reminds me distantly of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/industries-of-titan">Industries of Titan</a>, but without the accumulating e-waste.
</p>
<p>
Yes, this is quite nice. It helps that the world you’re building factories in is a blend of pearly iPod paving stones and verdant plastic greenery. Very calming. Nicely... lacking in things besides factories.
</p>
<p>
“There are no timers, no enemies—just you and your factory,” adds the Steam page. “Relax and find your flow as you build at your own pace. Watch your factory expand, with monumental buildings emerging to meet the ever growing demand from The Grand Neural Network.” That last part sounds a little ominous. Still, I’m sure “ever growing demand” won’t cause any difficulties as long as the resources available to me are also “ever growing”. Incidentally, are there any animals in this world? Any people? Ah, no matter.
</p>
<p>
There’s a demo for Modulus in the works for 3rd April. It will encompass an estimated two hours of playtime, though it’s fundamentally “only limited in factory floor size.” It’ll also have an objective-free "Zen" mode and a tutorial. I guess I could have waited till the demo launch to write this up, but it’s a slow news day – it was either this or write about some <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> nonsense. Besides, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2779120/Modulus/">you can sign up for the Modulus playtest right now on Steam</a>.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/baby-steps-first-hands-on-preview-youve-got-to-fall-before-you-walk</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/baby-steps-first-hands-on-preview-you%E2%80%99ve-got-to-fall-before-you-walk.1148055/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/baby-steps-first-hands-on-preview-youve-got-to-fall-before-you-walk<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Five minutes. It only took me five minutes of my hour-long demo to become beguiled by the world of Baby Steps and see the promise of what developers Gabe Cuzzillo, Maxi Boch, and Bennett Foddy have in store for us. Baby Steps takes the simple premise of a guy on the couch, Nate, needing to find his way home after being transported into another world. It all starts straightforward enough: you wake up in a new world and need to put one foot in front of the other by lifting Nate's feet and thighs in an almost rhythmic way to make him walk, and if that sounds complicated, well, that is just the tip of the iceberg. During my preview, I climbed natural steps made of rock, walked across narrow beams of wood, and climbed the remains of a destroyed carousel from a circus, each challenging my grasp on the controls. Every location brought new challenges or obstacles and a new way I had to think about progressing over or past them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Walking in a game sounds so simple, but the complicated part and most significant challenge in Baby Steps is perfecting how to control the protagonist. Walking in 99% of games is as simple as holding up on an analog stick or pressing the assigned key on a keyboard. However, in Baby Steps, walking is anything but simple because while the left analog stick still directs movement, you control Nate's legs with the bumpers and triggers. Like QWOP, this took some time to get used to, leading to not an insignificant amount of flops, falls, and setbacks. But in Baby Steps, those setbacks are all just part of your journey and Nate's story of learning to put one foot in front of the other as he traverses landscapes decorated with natural and unnatural slopes, steps, mountains, and other obstacles to test your prowess with controlling him. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Baby Steps is shaping up to be the largest world yet from the team that brought us QWOP, Ape Out, and Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy. During my sessions, they remarked that I was the fourth person that day to play, and each of us had taken different paths as we explored. Although there is a great joke about it, Baby Steps follows in the footsteps of some other recent open-world games but goes even further. There are no directions to guide Nate on his journey, no map, no markers, no radar – nothing. You only have your intuition to guide you. Maybe you will spot a sign offering a reward if a lost cup is found and returned, perhaps you'll see the remains of a circus, or possibly something glowing hanging from a tree hanging off the edge of a nearby mountain. All of these and more are Baby Steps’s ways of telling you to go somewhere, and it works remarkably well; not once did I find myself lost in this vast open world or feel like I didn't know where to go, what to do, or how to overcome an obstacle. The biggest challenge is not in finding the path somewhere, but in the execution of moving Nate properly so he can maneuver around narrow ledges, finding spots to increase your height to reach the next foothold or surface you can stand on, and it's all done without the use of yellow paint. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yellow paint isn't as immersion-breaking for me as it apparently is for some. When chatting with the team about it, they spoke about how, while useful, it's a tool for developers to tell players the right way to get from point A to B. However, Baby Steps doesn't use it because there is no "right" way to walk up a slippery hill or climb a rock with precarious footholds. Whatever way you end up accomplishing it, that is the right way. Now, some ways will be easier than others for sure, but even that mileage will vary based on your experience and determination. The team expects some players to see a path that looks too difficult and take the easier route early on, and then, after they have become more familiar with the controls and Nate's capabilities, return and try that tougher route. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The biggest challenge is not in finding the path somewhere, but in the execution of moving Nate properly...</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also benefits to taking some of these more demanding routes or exploring the perceivably more challenging areas. Hidden little treats and bonuses are sprinkled throughout. The remains of that circus carousel I mentioned earlier actually had a funny little hat at the very top, and my reward for reaching the top was Nate wearing it as I explored the world. The catch is that these rewards aren't permanent, as I soon found my hat at the bottom of an outcropping of rocks after I tumbled while wearing it. The development team fully expects players to create their own challenges, such as, “Can I beat this game without losing this hat?” This may not sound like too tough a challenge, but it only takes one wrong step while climbing up a mountain or across a thin walkway to fall and watch your hat hurtle to the very bottom. Hats also aren't the only thing to collect. I won't spoil the details of that cup I previously mentioned, as it's a fun treat for some fans, but it gave me a good idea of the type of humor and extra challenges that Baby Steps has in store for its players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of humor, the few cutscenes I did manage to find by reaching various locations had me cackling with laughter during my preview. These cutscenes have a sort of absurd humor that stuck with me; the closest thing I could compare them to would be some of the off-the-wall humor you might see in an episode of Looney Tunes. Nate isn't the only person in this new world, but he seems to be the most awkward. Granted, the NPCs I met weren't exactly normal, either. From what I've seen so far, Nate's personality is a blend between that stereotypical child still living with their parents past the point that many would consider healthy and someone who would rather face hardships than interact with someone they aren't comfortable with. This trait becomes evident from the beginning of the game when he meets the first of what I hope are many recurring NPCs. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The sound design and music also have interesting quirks to them; hearing the collisions, impacts, and sound of Nate as he slams face or body first into the world around him evokes that feeling you get when watching a show, and someone gets kicked in their groin or stubs their toe. Now, there is no health bar to keep track of, and from what I could tell, Nate can't die, regardless of whether I fell off a two-foot or 20-foot rock, which will make it a bit more approachable for those who might worry about dying in a game like this. Accompanying the sounds of Nate colliding with the environment are sounds of nature, birds squawking, insects chirping, frogs croaking, and various animals coming together to create a discordant yet harmonic soundtrack to explore to. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I don't know what the future will look like for Baby Steps. It has a lot going for it at first glance, with what I consider is the studio’s most approachable entry. Many others have combined the various elements and mechanics to different degrees. Plenty of open-world games now pride themselves on removing markers from maps, encouraging players to live in and interact with the world; physics-based games have been around for even longer in various forms, either ragdolling characters or using it to affect the world around your character. However, something about Baby Steps's combination of these elements and their unique control scheme makes me believe it could be special. The team's approach to just turning players loose in a strange world full of obstacles, challenges, and secrets isn't necessarily new, but the way it combines them feels fresh enough to not only reach their dedicated fan base but also reach a new audience and welcome them to their unique style. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Warhorse's celebrated RPG Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is now available without DRM. The popular RPG has launched today, March 28, on the DRM-free game store, GOG.

            <p>Krafton has patched out a bug in its early access release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/inzoi">InZoi</a>, which allowed players to run over children with a car and kill them.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/inZOI/comments/1jldd0w/i_dont_think_that_krafton_realizes_that_you_can/">post on the InZoi subreddit</a> titled "I don't think that Krafton realises that you can run over children in inZOI" had started making the rounds. Attached to this post was a clip from the game, showing a player hitting a child with the front of their car.</p>
<p>Once the car hit the child, the child was then launched ragdolling across the ground in front of them, with the impact ultimately killing them.</p>
<p>While the developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-like-inzoi-has-16-different-types-of-deaths-so-watch-out-for-slippery-bathroom-floors">previously confirmed characters in InZoi could die from getting hit by a car</a>, with game director Hyungjun 'Kjun' Kim warning players they "might want to be careful" near the road, it was never said that children would also be subjected to this death.</p>
<p>Krafton has now addressed this bug. In a statement shared with Eurogamer, a Krafton spokesperson said:</p>
<p>"This issue was caused by an unintended bug that has been resolved in the latest patch. These depictions are highly inappropriate and do not reflect the intent and values of inZOI. We understand the seriousness of this matter and age-appropriate content and we are strengthening our internal review processes to prevent similar incidents in the future."</p>

<p>Our Matt has been playing InZoi, and while he appreciated its "expansive customisation" and "richly detailed worlds", he was a touch disappointed with Krafton's life-sim game.</p>
<p>"The trouble is, it's all so <em>soulless </em>– its flashiness failing to mask a lack of personality. Where The Sims feels tuned for maximum chaos and carnage (sometimes exhaustingly so), InZoi barely mustered a single memorable event in the six hours I played. I milled about its empty streets, trudged around its handful of notable landmarks, sang a song in a park, and unsuccessfully tried to strike up a friendship with strangers before returning home," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-25-years-of-the-sims-could-inzoi-be-about-to-steal-its-crown">Eurogamer's InZoi impressions feature</a>.</p>
<p>"By the time I'd tired of redecorating and had clicked on everything in my apartment at least twice, I was genuinely wondering how I was going to fill the rest of my virtual day as InZoi's clock – glacially slow even on its fastest setting - ticked on by."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Nintendo Direct event to reveal all of the features of the Nintendo Switch 2 takes place on April 2, but that doesn’t mean rumors aren’t going to stop spreading before then. In a new claim by a known leaker, the Nintendo Switch 2 will have a unique feature that connects to the current-gen Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://youtu.be/l2QbjzzdVj8?si=TzuZlQutPSLgmFJk&amp;t=546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">eXtas1s</a>, the Nintendo Switch 2’s mysterious “C” button will have multiple functions. One specific function, however, is that it will let you connect the new system to an original Nintendo Switch. This will reportedly allow players to use the Switch 1 as a controller or screen for Switch 2 games.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>“I don’t know if it’s the only function, or it will have more,” eXtas1s said via translation. </p>



<p>He then went on to give an example of how this would work based on what his sources explained to him. Using Mario Kart 9 as an example, the Switch 2 user will be able to hit the “C” button and connect to the Switch 1, letting it then be used as another controller for the game. That would also allow, in this example, for Mario Kart 9 to be played on the Switch 1 screen to avoid split-screen play.</p>



<p>It’s unclear what—or how many—games this feature would work with.</p>



<p>As with all rumors, please take this with a grain of salt unless Insider Gaming can independently verify the information or it is confirmed by Nintendo itself.</p>

			<p>The function of the Nintendo Switch 2 new Joy-Con controller C button has yet to be officially revealed, but there's the chance that we will get to celebrate the unexpected return of the Wii U console when it will, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>In a new video shared today,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@extas1s"> eXstas1s</a>, who proved to be an overall reliable insider in the past, revealed that, according to their sources, the C button will be used, among other things, to connect the Nintendo Switch 2 to an original Switch console to use it as a controller or an additional screen, essentially turning the previous generation console into something akin to the Wii U GamePad. As not every Nintendo Switch 2 user may also be the owner of its predecessor, there's no doubt that this connectivity feature will be completely optional, but, on the other hand, it could open up some very interesting possibilities, such as proper emulation of Nintendo DS and 3DS games.</p>
<p><iframe title="BOOM ☄️ XBOX + STEAM : ÚLTIMA Hora 🥵 SWITCH 2 Botón C: ASÍ FUNCIONA 🤔 JUEGOS de PS5 en NINTENDO" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l2QbjzzdVj8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While eXstas1s has proven to be somewhat reliable in the past, we have to take this Nintendo Switch 2 rumor with a grain of salt until the C button functionality is officially revealed next week. At the same time, a patent that emerged online<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-dual-screen-patent/"> earlier this month</a> suggested some sort of dual-screen functionality for the system, so the ability to use the original Switch as a second screen doesn't sound all that improbable.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches later this year worldwide. The console's release date is expected to be revealed next week during a dedicated Nintendo Direct.</p>

He spent over 15 years in IT support before joining The Verge.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Some <em>Helldivers 2</em> players are reporting that they can no longer play the game on their computers equipped with older CPUs. The issue stems from the developer Arrowhead Game Studios’ and publisher Sony’s requirement that users play on systems that support AVX2 (Advanced Vector Extensions), which has been a feature in many CPUs since 2013. However, the requirement was not properly enforced in the software, allowing some players with older hardware to play the game since it was launched for PC last year.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-suddenly-unplayable-for-some-pc-players-on-older-systems"><em>Eurogamer</em></a>, players on the <em>Helldivers 2</em> Discord server have voiced their displeasure with suddenly not being able to launch a game they have paid for and have been playing. “600+ hours in a game I love just to be locked out is making me so frustrated to the point I just want to ask for a refund instead of fixing their mistakes,” said a user.</p><p>Server moderator Birby responded to some of those complaining and explained that “the AVX2 check in the script is experimental, and can throw false positives.” The moderator blamed users for not following the stated minimum system requirements. “I don’t like to have to tell people their 13 year old processor is out of date,” said the moderator. “You should never be surprised if your out of spec machine can’t run the game.”</p><p>Still, players with the older CPUs likely have PCs or laptops that aren’t upgradable, so they will need to prepare to spend a lot of money on a totally new system.</p><p>This isn’t Sony’s first unpopular move made on PC <em>Helldivers 2</em> players. Last year the company had forced PSN account requirements for PC users, but then <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24150327/sony-helldivers-2-review-bombing-psn-login">pulled back after all the negative reviews on Steam</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/638179/baby-steps-preview-ps5-steam<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>“Is the rage boiling over?” Bennett Foddy asks me as I fall down a wooden plank for the dozenth time. The creator of <em>QWOP</em> and <em>Getting Over It</em> is known for games that can be both frustrating and meditative, pairing challenging physics with thoughtful design. The latest, <em>Baby Steps</em>, is similar — but a whole lot bigger.</p><p>I had a chance to play a chunk of the early portion of <em>Baby Steps</em> at 2025’s Game Developers Conference earlier this month. The game is developed by a trio made up of Foddy, Maxi Boch, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/8/18255975/ape-out-game-pc-nintendo-switch"><em>Ape Out</em></a> creator Gabe Cuzzillo. It starts out pretty silly: you play as a slacker named Nate who is transported to a strange world with little choice but to hike. There are cutscenes where he babbles in confusion at his situation and a handful of characters who aren’t especially helpful. At one point, someone offers Nate a map, and he refuses; there is no gear that aids your adventure in <em>Baby Steps</em>.</p><p>Instead, the game is perhaps the most literal definition of a walking simulator. You move by controlling Nate’s two legs individually to take steps. At first, I couldn’t take more than a few steps before falling flat on my face, which, to be fair, was often hilarious. The physics makes the wipeouts in <em>Baby Steps</em> entertaining to watch. But it was also infuriating. Walking is supposed to be the easy part of a video game; you push the stick forward and go where you want to. But here, even the tiniest obstacle proved troublesome. The first time I saw a small staircase, I wondered how I’d ever make it.</p><p>But slowly, through a lot of trial and error, I fell into a rhythm. It reminded me a bit of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20941606/death-stranding-review-ps4-hideo-kojima"><em>Death Stranding</em></a>, where I had to carefully pay attention to my movements if I wanted to get anywhere. For just regular walking up a path, this meant timing my steps just right so that I didn’t stumble. For obstacles like logs or staircases, it meant taking my time and carefully placing my foot where it needed to go. It never got easy, but at least I felt in control of my movements after a while.</p><p><em>Baby Steps</em> takes place in what seems like a fairly large and open world, the kind of place where you can see something on the horizon and go there. The trick, of course, is being able to actually walk toward it. Early on, I came to a fork in the road: on one side was a gently sloping hill that led further up the mountain; on the other, a wooden plank across a muddy slope that led right back down to the bottom. After some deliberation, I attempted to get across the plank and, two steps later, found myself sliding in the mud.</p><p>The developers tell me that <em>Baby Steps</em> is built on the idea of “self guided play,” meaning there are no artificial obstacles in your way, and you don’t have to worry about things like health or death. It’s just you and the environment. And while it might not seem like it at first, the game isn’t really designed to be punishing. As an example, when I had my big fall down the mountain, it didn’t send me back to the beginning but instead brought me somewhere new that I wouldn’t have seen otherwise. It also taught me an important lesson about taking on challenges I’m ready for.</p><p>I played for less than an hour, but I could already feel myself settling into a contemplative style of exploration I’ve experienced in games like <em>Death Stranding</em> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review"><em>Breath of the Wild</em></a>. There were no quests to complete or to-do lists to check off.

                <p>Vampire Survivors fans can soon read an official book that takes a closer look at the lore of the popular bullet-hell's world and the characters who inhabit it. <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1835411932?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Vampire Survivors: The Grimoire</a></strong> will be published by Titan Books on <strong>October 21</strong>, and preorders for the budget-friendly hardcover book are available at Amazon for $30.</p><p>Dozens of new monsters and characters have been added to Vampire Survivors since it left early access in 2022, so this lore guidebook could help you parse the surprisingly deep stories that aren't always easy to absorb due to the (delightful) chaos of the gameplay loop.</p><div title="6530465 - Vampire Survivors The Grimoire" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3308" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6530465 - Vampire Survivors The Grimoire" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1835411932?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/1835411932?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1835411932?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Vampire Survivors: The Grimoire (Hardcover)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1835411932?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/1835411932?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1835411932?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$30 | Releases October 21</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Written by prolific author Paul Davies, this 176-page hardcover book is penned in an in-universe style. Designed to be a guidebook authored by the mysterious Merchant who appears at the start of each level, Vampire Survivors: The Grimoire covers locations and secrets from the award-winning game.</p><p>"Vampire survivors are on a relentless quest," the official plot synopsis reads. "Stumbling through the Mad Forest, climbing the calamitous Gallo Tower, searching the far reaches of the Inlaid Library. The Belpaese family, the Ladonnas, assorted clerics and supernatural folk all join the search. Why is there roast chicken everywhere? How is that dog making flowers bloom? And who – or what – is Poe Ratcho?</p><p>And where are the vampires? That’s where I come in. I am the Merchant, and I can be your guide. If you have gold of course. Always gold. If you seek coffins, I may know where to find them--for a price. Though I cannot guarantee you’ll find the vampires you seek."</p></div>                      </div><p>In case you haven't played it yet, Vampire Survivors is a fun game that feels deceptively simple to play. Unlike other bullet-hell adventures where you have to constantly dodge projectiles, the game flips that script on its head and turns you into a tornado of doom as you gradually increase your power through a 30-minute run. The catch here is that the longer you survive the more progressively difficult a level becomes, and even if you can last for 30 minutes, the Grim Reaper will always be ready to claim your life at the end. The game is very affordable, and if you have a Game Pass account, available to play on PC and Xbox through that subscription service.</p><hr><p>It's going to be a while before this book is available, but in the meantime, you can score a pretty great deal on a bunch of other video game lore and art books.

In the network test, players faced off against the Nightlord Gladius at the end of the third night, which they beat 58,615 times. If players are downed during battle, their teammates can revive them by attacking them. During the network test, a total of 23,627,489 attacks were used to revive downed players.</p><p>However, players will lose the Runes they've accumulated if they fall in battle, as a result of not being revived in time. A total of 37,957,453,867 Runes were lost during the network test. Runes are earned by defeating enemies, with stronger ones dropping more. Here are the most formidable ones during the network test and how many were killed:</p><ul><li><strong>Golden Hippopotamus:</strong> 194,996</li><li><strong>Flame Chariot:</strong> 164,974</li><li><strong>Fire Monk:</strong> 150,128</li><li><strong>Flying Dragon of the Hills:</strong> 147,202</li><li><strong>Royal Army Knights:</strong> 98,738</li></ul><p>Elden Ring Nightrein's traversal is much faster than the typical Soulslike game. Players can run much faster and don't suffer fall damage. Throughout Limveld, payers can also summon Spectral Hawks to fly vast distances across the map. These creatures were summoned 427,533 times.</p><p>Elden Ring Nightreign will launch on May 30 for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.

                <p>Netflix Gaming boss Alain Tascan has outlined his vision for the future of gaming at Netflix, and his aim is to help reduce "friction" similar to how the Wii helped opened things up for a wider audience.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/netflix-games-strategy-evokes-the" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business,</a> Tascan said when he worked at EA, one of his ambitions was around "lowering friction and eliminating it." He was a big fan of the Wii because it was a lower-priced console that appealed to a wide audience, and Tascan wants to try to achieve something similar at Netflix.</p><p>Tascan said some of the frictions that exists in gaming today is the need to have enough controllers in a home and having an "expensive" piece of dedicated gaming hardware. Waiting for game downloads is another friction, Tascan said. Netflix Gaming aims to offer solutions in these areas by eliminating the need for dedicated gaming consoles and controllers, in part because Netflix aims to offer games over the cloud. In fact, cloud-streaming games is already available on Netflix.com under the Games tab.</p><p>Tascan hopes Netflix can create more "party games" that can help people have fun quickly--without the need for a console or a special controller.</p><p>"For party games, I believe we can give instant fun, using the phone controller as a very innovative controller," he said. "On every phone you have a gyroscope, you have a microphone, you have a speaker, you have a touchscreen… if you give that to creative people, what do they do? Whether you're alone, or with two people, or 20 people, why not? Can we do something really engaging?"</p><p>Tascan went on to say that what he's excited about at Netflix is helping games reach more people.</p><p>"The same way mobile opened up gaming to go beyond 150--200 million players to now 3.2--3.3 billion players, I believe we can reach to a larger number of players," he said. "Does it really need to be these super complicated RPG-style games? There is a place for them, for sure. But this for me this is what's interesting. Netflix is giving us this opportunity to have access to these people. What do we give them, and in what way, so they can enjoy and engage with [games] over and over?"</p><p>Finally, Tascan addressed a question regarding Netflix's commitment to gaming. After all, the company already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-boss-explains-why-company-killed-the-aaa-multiplayer-game-from-halo-veteran/1100-6530293/" data-ref-id="1100-6530293">shuttered its AAA game studio to instead focus on mobile and party games</a>. Google, many will remember, was heavily invested in gaming with its Stadia product, only to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stadia-is-officially-dead/1100-6510708/" data-ref-id="1100-6510708">quickly shutter it. </a></p><p>Tascan said to find success in a market like gaming, "it takes time, stubbornness, and investment to get great results." Not every company is willing to put in the time and effort, but Tascan said Netflix is different.</p><p>"If you look at our two Co-CEOs, Ted [Sarandos] has been in the company 25 years, Greg [Peters] over 15 years. And look at where Netflix was 10 years ago in terms of their core business. They know the path of being stubborn, hard-working, innovating, having a vision and going after it," Tascan said. "The road is not always straight to the top. But I believe them when they told me that gaming was important, because if [Netflix] wants to entertain the world then there’s no-way around it, we need to be in games. When I look at these two leaders in particular, but also the rest of management, I believe in their full commitment."</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> publisher Bandai Namco has released some player statistics from the game's network test last month, and it seems players were struggling to finish it.</p>
<p>The online co-op game takes place over three in-game days, defeating bosses each night to progress the next. However, the final boss of the cycle - Nightlord Gladius, Beast of Night - was only defeated 58,615 times.</p>
<p>The publisher hasn't released total player numbers, but looking at the <a href="https://www.bandainamcoent.com/news/elden-ring-nightreign-network-test-infographic">remaining stats</a> we can get an idea of how popular the test was.</p>

</figure>
<p>For instance, a total of 23,627,489 attacks were used to save downed players. Considering it takes around three hits to revive a player in this way (sometimes more), that's about 7.9m revives.</p>
<p>Further, the mini bosses strewn across the world were defeated from between 99,000 times to 195,000 times, depending on how often they appeared over the day cycle.</p>
<p>Lastly, 37,957,453,867 runes were lost during the test, when not retrieved after death. That's a lot of death - and a lot of heartache.</p>
<p>In all, it seems players were struggling to get to grips with Nightreign. The shift to online co-op and a faster pace may have proven a challenge for players, whether through poor explanation from FromSoftware or just not enough time to master the game during the test.</p>
<p>And that's when players even managed to get on - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreigns-first-network-test-suffers-server-issues-due-to-congestion">first of several tests over that weekend was a disaster</a>, with players completely unable to log into a match. This was resolved for the remainder of the weekend.</p>
<p>Of course, FromSoftware's games are known for being difficult. In particular, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>'s expansion <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> caused much debate with its difficulty level. Just give it time and somebody will be finishing Nightreign with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-boss-beaten-with-an-actual-banana">banana controller</a>.</p>
<p>Personally <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-eight-hours-with-elden-ring-nightreign-im-convinced-multiplayer-souls-is-an-exhilarating-rush">I had a great time playing Nightreign</a> and enjoyed its new style of challenge, as well as working with others - though I had a decent chunk of time with it during the preview.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-announced-by-fromsoftware">Elden Ring: Nightreign is set for release on 30th May 2025</a> across PS4, PS5, Xbox consoles, and PC (Steam).</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
