<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Dragami_Games/status/2026116124568641634">post on social media</a>, the team has revealed how "significant updates" for both the Switch 2 and Switch release have led to this delay. It doesn't go into any further details about this, but a new release date for Juliet's zombie-slaying adventure on Nintendo's latest hybrid platform will be announced when the team has completed its preparations.</p><div><figure data-videoid="8i2vvu-qeBQ" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt8i2vvu-qeBQ" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4c3af8hotnlk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Here's the developer's notice in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Notice of Release Postponement]</p>
<p>LOLLIPOP CHAINSAW RePOP Nintendo Switch 2 Edition had been scheduled for release on March 26, 2026. However, due to the need for significant updates not only to the Nintendo Switch 2 version but also to the currently released Nintendo Switch version, we have made the difficult decision to postpone the release.</p>
<p>We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused to all fans who have been eagerly awaiting this title. We will announce the new release date as soon as preparations are complete.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Dragami's previous update in January, the "Upgrade Pack" for this title (at least in Japan) is set to be a paid release.</p>
<p>When the Switch 2 version does eventually arrive, it will apparently include graphical enhancements, as well as improvements to the performance. Joy-Con 2 mouse support has also been announced and will be featured in an exclusive arcade-style mode, where you'll face off against waves of zombies using Juliet's Chainsaw Blaster and a turret.</p>

<p>Following a surprise announcement at the end of last week, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_firered_and_leafgreen">Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen</a> from the Game Boy Advance generation are making a grand return on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>There has been a lot of conversation online about the Switch eShop versions, which are priced at <strong>£16.99 / $19.99</strong> each. Some trainers are ready for battle, but others are still questioning why Nintendo didn't make these classics available via the Switch Online service (or give fans both options).</p>
<p>Despite all this back-and-forth, it seems both titles are already making bank on the Switch eShop. Following <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/psa-pokemon-firered-and-leafgreen-switch-preloads-are-now-live">preorders going live last week</a>, we've now taken a look at the eShop, and at the time of writing, these GBA titles have already topped the Switch charts in the US, UK, Japan and Australia. <em>So, there's definitely some interest!</em></p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22frktxnv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>As you may have already guessed, Pokémon FireRed (repping the Fire/Flying type Charizard) is leading the charge, with Pokémon LeafGreen in second place.</p>
<p>Nintendo has confirmed these Switch versions of the games will contain <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/we-thought-it-would-be-fun-nintendo-explains-why-pokemon-firered-and-leafgreen-arent-on-switch-online">the same content as the original releases</a>, and you can expect some modern solutions for the connectivity features. Support for <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_home">Pokémon Home</a></strong> has also been confirmed, and these titles can be played while using the GameChat feature.</p>
<p>Although these releases might be easy money for Nintendo, this doesn't necessarily guarantee we can expect to see other first-party retro titles on the eShop. According to an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/we-thought-it-would-be-fun-nintendo-explains-why-pokemon-firered-and-leafgreen-arent-on-switch-online">official FAQ</a>, this is a special case marking Pokémon's 30th anniversary, and there are seemingly no plans to revive "Virtual Console types of offerings".</p>
<p>Nintendo says it intends to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/nintendo-seemingly-rules-out-virtual-console-revival-says-it-remains-focused-on-offering-classics-via-switch-online">remain focused on offering retro releases</a> for its Switch Online subscription service going forward.</p>

<p>April is the new March</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The noir-style cartoon detective FPS <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mouse-p-i-for-hire">Mouse: P.I. for Hire</a> was scheduled to arrive on Switch 2 next month, but it seems there's been a slight delay.</p>
<p>Instead of its 19th March 2026 release, this title will launch for Nintendo's new hybrid system (and other platforms) on <strong>16th April 2026</strong>. In a new <a href="https://x.com/mousethegame/status/2026046752693092801">notice on social media</a>, Fumi Games &amp; PlaySide Studios says it wants to deliver the best game possible and just needs a few more weeks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"As we approach the final stages of development, we want to ensure we are taking the extra time and care needed to make Mouse: P.I. for Hire an experience to remember. We remain unwavering in our goal to deliver you the best game we can, and that will take just an extra few weeks."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The same update mentions how the team is excited to share "more of the game" with followers in the lead-up to the release, so expect more updates soon! This isn't actually the first time Mouse: P.I. for Hire has been delayed. It also follows the announcement of the Switch 2 version in October last year.</p>
<p>You can find out a little more about this game in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/vintage-shooter-mouse-p-i-for-hire-blasts-onto-switch-2-in-march-2026">our previous story here on Nintendo Life</a> and an official developer "deep dive" documentary below. When it arrives, players can apparently expect "fast-paced FPS combat" and a thrilling single-player campaign with over 20 levels.</p>

<p>With this in mind, today it's added an absolute banger - it's the soundtrack for the 1992 Game Boy title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/super_mario_land_2_6_golden_coins">Super Mario Land 2 - 6 Golden Coins</a> starring Mario (and Wario). This album features tracks like "Mario Land" and "Star Course". It offers <strong>35 tracks</strong> and has a total runtime of 30 minutes.</p>
<p>This soundtrack was composed by the one and only Kazumi Totaka, who is known for his famous song <a href="https://youtu.be/_cfBw8cnWgg">"Totaka's Song", which appears as an easter egg</a> in many Nintendo games. He has also voiced Nintendo characters such as Yoshi.</p>
<p>Here's the full soundtrack for this latest Nintendo Music update:</p>

<p>It's a more "challenging production process"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="675381b58be4e"><a title="Final Fantasy VII Rebirth" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/675381b58be4e/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix, Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Earlier this month, Square Enix confirmed it would be bringing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> to the Switch 2 in June 2026.</p>
<p>Compared to the first entry, part two is a significantly larger game with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-director-hopes-to-share-switch-2-update-in-very-near-future">small but intricately detailed open-world zones</a>. Despite this, the target goal apparently remains the same, according to the trilogy's director Naoki Hamaguchi.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/interviews/we-ask-final-fantasy-vii-remake-director-naoki-hamaguchi-about-the-switch-2-versions-hair-problem-why-does-it-happen-and-can-it-be-avoided/">Automaton</a> recently, he mentioned how the team's engineers are targeting 30fps "wherever possible". This will apply to not only Rebirth, but also the third installment in the trilogy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Naoki Hamaguchi:</strong> "We’re consistently aiming for 30fps wherever possible. For FFVII Rebirth and the third installment of the trilogy, our engineers are working hard on tuning to ensure stable performance at that level. I hope players will look forward to it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hamaguchi adds how the team is working hard to optimise the game so it can maintain a "stable frame rate", while also improving the visual quality "as much as possible" at the same time.</p>

<p>This follows some comments Hamaguchi made not long ago, when he acknowledged how the second game was a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-director-hopes-to-share-switch-2-update-in-very-near-future">much more "challenging production process"</a> overall but was still confident his team of engineers would be "able to deliver".</p>
<p>Hamaguchi has also confirmed both titles to follow the Remake will feature <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/final-fantasy-vii-remakes-sequels-will-have-exactly-the-same-gameplay-as-other-consoles">"exactly the same" gameplay experience</a> as other platforms.</p>
<p>When Rebirth arrived on the PlayStation 5 in 2024, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth?utm_campaign=related-articles&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=nintendolife.com&amp;utm_content=in-article">our colleagues at <strong>Push Square</strong></a> thought it was a "great" sequel, but did call out the "disappointing" performance mode on this platform at the time, which <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/03/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-is-getting-another-patch-to-improve-performance-mode">led to a post-launch update</a>. As for our time with Remake on Switch 2, we thought it was an excellent experience, even at 30fps and with "a few minor dips" in handheld.</p>

        <p>Try to survive this cursed game with some help from an unusual cat.</p><p>This game includes scenes where information from the player’s PC environment is displayed within the game. When streaming or recording, enabling “Streamer Mode” is strongly recommended to prevent a loss of privacy.</p><p>Furthermore, we are participating in the Steam Next Fest, (starting on February 24) and a demo version is already available. Save data from the demo can be transferred to the full version, so please take this opportunity to play <em>DYPING: ESCAPE</em> and add it to your wishlist.</p><p><strong>About the Game</strong></p><p>“Let’s play a typing game. All you have to do is type what I tell you to. You don’t have to think at all.”</p><p>A pair of creepy, mysterious eyeballs is your game master. You’ll follow their instructions to progress through a typing game… but also be forced to sign a rather unreasonable contract.</p><p>Whatever you type becomes reality and is inflicted upon you. You might be asked to run programs you don’t want to, or even hack your own system in an act of self-destruction. You might have to watch in horror as your computer breaks down before your very eyes. There’s not much you can really do to fight against this, especially in a typing game… But with the help of a cat awakened from an ancient game, perhaps you can escape.</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/02/dyping-escape-launches-march-13]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>1444321</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Controversy has arisen from the recent <em>Neopets</em> TTRPG playtest document. The beta playtest, released as part of Geekify's development of the tabletop game, was so full of inappropriate and unrepresentative material, that it was taken down by the owner's request.</p><h2>The Neopets TTRPG Playtest Controversy</h2><p>The <em>Neopets</em> TTRPG playtest controversy started when the document became available to the public. Over several weeks, fans and tabletop enthusiasts poured over the material, curious to see how the family-friendly web series about raising adorable digital pets would be adapted.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The answer was not particularly well. The system was a derivative of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> and was very combat heavy. This is a major departure from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/neopets-ttrpg-kickstarter-has-doubled-its-funding-goal" rel="nofollow">Kickstarter's</a> promoted original classless, point-based RPG system. Worse still, the scenario had some decidedly inappropriate subject matter for <em>Neopets</em>.</p><p>How inappropriate? According to some posts on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/infernatrixsophia.bsky.social/post/3mec3mgatyl2f" rel="nofollow">Bluesky</a>, the document had players face intoxicated/drunk bandits, gives them the option to potentially torture them for information, and contains lines with misogynistic and even homophobic connotations. There is even a section asking players their comfort levels about in-game sexual activity. In a <em>Neopets</em> RPG.</p><p>In fact, the Neopets TTRPG playtest controversy was such a debacle, the company recently released a statement addressing the issue on their website. The statement is critical of the RPG, stating that <em>Neopets</em> wasn't "a generic fantasy dungeon crawler." Furthermore, it states the document was made without their approval.</p><blockquote><p>We want to be transparent with the community: the beta playtest document that was recently made public was not approved or reviewed by our team prior to its release. Under our licensing agreement, all content bearing the Neopets name must meet our quality standards and receive our written approval before it is shared publicly. Following an internal review, Neopets has determined that the content and themes contained within the document do not align with our brand standards, values, or the expectations we hold for experiences created under the Neopets license. Although the Neopets team has been steadily reviewing the TTRPG in sections as it is submitted, none of the aforementioned submissions was included in the beta document material released. We immediately requested the document’s removal and have been in direct communication with Geekify to address the matter.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Curiously, despite the <em>Neopets</em> TTRPG controversy, the company seems committed to the game's development. The statement ends stating the company will take the time needed to ensure the project reaches its potential. But if this playtest is indicative of the attitude and approach Geekify has towards the property, it doesn't paint a nice picture for the future.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <guid>1444315</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When big news happens there’s an inevitable rush to put it in context and explain it. One approach is to take the news at face value and begin rationalizing it. Another approach is to assume there’s some hidden logic at work and unearth whatever that is. We’ve seen both of these when it comes to <a href="https://kotaku.com/phil-spencer-xbox-leaving-retirement-microsoft-2000672059">Xbox’s big leadership shakeup</a> and neither offers a completely satisfying answer to the basic question everyone’s been asking themselves a version of since Friday afternoon: what the hell?</p> <p>Phil Spencer is retiring. Sure. Makes sense. He’s been at Microsoft for 38 years. God bless him. But for it to be announced on a Friday afternoon via a series of memos and weird media “exclusives?” Odd way to put a pin in the career of one of gaming’s longest-serving and most visible executives. Not even an Official Xbox Podcast episode to break the news and offer Spencer the chance to share it in a more personal way with the millions of fans who have been following his vision for Xbox and gaming for over a decade now.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/883015/microsoft-xbox-new-ceo-shakeup-notepad">A report from <em>The Verge</em></a> explains some of this weirdness. The announcement was originally supposed to happen on Monday February 23 instead, but reporting from<em> IGN</em> forced Microsoft to move up its timeline. Most employees learned about the move from social media first as a result. Spencer has reportedly been planning to retire for almost a year now. Microsoft just happened to choose the end of February to pull the rip cord. Microsoft head of comms Frank Shaw <a href="https://twitter.com/fxshaw/status/1940481184649433246?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1940481184649433246%7Ctwgr%5E4a5e94428821a7740f8fb58a86617febd86490cc%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fphil-spencer-retire-xbox-layoffs-microsoft-sarah-bond-1851785564">shut down rumors</a> last July that Spencer was retiring “anytime soon,” calling them made-up. Was he lying then, or now?</p> <h2>A celebration cut short</h2> <p>All the stranger considering Spencer will technically still be hanging around in an advisory role through the summer to help with the transition as new Microsoft Gaming CEO Asha Sharma takes the reigns. Will he be teaching her how to get all the achievements in <em>Brotato</em>? Spencer’s public-facing role at Xbox has felt ceremonial for a while now, yet he’s bailing out before the console’s 25 year anniversary celebrations get underway?</p>

 <p>For all its stumbles and challenges in recent years, 2026 is supposed to be a victory lap for Xbox. Game Pass’ price hike was wildly unpopular but its been on a tear of great releases. Xbox console sales are tanking but people are intrigued by the PC gaming future that devices like the Xbox Ally X are pointing to. And the games, a perennial Achilles’ heel for the tech giant, are here. <em>Forza Horizon 6</em>, <em>Gears of War: E-Day</em>, the <em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em> remake, and <em>Fable</em> are making good on the company’s promise of quarterly tentpoles. They’re not exclusive, but they’re each a celebration of franchises that have defined Xbox across four console generations.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Phil Spencer tries to explain Indiana Jones coming to PS5 so soon after Xbox. </p> <p>"We run a business, it's definitely true inside of Microsoft the bar is high for us in terms of the delivery we have to give back to the company" <a href="https://t.co/U9z5MWxxAe">pic.twitter.com/U9z5MWxxAe</a></p> <p>— AmericanTruckSongs9 (@ethangach) <a href="https://twitter.com/ethangach/status/1826253543491453381?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2024</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Then there’s the curious case of why Xbox president Sarah Bond resigned on Friday. Spencer’s goodbye email was the only one to mention her. Even Xbox’s long-time third musketeer Matt Booty declined to thank her for her service to the company and the platform. Hours after the news was out, Bond shared her statement on LinkedIn. She didn’t mention Booty either.</p> <p>“This moment also presents a unique opportunity for fresh eyes and new leadership to guide the team into its next chapter,” she <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7430753683912531968/">wrote</a>. “I’ve had the privilege of spending time with Asha over the last few weeks as we’ve planned for this transition, and I’ve seen firsthand her deep commitment to our players, developers, and brand.”</p>

 <h2>A convenient scapegoat</h2> <p><em>The Verge</em> reports that Bond was seen as “tough to work with” and that some employees were “relieved that Bond is leaving Microsoft.” Curiously, it lays much of the blame for Xbox’s recent strategic blunders at the feet of Xbox’s most junior leader. “Bond had tried to push mobile and cloud over console, to reach potentially millions more Xbox customers, but the result has been a classic case of chasing tomorrow’s customers by neglecting today’s,” writes Tom Warren, though he later notes that Bond’s actions were “under Spencer’s direction.”</p> <p>I think you’d be hard pressed to find an Xbox fan anywhere who believes even for a minute that Microsoft’s multiplatform “play anywhere” pivot to cloud, PC, and mobile was a bottom-up movement spearheaded by Bond rather than a mandate incentivized from the top down as CEO Satya Nadella and CFO Amy Hood demanded <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-price-hike-game-pass-layoffs-new-console-2000638546">aggressive growth targets and strict profit margin discipline</a> following the $70 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/papapishu.bsky.social/post/3mfkdfhaals2i">Many have noticed</a> how convenient it would be for Microsoft to pin the erosion of Xbox as a meaningful concept on someone who’s no longer at the company and her retiring boss.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Xbox president Sarah Bond responds to a question from Bloomberg's <a href="https://twitter.com/dinabass?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@dinabass</a> about why Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks was shut down. Full interview here: <a href="https://t.co/te5Trhut0Q">https://t.co/te5Trhut0Q</a> <a href="https://t.co/LGs0n9iV0t">pic.twitter.com/LGs0n9iV0t</a></p> <p>— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) <a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1788728698184540355?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 10, 2024</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It might be easier to square any of this if Microsoft’s own messaging on this moment and what it signals sounded any more coherent than the rest of the Xbox Series X/S generation. “We will recommit to our core Xbox fans and players, those who have invested with us for the past 25 years, and to the developers who build the expansive universes and experiences that are embraced by players across the world,” Sharma wrote in her introductory memo to staff and fans. She promised “a renewed commitment to Xbox starting with console which has shaped who we are.”</p>

 <p>Then just a sentence later she continued beating the “play anywhere” drum. “Gaming now lives across devices, not within the limits of any single piece of hardware,” she wrote. “As we expand across PC, mobile, and cloud, Xbox should feel seamless, instant, and worthy of the communities we serve. We will break down barriers so developers can build once and reach players everywhere without compromise.”</p> <h2>A renegade spirit for the AI age</h2> <p>No mention of other consoles like PS5 and Switch 2. Is Microsoft ending its experiment with exclusivity? “<a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-exclusives-halo-asha-sharma-microsoft-2000672587">Hear you</a>,” Sharma told an Xbox fan over the weekend when he told her to bring back console exclusivity. The new Microsoft Gaming CEO has been saying all the right things to build trust with Xbox’s core audience, but the platform has zigged and zagged so much over the last five years that no one’s going to believe words until they’re backed up by actions, and even then what will stop Microsoft from pivoting again while gaming remains a rounding error relative to its other businesses and the emerging AI market?</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-prices-dram-amd-ai-shortage-2000646851">Affordable hardware</a>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-perfect-dark-halo-gears-war-fable-ps5-1851785732">Killer games</a>. Those are the ingredients a console platform needs to thrive and flourish. Microsoft has shown time and again it’s either not committed to those two things or is unable to execute on them. Bond may have been a <a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1788728698184540355?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1788728698184540355%7Ctwgr%5E76c1407b0e4a4366c0ea5b5dff746c7d0cf8191c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fxbox-game-studios-arkane-tango-gameworks-hi-fi-rush-1851470253">poor messenger</a> for the future of Xbox, but it will take more than messaging <a href="https://kotaku.com/thats-it-im-calling-it-xbox-is-dead-time-of-death-february-20-2000672114">to save Xbox</a>. And the way this entire Xbox reorg has been rolled out suggests that even the messaging will continue to be a mess.</p> <p>“I want to return to the renegade spirit that built Xbox in the first place,” Sharma wrote in her memo. One person who doesn’t believe that is an actual renegade who built the first Xbox, Seamus Blackley. “I expect that the new CEO, Asha Sharma, her job is going to be as a palliative care doctor who slides Xbox gently into the night,” he <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/what-an-xbox-founder-thinks-of-the-new-xbox-ceo-seamus-blackley-interview/">told <em>Games Beat</em></a> today. “The job of all these people is to just gently usher all of these business units into the new world of AI. That’s what you’re seeing here.”</p>

<p>An unfortunate but important update has been shared from the team behind MOUSE: P.I. For Hire.</p>



<p>MOUSE: P.I. For Hire is an upcoming narrative-driven first-person shooter. One of the game’s main elements is its black-and-white art style, inspired by the rubber-hose animation style. MOUSE is one of many projects that entered development once the Steamboat Willie version of Mickey Mouse entered the public domain.</p>



<p>A mini behind-the-scenes documentary was released in October 2025, covering the development of MOUSE. It was shared during the ID@Xbox Fall showcase.</p>

The reason given for the delay is simply a request for extra time to ensure the game’s quality.</p>



<p>“As we approached the final stages of development, we want to ensure that we are taking the extra time and care needed to make MOUSE: P.I. For Hire an experience to remember,” the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2416450?emclan=103582791473604212&amp;emgid=490465653219656390" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">statement read. </a>“We remain unwavering in our goal to deliver you the best game we can, and that will just take an extra few weeks.”</p>

<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/category/esports/games/call-of-duty/" id="3373">Call of Duty</a> team recently shut down a rumor regarding an upcoming game project.</p>



<p>Recently, a “leak” from TheGhostofHope on Twitter claimed that the Call of Duty team was planning to release a standalone Zombies title alongside the standard Call of Duty release. The post also noted that Microsoft hoped Activision would be less attached to annual releases going forward.</p>



<p>However, it appears none of that is true.</p>







<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-team-denies-rumor">Call of Duty Team Denies Rumor</h2>



<p>The Call of Duty Twitter account actively shut down the rumor. Replying to a Dexerto post, they would say that the “rumor factory is working overtime” and that “this ain’t it.”</p>



<div><article><p><span>EXCLUSIVE: Sources indicate to me that the delay on the next Xbox has “hurt” a lot of CODs marketing plans as they wanted Modern Warfare 4 to be a launch title and draw a lot of hype to compete with peoples attention alongside GTA VI.

Because of this delay, the idea of two Call</span></p></article></div>



<p>There you have it. If you were looking forward to a standalone Zombies Call of Duty game, you may have to wait a little longer. This ain’t it, chief.</p>











<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-is-selling-very-well">Call of Duty Black Ops 7 Is Selling Very Well</h2>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 was recently listed as the best-selling game of January 2026. That was the second month in a row, as it also claimed the same spot in December 2025. Therefore, things are looking alright for the CoD brand.</p>



<p>They did recently shut down one of their mobile games, however. It was noted that Warzone Mobile will shut down in April. Learn more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-to-go-offline-in-two-months/" id="177181">here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Last week, longwinded YouTuber F.D. Signifier released a long awaited deep dive on the Black entertainer Tyler Perry. Perry is a filmmaker whose work is ubiquitous and for a long time felt impossible to escape. While his work is ostensibly for a Black audience, if you watch more than one of his films, it also reveals itself as tedious, formulaic, and at its worst, anti-Black. It's true that Perry is a self made billionaire and by all metrics a success. But what does his success mean for the rest of the Black community? </p><p>Gita and Isaiah sat down to talk about this, and the rest of Signifier's epic video.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cpgqWZyAJtM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="The Tyler Perry Video"></iframe></figure><p><strong>Gita Jackson:</strong> Isaiah! Thank you for joining me in unraveling the four hour YouTube video essay about Tyler Perry from F.D. Signifier that I have not been able to stop thinking about. Coming in on the heels of the <em>America's Next Top Model</em> documentary, this extremely long essay takes aim at another Black capitalist, the Madea Maven himself. I wanted to ask you: what's your relationship to Tyler Perry?</p><p><strong>Isaiah Colbert:</strong> Lordy. Well, my relationship with Tyler Perry—like most Black trauma—came from my mother. Or, more specifically, my mom owning the VHS tapes of his early <em>Madea</em> plays that she got from local bootleggers that she'd play almost daily when I was growing up. Though by then, I knew the man less than I knew his most famous character, Madea, before she became the mainstream caricature of tough Black love she is today. While I've been able to avoid Tyler Perry for the most part in my mostly autonomous day to day life as an adult, whenever I go over to my mom's for the holidays, she's guaranteed to either have her TV already on to whatever the Tyler Perry channel on her Roku TV or ask me if I've seen his latest produced movie after she's already put it on before waiting for my reply. In short, my relationship with him has been against my will.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> That's weirdly relatable for me? At least in that Tyler Perry is inescapable if you're Black. In college, I was in the cinema studies program and I ended up taking a Black Cinema class, and we spent a lot of time talking about that same distribution and tour model that made Tyler Perry so successful. Getting on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chitlin%27_Circuit?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">chitlin' circuit</a> and making movies specifically for Black churchgoers was extremely lucrative! But the work itself... well. </p><div><p>I think we also both have opinions on the work. I've never seen a Tyler Perry movie all the way through on purpose, and nothing I have seen of his work makes me want to. Yet, he is one the most successful Black filmmakers of all time. And I think he can be a good actor on occasion—Fincher casting him as a shrewd lawyer in <em>Gone Girl</em> was a stroke of genius.</p><p>For me, watching this video brought together a lot of criticisms I've had about Black capitalists like Perry—your Jay-Zs, your Tyras. But also, it really reveals that these films are not loving portraits of Black people. Perry seems to kind of hate us?&nbsp;</p></div><p><strong>Isaiah:</strong> Oh, big time. Or at least he's hit too comfortable a stride, similar to Dave Chappelle, where he knows he has enough cultural cache with Black people based on his past good will to know that he can joke about owning a town and treating its people like serfs without realize how out of touch the joke is. But the real joke here is that Tyler Perry can basically pump out the same meat and package it as different items on a fast food menu and he knows folks are gonna eat it up because it has the veneer of being by us for us. In reality its not dissimilar to a King Bach-style Vine with a prestige production machine backing it. </p><figure><iframe width="200" height="150" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZRfDgnapUAw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Typical Tyler Perry Plotlines (Boondocks Season 3 - Buy the Box Set Today)"></iframe></figure><p>But, like F.D. Signifier's video highlights, it's something a lot of Black folks have been keyed in on with a lot of help from <em>Boondocks </em>living up to how we'll clown on a nigga and have way too much truth layered in our jokes. He's a good character actor who huffs a bit too much of his own farts and thinks he's putting on airs with the slop he's mass producing on his channel. Unfortunately, convincing my mom of that is as easy as having a conversation about genders and my being bi: a lost cause.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> LMAO yeah, when I came out to my mom she didn't believe me and then we never talked about it again. She also doesn't know what my pronouns are because I'd rather not have that argument.</p><p>In Signifier's video, he frames the entire long-ass essay around the idea of building a table. I really enjoy this metaphor because, well, so often Black people are waiting for a "seat at the table" of success, of prestige, of financial support. But by the end of the video, Signifier says that Perry has truly built a table to sit at and eat at by himself. To me, that's the most evil part of Perry.</p><p><strong>Isaiah: </strong>Yeah, not to compare Tyler Perry to <em>Family Guy</em> (lol) but the whole thing seeing how he operates reminded me of the one cutaway gag about a father gorging himself on food while his emaciated family starves and he says they can eat when he's finished. But he's never finished. </p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jHFTATeWH5g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Family Guy - John Goodman  ᶜᶜ"></iframe></figure><div><p>But that won't stop a lot of Black folks lauding him as an aspirational tale of Black excellence that every young man should strive to achieve and do the most to sacrifice and claw your way to being at the top. Myself included. I probably can contribute a major part of my being nonbinary because I had a eureka moment in tandem with just not vibing with all the gender standards my family placed on me to what Tyler Perry basically thinks of light skinned men. Basically to be this Christlike figure of masculinity who will sacrifice and save everyone. To be "the man of the house" who commands respect while also being excellent at something that gets me money rather than what I enjoy,&nbsp; no matter how much it's putting myself out, <em>and </em>to never cry about it. Something that's bullshit; men should be allowed to cry and be soft.</p><p>And the whole notion of Black excellence is also bullshit. MFers should be allowed to just be Black without having the pressure to be excellent to give their lives inherent meaning. But Tyler, and his works by proxy, are an enduring sentiment from Boomer and Gen-X churchgoers that people from my generation have as much a chance as a pebble of stopping a wave from reaching shores with how his whole enterprise is intrinsically linked to and&nbsp;supercharged by the cultural Goliath that is the Black church. The man is as much a plague to my existence as the McMahon family.</p></div><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Honestly, seeing someone look at the empire that Perry has built and declare that the emperor has no clothes was refreshing to me. I remember when Jay-Z was talking about "gentrify your own hood." For a long time, Black millionaires like him were the people I was told to look up to, people who escaped the hood and consolidated wealth for themselves, the rest of us be damned.</p><figure><figcaption><span>This wig drives me INSANE!//Image Source: Lions Gate</span></figcaption></figure><p>A lot can be said for Perry's outright anti-Blackness, especially when it comes to Black men. He motherfucking HATES dark skinned Black men. Hell, he doesn't like Black women so much either. It's hard to say whether or not he holds the same opinions on blackness that are expressed in his films because he is strikingly dishonest, but he has built his entire empire on abusive dark skinned men and wilting, abused Black women. Black capitalists like Perry often say they're doing it "for the culture," but apparently "the culture" only means themselves and their gentrified hoods.</p><p><strong>Isaiah:</strong> And like, what the hell does "gentrify your own hood" even mean? No more corner stores and everything is cashless and by proxy anti-homeless and anti-baller on a budget? That always rang to me less like building our own and more building for oneself by playing the game that's already disadvantaged Black folks for years, but because you're doing it it's somehow better. </p><p>I grew up in Cabrini Green in Chicago, and I can tell you the gentrification of one's own hood seldom comes from the folks who live there because we all got moved the fuck out to make way for dispensaries, mall kiosks, and housing that a rare few of the folks who lived in those project buildings got grandfathered back into after being kicked to the south side. He's a big reason why I just roll my eyes whenever I see someone of his ilk claim his art isn't for everyone while saying it's for me. When in reality, he's just playing in my face. So it was really cathartic to have F.D. Signifier "king of the Blacks" (lol) put all of my deep-seated resentment and complicated history with the man in a video essay that wasn't long for the sake of being long and didn't waste my time or folks who aren't in the know of Perry's bullshit.</p><p>A video essay that stays on message without getting long in the tooth is a lost art within itself.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Right, can we just give F.D. Signifier his flowers for a second? I feel like most video essays are just... long. Not informative, not interesting, and most just don't earn their length. This video did not feel like it was four hours long. I watched it all in one go like, hypnotized. Every single moment of the video was essential! Everything he puts down, he picks back up again! Finally we are eating good on YouTube!</p><p><strong>Isaiah:</strong> Me and my friend basically raced to text each other that the video finally dropped and finished it before it wound up getting temporarily taken down. We'd been waiting for that jawn for a minute and it didn't disappoint. Cynically, I always assume his videos have the same purpose as Black literature purposely placed on a table at the front of a predominantly white-owned bookstore as the kind of media that's more for educating the children of the chalk on Black existence than necessarily telling me some shit I don't already know. </p><p>And with contemporary video essays feeling like an exercise in filibustering a video into the double digit hours just to say a whole lotta nothing, I was a bit worried I'd get a bit of fluff from unc here too since I wasn't too hot on his Beyonce video. But you can really tell that he was in full force with this one, making sure to cover the whole history of Tyler Perry and his chokehold on both the entertainment industry he's carved out for himself and the hot plate he's guaranteed with older Black folks as charitably and brutally honest as necessary.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WORguByyH78?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="[The Boondocks] Tyler Perry - Supremacy of Black Hollywood"></iframe></figure><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Going back to the beginning of the video, you can really see the artfulness of it. I do remember, like Signifier, being in school and having white teachers show us "culturally relevant" movies that centered Black struggle and Black pain. I, too, tired of only ever seeing movies about Black slaves. I remember embarrassing a teacher who cast me, the only Black person in class, as a slave in a table read of something or other. All this then creates an environment for someone like Perry to exist--a filmmaker who, for better or for worse (it's for worse) shows the middle-class Black life as it is often lived.</p><p>I especially really loved Signifier's analysis of Black directors in the film industry. You need to serve two masters--white investors and audiences, and the Black as fuck story you want to tell. Yes, it is admirable to see that Perry can build his damn table by centering Black audiences. Too bad he is also an evil man!</p><p>By the end of the four hours, I really did feel like I "ate my whole plate." Thank you for those vegetables, Mr. Signifier sir.</p><p><strong>Isaiah:</strong> Yeah, I didn't know about the history between him and Spike Lee, a cornball in his own right, being the way it was where Lee rightfully called Perry out by all but saying buddy is sending us back but still having to bend the knee to the capital of it all. That, set against the black balling of Monique really hammered home the complex, "the devil you know" of capitalism and how even if not all folk are skin folk, you kinda have to play the game to get fed. Even if the game is from a person who holds his lack of a writer's room like a badge of honor of his auteurship being made of Teflon against oncoming bullets of valid criticism. But F.D. did the damn thing by acting like the meme of the soldier standing in front of the knives while we all sleep knowing more people get to see, as you said, that the emperor has no clothes.</p><div><p><strong>Gita:</strong> It's hard to talk about the failures of Black leaders—even when it's obvious that the emperor is nude as hell—because of the way that it can reflect back on the Black community. (I remember when white people found out about being light skinned and dark skinned, like, that is just not information that I want white people to have, I don't want them to have that ammo against us collectively.) But I think when it comes to parasites like Perry, that time is finally coming to an end. We are allowed to gatekeep the Perrys from building their empire on our backs without letting us have a seat at their own damn table.</p><p><strong>Isaiah: </strong>I'd prefer white folks get keyed in on things like the Tyler Perry as an industry machine and all the folly that comes with that over misusing lingo like gyatt as a noun every two weeks.</p></div>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/marathon-is-already-improving-on-arc-raiders-in-one-key-area-2000672901</link>
            <guid>1444273</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Marathon</em> has been <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-fans-mad-marathon-bluepoint-boycott-ps5-bungie-2000672040">playing catch-up</a> to <em>Arc Raiders</em> ever since both games debuted their first player tests last year. But Bungie’s extraction shooter finally seems to have moved ahead when it comes to fair play and exploits. The development team revealed that <em>Marathon</em> will have a strict one-strike ban policy when it comes to cheating, which is more than can be said for <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-review-extraction-loot-shooter-embark-2000642198"><em>Arc Raiders</em></a>.</p> <p>“Anyone found to be cheating will be permabanned from playing <em>Marathon</em> forever, no second chances,” Bungie wrote <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathonsecurity">in a new blog post</a> previewing the multiplayer shooter’s upcoming server slam on February 26. The rest of the post lays out the different features and systems <em>Marathon</em> uses to maintain network security and limit the kinds of exploits that could be deployed during matches.</p>

 <p>Bungie boasts a “new server authority model” that automatically rejects “invalid client actions” before they can impact other players’ experiences. “This protects the gameplay experience against exploits such as teleporting, unlimited ammo, or damage manipulation,” Bungie writes. There’s also a “fog of war” that limits what map information each player has access to so that player and item locations remain safe from “wall hacks” or “ESP cheats.”</p> <p>While “client-side security upgrades,” a telemetry “backend analysis system,” and getting your loot back if your game accidentally crashes or disconnects all sound great, the proof will be in how <em>Marathon</em> performs out in the wild. <a href="https://kotaku.com/bungie-cheat-lawsuit-destiny-2-aimjunkies-aimbot-1850140970"><em>Destiny 2</em></a> players have dealt with a range of cheating epidemics over the years, and even the most determined teams and processes don’t always get the job done.</p>

 <h2><em>Arc Raiders</em> is still dogged by complaints about rampant cheating</h2> <p>But one strike and you’re out for cheaters should be reassuring to people familiar with <em>Arc Raiders</em>‘ <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-patch-cheating-out-of-bounds-embark-2000661267">current cheating issues</a>. The current extraction shooter king implemented strict permabans back in January, but only for repeat offenders. “A three strikes progressive ban system is in the process of being implemented,” read the <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/patch-notes-1-13-0">patch notes</a> at the time. “Bans will progress from 30 days, to 60 and finally a permaban for repeat offenders.”</p>

 <p>The latest exploit du jour involves players spawning their own hatches <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-cheaters-are-now-spawning-their-own-hatches-to-escape-death-and-players-are-once-again-begging-embark-to-punish-cheating-more-the-fact-people-can-do-this-is-insane/">to escape death</a>. “I’ve seen mod menus and all sorts of hacks in games before but for some reason this is the most ridiculous shit to me,” says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ravr41/how_are_the_people_not_getting_perma_bans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-id="inline-link" data-url="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ravr41/how_are_the_people_not_getting_perma_bans/" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-hawk-tracked="hawklinks" data-mrf-link="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ravr41/how_are_the_people_not_getting_perma_bans/">one commenter</a> on Reddit. Fans have been begging for better exploit detection and harsher penalties for perpetrators, but so far<em> Arc Raiders</em> has been taking a concerted but more cautious approach to weeding out cheaters.</p> <p>The game’s also suffered from a range of <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-dup-glitch-hotfix-patch-1-15-2000667320">duplication glitches</a>, which is bad when a scarcity of resources is a key mechanic in your game. <em>Marathon</em> is preparing for that potential challenge as well. “We take your investment of time seriously,” Bungie wrote. “We will strive to keep your progress safe and protected from item duplication or other economic cheats.” While that may be true,<em> Marathon</em>‘s first duplication glitch feels less like a matter of if than when.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Bungie has issued a warning to anything thinking of cheating in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>: you will be permanently banned from the game, and there are no second chances.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathonsecurity" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>, the Sony-owned studio said anyone found to be cheating in its extraction shooter will be permabanned from playing Marathon forever, “no second chances.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Bungie acknowledged there may be flaws in its system, as there are in all systems, and so will have an appeals process in place to help with detection issues.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Tau Ceti IV is a dangerous world where death is certain,” Bungie began. “That said, we want you to know your deaths are due to your own mistakes or enemy outplays — not because your run was compromised by network issues, cheaters, or the hardware hosting your connection to the world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“No network or security model can guarantee perfection, but we are committed to protecting the Marathon competitive experience and ensuring everyone has their fair chance at exfiltrating with a backpack full of sweet loot.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To that end, Marathon dedicated servers are “fully authoritative” on key combat and looting actions, Bungie explained, which should help prevent cheating. Meanwhile, the ‘Fog of War’ system limits the regions of a map that individual player clients have knowledge of, hopefully limiting the effectiveness of wall hacks, ESP cheats, and loot revealers “Product security is never fully solved and we’ll continue to invest in our game security systems," Bungie stressed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the crucial subject of client security, Bungie said it includes both user-mode and kernel-mode components, but kept things vague — deliberately. “Game security is a never-ending arms war with bad actors,” Bungie said. “This means sharing details about methodologies for protecting our games can inform those bad actors how to defeat them. With that in mind, we hope this high-level snapshot gives you an idea of how we are addressing client security.” There is no mention of Bungie employing Secure Boot (along with TPM 2.0), which is officially required to play the latest Call of Duty games and last year’s Battlefield 6 on PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marathon will launch its ‘Server Slam’ event on February 26, during which all of Bungie’s security tools will be online. Bungie called on players to report cheaters if they encounter them. Marathon launches proper on March 5 across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bungie’s blog post on security comes as fellow extraction shooter Arc Raiders is embroiled with a war on cheaters itself — and developer Embark Studios has issued <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-says-players-who-used-recent-exploits-will-face-warnings-and-suspensions-starting-this-week">some strongly-worded statements of its own</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Embark Studios has laid out everything included in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders"><u>Arc Raiders</u></a> Shrouded Sky update, revealing a first look at two new Arc threats, the Surgeon Raider Deck, Dam Battleground map changes, and, yeah, you guessed it: beards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Information about the big February update was unveiled in <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/shrouded-sky-content-update" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a blog post</u></a> published on its official website. The message comes with more information about all of the new content set to be added tomorrow, February 24, and it even includes a proper trailer for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-shrouded-sky-trailer-teases-hurricane-map-condition-and-windy-gameplay-hazards"><u>the previously announced Hurricane map condition</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Shani is blindsided by a Hurricane that engulfs the Rust Belt with ferocious speed and unrelenting force,” an official description for Shrouded Sky says. “Raiders have been caught in the howling, gnashing winds, the Tubes are at risk of flooding, and rumors quickly spread of new ARC prowling the surface among the fog. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You are not cleared to leave in such conditions; between the low visibility, unsuitable equipment, and risk to the Tube systems, it’s just not worth the danger… but that’s just an invitation to a Raider.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the Hurricane blows in extra challenge for those who had just started to get comfortable with Embark’s rotating selection of Arc Raiders events, players should expect to brave more than just the weather. Two new unique Arcs, for example, can be found topside starting with Shrouded Sky: the Firefly and the Comet. The former is another drone-style enemy, but instead of firing light ammo or stun shots, this armored aerial pest spits fire from above. The latter is a ground, sphere enemy not unlike Pops and Fireballs that is said to calmly patrol the surface before smacking raiders with a “seismic boom.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/23/new-arc-firefly-comet-1771868422714.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Arc Raiders Threats in Shrouded Sky. Image courtesy Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another one of the headliners for the February content drop is a map update for Dam Battlegrounds. During a conversation with IGN, Embark CEO Patrick Söderlund spoke about the map, saying, "we know from data that's the map that people seem to gravitate mostly toward, that people like the most, but there's still things in there that I think the developers feel like we can improve." He teased that "all maps are going to get, most likely, touched," but in the case of Dam Battlegrounds, today's post tells players to expect a new high-value loot area called the Controlled Access Zone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As new Arc threats and existing enemies like the Rocketeer will no doubt continue sending Raiders back to Speranza, players should be happy to see there are some not-so-threatening additions coming in the next Arc Raiders update, too. The third Raider Deck, for example, comes with a Surgeon theme, with Embark also directing players to head to the in-game store to check out The Volare and Devotee cosmetic sets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those looking to dress up their survivors with a little something special will also be happy to find that facial hair has finally made its way to Speranza, too. All players can access the new Stubble cosmetic when the update launches, with a Full Beard option available to unlock via the Surgeon Deck. Stubble Beard and Thick Moustache options will also be purchasable in the store.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Arc Raiders - Shrouded Sky Update Images</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Arc Raiders launched October 30, 2025, and is keeping the ball rolling with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-gets-pve-focused-event-and-new-rewards-as-embark-squashes-duplication-bug-in-new-update"><u>smaller, weekly updates</u></a> alongside the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-big-arc-raiders-update-of-2026-adds-solo-vs-squads-matchmaking-bird-city-and-more-tomorrow"><u>more substantial monthly updates</u></a>.

              <p>Online-only live-service co-op game <em>King of Meat</em> launched last fall. About four months later, the game announced that its servers would be shutting off in April. This has become a very familiar story in the game industry.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/king-meat-glowmade-layoffs-keighley-mrbeast-trailer-2000651722"><em>King of Meat</em></a> launched on October 31, 2025, and cost $30. In the lead-up to the launch of the Amazon-published game, it got a flashy (and likely very expensive) <a href="https://youtu.be/iT5ilwECdrA?t=3000">animated trailer</a> at Gamescom Opening Night Live in August 2024. There was even a (also likely expensive) promotional video from MrBeast featuring content creators playing <em>King of Meat</em> in a big tournament. Reportedly, leadership at Glowmade, the studio behind the game, was aiming for around 100,000 concurrent players on Steam at launch. It never exceeded more than <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1926980/charts/">400</a> according to SteamDB and never cracked 1,000 across consoles and PC. Shocking nobody, layoffs were planned in late December. Now, the game is shutting down.</p>  <p><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1926980/announcements/detail/527620350145462992/">On February 23,&nbsp; Amazon announced</a> that <em>King of Meat</em>‘s servers will shut off for good on April 9, 2026 in a post titled “The Future of <em>King of Meat.”</em></p>

 <p><wbr>“Despite the creativity and innovation Glowmade brought to <em>King of Meat,</em> the game has unfortunately not found the audience we hoped for,” said the post. “As a result, we have made the difficult decision to conclude our investment in the game, and <em>King of Mea</em>t’s servers will close on April 9, 2026. Players will be able to access and play all existing content until then, so we encourage you to enjoy your remaining time in the game with your fellow Contenders.”</p> <p>All players who purchased <em>King of Meat</em> will receive a full refund “in the coming weeks,” according to the post announcing the game’s demise.</p> <p><wbr>“We want to sincerely thank every player who supported <em>King of Meat</em> and the wonderful community that formed around it,” said Amazon. “Your enthusiasm, imagination, and feedback have meant the world to us and to the team at Glowmade. We’re grateful for Glowmade’s partnership and passion throughout this journey and wish them continued success in the future.”</p> <h2>Stop trying to force people to play more live-service games</h2> <p>This is far from the first live-service game that’s announced a shutdown over the last few years. In fact, the odds are high that if a studio launches an online-only live-service game, it will be dead in about a year or less nowadays. We <a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-shutting-down-closing-servers-refunds-ps5-1851638566">famously saw that with <em>Concord</em> in 2024,</a> which was such a disastrous launch that it died in less than two weeks and torpedoed Sony’s ongoing live-service game efforts, likely leading to canceled projects and studio closures as PlayStation reevaluated its strategy. <a href="https://kotaku.com/sonys-new-live-service-game-is-coming-at-just-the-worst-possible-time-2000666078">It hasn’t given up entirely, though.</a></p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonys-ps5-era-studio-acquisition-spree-has-been-a-disaster-2000671404">But Sony isn’t alone in its desperate, messy push for forever games that can print money</a>. Amazon is shutting down its once-popular MMO <em>New World</em>, and before that, killed online shooter <em>Crucible</em>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/troubled-amazon-shooter-crucible-is-shutting-down-1845330651">a game that I can almost bet nobody remembers in 2026</a>. You could make a pretty long list of all the live-service and other online games that have died in recent years. <a href="https://kotaku.com/dead-games-2023-delisted-servers-offline-1850083031">Actually, we have done that.</a> It just keeps happening. And yet, publishers keep investing a lot of money and resources into chasing <em>Fortnite</em> and other live-service hits, despite being surrounded by a graveyard of past attempts. <a href="https://kotaku.com/most-playstation-5-owners-have-been-playing-the-same-games-since-2022-2000672009">And the few big winners there are these days came out years ago, and everyone is still playing them.</a></p>

 <p>Hopefully, the folks at Glowmade can bounce back, along with all other affected devs, and the industry stops trying to make 500 more live-service games nobody clearly wants. Yes, <em>Helldivers 2</em> succeeded. There are rare exceptions, sure. But odds are your in-development live-service project won’t be so lucky.<wbr><wbr></p>

<p>King of Meat has announced it will shut down in April. The game was released less than 6 months ago.</p>



<p>An <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/amazon-games/" id="52194">Amazon Games</a> release, the dungeon-crawler x action-brawler hybrid <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/king-of-meat/" id="3030">King of Meat</a>, launched in October 2025. It was a rough launch, described as “disastrous.” Two months after the game’s launch, several developers at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/glowmade/" id="3031">Glowmade</a>, the game’s development studio, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/king-of-meat-glowmade-layoffs/" id="162870">were laid off</a>.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming exclusively reported that leadership hoped the game would reach a concurrent player count of at least 100,000. As of this writing, there are 11 concurrent players on Steam, and the game’s all-time concurrent player peak was 320 on November 15. </p>



<p>They’d even put up a multi-million-dollar video from Mr. Beast’s gaming YouTube channel, featuring a custom set and several content creators. They also had custom-wrapped buses in London to market the game, and were even looking at an animated TV pilot.</p>



<p>The game has announced it will be shutting down, and players will receive a full refund.</p>







<h2 id="h-king-of-meat-plans-to-shut-servers-down-in-early-april">King of Meat Plans to Shut Servers Down in Early April</h2>



<p>King of Meat’s servers will shut down on April 9, meaning the game will be offline just a few days past the 6-month mark.</p>



<p>The development studio thanked players who gave the game a chance, but ultimately admitted the game did not find the audience it was looking for. </p>



<p>“King of Meat, the game has unfortunately not found the audience we hoped for. As a result, we have made the difficult decision to conclude our investment in the game, and King of Meat’s servers will close on April 9, 2026,” <a href="https://www.kingofmeat.com/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the statement</a> reads.</p>
