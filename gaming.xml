laptop. The 15.6-inch LCD screen has a 144Hz refresh rate and Nvidia's G-Sync adaptive frame rate tech. It has a full 100% standard RGB color gamut, which often isn't the case with gaming laptops in this price range. It offers 300 nits brightness and has an anti-glare coating.</p><p>The GeForce RTX 5050 GPU is an entry-level graphics card--at least when compared to the rest of Nvidia's 50 Series lineup. It offers nice improvements compared to the RTX 4050, but it's not quite as good as the RTX 4060. Don't expect to play the latest AAA games on high settings, but you can play many games in 1080p at 60fps thanks DLSS upscaling. If you want to connect your laptop to a monitor for 1440p or 4K gaming, you will need to look elsewhere; the 5050 is only suitable for 1080p.</p><p>The Intel Core i5-13450HX is an entry-level processor with 10 CPU cores and 16 threads. It has a base clock speed of 3.4GHz and can boost to 4.6GHz.</p><p>Like most gaming laptops that retail for around $1,000, the Lenovo LOQ comes with 16GB of DDR5 RAM. It has two memory slots and can be upgraded to 32GB (16GB in each slot).</p><p>When it comes to PC gaming, 512GB of storage space really isn't a lot these days, especially if you play a lot of AAA games and online multiplayer titles with frequent updates.

                <p>Embark Studios is clearly keen to keep building on the success of its latest game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>. The extraction shooter, which just launched to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-has-already-broken-a-steam-concurrent-players-record-for-extraction-shooters/1100-6535848/" data-ref-id="1100-6535848">biggest player numbers</a> on Steam for the niche genre, is already growing and now there's a roadmap outlining its trajectory.</p><p>Arc Raiders' roadmap provides a glimpse at the months ahead for the fresh third-person shooter on the market. As is typically the case, the live-service game will be receiving frequent updates fine-tuning the experience, ironing out any kinks, and steadily rolling out new cosmetics, feats and trials, as well as map conditions that should liven the playing field.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4594476-arcraidersroadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594476" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4594476-arcraidersroadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594476"></a><figcaption>Arc Raiders roadmap for the next several months.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4594476-arcraidersroadmap.jpg"></figure><p>The most exciting news though has to do with two updates coming in November and December, respectively. The first is dubbed North Line, and it will feature an entirely new map called Stella Montis, bringing Arc Raiders' map count to five. North Line will also introduce a new community unlock event--these are typically goals and challenges for the entire game's community to work towards in order to unlock a reward--as well as equipment and quests. There will even be two new Arcs, the game's robotic enemies which tower over players, called the Matriarch and Shredder.</p><p>Just a month later in December, another update called Cold Snap will be dropping just in time for the brisk winter holidays. As the name suggests, a new arctic map condition will arrive in the game as well as a complementary event called Flickering Flames. I reckon players should start preparing to fight one another in order to stay warm come December.</p><p>Both updates will also let players rediscover "what was lost in expanded Quests," according to Embark's announcement post. Only the Cold Snap update in December will pack in a Raider Deck though, Arc Raiders' rendition of a battle pass.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="11c4c6604f2bf"><a title="Animal Crossing Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/11c4c6604f2bf/animal-crossing-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>I <em>adore</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>. I know, I know, such a hot take puts me in a niche of... about 98% of people that read this site, but what I mean to say is that when the announcement of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> and the 3.0 update were announced yesterday, I was about as excited as Blathers when you deliver him a fourth Fossil in one day. That's <em>very excited</em>.</p>
<p>I spent the evening grinning about the return of Sonny Resetti, the Mineru Villager (!!), all of the design potential that comes with the Hotel Resort, and bulk crafting! I was even pretty pleased with the Switch 2-specific features like Mouse Mode and GameChat, perhaps not quite as big as the additions that the 3.0 update will provide, but a nice little bonus for four quid.</p>
<p>But then, as I settled into bed after an evening of counting the days until 15th January (77 today, for those interested), I was met with a little pang of worry. "If the New Horizons Switch 2 Edition is arriving with this much pomp," I thought to myself, "it's going to be <em>years</em> until we get a new Animal Crossing!"</p>
<figure data-uuid="d7a897ef76bd6"><a title="Animal Crossing Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d7a897ef76bd6/animal-crossing-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>If only we could fast forward to the next entry, eh? — <em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This isn't to say I'm particularly keen to move on from New Horizons — if those lockdown months taught me anything, it was that I could play this game forever (given the time) — but I realised that a lot of my Switch 2 excitement was built on seeing what comes next. I've already <em>played</em> New Horizons, and no amount of home storage expansion is going to feel as fresh as a new entry.</p>
<p>I'm starting to see the Nintendo Switch 2 Editions as a big ol' placeholder in Nintendo's release schedule. It's one of those 'we're not quite ready to show you what's next, so here's something familiar to keep you busy in the meantime' moments that we're becoming increasingly well acquainted with. Surely a brand new game would be a much better prospect for console sales?</p>
<p>It was a similar story on Switch. Rather than give us a new Mario Kart, we got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>; instead of a new 3D Mario, we got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_world_plus_bowsers_fury">Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury</a>. They're great games, no doubt, but they're also a telltale sign of 'you're years away from a new entry, mate'.</p>
<p>And I don't want that for Animal Crossing. New Horizons launched over five years ago *<em>gulp</em>*, and while that's hardly a <em>long</em> wait between series entries, the arrival of the Switch 2 Edition makes me think that Nintendo could easily make us wait another five.Throw in some unexpected content updates a few years down the line to sweeten the deal, à la MK8D's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/mario_kart_8_deluxe_booster_course_pass">Booster Course Pass</a>, and we might end up waiting even longer, forever convinced that the 2020 game is delivering something new.</p>

<p>I have no idea where we go next after New Horizons, but I thought the same thing after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/animal_crossing_new_leaf">New Leaf</a>, and look where that left us! All the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition does is delay the next entry. I'll jump back into ACNH and have a wonderful time doing so, but it won't capture the magic of terraforming your island the first time, will it?</p>
<p>More pressingly, putting my industry cap on for a second, Animal Crossing is a system seller. Unless Nintendo has another global pandemic up its sleeve, I can't imagine that a new series entry would hit the 48 million sales that New Horizons mustered, but people would <em>flock</em> to it, all the same. In a launch year that's been criticised for its re-releases, wouldn't 'Animal Crossing: Newer Horizons' be the big push to go out and nab a Switch 2?</p>
<p>It all feels like many of the same concerns that I've had with the console in general these past few months. I think the year-one lineup is fantastic, but I'm fortunate because I <em>like</em> most of the games that are getting re-released. No amount of graphical upgrades or Mouse Mode inclusions can overshadow the fact that these are games that I, and many other people, have played before, some of them just a few years ago.</p>
<p>Of course, this is how console launches work these days, and compared to the Xbox Series or the PS5, the Switch 2 is already off to a flying start as far as its software is concerned.</p>
<p>I also need to remind myself that the past four months haven't been wall-to-wall NS2 Editions. In terms of exclusives, we've had <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a>. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors</a> are right around the corner, then we've got new Switch 2 entries for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yoshi-and-the-mysterious-book">Yoshi</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/splatoon-raiders">Splatoon</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fire-emblem-fortunes-weave">Fire Emblem</a> already lined up for 2026. You compare that to the PS5's exclusives list for its first couple of years, and it's a firm reminder that we're eating good!</p>

<p>But I think we're still missing the real big hitter. The Switch 2 Editions of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">BOTW</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">TOTK</a> seemed like a fair stand-in for a new entry in that series (we have had two newbies in the past two years, to be fair), Donkey Kong Bananza feels like the obvious substitute for a 3D Mario, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Mario Wonder + Meetup in Bellabel Park</a> will have us covered on the 2D front soon enough, too.</p>
<p>I was hoping that Animal Crossing would be the biggie to make everyone go, "Yes, now I <em>need</em> a Switch 2", but I fear that January's re-release is a sign that we still have a long wait ahead of us before we can see what Newer Horizons will look like.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Embark Studios just released its second major title, ARC Raiders, which launched yesterday and made quite the splash, <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-surpasses-200k-concurrent-players-on-steam-at-launch/">achieving over 250K concurrent players on Steam</a>, making it the biggest launch for an extraction shooter on the platform, and it also surpassed Embark's other major title, The Finals, for its concurrent launch numbers on Steam.</p>



<p>Keeping up with the pace of modern-day live service games, Embark Studios has no intention of slowing down and followed up yesterday's stellar launch with the reveal of the game's roadmap for the remainder of 2025.</p>



<p>There are no specific release dates around when the next set of major updates are coming, but it does tell us that we can expect two major updates for the rest of the year, one in November and one in December. Both include new quests and community events, though only the November update includes a new map and new ARC machines for players to combat.</p>



<p>The December update adds Snowfall as a new map condition to fit the holiday mood, a new expedition, and a new raider deck. </p>



<figure><figcaption><em>ARC Raiders 2025 roadmap. Image credit: Embark Studios</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>"<em>We are so thankful to have you on this journey with us,</em>" Embark Studio <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/2025-roadmap/">writes on its website in its roadmap blog post</a>, "<em>and we will continue to refine and grow the game with your feedback in mind. Keep your eyes on the horizon. This is only the beginning of what is in store for ARC Raiders</em>."</p>



<p>Besides the roadmap shown off today, Embark Studios has also already put out the first hotfix for the game, which was intended to fix some server issues and animation issues. Though overall, yesterday (and so far today), has gone on without major reports about the servers being broken or players waiting in long queues. For an indie team making online multiplayer games, that's an impressive feat on its own.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/fortnite-sidekicks-cute-pets-follow-around-can-only-be-customized-once/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-sidekicks-are-cute-pets-that-follow-you-around-but-can-only-be-customized-once-unless-you-buy-them-again.1340638/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Epic Games has introduced a new category of cosmetics called Fortnite Sidekicks. They're essentially pets that follow the player around in various modes, including Battle Royale, <a href="https://wccftech.com/lego-fortnite-gets-launch-of-new-game-and-major-content-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Fortnite</a>, Save the World, Fortnite Festival (though they'll remain backstage), and even user-made experiences (though only if the creator has enabled them).</p>



<p>They won't provide any gameplay advantages, so their only real perk is looking cute. They do, however, react to the surrounding world, and players can interact with them through special Sidekick Emotes. The first one to be introduced to the game is Peels, a 'banana dog', which will be available to be unlocked via the Battle Pass starting tomorrow. Bonesy (which will be granted to owners of the Bonesy Back Bling), Spike, and Lil’ Raptor will go live next Friday, and Epic also teased that there will soon be something for the many cat lovers out there.</p>



<p>It sounds like yet another idea that will earn Epic a lot of money, especially because they are locking repeated customization beyond multiple purchases of the same pet. That's right: you may only customize the physical traits of Fortnite Sidekicks once. If you purchase it multiple times, you can give it separate Appearances, which must be unique (duplicate Appearances are not allowed). </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Fortnite Sidekicks | Tutorial Video" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1N0m9H13pGM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Needless to say, some Fortnite players have already criticized this choice as a blatant way to extract more money from the user base. It is especially lamentable, since younger players may well be among the most interested in this kind of cosmetic customization. That said, Epic does allow you to change the Sidekick's name and accessories at any time, and you can also earn hats and hoodies by hanging out with your pet and using your Sidekick Points.</p>



<p>The current Fortnite season, Shock 'N Awesome, will end tomorrow at 8:30 AM Pacific Time/11:30 AM Eastern Time/4:30 PM Central European Time. The downtime is expected to last around two to three hours, after which Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 5, which is known to be themed around The Simpsons, will go live.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/poppy-playtime-chapter-5-teaser-2025/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The viral horror sensation Poppy Playtime is back with Chapter 5 and, in honor of Halloween, a new teaser is out. Furthermore, we now know some more on what to expect from the next chapter in the series.</p>



<p>Mascot Horror has been at the forefront of the indie scene for quite some time. Starting with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/five-nights-at-freddys-2-megan-fox-matpat-cast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Five Nights at Freddy’s</a>, the genre has developed into an almost foolproof shot to success. Games like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-shown-at-summer-game-fest-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Choo-Choo Charlie</a>, Indigo Park, and Garten of BanBan have rose in popularity from following FNAF’s footsteps. One such series, Mob Entertainment’s Poppy Playtime, has been one of the bigger successes. With recognizable characters like Huggy Wuggy, Doey, and CatNap, fans worldwide have been anticipating the next chapter of the franchise. Fortunately, just in time for Halloween, we got a new teaser and some plot to go with it.</p>



<h2 id="h-meet-the-puppetmaster-in-poppy-playtime-chapter-5-s-newest-trailer">Meet the Puppetmaster in Poppy Playtime: Chapter 5’s Newest Trailer</h2>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 - Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NGSn5cY0o3k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Mob Entertainment has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGSn5cY0o3k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">released a new trailer</a> for <strong>Poppy Playtime: Chapter 5</strong>. While the video isn’t long, lasting less than a minute, it’s certain to make fans go nuts with theories and the like. There’s a lot to go off of, too, as specific locations like a science lab are shown along with mysterious goop and a burning Poppy billboard. Unfortunately, <strong>no pricing or release date was announced</strong>, though the game is <strong>now available for wishlisting</strong> on <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbWlYYXJZYlJyb0NpWEF3X1dGUG5IeHRKckJqZ3xBQ3Jtc0tsTDBLdTh3TVpvdEJ3X20xRE1QWGdiVU9sR2hlQW5jS2dic29pNTNXdDhLNmtIaFRzSHVvMGMxSFRweFNDOU5NNF9Nd1hDYlhocjlVT3RMTTJzeDBXN3FPckRYcTEyeEZ3QnpMa2dlUGZFRWJ4YWdwcw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fhuggywug.co%2F4oK8fPx&amp;v=NGSn5cY0o3k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a> </strong>and the <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbUQ4eWZjbUNuWFVjbUxDY1o0b0pCeENRU3BuQXxBQ3Jtc0tsNkxVNzdqa1pFbllxV3ByR1hKZmFvVVdKSWFkSjl5RXF1NjUzd1JFZGtnLWhMMUV4UlhCaEZ4QjJIZ3YwaUtUenR4bFhiOGlhcWNQX2pxQXRkMEdBdGFDWXdyNGd5ZEN4Y3JjTEgwWGNrWl9WMHhVMA&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fhuggywug.co%2F4qswKSW&amp;v=NGSn5cY0o3k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Epic Games Store</a></strong>.</p>



<p>However, we do know some information regarding the game’s plot. The game takes place after the events of Chapter 4. Mob Entertainment states on the official Steam page,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“In Poppy Playtime: Chapter 5, players must prepare to face off against the deadly puppetmaster behind the horrifying events of Playtime Co. Solve devious puzzles and overcome dangerous obstacles as the true rotten heart at the center of Playtime Co. draws nearer. Traverse this new realm of shadows in a fight for survival (and the truth) with Playtime’s security system Huggy Wuggy in hot pursuit and separated from your only allies. Will you finally end this nightmare, or fall victim to the puppet master’s twisted madness?”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If Chapter 5 is as big as previous entries, we may see Poppy Playtime get back into the spotlight once again. Even if you haven’t played any games in the series, it’s sure to deliver some scares galore. Given <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnitemares-2025-features-largest-ever-collabs-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite added Poppy Playtime</a> to its Fortnitemares this year, it’s a pretty good time to get into the series and an even better time to be a fan.</p>

                <p>Platinum Games' Bayonetta made her North American debut in 2010 and she quickly became a fan-favorite character. And what's not to love? She's a shapeshifting witch who's very good at gunplay. And she almost never appears without her glasses, as insisted upon by her creator, Hideki Kamiya.</p><p>Earlier this week, a fan on <a href="https://twitter.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/1983682508341571921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1983682508341571921%7Ctwgr%5E3034485e9a8241d0ba688a86118f8d542597acdd%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fautomaton-media.com%2Fen%2Fnews%2Fthe-glasses-stay-on-bayonettas-most-iconic-design-feature-was-in-danger-of-being-removed-by-publishers-but-hideki-kamiya-refused-to-compromise%2F" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a> asked Kamiya about a meme-worthy quote he was alleged to have said: "Bayonetta’s glasses are just like her underwear." Via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/the-glasses-stay-on-bayonettas-most-iconic-design-feature-was-in-danger-of-being-removed-by-publishers-but-hideki-kamiya-refused-to-compromise/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>, Kamiya attributed the quote to animation director Yuji Shimomura, who handled the game's cinematics. Kamiya also indicated that he agreed with Shimomura that Bayonetta should never be without her glasses.</p><p>"When we were designing Bayonetta, our clients requested us to take off her glasses, and it's true that I kept rejecting their proposals," recalled Kamiya. "But it's also true that, on a separate occasion, Mr. Shimomura, who produced the cinematics, said 'Bayonetta's glasses are just like her underwear--do not take them off at any cost.'"</p><p>Mari Shimazaki--the character designer of Bayonetta--posted <a href="https://twitter.com/MariShimazaki/status/1984088379362054294?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1984088379362054294%7Ctwgr%5E3034485e9a8241d0ba688a86118f8d542597acdd%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fautomaton-media.com%2Fen%2Fnews%2Fthe-glasses-stay-on-bayonettas-most-iconic-design-feature-was-in-danger-of-being-removed-by-publishers-but-hideki-kamiya-refused-to-compromise%2F" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a response of her own</a> on X, and noted that Kamiya came up with Bayonetta's glasses at the earliest stages of her creation.</p><p>"During the development of Bayonetta 1, when I was drawing up rough sketches of the character design, Kamiya appeared behind me out of nowhere and whispered: 'Give her glasses.' That's how everything started. Later, whenever I was sketching rough designs for Bayonetta, he'd always come up to me saying, 'Why don’t you give her glasses?' So it became a habit for me to always have a glasses layer ready in my designs. While the process of finalizing designs was sometimes a bumpy ride, I always had the glasses layer on standby."</p><p>Thus far in the games, Bayonetta has only allowed a single person to see her without her glasses. She even wears them during the 2023 prequel game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/bayonetta-origins-cereza-and-the-lost-demon-malice-in-wonderland/1900-6418045/" data-ref-id="1900-6418045">Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon</a>.</p><p>Bayonetta 3 came out in 2022, and Kamiya subsequently hinted at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bayonetta-4-is-already-in-the-works-kamiya-announces/1100-6509360/" data-ref-id="1100-6509360">Bayonetta 4</a>. However, Kamiya left Platinum Games in 2023, and subsequently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bayonetta-creator-hideki-kamiya-says-his-next-game-will-be-one-only-he-can-make/1100-6519976/" data-ref-id="1100-6519976">expressed his desire to make his own games</a>. The status of Bayonetta 4 is currently unknown, with Kamiya busy on Okami 2.</p>

Fortnite caps meaningful rewards around level 200, and higher levels don’t grant extra items, bonuses, or skill advantages. The main payoff is appearing on a <a href="https://fortnite.gg/stats" rel="nofollow ">leaderboard</a> and having something to brag about--though even that isn’t respectable. Terns also admitted that most of their progress came from playing against bots rather than real players.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/TernsCheese/status/1983319212446888292" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">22+ hours a day<br>82 days<br>7,000 levels<br>After a LOT of grinding, I've finally reached my goal and if I'm correct, the only grinder to ever reach level 7,000 legitimately without glitches or account sharing. Thank you for all your support. 🧡 <a href="https://t.co/Ap7qoiT1R1" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/Ap7qoiT1R1</a></p>  — Terns (@TernsCheese) <a href="https://twitter.com/TernsCheese/status/1983319212446888292?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 28, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">"I mostly played Reload this season to get my levels," they told GameSpot. "I used 'bot lobbies,' which are an Epic-supported thing, where every enemy in your game is an AI player and it is easier to kill."</p><p dir="ltr">Terns’ post was met with ridicule across social media, with many users questioning how anyone could dedicate that much time to anything, let alone a single season of Fortnite.</p><p dir="ltr">"That’s honestly pathetic," one commenter <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteBattleRoyale/comments/1oiujbr/comment/nlye4ib/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="nofollow ">wrote</a>. "Playing nearly three months with no sleep just to say no one has played as much Fortnite as you ... this is just grinding the same thing for weeks making your brain go numb so a bunch of 12-year-olds can go 'woah.'"</p><p dir="ltr">According to Terns, the upper ranks of Fortnite’s leveling leaderboards are often dominated by players who use exploits to boost their stats.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4594461-screenshot2025-10-31095044.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594461" data-ratio="0.4568661971831" data-width="1136" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4594461-screenshot2025-10-31095044.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594461"></a><figcaption>These levels will reset at the end of the season.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4594461-screenshot2025-10-31095044.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Others are cheating to grind, and it’s mostly the same few people every time," they said. "There are teams and clans of glitchers who cheat and try to ruin leaderboards and the integrity of grinding every season."</p><p dir="ltr">Epic Games occasionally patches these exploits, but Terns says cheaters quickly adapt. Their drive came from a small Discord community of like-minded players who talk about leveling up for hours on end.</p><p dir="ltr">"I’m mainly motivated by talking to other grinders in my own Discord server," they said. "We often sit in voice chats together, laughing and discussing XP all day."</p><p dir="ltr">We're fastly approaching the 10-year anniversary of the launch of Fortnite battle royale and Epic's creation is still gripping players like Terns. It helps that the gaming supergiant continues to update the game with content like a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-simpsons-live-event-start-time-rewards-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6535750/" data-ref-id="1100-6535750">Simpsons-themed</a> season.</p><p dir="ltr">Terns has been playing Fortnite since Chapter 1 Season 9 and has spent years grinding for levels. After hundreds of hours and nearly sleepless nights, they've reached a level that few players--or anyone else--should pursue again.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Halo: Campaign Evolved vs Halo Combat Evolved Side by Side Graphics Comparison</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Halo Leaks didn't have more details about the remakes to offer, but stated Halo Studios would be saving the return of the franchise's iconic multiplayer for Halo 7.</p><p dir="ltr">Halo: Campaign Evolved.when it launches in 2026, will be the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-is-coming-to-playstation-for-the-first-time/1100-6535696/" data-ref-id="1100-6535696">Halo franchise's first time on PlayStation</a>, where it will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-games-will-be-on-playstation-going-forward-says-microsoft/1100-6535712/" data-ref-id="1100-6535712">continue to be released going forward</a>. If the goal of Microsoft and Halo Studios is to introduce a whole new audience and generation to Halo, starting with Combat Evolved and going through the entire original trilogy does make sense. Xbox social marketing manager Josh Stein said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-on-ps5-is-a-win-for-the-future-of-halo-dev-says/1100-6535726/" data-ref-id="1100-6535726">Halo arriving on PS5</a> "is a win for the future of Halo and those that love it, new and old."</p><p dir="ltr">Remasters aren't exactly new for the Halo franchise. Halo: Combat Evolved received its first visual remaster in 2011, and Halo 2 was remastered in 2014 as part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-the-master-chief-collection/" data-ref-id="5000-283982">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a>. Halo 3 has never been remastered or remade, making it a prime candidate for receiving a remake similar to Campaign Evolved.</p><p dir="ltr">Given that Halo: Campaign Evolved isn't out until sometime next year, it will likely still be a while before Halo Studios makes any official announcements about a Halo 2 or Halo 3 remake. In the meantime, some of the developers on the original Halo have shared their own opinions on Campaign Evolved. Master Chief creator Marcus Lehto said the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-remake-warms-my-heart-original-dev-says/1100-6535722/" data-ref-id="1100-6535722">Halo remake "warms my heart,"</a> while another former <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-halo-developer-slams-campaign-evolveds-changes/1100-6535720/" data-ref-id="1100-6535720">Halo dev slammed some of the remake's changes</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Europa Universalis V starts as it means to go on, dropping you into its recreation of the late Middle Ages just as England and France embark on their Hundred Years’ War and then as the Black Death washes through Europe. To that backdrop, whatever nation you choose to play as is going to have a pretty rough time of it early on, but that just breeds opportunity through the 500 years of human history this ambitious game looks to portray.</p>
<p><iframe title="Here's Everything You Need To Know Before You Unpause Europa Universalis V" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iA0cMW6QjDY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>But who do you choose to play as? If you’re coming from EU4, chances are you’ve already got a good idea, but for new players (or for the terminally indecisive) Paradox has a few handy suggestions, leaning into particular playstyles, such as the initially more expansionist tone of Hungary, the political focus of Norway, or the burgeoning trading nation of Holland. Unless you click it away, you’ll find yourself in a tailored opening experience with guiding tutorials through some of the key pillars and concepts within the game, and building certain mission paths.</p>


<p>There’s no getting away from just how dense Europa Universalis V remains, and it doesn’t help that some of the suggestions in the tutorial and the rigidity of the subsequent missions feel like they’re actively hindering your potential. That’s especially true of goals that target improvements, such as adding four buildings to your capital or increasing Control through a region –&nbsp;if you’ve already pushed those metrics quite high, it makes that mission tree more arduous than it should be. You can’t do multiple mission trees at once, and you lose progress if you switch to another.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the foundational work that Paradox has put in with the nested tooltips, the in-game search, and encyclopaedia all go a long way to helping pick up the slack… mostly. There’s still plenty of times where it won’t be quite clear why you can’t build that particular building just yet, or there’s a new term that your Renaissance Googling won’t quite dredge up, or maybe you’ve just found a search bar in the wrong section… But you’re in this for the long haul, and like a spotty 16-year old who’s been hurriedly handed a crown and told to go make an heir, you’ll figure it out – OK, that’s a bit more <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/08/31/crusader-kings-iii-review/">Crusader Kings</a> than Europa Universalis, but you know what I mean.</p>


<p>Even as a series veteran, there’s plenty of new, returning, and modified concepts to get to grips with. Trade, for example, now hinges on a system of established markets to funnel all of a region’s imports, exports, resources, and production through – this isn’t based on nations, but literally the proximity and influence of the markets themselves. You can happily use the established flow of trade through the world to flog your wares and feed your economy, but there’s also benefits to being in control, and so you can make the investment to found a market of your own to try and grow your stature.</p>
<p>All of that trade is, of course, built off the backs of your people, your “pops”, and the provinces they inhabit. This is the real lifeblood of your nation, with each province (and there’s so many more vs. EU4) having a key resource assigned that can be gathered, mined, hunted, and farmed through an RGO (the very technically correct Resource Gathering Operation), alongside whatever buildings you’re able to construct for your town, city, or countryside. Pops are your units, each with their key culture, religion, and social position, needs, and preferences. Peasants are at the bottom rung, below Labourers, the increasingly wealthy Burghers, then the Nobility and the Aristocracy, with religious leaders having their own special place alongside, each represented by an Estate in your government. You need people of the right class to work the specific jobs, and so there’s some social mobility here even early on, but as you progress through the ages, that grows and shifts.</p>

<p>You are, in some ways, as much at the whims of the pops, as they are to your desires to reshape your nation along twelve Societal Values scales. You might want to build up the cities with tons of growing industries and technological advances, but people really don’t like change, whether that’s the nobility wanting to maintain all their power and serfs, or country folk not wanting everything to be so centralised around stinky towns. There’s a constant push and pull to societal change, as you need to appease each Estate by giving them privileges to give nuggets of power and influence in exchange for enabling your Reforms. On a smaller scale, individual pops can be dissatisfied, and you need to maintain stability, using this as a currency to enact change. Some of that can come from buildings, but there’s also tasking your Cabinet with tipping the balance in a particular category, making choices at key junctures, and enacting laws as their concepts become available. It’s always handy to have a fair amount of Crown Power to push this through.</p>
<p>Another key metric is Control, an indication of how “close” your provinces are to your centre of power –&nbsp;a bit like those mud farmers in Monty Python not knowing who their king is. It’s vital for you to be able to dredge up taxes and manpower for your military, as lower control drops your reach in a province. It’s simple, and it’s clear, and the two simplest ways to improve it are to build roads and use your Cabinet to increase control in a region, but there’s other ways to boost it as well.</p>

<p>Given the 500 year span of the campaign, there’s an awful lot of development of cultures, ideas and technology, and this is broken down into six distinct ages. Each of these has three core concepts that need to reach your borders, slowly spreading across the world from their point of origin, and then needing you to invest in that category before you can start to research – this costs more, the lower nascent awareness your pops have. The tech trees are big and broad, branching out from an initial innovation to a bunch of Advances, and the UI for this is a massively zoomed out sideways scrolling mess, but it’s conceptually a good way to gate and reveal each age’s advances. The sticking plaster is that there’s also a list of available Advances, that you can search for a particular thing you need and queue up the whole chain, and just offload to an AI manager.</p>
<p>And you can do that a lot in this game. AI has been laced into so many aspects of Europa Universalis V that you can almost put the game in autopilot to run itself but, really, I appreciate that this is present, it feels like it does a competent job, and I can always dive in and tinker as well. It allows trading to be massively granular, making deals with two decimal points for market needs while I just pop in to maybe set out some bigger ones. It’s a great tool both for beginners and for removing some of the busywork, and it can be applied as specifically or as broadly as you like.</p>
<p>With such an early start date to EU5, this really pushes the colonialist expansion side of a campaign much further. Depending on the nation that you choose to play as – I went with Holland for an economic play mainly – this can be your opportunity to really spread your wings when you’ve got major powers like France and England greedily gobbling up territory and vassals right next to you. The thing it, this is now tens of hours into the game, and if you’re a bit pigeonholed that can lead to long stretches of waiting.</p>

<p>So what to do but to lash out with some good old fashioned wars? I like the way that wars and combat are balanced in EU5. The tangle of alliances and defensive pacts can keep a lot of excessive aggression in check, and when fighting does break out, the AI is fairly smart in how it attacks you and uses multiple armies –&nbsp;though you can still outwit them if they get hung up on long sieges. Armies are arranged into three channels –&nbsp;a centre and two flanks –&nbsp;and you can toy with this a little to gain an advantage before combat begins.</p>
<p>All of this review, and I’ve barely scratched the surface of many of EU5’s depths and breadths. There’s an impressive amount in this game – the number of nations, cultural tweaks and world events are huge – and the core workings are very capable to encapsulating so much of this. I’ve no doubt that there’s balancing and tweaking that will occur once the game is in the hands of the masses, and the more overpowered and underpowered nations and playstyles will be brought into line.</p>
<p>But a final, special note for the presentation of this game. Visually, this is a nice evolution of Paradox’s Clausewitz Engine: there’s the pleasing way that towns and cities sprawl, how the overlay flattens the map and recedes, and the UI is pleasingly textured and thematic… but it’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLdEOqfEouw">Håkan Glänte’s soundtrack</a> that will burrow its way into your mind. It certainly leans toward the breadth of later classical music eras, but folds earlier instrumentation and styles into the mix, and recalls motifs from previous games as well. Overture II: The Odyssey swells with optimism, Pain Is Salvation boasts rich and dramatic choral work, and Battle of Lützen is a suitably epic accompaniment to wartime, and on and on. For music that will join you for tens and hundreds of hours, I’m definitely not sick of it yet.</p>

			<p>It's Halloween at the time of this writing, which means it's the perfect day to turn off the lights and play a horror game, whether that's something new like Cronos: The New Dawn and Silent Hill f, or a classic like Amnesia: The Dark Descent, Dead Space, and Alien: Isolation. Developer Broken Mirror Games and publisher Skybound Games' upcoming isometric 80s-themed horror adventure was unfortunately never going to be an option this Halloween, <a href="https://wccftech.com/i-hate-this-place-release-date-ps5-xbox-nintendo-pc/">as it was due to come out on November 7, 2025</a>, but now it won't even be coming out this year.</p>



<p>A new story trailer released today shows off more of the game's spooky vibes, which is more than fitting for this time of year, but it ends with the revelation that the game will no longer make its November 7, 2025 date. Instead, it'll now release on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch on January 29, 2026.</p>

<iframe title="I Hate This Place | Official Story Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7-FhtWgbx1A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>"<em>As for the date change, we decided that we need a little more time to better incorporate some changes and features gathered from community feedback</em>,<em>" </em>Broken Mirror Games wrote <a href="https://x.com/BMGhorrors/status/1984260318382658038">in a post on its official X (formerly Twitter) account</a>. "<em>We feel the game deserves to make a good first impression so we rethought things and set the new release window to January 2026. Thanks for your patience and understanding.</em>"</p>



<p>Broken Mirror Games' debut title is based on the comic book by writer Kyle Starks and artist Artyom Topilin, with players facing supernatural entities in this 80s-themed world. It was first showcased in <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/03/open-world-survival-horror-game-i-hate-this-place-announced-for-ps5-xbox-series-switch-and-pc">March 2025</a>, and prior to this delay, was expected to arrive sometime before the end of the year.</p>



<p>At least with its current release date, by the time we get to October 31, 2026, you'll probably be able to grab I Hate This Place as part of a spooky sale if you hadn't already picked it up. In the meantime, if you do want to check it out, there's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2604490/I_Hate_This_Place/">a demo currently available on PC</a> that was featured in the latest Steam Next Fest. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/advantage-wireless-controller-for-nintendo-switch-2-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/advantage-wireless-controller-for-nintendo-switch-2-review%E2%80%94pro-perfection-without-paying-full-price.1340587/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>On paper, the&nbsp;PowerA Advantage Wireless Controllers for the Nintendo Switch 2 seem like a more affordable way to enjoy the premium nuances of an official Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller. PowerA has always excelled at delivering classy imitators, all while adding its own signature flair through creative designs and licensed crossovers.</p>



<p>When I was asked to check out PowerA’s Advantage Wireless Controller lineup of Switch 2 Pro controllers, it was a no-brainer. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-production-pipeline-boost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo</a>‘s official accessories have always been notoriously expensive—it costs <strong>$89.99 for another set of Joy-Con 2 controllers</strong>, for example! If you’re worried about investing a lot of money into a third-party accessory or peripheral device, I’m here to tell you that your doubts are in vain. Read on for my full Advantage Wireless Controller Switch 2 Controller review.</p>



<h2 id="h-pro-kemon-gotta-catch-em-all">Pro-kemon, Gotta Catch ‘Em All!</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It looks utterly gorgeous. Credit to PowerA</figcaption></figure>



<p>From the box to the packaging to the controller itself, this feels like a premium product. The <a href="https://www.powera.com.au/collections/all" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PowerA</a> Advantage Wireless Controller is ‘Pro’ in every sense of the word. I reviewed the Pokémon: Mega Evolutions edition, but the range also features a more classic-looking ‘<strong>Black</strong>‘ design, in line with the actual Switch 2 Pro controller, and the more vibrant ‘<strong>Mario &amp; Friends</strong>‘ is a must-have for Mario fans. </p>



<p>As a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-first-year-revenue-estimates-hit-1-3-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> connoisseur myself, I had to have Mega Evolutions. It’s simply incredible to look at. The front-facing design is compartmentalized into Lucario, Pikachu, and Mewtwo segments. They team up and intertwine to create a canvas of cohesive colors, and they’re presented on, in essence, a smooth-shaven controller surface—<strong>It’s the ASMR equivalent of sleek architecture</strong>. </p>



<p>The main Y, X, A, and B buttons have a nice purple finish to align with Mewtwo’s colors, and the top of the device—where a centrally-placed USB-C slot awaits—has a lovely yellow finish wrapped around the curved edges. The analog sticks are where your thumbs will be the majority of the time. A stark opposite to the Pro controller is having grippy barbs around each rubber stick. They add an extra layer of grip, and give you a feel of control that its more expensive contemporary could learn a thing or two from.</p>



<p>Lightweight is the best way to describe the controller, and it sits beautifully in my hands. The buttons are clicky and responsive, and my only real reservation about the design is that the <strong>controller’s main functionality buttons are all in a line along the bottom of the controller</strong>. I don’t think PowerA has done this with previous Switch controller designs. Throughout my playtime with the device, I often found myself trying to press the ‘+’ button, thinking it was in the middle of the controller, only to be met with empty space. Again, it’s the <em>only </em>minor inconvenience I’ve encountered with the design and presentation, and you get used to it after a while.</p>



<h2 id="h-pro-performance-across-the-board">Pro Performance Across The Board</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Spoilt for choice? Credit to PowerA</figcaption></figure>



<p>The PowerA Advantage Wireless Switch 2 Controller will cost you <strong>$69.99</strong>, compared to the more eye-watering <strong>$84.99</strong> of the official Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller. After countless hours with the Pokémon: Mega Evolutions controller, I don’t see any reason to pay the extra $15. Plus, you don’t get the novelty and variety of these bespoke designs.</p>



<p>In fact, the only major performance discrepancy of note is the <strong>battery life</strong>: You get roughly 40 hours for the official controller versus 30 hours with the PowerA model. It’s up to you if you think the extra money is worth a few more hours, but I charge my controller regularly, and I have immediate access to a USB-C cable next to the couch as a contingency for worst-case scenarios. </p>



<p><strong>PowerA has also thrown in a 10ft / 3m USB-C charging cable as a bonus.</strong></p>



<p>I tested the controller across a collection of my Switch games: Mario Kart World, Pokémon Scarlet, and Super Mario Party Jamboree. <strong>I experienced zero issues</strong>; the controller connected to my Switch 2 very quickly, and it behaves just like a Pro controller should. It also doesn’t skimp on the additional buttons, enabling you to reconfigure the controls. If you feel the X button is too far away for the game you’re playing and it’s compromising your playstyle, simply remap it to either of the GR/GL buttons.</p>



<p>The GR and GL buttons are present on the controller’s rear area of the handles, tucked inside. They sync up with your middle fingers and give you the liberty to tweak your setup. It also has real-time sensors and motion controls as standard—along with a C Button for Switch 2 GameChat.</p>



<h2 id="h-verdict">Verdict</h2>



<p>Unless another pro controller comes along that narrowly edges out the Pokémon: Mega Evolutions design, this is easily my new, full-time Nintendo Switch 2 controller moving forward. The analog sticks are unbelievably satisfying to use and tailor-made to cushion your thumbs. The overall design is smooth, simple, light, and feels satisfying to use. The controller’s performance is absolutely what it needs to be, and unless you want to pay a few more dollars for additional battery life, you can’t go wrong with any of the PowerA Advantage Wireless Controllers For Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>I hope you enjoyed my Advantage Wireless Controller For Nintendo Switch 2 review. Let me know if you end up buying one of the controllers.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">With all the indie titles being released on Steam every week, it can be hard to make your game stand out. Italian developer Fix-a-Bug accidentally gave its 2D dungeon crawler a big prelaunch popularity boost in Japan by accidentally naming the game “Shitty Dungeon” in Japanese.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although the game’s English title is The Crazy Hyper-Dungeon Chronicles, its Japanese language Steam Store page ended up displaying the title as Kuso Danjon. This means “Shitty Dungeon” or “Crap Dungeon,” if you want to be slightly more polite.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/10/28/158848.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Game*Spark</u></a> spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/developer-who-accidentally-listed-game-as-shitty-dungeon-in-japan-says-steam-wishlists-skyrocketed-in-aftermath/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Automaton</u></a>, developer Paolo Nicoletti explained that the ‘shitty dungeon incident’ occurred back in August this year, when the team was releasing a demo version of the game and had yet to get a professional Japanese translation.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When they realized their mistake, Nicoletti says, "Everyone was cracking up, and honestly, I also laughed a lot about it. It was completely unintentional.” However the mishap did not flush the rogue-lite dungeon crawler down the toilet, rather, “It ended up bringing the game a lot of attention and the number of Wishlists soared." Nicoletti said the name change was “the best accidental marketing” the developer could have hoped for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to an earlier report by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/articles/newsjp/the-crazy-hyper-dungeon-20250814-353398/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Automaton Japan</u></a>, the Japanese language Steam page for The Crazy Hyper-Dungeon Chronicles was named Shitty Dungeon back on August 8. By August 13, Japanese speaking users had begun discussing the topic on X and had reported it on the official Discord server. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s still not clear how or why this mistranslation happened, but it’s worth noting that the pre-release Japanese language demo of the game had some awkward machine translations when it was picked for Tokyo Game Show’s ‘Selected Indie 80’ in September. The developers announced that these issues would be fixed in the full release, and it appears the ‘shitty dungeon incident’ occurred around this time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This amusing mistake made the indie game stand out from the crowd of new Steam releases. It soon became a topic of discussion on Japanese social media. According to Nicoletti, this contributed to an increase in Wishlist numbers for the then-unreleased game. After all, a title that seems to proudly proclaim it's bad can make people curious as to whether that’s really the case.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, the quality of the game did not stink after all, and The Crazy Hyper-Dungeon Chronicles currently has a '<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2510490/_/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Mostly Positive'</u></a> rating on Steam. Reviewers have been praising its funny dialogue, satisfying gameplay loop and the overall care put into its development. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Japanese speaking <a href="https://x.com/E2Rk85OLelnvHGG/status/1981349995816358273" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>commenters on X</u></a> have also praised the demo and the full game for being surprisingly better than its initial Japanese title suggested. “Humor that lives up to the name,” and “great, detailed pixel art,” are among the plaudits given to the indie title. One Japanese language <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198158461015/recommended/2510490/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>review</u></a> on Steam noted that, “Despite the title Shitty Dungeon making me think it was a joke, it is actually quite well made.” The reviewer said that because they'd made a blind buy, “It wasn’t quite what I expected but the combat system is pretty interesting.” They also praised the game’s balance between humorous dialogue and tense combat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although good localizations are preferable, translation errors have produced some weirdly memorable dialogue over the years. If it hadn’t been for mistranslation, such lines would never have become so iconic. Lines like Zero Wing’s “All your base are belong to us,” and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night’s “What is a man? A miserable little pile of secrets,” have endured beyond their source games to become well-known memes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West. She has also written about Japanese culture and movies for various publications.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/indie-game-gets-the-best-accidental-marketing-in-japan-after-title-mistranslated-to-shy-dungeon]]></content:encoded>

<p dir="ltr">Before the final shot--which shows a cardboard standee of Poppy Playtime burning and surrounded by goo--transitions to the number 5, a brief message flashes on the screen. The message says the following:</p><p dir="ltr">"<em>A needle pulls a thread. The body writhes on the table. 'Is this it? Is this life?' Footsteps echo off the manor floors. 'What do I do now? Where do I belong?' The eyes glue to the screen. You think you know what he wants? You don't know anything.

                <p>Looking for a fittingly eerie game to mark Halloween? Stasis, the award-winning sci-fi horror adventure from The Brotherhood, is free to claim until Monday morning over at GOG. The game combines a gruesome, story-driven narrative with classic point-and-click gameplay, inviting players to explore, combine items, and solve puzzles in a chilling, retro-inspired setting.</p><p>Set in the distant future aboard the derelict spaceship Groomlake, Stasis follows John Maracheck as he awakens from cryogenic sleep in excruciating pain, separated from his wife and daughter. With time running out and the ship sinking into Neptune's dense methane clouds, John must uncover the horrifying truth behind the facility’s experiments. The game's isometric perspective and richly detailed 2D environments create an immersive sense of dread and isolation.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3eKjhTL1Zs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/b3eKjhTL1Zs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Stasis features a cinematic score by Mark Morgan (most notably known for his work on Fallout and Fallout 2), a slew of characters to interact with, and a range of realistic and challenging puzzles. Originally released in 2015, it won the Aggie Award for Best Adventure Game. For a limited time, players can experience the game for free, making it an ideal choice for Halloween-themed gaming.</p><p>If you're looking for more to play, check out our list of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-free-horror-games/2900-7151/#11" data-ref-id="2900-7151">best free horror games</a>, which features everything from puzzles to creepy farm sims</p>

Varholak's <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/keighin-reco.pdf">recommendation</a> states that Keighin streamed gameplay footage "before the games were released to the public" on "at least fifty occasions", with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_and_luigi_brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a> being the most recent example.</p><div><figure data-videoid="3ZPwyfIL_qU" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ZPwyfIL_qU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt3ZPwyfIL_qU" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3ZPwyfIL_qU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ZPwyfIL_qU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed444994ikvphj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>However, the court has refused to issue a permanent injunction on the streamer to destroy "all circumvention devices" as it is "unclear what purpose those would serve or what devices would be covered by this provision" as most of them are freely available on the internet.</p>

<p>Similarly, an injunction against third parties has also been denied on the basis that "Plaintiff’s Complaint does not allege that Defendant is working in concert with any third party".</p>
<p>In terms of the streaming, the recommendation highlights numerous times where Keighin publicly acknowledges his actions, including sharing links to emulation software on social media and even directly emailing Nintendo to say that he "will actively help people find newer and updated copies".</p>
<p>Keighin has also made other public posts taunting Nintendo, such as "You might run a corporation. I run the streets". We won't share <em>most</em> of those here, though, as many of the posts use strong and derogatory language.</p>
<p>The court has ordered the Keighin to pay $17,500 — $10,000 for streaming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/paper_mario_the_thousand-year_door">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a>, and $500 for 15 violations including distribution of links to emulators, cryptographic keys, and circumventing technological measures to play the unreleased games.</p>
<p>Nintendo has until 13th November 2025 to submit a Status Report to the court laying out its next steps.</p>

He previously wrote for <em>Business Insider, Rolling Stone, </em><em>Futurism, </em>and <em>Popular Science.</em></span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>There haven’t been a lot of opportunities to catch Switch 2 games on sale since the console launched in early June, but that’s changing thanks to Woot. The store is having <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.woot.com/plus/hot-deals-on-video-games" rel="sponsored">a sale on new video games and game accessories</a> that’s live now, and runs through November 8th at 11:59PM CT. Dozens of games for all three current-generation systems are on sale, but the Switch 2 titles caught our eye because of how new they are. Woot’s deals are especially enticing because first-party Nintendo games don’t go on sale very often.</p><p>Woot’s sale also includes discounts on Switch 2 exclusives, including <em>Donkey Kong Banaza </em>and<em> Mario Kart World, </em>and Switch 2 Edition versions of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild </em>and<em> Kirby and the Forgotten Land Plus Star-Crossed World</em>. The latter are enhanced versions of games released for the original Switch that have new exclusive content, a boost in performance, or both. If you already own the original versions of these games, Nintendo allows you to download a paid upgrade pack to get the enhancements instead of paying full price for the entire game.</p><p>There are also some respectable discounts on games released for the original Nintendo Switch, which can be played on the Switch 2, so we’ve included them here. In some cases games are listed as being an “international version” of the title, which is fine because the Nintendo Switch 2 is a region free console that’s able to play them.</p><div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODExMjUy"><p><span>$<!-- -->62</span></p><div><p><em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>is one of the Switch 2’s first exclusive must-have titles. Its destructible environment allows you to smash your way through each of its 17 levels, and the paths you make will remain intact unless you specifically choose to reset the world. Your companion Paulene’s singing allows you to transform into animals that have abilities that allow you to reach previously inaccessible parts of levels. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/707704/donkey-kong-bananza-review-nintendo-switch-2">Read our review</a>.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODExMjgx"><p><span>$<!-- -->70</span></p><div><p><em>Mario Kart World</em> mixes up the formula that’s remained more or less the same since 1992. You still progress by out-racing your competitors across several cups, but there’s a new Knockout Tour mode in which you actually drive from stage to stage in an interconnected world. There’re new weapons to collect, an item that allows you to change costumes mid-race, and a single player mode loaded with challenges. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/684518/mario-kart-world-review-nintendo-switch-2">Read our review</a>.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODExMjc0"><p><span>$<!-- -->63</span></p><div><p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild </em>is one of the most highly-regarded games of all time thanks to its massive open world. The game gives you little direction after a brief tutorial, so you’re free to examine every nook and cranny at your leisure without hitting a single story beat. The Switch 2 Edition runs in 4K at 60 frames per second, so you can appreciate Hyrule even more. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/681361/nintendo-switch-2-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-edition">Read our hands-on</a>.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODExMjcx"><p><span>$<!-- -->70</span></p><div><p>The Switch 2 Edition of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom </em>has the same technical enhancements as <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, but they’re more welcome here because the game struggled to run a bit on the original Switch. The game is set in the same environment as its predecessor, but Hyrule is more dense, so there’s even more to explore.

However, optional modes that allow you to play the mini games in rapid succession, or take down Imitation Bowser with bombs shot through a cannon keep it feeling fresh. The Switch 2-exclusive Jamboree TV mode introduces mini games that utilize the system’s Joy-Con 2 mouse controls and optional USB-C Camera. </p></div></div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODExMjY2"><p><span>$<!-- -->70</span></p><div><p><em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land Plus Star-Crossed World </em>includes the original Switch title, plus 12 levels whose environments have been reshaped by a meteorite.

However, each level contains “Wonder Seeds,” which turn the stage into a challenging, psychedelic stage when collected.

It contains every character and level from previous <em>Super Smash Bros. </em>games, and the ability to expand the roster through paid downloadable content. The gameplay is largely the same (choose a fighter and play against people in the same room or online), but its single player “Spirit Mode” lets you progress through a story through matches with set objectives. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18128015/super-smash-bros-ultimate-review-nintendo-switch">Read our review</a>.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODExMjk3"><p><span>$<!-- -->46</span></p><div><p><em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons </em>is the ultimate cozy game.

Online multiplayer remains Splatoon’s 3’s big draw, so be prepared to square off against fellow squid kids. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23339801/splatoon-3-review-nintendo-switch">Read our review</a>.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODExMzA0"><p><span>$<!-- -->47</span></p><div><p><em>Pokémon Scarlet</em> is one of the latest entries in the series, and it’s the most open world mainline <em>Pokémon</em> game to date.

            <p>My dearest Hedwig, I write to you from the churning battlefields of King Friedrich II's campaign to reinforce Silesia against the lurking Gallic aggressor. I regret to inform you that the French Hussars are kicking our Hussarses. We just engaged what our scouts from the 17th Pop-Up Tutorial Squadron promised was a "light" patrol of ill-trained musketmen and cavalry, just outside Hildesheim. French equestrians appear to be made of different stuff than our Prussian chargers. They cleave through our Landmiltz like wheat. Meanwhile, our horseguys can't take a single bayonet to the gaskin without turning for home. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>All is bloodmist and flashing unit banners. There is no time, dear Hedwig, for the baguette-wielding infidels swiftly descend upon my sole surviving regiment of Cantonist Recruits. Our ill-named leader Count von Smash has long since cast down his sabre and left to pursue a second career as a humble peasant with a suspiciously fine moustache. Avenge me, my love! Complete the Silesian campaign in Master Of Command and retrieve my bloody bones!

<p>If you're hungry for another historical Total War, and besotted specifically with the gunpowder combat of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/napoleon-total-war">Napoleon: Total War</a> and Empire: Total War, you might enjoy Master Of Command, Armchair History Interactive's real-time <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> set during the Seven Years War of 1756 to 1763. 
</p><p>That's my conclusion after 40 minutes with it, anyway. The game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2878450/Master_of_Command/">only just launched on Steam</a>, and there is a heck of a lot of period detail to chew through, but you can boil it down as follows: you lead an army around a procedurally generated map of real-ish places cloaked in fog of war, duffing up rival armies and claiming or trading with settlements while managing your supplies. 
</p>
<p>Your army consists of upgradeable regiments drawn from a whiskery bestiary of 150 celebrated 18th century European military units. There are officers with buffs and customisable hats, and many kinds of equipment to consider, such as tricking your muzzleloaders out with the latest cylindrical ramrods to shorten the gap between volleys. On the battlefield, meanwhile, you line up your grenadiers, fusiliers, cossacks and whatnot to outmarch, outgun, outflank and otherwise outfox the enemy, while taking advantage of terrain features like hedgerows, and monitoring each regiment's ammo and morale.

<p>I am skimming through the nerdy warfaring minutiae here not out of disrespect for historians (armchair-based or otherwise), but simply because AAAAARGH, I think this game is trying to kill me with proper nouns. I am swimming in a sea of heraldry and plumed headgear. Fortunately, the in-game presentation is quite intuitive, so far, without simply being functional. The maps, menus, UI elements and character portraits are wrought in bright, bold colours. The 3D unit models are simple and toylike, next to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer">Total War: Warhammer</a> 3's blinged and prancing miniatures, but you'll wince nonetheless when one of your flanking cavalry formations eats a full musket volley. As battles go on, the view fills with gunpowder smoke. The strikingly painted countryside grows bleary and concussed. Oh the humanity!</p><p>Dear Hedwig, I live! Following my last, desperate letter, I managed to escape the carnage by playing dead. After night fell I stole back to camp, where Count von Smash loitered in his tent, having finally regained his nerve after two solid miles of running and screaming. He assures me that we'll give the tricolore trouble-makers what for during our next encounter. I can only hope he reads Armchair History Interactive's <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3594434716">"basic" guide to units</a> before continuing the offensive. </p>

The supposedly harmonious city’s urban redevelopment plan includes </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1izjtjg/future_kalos_has_antihomeless_benches/"><span>anti-homeless benches</span></a><span>? If we’re supposed to be living alongside Pokémon in the Paris-inspired city, why do they live in walled-off Wild Zones? Yeah, they thankfully have free healthcare, but why is Nurse Joy having to take on two jobs as both healer and shopkeeper in this city? Those are questions that hang over a game that is very much trying to figure its world out, but one of the moments of clarity it does have captures how, in the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>universe, cops would absolutely try to enlist these monsters in state-sanctioned violence. No moment captures that better than the “Investigating with Shuppet” quest.</span></p>  <p><span>Rancun, a Lumiose City cop, asks if you can bring him a Shuppet to help with his investigations. In his mind, the ghost-type Pokémon’s ability to sense negative emotions such as jealousy and vindictiveness is something that could help him identify criminals before they have a chance to commit a crime. If you’ve never encountered stories like the cyberpunk anime </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/psycho-pass-is-a-compelling-cyberpunk-mystery-and-its-5973624"><i><span>Psycho-Pass</span></i></a><span>, there are entire subgenres of dystopian fiction about how police over-surveilling citizens based almost entirely on vibes can lead to an oppressive police state. And this officer is imagining a world in which he can co-opt an innocent Pokémon into his surveillance scheme and doesn’t see anything wrong with that. But the quest is in our log, so what happens when you bring a Shuppet to Rancun? The funniest outcome, actually.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000640502" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000640502"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000640502">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>After you catch a Shuppet and bring the living puppet to Rancun, he tells the ghost that the peace of the city “depends on” it, and asks it to home in on some of these negative emotions it can sense. Funnily enough, Shuppet doesn’t go looking for someone stealing food to help feed their family, but instead takes the cop right back to his own front door. His wife greets us there and asks her husband if he’s still working. When Rancun says that yes, he’s still on a case, she says, seeming slightly annoyed, “Well, I guess you’re still busy with work…Good luck with the investigation.” Before she can head back inside, Shuppet cries out at her, insisting it’s found some negative emotions here. That’s when the truth comes out: It turns out his wife has been feeling neglected by Rancun’s workaholic nature, and has grown resentful. The grudge had grown so strong, in fact, that Shuppet felt it across the city. Rancun decides he should probably devote more energy to his marriage, hopefully indicating that he’s no longer invested in trying to create a Pokémon-powered police state.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>has a surprising track record when it comes to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-detective-pikachu-returns-switch-acab-is-a-cop-1850906651"><span>cop commentary</span></a><span>, including the time </span><i><span>Detective Pikachu </span></i><a href="https://kotaku.com/detective-pikachu-returns-pokemon-review-switch-1850915720"><span>got arrested on false charges</span></a><span> and did a jail break.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Netflix is looking into buying Warner Bros. Discovery, which could include the full library of Warner Bros. Games and intellectual properties (IPs).</p>



<p>The news <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-discovery-sale-potential-game-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comes just over a week</a> after Warner Bros. Discovery announced it was opening up sales bids after it had received “unsolicited interest from multiple parties for the entire company.”</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/netflix-exploring-warner-bros-bid-1236603687/">Deadline</a>, Netflix has hired investment bank Moelis &amp; Co to explore a bid for the company. It’s the same firm that helped with Skydance’s merger with Paramount. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-could-happen-to-warner-bros-games-under-netflix">What Could Happen To Warner Bros. Games Under Netflix?</h2>



<p>What’s unclear, though possible to happen, is if a Netflix acquisition would see all of Warner Bros. Games be assumed into Netflix Games. Currently, Warner Bros. Games holds major gaming franchises such as Mortal Kombat, Harry Potter, DC Comics, Game of Thrones, and more. </p>



<p>Warner Bros. Games also owns multiple studios, including Avalanche Software, NetherRealm Studios, Rocksteady Studios, TT Games, and WB Games studios in Montreal, Boston, New York, and San Francisco. All of which would likely be included in any sale. </p>



<p>Netflix declined to comment to Deadline on the report. Insider Gaming has also reached out to Warner Bros. Discovery for comment on whether any sale would include the games division. Thus far, no response has been received.  </p>



<p>Netflix has attempted to make a dent in the games industry in recent years, but it has never fully gotten off the ground. That said, the company is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-is-doubling-down-on-its-gaming-investment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continuing to invest in gaming</a> on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dont-nod-netflix-major-ip-game-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">various fronts</a>.</p>



<p>What do you think the future would hold if Netflix were to acquire Warner Bros. Games? Leave your thoughts down in the comments, and join the official&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

Themed around the Movember mustache movement--an annual event encouraging the growth of moustaches in an effort to raise awareness around men's health issues--this bundle offers a curated selection of PC games for $20. Proceeds will go to charity, and each game in this bundle will be delivered as a Steam key that can be redeemed on your account.</p><p>As for the games, the selection includes titles like Schedule I, Mon Bazou, Gloomwood, and Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous - Enhanced Edition. Schedule I has been a sleeper hit this year--and one of our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-co-op-games/2900-5361/" data-ref-id="2900-5361">favorite co-op games</a>--even if it does revolve around acts that would be illegal in real life. As a small-time drug dealer, it's up to you to build a drug empire and deal with threats to your organization like rival cartels and law enforcement. The game usually costs $20 on its own, so this bundle deal works out to be pretty good value for money, in case you've been thinking of purchasing Schedule I.</p><p>Anyone looking to revisit the era of old-school shooters will want to check out Dusk, which plays like Quake 2 with a metal soundtrack and horror vibes. The game features three campaigns to blast your way through, and has become a cult-classic over the years with its polished action. Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous can consume dozens of your waking hours with its fantasy gameplay, Valthirian Arc: Hero School Story is a charming RPG, and The Corridor is a game about walking down a corridor--no, really.</p><h2>Movember Game 'Stache Charity Bundle (2025)</h2><ul><li>Schedule I</li><li>Mon Bazou</li><li>Gloomwood (Steam Deck Playable)</li><li>Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous Enhanced Edition (Steam Deck Playable)</li><li>Instruments of Destruction (Steam Deck Playable)</li><li>Men of War 2</li><li>Hello Neighbor 2 (Steam Deck Playable)</li><li>Chivalry 2 (Steam Deck Playable)</li><li>American Truck Simulator (Steam Deck Verified)</li><li>Dusk (Steam Deck verified)</li><li>Agent Intercept</li><li>Prodigal</li><li>Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector (Steam Deck Verified)</li><li>Valthirian Arc: Hero School Story (Steam Deck Playable)</li><li>The Corridor (Steam Deck Playable)</li></ul><p>For another bundle deal, you can also check out Fanatical's <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Get+Schedule+I+And+14+Games+For+%2420+In+This+Movember+Charity+Bundle&amp;fnauthor=darranged&amp;fndate=2025-10-31+09%3A21%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-10-31+09%3A22%3A00&amp;fnarticle_id=6535850&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fpick-and-mix%2Fbuild-your-own-shooter-bundle&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-schedule-i-and-14-games-for-20-in-this-movember-charity-bundle%2F1100-6535850%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Build Your Own Shooter Bundle</a> deal.

			<p>Grand Theft Auto 4 with RTX Remix Path Tracing looks like the remaster we'll likely never get, introducing significant visual improvements that enhance the game's visuals considerably.</p>



<p>How much <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-look-path-traced-gta-4-rtx-remix-test-build/">the mod developed by Xoxor4D</a> enhances the visuals of the fourth entry in the series by Rockstar Games is shown in a new comparison video put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC">MxBenchmarkPC.</a> The video showcases the vanilla version of the game running side by side with the path-traced version at 4K and 1440p resolutions, utilizing NVIDIA DLSS and Frame Generation.</p>



<p>As expected, the mod is highly demanding, and even high-end modern hardware has trouble running it at 60 FPS without Frame Generation, but the results seem well worth the performance hit,  although some of the visual elements of the game, besides lighting and shadows, need an evident update, such as character models and low-quality textures.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The Grand Theft Auto 4 RTX Remix mod is not yet available publicly. However, those interested in trying it out before its launch can do so by <a href="https://www.patreon.com/xoxor4d">supporting Xoxor4D on Patreon.</a></p>



<p>Replaying through Grand Theft Auto 4 with RTX Remix path tracing and other mods is definitely a good way to make the wait for Grand Theft Auto 6 more bearable. The sixth entry in the series was initially scheduled to launch on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S this year, but <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">Rockstar Games ultimately delayed the game to May 2026. </a></p>



<p>While no precise reason was provided for the game's delay, Rockstar Games stated in the message shared to announce the delay that the additional development time was required to meet and exceed players' expectations for a game whose launch is predicted to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/">the biggest entertainment launch to date.</a></p>
