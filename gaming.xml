			<p>Gears of War: Reloaded arrived on all current-gen consoles, including PlayStation ones, just three days ago on August 26, and before its first week on store shelves is finished, The Coalition and Microsoft have announced that it has already surpassed 1 million players.</p>



<p>"<em>Ending the console war, one grub at a time</em>," The Coalition wrote in its <a href="https://x.com/gearsofwar/status/1961474052557557990?s=46">post on X (formerly Twitter)</a> announcing the milestone. "<em>Thank you for 1 million players.</em>"</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It's a solid milestone for the remaster, even if the 1 million players isn't indicative of sales figures, since a good chunk of those players were likely ones who jumped in through Xbox Game Pass.</p>



<p>Overall, August 26, 2025, was a historic day for the video game industry, as games that were previously console exclusives for either PlayStation or Xbox jumped the fence to the other side. PlayStation players finally got the chance to check out Gears of War, and Xbox players finally got the chance to jump into the fight for democracy and Super Earth in Helldivers 2.</p>



<p>Funnily enough, this resulted in making the <a href="https://wccftech.com/best-console-to-play-gears-of-war-on-playstation-ps5-pro-xbox/">best console to play Gears of War on a PlayStation console</a>, since the PS5 Pro is capable of delivering the best mix of performance and visual fidelity compared to the Xbox Series X and the base PS5.</p>



<p>There is more Gears of War coming, with the previously announced prequel, to the original games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-has-been-in-active-development-for-over-five-years/">Gears of War E-Day</a>, in development, and beyond the small screen of your home TV or PC monitor, Gears is headed to the big screen, with a feature film in the works. That, however, <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-film-wont-debut-before-2027/">won't be out until sometime in 2027</a>.</p>

<p>After months of being drip-fed tiny nuggets of information regarding <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yooka-replaylee">Yooka-Replaylee</a>, Playtonic Games has finally announced that the game will launch on Switch 2 on <strong>9th October 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>In addition, while a previous listing heavily hinted at the game receiving a proper physical release (i.e. no Game-Key Card), this has now been officially confirmed. Digital copies will be available via the Switch 2 eShop at <strong>$29.99</strong>, while physical copies will retail at <strong>$49.99</strong>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, those who already own <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/yooka-laylee">Yooka-Laylee</a> on the Switch can bag a sweet 30% discount off the price of Yooka-Replaylee on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>It's about time though, right? It's good to know that we don't have to wait too long for the release now. Our only hope at this point is that the remaster improves upon the original in more ways than one. We certainly enjoyed it well enough, but it never quite matched up to the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/banjo-kazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a>.</p>
<p>Here's a reminder of the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Refined story:</strong> The events of the first game are relived and retold by the main characters, Yooka and Laylee. New sequences and plot points have been added throughout the adventure at key milestones, too.<br>
<strong><br>
Upgraded graphics:</strong> With an art and animations overhaul and enhanced performance and resolution, the favorite buddy duo has never looked or moved better.<br>
<strong><br>
Brand new Rextro’s Arcade:</strong> The old minigames are no more! Instead you'll jump into the feet of Rextro the dinosaur and undertake brand-new isometric platforming challenges for collectible rewards.<br>
<strong><br>
New collectible currency:</strong> Capital B's inept minions have dropped their hard-earned coins all over the place. Collect the official currency of the Hivory Towers to spend on video games' most beloved sentient vending machine.<br>
<strong><br>
Build your own playstyle:</strong> Tonics are back with all new flavors! With the option to equip multiple game changing enhancements, you can truly customize your playstyle. And as if that wasn't enough, Vendi has new lines of merchandise for the modern fashionable adventurer.<br>
<strong><br>
Navigate the world easily:</strong> Yooka-Replaylee introduces a brand-new map and collectibles tracker, making it easier for you to traverse the environments, track NPC and Pagie locations along with tracking their progress. We're also introducing a new character in the form of (book)Mark who acts as your warp point and guide.<br>
<strong><br>
Revamped controls and camera:</strong> The buddy-duo now has access to their entire move set from the start of the game and can sequence the moves together a lot smoother than in the original game. This, combined with the revamped camera controls, makes Yooka-Replaylee feel like a more modern, snappier experience, while also directly addressing player feedback on the original game.<br>
<strong><br>
A dreamy orchestral soundtrack:</strong> The original score from famed video game composers Grant Kirkhope (Banjo-Kazooie) and David Wise (Donkey Kong Country) returns but as a beautifully arranged orchestral score. Now seriously, clean out those ears!</p></blockquote><blockquote>

			<p>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 has been a long time coming, that's for sure. I first attended a hands-off preview of the original project by Hardsuit Labs at E3 2019. Back then, I hoped to play the full game in 2021, but then Paradox Interactive boldly removed Hardsuit Labs from the project and accepted a brand new pitch from The Chinese Room, adding another four years to the development of this long-anticipated RPG sequel.</p>



<p>Ahead of Gamescom 2025, I <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-pre-gamescom-2025-hands-on-a-tasty-morsel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">played the game's opening missions</a> and quite enjoyed that slice of Bloodlines 2. During a convention, I got to play even further than that, but that portion is still embargoed until a later date. What is not embargoed, though, is my chat with a few key members of the development team: Design Director Jey Hicks, Level Designer Catarina Martins, and Narrative Director Ian Thomas. As a reminder, the game is <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-october-21-lasombra-toreador-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slated to launch on October 21</a> for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, and publisher Paradox Interactive has <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-publisher-promises-fix-clans-locked-day-one-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promised</a> to make 'adjustments' to the Lasombra and Toreador clans being locked behind a day-one DLC. </p>



<p><strong>How far is this demo into the game?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jey Hicks: </strong>There's a whole lot more to go. I can't say the exact numbers because right now we're trying to figure out exactly how long it is, because we've been adding in a bunch of new content recently, but currently our estimates are between people who are a fast player who doesn't do any of the additional content, maybe 20-25 odd hours and then up to potentially around 40 hours for more sort of completionists.</p>



<p><strong>Ian Thomas: </strong>This demo is just before the point where Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 opens up into a more open world space, if that makes sense. The story is quite linear up to this point, and after you return from this mission, the map opens up. Phyre gets a different role in the city and there'll be lots of different things you can look at from the map and go and interact with. Side missions, if you like.</p>



<p><strong>Are these side missions tied to specific characters?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jey Hicks: </strong> Yes, exactly. Are you aware of the blood resonance system? That's how you unlock the other powers from the other clans. Each clan has a leader, essentially. They will be sending you out on various different missions, which can help you progress along with your unlocks as well. You're going to gain experience, you're going to gain resonant blood, which you can then spend on the new abilities.</p>



<p><strong>Something that I noticed in the previous demo is that when you play with Fabian, you still have access to the blood resonance, or at least the resonance events are still marked on the map. Does that mean you can unlock stuff with Fabian, too?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jey Hicks:</strong> Yeah, there's essentially certain people who are there for Fabian to feed on around Seattle.</p>



<p><strong>But you can't unlock any new abilities, right?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jey Hicks:</strong> Not with Fabian, no.</p>



<p><strong>He already has everything unlocked from the get-go, then. </strong></p>



<p><strong>Ian Thomas: </strong>Because it makes sense narratively with Fabian at the end of his life cycle, right? We don't want to boost him further just as he's about to die.</p>



<p><strong>Catarina Martins:</strong> And also, Fabian is not as powerful as Phyre.</p>



<p><strong>Ian Thomas: </strong>But he still needs to feed. And so I think what you saw were probably the people he feeds upon.</p>



<p><strong>Catarina Martins:</strong> Fabian is an interesting one because, as a detective himself, he doesn't want to break the Masquerade by feeding on people randomly. He has people that he trusts and goes back to on a regular basis who allow him to feed on them.</p>



<p><strong>Jey Hicks: </strong>It's voluntary. They're allowing him to do this.</p>



<p><strong>Ian Thomas: </strong>They're also his own detective's contacts on the street.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The idea always was that Phyre would have somebody in their head, but originally, that somebody was written as a very different character, somebody who was still called Fabian but was very different. He was much more modern and much younger than he ended up being. When we tested that, and we tried to make that work, it wasn't working. The two characters were too similar in a bunch of ways, weirdly enough, because the younger vampire was quite upset about everything that was happening, and then Phyre isn't exactly cheerful, either.</em> <em>And so people found that that pairing wasn't really fun to spend time with. So we did quite a big change later on, we had a lot of extra story we wanted to tell and we also wanted to introduce the Malkavian clan. Suddenly, we went, what if the Malkavian was the character in Phyre's head? Suddenly, it really started to work.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>How did you come up with this idea of a vampire stuck in the head of another? They are very different, too, because Phyre is ancient and originally from the old world, and of course, Fabian is local, not to mention that he's a detective interested in the workings of the mind, whereas Phyre is much more physical.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ian Thomas: </strong>It started before I joined the company, actually. The idea always was that Phyre would have somebody in their head, but originally, that somebody was written as a very different character, somebody who was still called Fabian but was very different. He was much more modern and much younger than he ended up being. When we tested that, and we tried to make that work, it wasn't working. The two characters were too similar in a bunch of ways, weirdly enough, because the younger vampire was quite upset about everything that was happening, and then Phyre isn't exactly cheerful, either.</p>



<p>And so people found that that pairing wasn't really fun to spend time with. So we did quite a big change later on, we had a lot of extra story we wanted to tell and we also wanted to introduce the Malkavian clan. Suddenly we went, what if the Malkavian was the character in Phyre's head? Suddenly, it really started to work, and we found that having the old vampire who has maybe lost their humanity to quite a big extent and doesn't connect to the humans, along with Fabian, who's fascinated by humans and is really interested in how the world work, it was a really nice pairing, and that just worked for us, along with a really good voice actor. Suddenly, Fabian was brought to life and they went okay, this is the right way to go. It's quite a late change and also a brave change, I think, from Paradox's case, because they said, yes, you're right. We do need to make this change, let's take the time to do it. We are very happy with that.</p>



<p><strong>Jey Hicks: </strong>I think it was definitely a worthwhile decision to delay the game and make sure that people actually relate and enjoy the characters. We didn't want Fabian to be just another voice in your head sort of character.</p>



<p><strong>It wasn't playable before, I take it?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jey Hicks: </strong>Exactly, that's exactly so. That took at least a year.</p>



<p><strong>Ian Thomas: </strong>Two years, really, to incorporate that change. But it was so we'd get a much bigger game as well, and it's given us more playstyles, because you get to do the detective. And it's brought in Malkavian, and we like Malkavian.</p>



<p><strong>Speaking about Malkavians, they're usually considered to be mad in Vampire: The Masquerade lore, but that doesn't seem to be the case with Fabian.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ian Thomas: </strong>That depends on what you think mad is. They have a twisted view and a different perception of the world. Some people call them mad, and some people call them prophets or visionaries, and that's all part of Vampire: The Masquerade lore. Some may well be crazy, but some just see the world in a very different way, and Fabian sees the world in a very different way. He sees it as if he's a detective in the 1930s or 40s. Is he? Who knows, but that's what he thinks he is.</p>



<p><strong>Speaking about the gameplay balance between the clans, I noticed that half of the clans have two clan affinities, while others have three. Are those with three designed to be more versatile?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jey Hicks: </strong>I'm glad you picked up on that. Yeah, with those kinds of abilities, you essentially get a discount on purchasing the ability. So yeah, you can buy way more abilities with clan affinities.</p>



<p><strong>Ian Thomas: </strong>That's coming from the roleplaying game.</p>



<p><strong>Jey Hicks: </strong>Yeah, 100%. We tried to be accurate to the roleplaying game with that, and if you look at the mastery rating, it is specified at the top when you're choosing your clan. That gives people just a rough idea of how difficult it is to play as each clan. Because we have the difficulty and then we have the difficulty of playing Phyre as a member of a specific clan.</p>



<p><strong>I wanted to ask about the Masquerade system in Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2. I noticed that when it's full, if you're completely in the red, someone appears from nowhere and stabs Phyre to death. Who is that character?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ian Thomas: </strong>I can't remember whether you met the character Tolly [a Nosferature vampire].</p>



<p><strong>Yes, he was in the previous demo.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ian Thomas: </strong>So Tolly is very, very efficient. He is not just an information master. He is an enforcer of the Camarilla and he is constantly watching you. When you break the Masquerade, he puts you back into torpor.</p>



<p><strong>I noticed that when you go into the red bar, but it's not full, you can slowly come back before Tolly executes you.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Catarina Martins:</strong> If you hide from the police, if we don't do any more things in the eye of the public, then you should be able to just go back and not get dealt with by Tolly.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Tolly is very, very efficient. He is not just an information master. He is an enforcer of the Camarilla and he is constantly watching you. When you break the Masquerade, he puts you back into torpor. It gets quite interesting later in the game when you're doing more missions around the city. Let's say you have to go and kill little thieves or someone who's maybe in the park. There will be witnesses, so you've got to figure out the optimal way to do that without upsetting the Camarilla.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>This system is kind of core to the very IP. It's in the name, right? You can't break the Masquerade.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jey Hicks: </strong>Yes. It gets quite interesting later in the game when you're doing more missions around the city. Let's say you have to go and kill little thieves or someone who's maybe in the park. There will be witnesses, so you've got to figure out the optimal way to do that without upsetting the Camarilla.</p>



<p><strong>So even when you become the Sheriff of Seattle on behalf of the Camarilla, you don't get any more leeway in that regard.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jey Hicks: </strong>No. The Masquerade is the single, hard, sacred law. Right now. No one is above that.</p>



<p><strong>Catarina Martins:</strong> And it's not just something that happens in the game. It comes straight from the tabletop RPG. It doesn't matter who you are. It doesn't matter how cool you are.</p>



<p><strong>Jey Hicks: </strong>It's essential for vampires to remain anonymous; otherwise, they would just get hunted to extinction. They know that they wouldn't be able to win an open war with the mortals.</p>



<p><strong>In terms of RPG systems, I noticed that there isn't that much to loot in </strong><strong>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</strong> <strong>besides elixirs. Is that correct?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jey Hicks: </strong>The elixirs are the looting, yes. We also have various types of collectibles that give the player lore about the world, so you can go around collecting them. Some of those actually enhance your character as well. I don't know if you have found the blue ones with Phyre's symbol. They actually give you more health as well as giving you a big chunk of experience. You will then use the experience to unlock your abilities, but the health is quite obvious: it's easier to survive with more health.</p>



<p><strong>Catarina Martins:</strong> If you take your time to explore the city, then you will eventually find some collectibles that will help you in the long run. And so, if you are one of those players who likes to explore when you're running around (I'm guilty of that), you can actually give yourself a step up because you can increase your health and experience bar. It will help you in the future rather than being the person who goes from objective to objective. I think the game is even more difficult if you go straight from objective to objective without experience, so we promote the exploring part.</p>



<p><strong>Jey Hicks: </strong>And it's fun to explore. Did you enjoy just navigating around the city and jumping from rooftops and stuff?</p>



<p><strong>Yes, especially the gliding.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Catarina Martins:</strong> But did you dash during a glide?</p>



<p><strong>Nope.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Catarina Martins:</strong> It gets you there so fast. So, the moment that you glide and you look like you're just about to miss a ledge or something, if you dash, you can get a natural forward momentum.</p>



<p><strong>Jey Hicks: </strong>There's a lot of subtleties to the movement and the combat if you want to master them. Did you discover the additional kicks and stuff like that?</p>



<p><strong>I mean, I noticed that when you unlock the Blink ability, you can aim it at a foe and it will kick them.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jey Hicks: </strong>I saw you doing that, that was cool. But no, actually, if you use dash and a direction and an attack, it's like if you dash backward, you'll do a knee move. If you dash to the right, you do a big sweeping roundhouse kick, and there's some more for you to discover. It's really cool.</p>



<p><strong>Maybe it could be helpful if you would put some tool tips in there.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jey Hicks: </strong>There are some. Also, if you take your time to read the codex as well, there's advanced combat tutorials in there. But yeah, they serve different purposes. The roundhouse kick is really good for crowd control, so if you've got a big group of enemies nearby, do the roundhouse kick, and they'll scatter off.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The decision to change that made the game so much better in my opinion. We had a similar thing to other games with using a sort of token-based combat system, where only one guy can attack me at once. It just didn't feel right. We wanted this to feel like really fast combat. It was way too easy when we had that. Just making those two changes that I just said made the game so much more fun. It's now about managing the crowd, which is a real thing that, if you talk to people who do like street fighting, the most important thing is making sure your enemies are in your field of view. If people get behind you, you're done, you're dead.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Personally, I think that the combat of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 captures the feeling of being a vampire quite well. I also like that you have to be tactical when you're feeding because otherwise, the NPCs can kill you. In most games, when you enter those kind of choreographed cinematic animations where you're locked for a few seconds, you are also effectively invulnerable to enemy attacks.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jey Hicks: </strong>We had that for quite a while and the decision to change that made the game so much better in my opinion. We had a similar thing to other games with using a sort of token-based combat system, where only one guy can attack me at once. It just didn't feel right. We wanted this to feel like really fast combat. It was way too easy when we had that. Just making those two changes that I just said made the game so much more fun. It's now about managing the crowd, which is a real thing that, if you talk to people who do like street fighting, the most important thing is making sure your enemies are in your field of view, right? If people get behind you, you're done, you're dead.</p>



<p><strong>Catarina Martins:</strong> The thing about it is that you can actually use it to your advantage. If there is an NPC that uses firearms, like the enforcer with the gun, and you line it up with another enemy who is closing in melee, they will hit them as well.</p>



<p><strong>I did notice that, and it felt great. Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/bloodthief-pc-release-date-september/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/retro-medieval-vampiric-%E2%80%9Cboomer-slasher%E2%80%9D-bloodthief-arrives-on-pc-next-month.1284357/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Bloodthief, a fast-paced, self-described "<em>boomer-slasher</em>" that puts you in the boots of a wall-running, parkouring vampire with a sword, will arrive on PC next month, on September 22, 2025.</p>



<p>If you like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghostrunner-death-not-such-terrible/">Ghostrunner</a> but thought it should be faster, Bloodthief might just be the game you've been waiting for. It's made by a new indie developer, Blargis, and is the studio's debut title, and a quick look at the newly debuted release date trailer will show you everything you need to see about Bloodthief, which you could alternatively call 'speedrunner's delight.'</p>



<p>Speaking of Ghostrunner, interestingly, Bloodthief also feels like it's beating Ghostrunner developer One More Level to the punch by taking that fast-paced, melee-first style of first-person parkouring action and turning it medieval. If you're excited for what <a href="https://wccftech.com/valor-mortis-gamescom-hands-on-preview-an-amazing-standout-and-one-of-the-shows-best/">One More Level is building with Valor Mortis</a>, then you can play Bloodthief in the meantime, since Bloodthief arrives in a few weeks' time, while Valor Mortis won't be out until next year.</p>

<p>I checked out Bloodthief earlier this year in fact when Blargis released a demo of the game during <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-next-fest-june-2025-the-demos-i-loved-that-you-should-spend-the-weekend-playing/">Steam Next Fest June 2025</a>, which is still available to download and play on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2533600/Bloodthief/">Steam page</a>, if you want to try it for yourself. </p>



<p>At the time, I wrote, <em>"Bloodthief is a classic, simple-looking, 2-feet-wide, 10-feet-deep kind of game. If you want to dig into the parkour mechanics and push them to their limits, what I've played of its levels so far shows that there's plenty for you to dig into. Even in the opening levels, I was finding alternate paths through the parkouring by simply thinking 'I can make that jump,' and figuring out that I could, if I was nimble enough. It's not the same one-hit-kill style combat as Ghostrunner, but it still plays within the same realm of you can only take so many hits before you have to go back to the checkpoint. I also appreciate the shift from a high-gloss, neon-light-filled cyberpunk world to a muted, medieval setting. It makes the dark red blood really stand out, and it's just more fun to watch armored knights flailing their swords and running at you at full sprint.</em>"</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/capcom-pragmata-mega-man-conspiracy-theory-debunked-2000621414</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/capcom-producer-laughed-and-said-no-when-asked-if-pragmata-is-a-secret-mega-man-game.1284348/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For many months now, some fans online have suggested that <a href="https://kotaku.com/onimusha-way-sword-pragmata-resident-evil-9-preview-2000618849">Capcom’s upcoming sci-fi adventure <em>Pragmata</em></a> is actually a secret<em> Mega Man r</em>eboot. However, <em>Pragmata’s</em> producer says it is not, even laughing about the conspiracy theory when recently asked about it.</p> <p>Fans and content creators online have spread this theory around for a while. Many point out that <em>Pragmata’s</em> cybergirl sidekick, Diana, shares a lot of design elements with Mega Man<em>,</em> with her coat lending her the robot’s signature color and her arm expanding during some moments in a way reminiscent of the Blue Bomber’s oversized blaster arm. There’s also the game’s narrative setup, which involves evil robots. <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/capcom-settles-it-no-pragmata-isnt-a-secret-mega-man-game/">But, in a recent interview with&nbsp;<em>VGC</em></a><em>,</em> <em>Pragmata’s</em> producer Naoto Oyama completely denied this theory.</p> <p>“<em>Pragmata</em> is not a <em>Mega Man</em> game,” said Oyama. <em>VGC</em> also reports he was laughing as he answered the question. He then added, “It is a completely new game from Capcom.</p>

 <p>“I was actually one of the producers on the <em>Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collectio</em>n as well, so I’m happy to see that people who love <em>Mega Man</em> are passionate about <em>Pragmata</em> too,” Oyama told the outlet. “From my standpoint, it’s nice to see people are being so positive about it.”</p> <p>So that seems like a definitive no. However, I expect some fans will claim that Capcom is lying. That, <em>of course</em>, they won’t confirm <em>Pragmata’s</em> connection to <em>Mega Man</em>. It’s supposed to be a big secret, so Capcom will deny it until <em>Pragmata</em> launches sometime in 2026. (<a href="https://kotaku.com/capcom-pragmata-delay-delayed-2023-2024-ps5-xbox-pc-1850531732">Remember when this game was revealed in 2020 and was supposed to be out in 2022?</a>)</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="PRAGMATA – Announcement Trailer, Extended Cut | Next Gen (2022)" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZJxXPZGmTzY?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>However, I’d argue that Capcom knows how much people want new<em> Mega Man</em> games, and if they were making one, they’d be shouting about it from the rooftops. Also, keep in mind that Capcom isn’t above referencing and hinting at other games in their new IPs. <a href="https://kotaku.com/exoprimal-dino-crisis-reboot-sequel-dinosaur-shooter-ca-1849066060">We saw this happen with <em>Exoprimal</em></a>, which many fans were convinced was a <em>Dino Crisis</em> game. And to fans’ credit, Capcom did include a woman with red hair in a debut trailer for the game about dinosaurs. So I’m not surprised there’s some <em>Mega Man</em> inspiration in <em>Pragmata</em>. Capcom really needs people to remember this game exists and care about it in 2026. And what better way to do that than by sprinkling a few references to something much more popular and hoping the fans take the bait.</p> <p>Anyway, even if <em>Pragmata</em> isn’t a <em>Mega Man</em> game (and I really don’t think it is), the game sounds like it might be an interesting throwback to the kind of linear action games we got back in the 2010s on Xbox 360 and PS3. <a href="https://kotaku.com/pragmata-capcom-preview-summer-game-fest-impressions-1851784342">Here’s what our own Kenneth Shepard thought about it when he played it earlier this year</a>:</p> <blockquote><p><em>Pragmata&nbsp;</em>feels a bit like a game out of time, as its gruff old man protagonist, slow-moving enemies, and brutalist sci-fi aesthetic are all evocative of the over-the-shoulder shooters from the PS360 era. Given those seemingly bygone qualities, it’d be easy for&nbsp;<em>Pragmata&nbsp;</em>to feel rote and dated, but what I played was just inventive enough to feel novel. I was super impressed with it.</p></blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Predecessor is getting it’s next big update next week. Developer Omeda Studios has announced that version 1.8 of the free-to-play MOBA will go live on September 2nd. The update introduces a new map mechanic called World Shift and adds a highly anticipated hero, Demon King Akeron.</p>



<p>World Shift is a mechanic that changes the battlefield in real time. During a match, paths, objectives, and environmental hazards can appear or disappear, keeping teams on their toes. </p>



<p><strong>“This isn’t just a visual upgrade,”</strong> Omeda says. <strong>“The World Shift reshapes strategy on the fly, demanding swift adaptation and tight teamwork.”</strong></p>



<p>Aside from the new mechanic, Akeron joins Predecessor as a tank/off-lane/jungle hero with a playstyle all his own. He can climb walls to strike from above and focuses on controlling areas while staying strong in extended fights. Players can tweak his passive, ultimate, and movement abilities to suit different strategies. Akeron is part of the ongoing Ashes of the Damned storyline, bringing the next chapter of the game’s story to life.</p>



<p>While those are the two major additions, Predecessor Version 1.8 also sees the launch of a new ranked season, battlepass updates, and even the launch in a new location: Japan. With the launch of the game in Japan, players will have a dedicated Asia server to provide the best connection possible. </p>



<p>Lastly, performance updates for the new with 1.8 include support for Nvidia DLSS with AMD FSR support coming later. Additional changes cover improvements to the in-game store, user interface, and mini-map.</p>



<p>Predecessor’s 1.8 Update launches on September 2nd for all players. Let us know if you plan on checking it out in the comments below.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Valkyrie Profile is celebrating its 25-year anniversary today, August 29, 2025. Below, we look back at why the RPG went overlooked at the time, and what makes it still stand out as special today.</em></p><p dir="ltr">It's not hard to see why Valkyrie Profile wound up overlooked in its initial North American release. Japanese publisher Enix had only recently revived its US branch, likely due to both the surge of popularity of JRPGs in the post-Final Fantasy 7 era and the success Sony had licensing and releasing Star Ocean: The Second Story globally. But it was going to be an uphill struggle to get a new PS1 RPG any traction, even one made by Star Ocean 2 developer Tri-Ace. The Dreamcast was already out, the US launch of the PS2 was less than two months away, and Squaresoft had dropped Chrono Cross, a follow-up to the beloved Chrono Trigger, a couple of weeks earlier.</p><p dir="ltr">It was my freshman year of college, the weekend just before my birthday, and I wanted a new RPG to keep me occupied between classes. I had two choices: Valkyrie Profile or Chrono Cross. After having a delightful experience with Star Ocean 2 the summer before, my gut was telling me that Valkyrie Profile was the one I should pick.</p><p dir="ltr">I have never once regretted my purchase. Valkyrie Profile was--and still is--one of the greatest RPGs of its era, a game that--despite universal acclaim from its many devoted fans--remains criminally underplayed. It's been 25 years, and there's still nothing else that captures the same magic.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4558972-valkyrie_profile__lenneth_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4558972" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4558972-valkyrie_profile__lenneth_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4558972"></a><figcaption>The enhanced port Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4558972-valkyrie_profile__lenneth_1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As you might surmise from the title, Valkyrie Profile's setting is built around concepts inspired by Norse mythology--with a good deal of creative wiggle room, of course. Lenneth, the titular Valkyrie, has been summoned to the service of the great god Odin, ruler of the heavenly realm of Asgard. He has learned that the mythical Ragnarok is nigh, and between that and the Aesir gods' struggle with the Vanir heating up, they need manpower in the form of worthy human souls: einherjar. Lenneth must find the worthy souls of the recently departed on the lower plane of Midgard to train and transfer to Asgard before the gods' final confrontation. There are also plenty of messes on Midgard to clean up, however--the undead seeping in from Niflheim, a rebellious former einherjar, and humans overstepping their boundaries.</p><p dir="ltr">It's clear from the outset that, in contrast to the gilded realm of the gods, Midgard is a den of abject misery. Villages exist on the brink of catastrophic collapse. Desperation has led to many partaking in dangerous activities to make a living. Illicit trades like smuggling, thievery, and even human trafficking thrive in this harsh, bleak realm, and many seem to live day to day with one foot already in the grave. You can't help but wonder if the cataclysm of Ragnarok might be a small mercy to end all the suffering that's seen.</p><p dir="ltr">Lenneth, with the gift of spiritual concentration, can sense the struggles and anguish of the departed. When she comes to take their soul under her wing, she sees what their final days of existence were like, their tragic fates laid bare. Her first recruits involve a haughty princess and a gruff mercenary who find themselves caught up in a convoluted plot by a traitorous noble--one that dooms them both. More tragedies follow. A warrior strikes a faustian bargain to cure his sister's blindness, only to perish at the hands of his inner demons. A headmistress at a magic academy finds herself slaughtered by her own husband, transformed into a monster by a vengeful student. Those are just a handful. Not every death feels undeserved, as not everyone who Lenneth recruits is a particularly good person. It's their usefulness to Odin that matters--and Lenneth can help shape them into the perfect fighters.</p><p dir="ltr">Knowledge of Midgard's geopolitical environment can be gleaned from the interwoven sagas of the departed, and while the gods generally care little about most human affairs, Lenneth encounters numerous personalities that shake up her ongoing mission. There's an einherjar who seems oddly familiar with Lenneth. Then there's Brahms, the lord of the undead, who appears to hold someone important to Lenneth and the gods hostage to prevent them from destroying him. And, of course, sorcerer wunderkind Lezard Valeth: The only thing worse than his creepy obsession with making the Valkyrie "his" are the immoral means he'll stoop to to make that happen.</p><p dir="ltr">The ever-present tragedy of Valkyrie Profile helps set it apart from most other RPGs of the era, but a lot of what makes it feel special to this day are its unique interlocking gameplay mechanics. One of these is the game's distinct structure. Exploration is largely freeform, allowing you to visit areas, recruit einherjar, and delve into dungeons when you see fit. Progression is instead dictated by a timer system: The game's chapters are divided into a set number of "periods," and actions--recruitment, exploration, resting--all have a set time cost. When you reach the end of that chapter's periods, Lenneth receives an evaluation from Asgard. Actions performed during the chapter, such as sending suitable einherjar and lost artifacts to Asgard, count towards your evaluation. Perform well, and you get rewarded. Then you move on to the next chapter. While some characters and areas only become available in certain chapters, you're usually not obligated to complete anything as soon as it appears, giving you a lot of freedom.</p><p dir="ltr">Another defining gameplay characteristic are the dungeons. These are presented as 2D, sidescrolling platformer-style affairs, laden with traps, enemies, jumps, and gimmicks. They often feature bespoke obstacles and tricks that Lenneth will need to overcome, adding an element of puzzle-solving to the platforming action. Fortunately, Lenneth has a handy little tool to help: a crystal projectile. This offers a wide variety of uses: temporarily freezing enemies, creating barriers and platforms, even refracting light or manipulating objects from afar. She can also perform advanced movement techniques by building and shattering crystals in various ways, propelling her into hidden enclaves (and allowing for some fun speed tech).</p><p dir="ltr">But Valkyrie Profile's most memorably distinctive element is its combat. Tri-Ace's previous Star Ocean games added an element of action gameplay to the usual RPG proceedings, and Valkyrie Profile does something similar in concept, yet entirely different in execution. Each turn of combat sees you controlling four characters, one assigned to each face button. Depending on the weapons you've equipped, each character will have access to certain set attacks, which they will execute when you press a button. Some attacks have special properties, such as breaking an enemy's guard or launching them airborne for juggles. Land enough hits in a turn and you'll fill a gauge, allowing you to unleash one of your party member's ultimate attacks. With some strategy and practice, you can learn to chain combos and supers similarly to the way you would in a fighting game.</p><p dir="ltr">However, the enemies won't always make it easy--they'll guard, parry, and sidestep when they can, upsetting your combat flow and making them much more challenging to slay. Observing and figuring out the properties of your attacks--how they hit, how many hits they have, if they can juggle or damage enemies on the ground--is crucial to both defeat strong enemies and earn lots of post-combat rewards. Learning how the enemies react to your attacks and conduct offense on their turn is important, as well, since you can also dodge, counter, and guard, provided you've got the appropriate skills. As cool as this might sound, I'm actually oversimplifying the combat: There's a tremendous amount of skill and nuance here that will challenge RPG vets and seasoned action-game players alike.</p><p dir="ltr">An in-depth skill system bolsters Valkyrie Profile's gameplay depth. Not only does learning skills help characters in combat, but they also raise characters' Hero Value and give them positive traits, making them more suitable for service in Valhalla. Passive character skills grant stat boosts, remove negative character traits, and tend to come as specific requests from the gods. Combat skills include auto-heals and low-HP survival techniques, counterattacks, added effects to normal strikes (like splash damage and extra hits), and powerful techniques to catch enemies unaware.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4558973-valkyrie_profile__lenneth_3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4558973" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4558973-valkyrie_profile__lenneth_3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4558973"></a><figcaption>The enhanced port Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4558973-valkyrie_profile__lenneth_3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>WARNING: Spoilers for Valkyrie Profile's ending, including its true ending, follow.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Everything culminates in the game's final chapter, where Lenneth leads the einherjar in an assault on the Vanir stronghold. When she emerges triumphant, you might expect a glorious celebration in Valhalla. But that's not what you get. The ending you receive for this stellar performance is… bland. And short. Eerily so, as if there's something being hidden from you. And there is! Valkyrie Profile is a multi-ending game, and part of why it remains so strongly in the memory of players is the trick it pulls on them.</p><p dir="ltr">The key to obtaining the true, best ending in the game is a radical departure from what players are often led to expect. It's easy to assume that performing the tasks the game sets out for you exceptionally well would yield greater rewards, and thus, a better ending. But that's not what Valkyrie Profile does. Instead, Valkyrie Profile wants you to question and doubt your assigned task.</p><p dir="ltr">There are hints throughout that Odin and the gods are not entirely noble, seeing humanity as merely useful tools for their battle and service. By strictly following the orders that Odin has given her, Lenneth plays right into his hands, acting as his obedient pawn. But what if Lenneth disobeyed? Obviously, outright rebellion under the watchful eye of a powerful god would put her directly in his crosshairs for elimination.</p><p dir="ltr">What the player must do to free Lenneth from Odin's control is stage small acts of rebellion over time: sending up only the required number of einherjar, deciding to keep some of the gods' sacred treasures found in dungeons, visiting places tied to a forgotten past. Even the simple act of removing the ring Odin bestowed upon Lenneth when consulting with Asgard between chapters will help break his sway over her. Lower the Seal Value enough, and when you enter a certain area in Chapter 7, a series of dramatic events will occur, ushering in a moment of reckoning for Lenneth with the fate of all the realms hanging in the balance.</p><p dir="ltr">The unique requirements to access this ending was quite a shock to players when the game first released, and even now, it stands out. We're conditioned to do what we're told will get us praise and rewards in games, rarely stopping to question why we're doing it. Valkyrie Profile, in contrast, only reveals the full truth about its world to those who deliberately and defiantly play around its core systems.</p><p dir="ltr">Valkyrie Profile has had sequels, spin-offs, and spiritual successors, as well as giving inspiration to many games that followed. Some of these games have been excellent in their own right, others not so much. But all of the games that have come since have deviated in some way from the original gameplay elements that helped make Valkyrie Profile the fantastic experience that it is. Perhaps it's just a case of lighting in a bottle--the world of games and game development have changed so much since its original release that you can't recapture the same magic. That's why its lack of availability on modern platforms is so tragic: only a compromised mobile port and a PS4/5 re-release of the PSP version exist. I can only hope that changes eventually, because there's nothing else like Valkyrie Profile, and there probably never will be. When I first played it all those years ago on PS1, I was entranced. A quarter of a century later, I still am.</p>

<p>"Yooka-Replaylee is built to shine on every platform, and we're chuffed to bits it's on Switch 2 from day one, it holds a special place in our hearts (and hands)," said Gavin Price, studio director at Playtonic."It's bigger, brighter, bolder, and packed with all the little touches we always dreamed of. We can't wait for players to jump in."</p>
<p>"It's rare to see a game get this kind of second life - not as a remaster, but as a true reinvention," added Ami Blaire, chief marketing officer at PM Studios. "It's the kind of release that reminds you why I fell in love with platform games in the first place."</p>

<p>On Yooka-Replaylee's release, fans can expect the following key features:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li><strong>REFINED STORY</strong> - The events of the first game are relived and retold by the main characters, Yooka and Laylee. New sequences and plot points have been added throughout the adventure at key milestones too.</li>
<li><strong>MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN EVER</strong> - With an art and animations overhaul and enhanced performance and resolution, the favourite buddy duo has never looked or moved better.</li>
<li><strong>BRAND-NEW REXTRO'S ARCADE</strong> - The old minigames are no more! Instead you'll jump into the feet of Rextro the dinosaur and undertake brand-new isometric platforming challenges for collectible rewards.</li>
<li><strong>NEW COLLECTIBLE CURRENCY</strong> - Capital B's inept minions have dropped their hard-earned coins all over the place. Collect the official currency of the Hivory Towers to spend on video games' most beloved sentient vending Machine.</li>
<li><strong>VENDI HAS PLENTY TO OFFER</strong> - Tonics are back with all new flavours! With the option to equip multiple game-changing enhancements, you can truly customise your playstyle. And as if that wasn't enough, Vendi has new lines of merchandise for the modern fashionable adventurer.</li>
<li><strong>NAVIGATING THE WORLD</strong> - Yooka-Replaylee introduces a brand-new map and collectibles tracker, making it easier for you to traverse the environments, track NPC and Pagie locations along with tracking their progress. We're also introducing a new character in the form of (book)Mark who acts as your warp point and guide.</li>
<li><strong>REVISED CONTROLS &amp; CAMERA</strong> - The buddy-duo now has access to their entire move set from the start of the game and can sequence the moves together a lot smoother than in the original game. This combined with the revamped camera controls makes Yooka-Replaylee feel like a lot more modern, snappier experience while also directly addressing player feedback on the original game.</li>
<li><strong>A DREAMY ORCHESTRAL SOUNDTRACK</strong> - The original score from famed video game composers Grant Kirkhope (Banjo-Kazooie) and David Wise (Donkey Kong Country) returns but as a beautifully arranged orchestral score. Now seriously, clean out those ears.</li>
</ul>

<p>"Right now, and after only a short time with it, Yooka-Replaylee is something I can absolutely picture children perhaps a little younger than my own - who are 12 and 10 - whiling away some pleasurable hours with," I said in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/has-playtonic-done-enough-to-entice-players-back-to-the-world-of-yooka-replaylee-i-think-it-depends-on-the-price">Eurogamer's Yooka-Replaylee preview</a>.</p>
<p>"There are items to collect, secrets to discover, baddies to bop and the colours are a kaleidoscope of joy. Even though overall it was relatively simple, it made me chuckle and smile."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Silksong </em>has sent ripples through the indie game world simply by existing. Just last week, all manner of mice and men were on the verge of deploying their best laid plans, but now with the long-dormant juggernaut suddenly days away from release, everyone else has <a href="https://aftermath.site/silksong-indie-delays" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">run for the hills</a> – even bigger names like <em>Baby Steps</em>, the new game from <em>Getting Over It </em>creator Bennett Foddy, and <em>Demonschool</em>, a promising-looking <em>Persona</em>-esque tactics RPG by a team of indie vets. These games are nothing like <em>Silksong</em>; were they really in danger of getting steamrolled? On the latest Aftermath Hours, we talk to <em>Demonschool</em>’s creative director about retreating and living to fight another day.</p><p>This time around, we’re joined by Brandon Sheffield of Necrosoft to discuss the aforementioned delay and the climate surrounding it. While <em>Demonschool</em>’s publisher, rather than development team, ultimately made the call, they’re far from alone in rolling out the red carpet for the long-awaited indie darling and then sprinting full force in the opposite direction. Will <em>Silksong </em>really suck all the air out of the room, though? Or are developers overreacting?</p><p>Then we talk about two pieces of news in what has proven to be a banner week for unions: IGN workers, worn down after multiple rounds of layoffs, have <a href="https://aftermath.site/ign-layoffs-union-action-ziff-davis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">resolved to do their jobs</a> – and no more – for the next six months. Meanwhile, the hundreds-strong dev team behind <em>Diablo </em>has <a href="https://aftermath.site/diablo-union-activision-blizzard-microsoft-cwa-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">formed a union of their own</a>, and they’re hoping to secure layoff and AI protections, as well as pay equity. Finally, we reminisce about the last time we dug a hole.</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can dig an even deeper hole.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Y’all’s publisher made the announcement that <em>Demonschool </em>was delayed, and the impression I got is that that was not necessarily your preferred decision.</p><p><strong>Brandon: </strong>Yeah, we had a discussion with them about it, so they didn’t just blindside us. We talked about it, and I was more in favor of staying, but I understand why they wanted to move. Our game, <em>Demonschool</em>, is an RPG, basically. It’s an RPG with tactical battles, so you could argue that it doesn’t intersect with <em>Silksong</em> – which is sort of what I was arguing [with the publisher]. But the fact is, if you want to make decent money off your game – which, at this point, when you’ve been working on it for a bunch of years, you have to. I wish we didn’t live in a capitalist society, but guess what? We do. So I’ve gotta make a certain amount of money, we’re gonna run out of money, etc.</p><p>If you want to [make money], your best shot is at being the indie game of the week that is getting discussed. And if that doesn’t happen, you’ll lose out on all the curious people.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>There’s that whole school of thought that if you’re not competing directly with a game genre-wise on Steam, then you’re not necessarily in the clear, but you’re probably OK. For the piece I wrote last week about people contemplating delaying their games, I talked to Simon Carless, who does a lot of analysis of Steam and discoverability more generally, and that was his larger thesis. He was like “Well, I think that indies sort of overrate how important your release window is, especially relative to other games.” If <em>Demonschool </em>was a Metroidvania, that’d be one thing, but why delay something like <em>Demonschool</em>, which is substantially different than <em>Silksong </em>if conventional wisdom – at least from one guy who looks at a lot of numbers – is that you don’t necessarily need to?</p><p><strong>Brandon: </strong>One of the weird things about games is, not that many other industries do this thing where we try to get out of each others’ way. So there’s an argument that maybe you don’t have to. Film industry does it. Books don’t. Music doesn’t. But games are really long; they take a lot of time. So mindshare can last a long time. And like I said, it is ultimately about the people who are just curious. You want to break out into people who like games in general – not just the genre fans. The people who like games in general are gonna be looking at the most popular thing at that time.&nbsp;</p><p>But I felt like, yeah, maybe people could buy two games. Maybe there’s people who don’t want to play <em>Silksong</em>. Maybe there’s people who want to play something else, and maybe it’s a good opportunity for us to be that other thing. But the problem is, you can’t prove any of those without A/B testing it, which you can’t do, because you either release it or you don’t.</p><p>It’s hard to know what to do, so you’ve just gotta use your best judgement and your best guess. And in a way, the delay is good for us. It’s annoying, but in a way it’s good because the publisher’s paying for it, so we get paid for a little longer, and we’re able to really polish stuff.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I remember, last week especially, when the first delay announcements were starting to trickle in, some people were saying, “Oh, developers don’t seriously think they need to delay their games; they’re just doing it for the free press. They’re doing it because it will get them mentioned in articles alongside <em>Silksong</em>, and then they’ll gain more visibility.” My impression is that that was not really the case?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Brandon:</strong> Nobody was doing that. The gains you get from that are so minimal compared to anything else, like a Steam Next Fest or something. Announcing a delay is not a positive news beat. We got some wishlists out of it, and we tried to turn it into a positive, but what you wind up getting on social media is a bunch of people dumping on you, basically. There were a lot of people who were nice about it, but it’s hard not to focus on the ones who are saying mean things or being like “I don’t care.” There’s the whole spectrum of stuff you get from existing on the internet. So I don’t think it would be anybody’s first choice as a promotional vehicle.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> It also goes back to what you were saying earlier, where you kind of naturally incur more costs if you delay, because that’s time that you’re not making money off the release.</p><p><strong>Brandon:</strong> Yeah, and it’s more copies that we have to sell. The more the game costs, the more we have to make back in order to break even. That’s also a factor, and that’s why we try to self-fund as much as possible as well, so that we don’t have to have a big amount to recoup. It’s very scary. When you have a publisher, you’re not going into actual debt, because they’re paying for it, and if it doesn’t sell, they’re on the hook for that.</p><p>But there is an emotional debt that at least I feel, where I feel a responsibility to make that money back. And maybe that’s weird and naive, but I just want to do right by people who have tried to believe in me and the team, and I want them to succeed as well off of this. And so we’ve gotta sell 100,000 copies to break even.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Is that the real number, or just a hypothetical one?</p><p><strong>Brandon:</strong> That’s a real number.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Wow, that’s a lot of copies.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Brandon: </strong>We’ve been working on it a long time! When you’ve got a team of five-to-seven people, and they make a bare-minimum-to-survive-in-a-city type of wage, that’s a lot of multiplication that you do on numbers to keep that thing going.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Then you have to take into account the overall economics of Steam. How many games these days sell that number of copies? It can’t be a lot.</p><p><strong>Brandon: </strong>It’s not. There’s a lot of pressure to make sure you’re presenting the game in the way that will sell the most, because there’s so much to make back – so many copies you have to sell. Obviously the first thing you have to do is make the game good, but then there’s so much other stuff around that that has to happen in order for your game to be seen and positioned in such a way that people will know to buy it, know that they want to buy it, know that it exists at all.</p><p>It’s frustrating because we’ve really tried very hard to let people know that this game exists, but all the promotional vehicles have scattered to the four winds. It used to be that you could go viral on Twitter, and there you’d be. Now Twitter’s a nazi hellscape. Someone can do great on TikTok, but you can’t manufacture that; someone who’s already popular has to pick you up and do something cool. There’s all this nonsense that you have to think about.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/long-story-short-bojack-netflix"><h3>Long Story Short Is A Lot, In A Good Way</h3></a><p>The new family drama from the creators of Bojack Horseman is funny, moving, and just the right amount of intense</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/vivi-is-screwing-up-magic-the-gathering-and-you-know-what-good-for-him"><h3>Vivi Is Screwing Up Magic: The Gathering, And You Know What?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>When&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/21/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-review/">The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</a> launched, Kazutaka Kodaka joked that his studio Tookyo Games might go bankrupt if the game didn’t do well. Thankfully, the massive visual novel experience ended up doing so well he later clarified that the team no longer felt that bankruptcy was a possibility. Despite that, it felt like it might take a miracle for the team to be able to put out another game if they were so close to shuttering after completing this one. As it turns out, Kazutaka Kodaka treated us like the victims in his own infamous twist-filled mystery thriller games. He quickly announced the development of a new game alongside DMM Games and Spike Chunsoft where the gimmick is that it is actually five different games in one – and that smorgasbord title is called Shuten Order.</p>
<p><iframe title="SHUTEN ORDER Gameplay Intro Trailer (Nintendo Switch, Steam)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JLlfmevjGAk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While I loved&nbsp;The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy&nbsp;a lot, it felt all too familiar as a fan of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/danganronpa">Danganronpa</a>&nbsp;series. Perhaps that’s because it shares so much of a visual and auditory identity with those games. Perhaps it’s because the game kicks off with all-too-familiar mysteries of locked classrooms and quirky teens that it drags it’s feet expanding into truly original ideas. None of it was bad, just familiar.&nbsp;Shuten Order,&nbsp;by comparison, is a revelation.</p>


<p>It finally feels like Kazutaka Kodaka is doing something fresh and new with this game, and there’s a lot of reasons for that. For one, the entire plot setup is refreshingly unique – our protagonist wakes up in a mysterious hotel room with no memory of their identity or their past. Two self-proclaimed angels tell her that she has been murdered, but they placed her in a new temporary body and have given her the alias of Rei with the goal of completing “God’s trial”. The task? Interrogate five key members from a mysterious organization known as Shuten Order, discover which of them is our killer, then get them to confess. Oh, and kill them too.</p>


<p>In the opening hours of&nbsp;Shuten Order,&nbsp;layers of dubious explanations and hauntingly under-explained world details are stacked on top of each other at a staggering rate. Before you can even question who these angels are if they’re real, you’re also grappling with learning that you live in a city-state founded by a religious cult – then, before the dubiousness of that can even sink in, it’s hinted that the world outside of this mini-country is a literal apocalypse. Despite the ominous circumstances of the game’s world, the streets are lined with confetti and festival banners celebrating the heroes of the Shuten Order. A cutscene shows you the celebrations playing out, but the cacophony quickly goes from just loud to overbearingly chaotic – voices and cheers and sounds overlap in an overwhelming, barely decipherable mess.</p>
<p>There’s a really hauntingly beautiful sort of cluttered chaos to the entire aesthetic of the game that is unlike anything else I’ve seen. Stylish title cards outlining the day and time explode onto the screen regularly, and when your protagonist uses the mysterious “power of God” to make unexpected miracles or coincidences occur, a terrifying animatic of inhuman language and shapes and sounds pops onto screen that seems to represent some kind of representation of whatever god is helping you. Most of the game is represented by talking character portraits and subtly stylised text boxes that look like a regular video game, but when these alarming animatics pop in, it really adds to this sense of urgency and strangeness that elevates the game so much.</p>

<p>Your guardian angels prompt you to pick one of the five leaders of the Shuten Order to identify as your killer – the implication is that your choice is guided by divine will, and whoever you pick&nbsp;is&nbsp;the killer. Whoever you pick also dictates an entirely different gameplay experience you’ll be going through as you investigate their secrets and hunt their confession. Kishiru Inugami makes you play an Ace Attorney-style investigation game. Yugen Ushitora has you playing an all-too-familiar death game escape adventure. Teko Ion’s route takes the form of a flowchart-exploring non-linear visual novel.&nbsp;Honoka Kokushikan’s route is a high-stress twist on a dating sim visual novel. Most striking of all, though is Manji Fushicho’s story – which isn’t a 2D visual novel genre-spin at all, but instead a fully 3D top-down stealth horror game.</p>
<p>I started off with Honoka Kokushikan’s route, intrigued by the idea of a romantic adventure, but I was initially disappointed by how it felt identical to the base game. Characters joke about how “different” the world looks once you step into her route, but all that’s really changed is that your text boxes are a slightly different shape. Thankfully, over the course of her 6-ish hour route, a lot of unique gameplay ideas start to crop up and you’re given a satisfying amount of freedom to explore the weirdness of the route. Each of the five routes clocks in at a similar length of time, and they all do a surprisingly good job of fully committing to their bits and giving you a full-games worth of mechanical depth and mix-ups. About half the routes feel whole enough in terms of narrative to come across as their own intriguing little mystery games, but the other half are so clearly part of a larger puzzle and don’t fully stand up on their own. Special shout-out to Yugen Ushitora’s escape-room route, because it’s inexplicably formatted like a vtuber livestream with a 3D anime girl reacting to everything in the corner while her chat pops off above her head.</p>

<p>As a complete experience, Shuten Order does unfortunately fall into a very similar trap as a lot of other works by Kazutaka Kodaka – there are really fascinating ideas and twists presented in the game, but character dialogue is so overbearing in repeatedly explaining and clarifying every interaction that it feels like this sometimes-exhausting 50 hour experience could have been a much swifter, snappier, and more satisfying 30-35 hour adventure. Like his other games though, the sheer creativity and one-of-a-kind aesthetic in this game ends up making the sometimes mind-numbing dialogue worth digging through. Shuten Order blends quiet tension with loud and anxiety-inducing frights perfectly without ever even acting like it’s a horror game. It isn’t, except for that one route where it is. It’s just an amalgamation of overwhelming sights and sounds that’s equal parts beautiful and confusing. It’s an uncompromising experience, and one I won’t forget for a long time.</p>

<figure><a title="SHUTEN ORDER Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158313/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>Leave it up to Kazutaka Kodaka to come up with one of the weirdest stories in gaming, huh?</p>
<p>Following on from the outrageously ambitious <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">The Hundred Line - Last Defense Academy</a>, the creator has now joined forces with developer Neilo on the new visual novel <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shuten_order">Shuten Order</a>. I say ‘visual novel’, and that’s absolutely the overarching genre, but it also manages to feature five distinct sub-genres within its surprisingly lengthy story. Wild stuff.</p>
<p>Shuten Order itself is the titular cult obsessed with the idea that humanity itself is doomed. In fact, the cult not only believes that the end of times is at hand, but is actively <em>wishing</em> for it, rejecting any notion of an afterlife or an all-seeing deity. In what can only be described as divine intervention, however, its founder awakens following their brutal murder, seemingly resurrected to track down the culprit. If that’s not enough, two angels also accompany you throughout the game to provide advice and guidance. Could the cult be...wrong?</p>
<figure><a title="SHUTEN ORDER Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158315/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>With just a few days on the clock before your resurrection ‘expires’, you’re tasked with completing ‘God’s Trial’: identify your murderer, get them to confess, and then, well… kill them. The potential suspects are limited to just five individuals: Shuten Order’s ministers, each of whom presides over a specific department. So you’ve got the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Education, and so on.</p>
<p>Once you’ve chosen which of the five ministers to accuse of your murder, you’ll have to pursue them and try to gain a confession, and it’s here where the gameplay diverges into one of five sub-genres.</p>
<p>I started with the Ministry of Security, which essentially sees you working to solve the mystery of a deadly entity called ‘Nephilim’, a grotesque creature that stalks its prey and gouges their eyes out. Lovely stuff. The Security path sees you navigate a series of labyrinths set in different locations as you progress through the story. It’s mostly a case of finding an item or activating a switch and then making it to a final destination without being caught by Nephilim, who constantly shuffles along the corridors. It’s shallow stuff with some pretty basic 3D visuals, and on its own doesn’t really hold up all that well.</p>
<figure><a title="SHUTEN ORDER Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158311/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In fact, the same could very well be said for every sub-genre: The Ministry of Education focuses on a romance story in which you need to woo three women within a typical school setting; The Ministry of Health is an escape adventure focused around a ‘death game’ that fans of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/danganronpa_decadence">Danganronpa</a> will no doubt appreciate; The Ministry of Justice is a straightforward investigation in which you need to gather clues and deduce the correct course of action; and finally, The Ministry of Science is a multi-perspective visual novel that features several ‘protagonists’.</p>
<p>None of the gameplay tropes feel particularly new, and pretty much all of them can be seen in Kodaka’s previous work, but I guess you could say that this is the first time they’ve all been cobbled together in one single game. With that in mind, if you’re familiar with the likes of Dangaronpa or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/zero_escape_virtues_last_reward">Zero Escape</a>, then much of Shuten Order will be pretty familiar territory.</p>
<p>Despite the marketing push to highlight the different sub-genres, the overarching story is really the main draw here. As you start to unravel the mystery, you’ll meet some seriously entertaining characters along the way, and Kodaka’s writing alongside illustrator simadoriru’s visual design is consistently striking and unique.</p>
<figure><a title="SHUTEN ORDER Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158307/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Where Shuten Order begins to falter is in its execution of those sub-genres. Kodaka <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/unsettling-yet-captivating-shuten-order-creators-talk-cult-religion-and-dismemberment">has stated</a> his ambition to present a “culmination of all the visual novels I've ever read”, and it’s certainly an ambitious attempt, but the approach here screams ‘Jack of all trades’.</p>
<p>The five different branches wind up feeling little more than a novelty, and not a particularly compelling one. I mentioned how the Security path features basic visuals, but this is nothing compared to how simple and mundane the actual gameplay is. The devs want you to feel nervous as you avoid the gaze of Nephilim, but there's zero challenge, and it ends up just being a nuisance.</p>
<p>Similarly, the romance path has you searching (stalking?) for your potential date, with the game presenting multiple locations to visit, but not giving much indication as to where you actually need to go. So you wind up just guessing until you reach the right goal, forced to engage in random NPC conversations if you happen to search in the wrong place. This isn't a game that respects your time.</p>
<figure><a title="SHUTEN ORDER Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158312/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s not a short one, either. The length will vary depending on how much you’re willing to invest in the story and investigate every possible avenue, but each of the five narrative branches could easily take you 10 hours or so. At a total of 50, Shuten Order felt quite bloated and would have benefited from focusing on just one or two key gameplay hooks to tell its story. Coming off the back of The Hundred Line, which demonstrated an exceptionally strong combination of visual novel storytelling and tactical gameplay, the attempt to showcase several different genres here means that none of them are really able to shine.</p>
<p>What <em>does</em> shine, however, is the visual design. Shuten Order displays exceptional use of colour that really sets it apart from other visual novels, and the juxtaposition of the striking blues, yellows, and pinks against a story steeped in misery and despair is particularly notable.</p>
<p>Similarly, the music is consistently engaging, shifting in tone at all the right moments, while the Japanese voiceover work never falters. There’s no Western VO here, however, so you’re out of luck if you happen to prefer your Japanese visual novels dubbed.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, it all runs well on the Switch, with reasonably short load times. If you happen to be playing on the Switch 2, then you won't find any issues with performance, but you should note that character illustrations at certain distances can look almost pixelated, slightly – a simple symptom of blowing up the Switch 1 game's handled resolution on the larger 1080p screen. If you can, play it on the Switch OLED; the colours look simply marvellous on that stunning display.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Shuten Order is an ambitious visual novel that tells an intriguing story with consistently engaging characters and more than a few twists and turns. Unfortunately, with the inclusion of five distinct forms of gameplay driving the story, it ultimately feels bloated and directionless, and not one of the sub-genre sections is polished enough to stand on its own two feet.</p>
<p>I wholeheartedly commend the audacious, multi-genre effort, but Shuten Order would have benefited from a lot more focus.</p></section>

			<p>After initially launching in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2530490/Lost_Eidolons_Veil_of_the_Witch/">early access</a> in November 2024, Lost Eidolons: Veil of the Witch will make its v1.0 debut this coming October 9, 2025, arriving on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch. Pre-orders are now live for players who want to be there day one on consoles, and if you want to try it before taking the plunge, new demos have been released on PlayStation and Xbox. There's already a demo available on Steam.</p>



<p>The tactical roguelite RPG is the studio's follow-up to its turn-based tactical RPG, Lost Eidolons, <a href="https://wccftech.com/turn-based-tactical-rpg-lost-eidolons-launches-on-october-13th/">which launched in 2022</a> and is already available on PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo consoles alongside the PC version.</p>



<p>A new trailer for Veil of the Witch debuted along with the release date, showcasing elements of the game's story and combat.</p>

<p>Lost Eidolons: Veil of the Witch puts you in the boots of a shipwrecked warrior who is trying to recover their memories. A witch's proposal sends them on a quest to slaughter anyone who stands against the witch with the promise of gaining their life and memories back.</p>



<p>Veil of the Witch will be Ocean Drive's second release of the year, after the launch of rougelite shooter <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2111870/Section_13/">Section 13</a> this past May. The studio also has a physics-based, third-person, semi-open-world-looking game, God Save Birmingham, in development, where you try to survive an undead horde in the 14th century.</p>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/duskers">Duskers</a> developers Misfit Attic have revealed Below The Crown, a chess-flavoured fantasy roguelike with an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/inscryption">Inscryption</a>-style meta-layer and some sexy 80s CRT visuals. You are a wizard, tasked with Gathering A Party and braving an offbrand Tron dungeon to retrieve some gold. Your upgradeable party members are based on chess units, and each floor of the dungeon is a grid-based combat puzzle inspired by classic chess manouevres like Forks and Pins. Here's a trailer.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8gf18lJ_lc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>


<p>
Misfits Attic founder Tim Keenan calls it a "gateway drug into chess", but the press release often seems more eager to dunk on chess than celebrate it, as it straddles the line of being "accessible for newcomers and compelling for experts". They want to sell people on the wonders of chess, a beautiful abstract strategy game that dates back hundreds of years, while also reassuring a younger generation of nerds that Below The Crown is absolutely nothing like chess, a stupid non-computer game played by losers that doesn't even have any magic spells in it. 
</p>
<p>
"Forget memorized openings, drawn-out endgames, and stalemates," it reads. "Start with one piece, a badass wizard, instead of 16 - and bid the tedium of analysis paralysis adieu." Sayonara, chess, you monstrous waste of perfectly good timber! I love you. You're an awful experience and I hope all of my friends get hooked on you. Let's kiss with tongues, you embarrassing plod.
</p><p>
Chess aside, Below The Crown is billed as a "thinking person's roguelike" in the style of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slay-the-spire">Slay The Spire</a>, which seems a bit mean to other roguelikes. I consider the roguelike a fairly cerebral genre by default. It's not like saying "thinking person's ballpit", is it. "Make smart plays to capture enemies and survive an ever-changing dungeon," the press release goes on. "Imbue the party with abilities like Vision for placement flexibility or Shadow Protection, granting a shield while on a dark tile. Acquire spell cards and skills to ramp up throughout a run, collecting gold to sate the Emperor, but also finding mysterious runes along the way..."
</p>
<p>
That dot-dot-dotting probably pertains to the aforesaid Inscryption-esque meta-layer, which sees you pulling back from a computer <em>within</em> the computer to answer enigmatic corporate queries. "From daily stress surveys to strange ranking rituals, the game isn't afraid to break the fourth wall and surprise the player with unexpected weirdness," the press release adds. I am making a note, "expect weirdness". Keenan also calls Below The Crown a "massively singleplayer experience", with a custom board editor and the ability to share your creations online.
</p>
<p>
I will forgive all this frenzied marketing footwork because Misfits Attic are the creators of Duskers - a lonely Lieutenant Gorman simulator, and solid candidate for the title of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc">best space game</a>. According to me, anyway: whoever last edited that Best Of didn't include it, and they didn't put it on our list of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">best horror games</a>, either. Philistines! 

</p><p>Misfits recently announced that they're <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/duskers-is-getting-a-ship-building-sequel-years-after-the-sci-fi-roguelike-scared-us-to-bits">making a "spiritual successor" to Duskers</a> featuring ship-building, under the working title "Humanity 2.0". They're also making a "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings">Crusader Kings</a> lite" in which you try to manipulate enemy factions into fighting each other. Certainly, they've got a lot going on these days.

</p><p>
Below The Crown will launch on PC via Steam Early Access in Q4 2025, and there's a demo coming in this October's Steam Next Fest. Read more on the aforesaid <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1883920/Below_the_Crown/">Steam</a>.

              <p>Valve’s extremely popular PC gaming store Steam is now requiring users in the United Kingdom to <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-child-account-safety-settings-danger-1851680045">verify their age</a> using a credit card. This is a direct result of the UK’s controversial Online Safety Act.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-steam-users-must-now-verify-age-to-access-store-pages-for-mature-games-thanks-to-online-safety-act">As of August 29, as spotted by <em>Eurogamer</em></a>, it looks like Valve is now requiring that all users in the United Kingdom verify how old they are before they will be able to access mature video games. <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/292B-3DA3-CFC8-97F6">Valve has also updated its official Steam Support website</a> with new information about age verification, telling UK users that “in order to access Steam store pages for mature content games,” they’ll need to go through an “opt-in process” that requires age verification via credit card. Going through this process will “trigger a £0 authorization” on the card to check if it’s active and real.</p> <p>Valve says that as long as the credit card stored on the Steam account is valid, the account is considered “age verified.” So you should only have to do this once. Hopefully.</p> <p>According to the updated Steam Support website, Valve “reviewed” all age verification methods and determined that using a credit card preserved “the maximum degree of user privacy” compared to some other sites and services that use AI-powered facial scanning tech.</p> <p>“The data processed in the verification process is identical to that of the millions of other Steam users who make purchases or store their payment details for convenience,” explained Valve on the website. “The verification process therefore provides no information about a user’s content preferences to payment providers or other third parties. Valve handles the verification process using its own internal payment processing system, which is independently certified under the PCI-DSS standard.”</p>

 <p>Also on the site, when explaining why this new verification process is being forced upon users, Valve directly and politely lays the blame on the UK’s new online safety laws and Ofcom, the nation’s independent regulator for online safety.</p> <p>Valve isn’t the first video game company to run into issues with the UK’s Online Safety Act, which has placed large, <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/08/no-uks-online-safety-act-doesnt-make-children-safer-online">controversial restrictions and regulations</a> on how people under 18 can access the internet. In July, <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/28/xbox-age-verification-uk/">Xbox began rolling out its own age verification process</a> in the United Kingdom. <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/support/account/age-verification-faq/#:~:text=We%20are%20piloting%20an%20age%20verification%20process%20for%20players%20who%20register%20for%20new%20accounts%20in%20the%20UK%20and%20Ireland.%20If%20you%20are%20setting%20up%20an%20adult%20account%2C%20you%20will%20be%20asked%20to%20provide%20proof%20that%20you%20are%20over%20the%20minimum%20age%20for%20that%20type%20of%20account%20using%20an%20age%20verification%20service.">Sony is “rolling out”</a> an age verification process in the&nbsp; UK, too.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>You can earn free Battlefield 6 goodies from Battlefield 2042. The problem is that the grind is slow, and players have complained. In keeping with EA’s recent acknowledgment of player feedback, Battlefield 2042 players can expect regular double—and triple XP—weekends every weekend moving forward.</p>



<p>The Battlefield Team has once again heard your cries. The community has lamented how long it takes to level up the Battlefield 2042 Free Battlepass to obtain <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-sign-up-for-battlefield-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> items. If you like your double XP weekends, your day is about to get much better.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-rewards-will-be-easier-to-get-with-battlefield-2042-double-xp">Battlefield 6 Rewards Will Be Easier To Get With Battlefield 2042 Double XP</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Still a grind, but less of one. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>An August 29 update from the Battlefield Team (through <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield Comms</a>) has recognized the negative noise surrounding the Free Battlepass in Battlefield 2042.</p>



<p>Here’s what the team has had to say:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We’ve heard your concerns that you might have missed out on an XP weekend already, or might miss one of the upcoming ones, making it harder to catch up and get all the items from the Free Battlepass you’ve wanted. We therefore will have a double XP events every weekend until the Free Battlepass ends on October 7. Additionally, the last two weekends will feature triple XP gains, so keep those circled in your calendar!”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That’s right: Double XP every weekend basically until Battlefield 6 launches, and the occasional triple XP weekend for good measure.</p>



<p>There are countless items for you to earn in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2042-road-to-battlefield-6-pass-all-exclusive-bf6-rewards-how-to-get-them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 2042 Road to Battlefield 6 Pass</a>. The more you earn now, the greater your haul of cosmetics and bonuses by the time Battlefield 6 finally makes its way around.</p>







<p>Is this going to make you complete the entire Free Battlepass for BF6 bonuses? Is this a smart move from EA, showing that it’s prepared to listen to players ahead of Battlefield 6’s launch? Let us know what you think about the Battlefield 2042 double XP changes through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

"We showcased them in a series of hands on presentations attracting praise from the player community and gaming media. And although we clearly see that sales of the on the new console are currently dominated by Nintendo’s first party titles, we were very pleased with Cyberpunk being among the best selling third party games."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The Switch 2 might pack much better hardware than the original, but a game I’m still surprised to see running at all (much less pretty well) on a Nintendo system is Cyberpunk 2077," we wrote in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-review-update"><u>Nintendo Switch 2 Cyberpunk 2007 review update</u></a>. "I spent a few days with CD Projekt Red’s latest port to get a feel for how it runs, how it holds up, and how the Switch 2’s fancy new mouse controls work when applied to a high-octane FPS.

<p>A frame rate brawl</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>SEGA popped up in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">July Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</a> to reveal that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami">Yakuza Kiwami</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-2">Kiwami 2</a> would be brawling their way onto Switch 2 on <strong>13th November</strong>. Of course, the former is already available on Switch 1, but this new release promised improved graphics and frame rates, alongside some bonus language options.</p>
<p>The announcement was all well and good, but we haven't seen anything from either game in the month since — and when it comes to titles that are already available on other platforms like these, we're particularly interested to see how they'll run on the fresh hardware. Well, SEGA has the answer.</p>
<p>The publisher recently dedicated roughly 40 minutes of a livestream to showcasing Kiwami and Kiwami 2 Switch 2 gameplay, and both look really rather strong. Now yes, the frame rate displayed in the first game is not quite as "improved" as we were led to believe in the Direct announcement, but perhaps it's just a capture issue? Who knows! Kiwami 2 appears that bit smoother (starting around the 25-minute mark), so let's roll with that example.</p>
<p>Let's not forget that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director's Cut</a> slotted itself into nicely into the Switch 2's launch line-up, providing some sweet 4K/60fps goodness to the series' oft-recommended starting place. If Kiwami 1 and 2 can offer more of the same on the console when we get to play the entire thing in November, then we'll be very happy indeed.</p>
