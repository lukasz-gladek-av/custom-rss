<p>In London, the League of Legends World Championship is unfolding in an epic fashion. It’s Bilibili Gaming versus T1 Esports, and there are hundreds of thousands of dollars on the line. In the fourth game of the grand final, Lee ‘Faker’ Sang-hyeok made history by netting his <strong>five hundredth kill </strong>all-time in the tournament.</p>



<p>He’s been attending the League of Legends World Championship for a decade, and he’s the first person in history to hit this milestone.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-records-on-records">Records on Records</h2>



<p>This is turning out to be a stunning tournament for T1’s Faker. This hyper-recognisable and incredibly talented esports pro player won his <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/faker-100-matches-league-worlds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">100th LoL Worlds match</a> on October 12, and now he’s hit the milestone for 500 all-time kills in the tournament.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, T1 had pulled back from a 2 – 1 deficit to draw even with Bilibili Gaming, the team looking to score its first win ever on the grandest stage in esports. During the fourth round of the series, Faker eliminated BLG Xun to secure the 500-kill record, and shortly after, T1 won the map and prepared to move into game five.</p>



<figure><figcaption>The fateful moment, seconds after dropping BLG Xun</figcaption></figure>







<p>Time and again, Faker proves why he’s arguably the most impactful esports competitor in history. His record of four world championship wins speaks for itself, and the man is <strong>intent </strong>on winning another one today in London, England. He’s a rockstar competitor and nobody does it quite like him.</p>

Right now it sits at a strong 84 on review aggregate site <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/game/dragon-age-the-veilguard/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/dragon-age-the-veilguard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metacritic</a></span>, which is about in line with where these games typically land. The original <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em> sits at an 86, with <em>Inquisition</em>, the series’ third entry, landing close by at 84. Meanwhile, <em>Dragon Age II</em>, probably the most divisive game in the series, sits at 79. As much as I loved my time with <em>The Veilguard</em>, I knew it would elicit some pretty divergent reactions from folks. There are 10s and there are some more middling scores. You can even find some folks straight-up saying they <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QF-Kd2BBpx8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QF-Kd2BBpx8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“do not recommend”</a></span> the game, like YouTuber Skill Up does while discussing all his problems with BioWare’s latest entry.

It’s the last day of October and Nintendo still hasn’t revealed the one thing every fan is waiting for.

		<p>Critical Reflex has announced that the much anticipated multiplayer update for Buckshot Roulette is now available to all players. The development team has said that there are still some issues that were already identified in the multiplayer beta, and are currently working on ways to get those fixed. Creative Reflex is also going to be monitoring player submitted reports for other issues that could crop up.</p>
<p><iframe title="Buckshot Roulette — Multiplayer Update Out Now" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fle3zPwrz5s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In its statement, Critical Reflex said, <em>“Now, last time we spoke, we said, quote, “we don’t underestimate the capacity of you, High Rollers, to break games in half”. Turns out, we still sort of did. Here’s the thing: due to the peer-to-peer nature of the multiplayer, we have identified a few issues throughout the beta, so we’re already working on patches and fixes for those. Throughout the coming days we’ll be closely monitoring the community reports and react accordingly, so if you’ve got any thoughts to share — make sure to leave them at the Steam Forums or at our Discord server and we’ll certainly take them into consideration.”</em></p>
<p>Alongside multiplayer, the new Buckshot Roulette update has added brand new items to use, new music, new faces created by the fictional in game company Volta Standard Electronics. Buckshot Roulette is a dark horror card game in which players play Russian Roulette with a 12-gauge shotgun. Players enter an arena within a nightclub to go three rounds with the dealer, and only one of you will survive.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> has tightened its rules around broadcasts that include debates about "political" and "sensitive social issues".</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Content-Classification-Guidelines?language=en_US#7VII:PoliticsandSensitiveSocialIssues">statement</a>, Twitch said that whilst it is a place "for people to express themselves and discuss the world around them", from now on, any stream that includes discussions about war, religion, or "reproductive rights, LGBTQ+ rights, or immigration" needs to be labelled.</p>

<p>"Twitch is a place for people to express themselves and discuss the world around them," Twitch explained.</p>
<p>"We require streams to be labelled when the focus of the stream includes discussions and debates about political or sensitive social issues such as discussions about elections, civic integrity, war or military conflict, and civil rights."</p>
<p>Examples of content that require a classification label include streams featuring former or current political officials if the content includes discussions with these individuals around public policies, live coverage or commentary on elections, civic processes, or election-related disputes, and livestreams of protests, rallies, or civil unrest related to civil rights issues or government policies.</p>
<p>Also subject to further labelling are discussions about military conflicts, foreign policy decisions, or national security matters, and discussing ideological or socio-political views on topics like gender, race, sexuality, or religion.</p>
<p>"Discussing legislation related to a sensitive social issue such as reproductive rights, LGBTQ+ rights, or immigration" is also subject to labels.</p>
<p>"Streams containing informational or educational content that aim to share knowledge in a neutral, fact-based manner, rather than engaging in any kind of advocacy for an issue or candidate" are not subject to labelling, however.</p>
<p>"For example, sharing the history of how votes in the US presidential election are counted to determine the next President, or merely encouraging individuals to vote or register to vote," Twitch explained. "Intermittent mentions of politics, politicians, or sensitive social issues are not required to have the Politics and Sensitive Social Issues label."</p>
<p>The changes come after a trying few weeks for the livestreaming giant, which has found itself fielding accusations of islamophobia and anti-semitism.</p>
<p>"There is no place on Twitch for racism, hatred, or harassment of any kind, including antisemitism and Islamophobia," CEO Dan Clancy said in a <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2024/11/01/hate-and-harassment-have-no-place-on-twitch/">complementary statement</a>. "As our community has grown, we’ve endeavoured to build Community Guidelines to prohibit these harms."</p><p>"Twitch is, and will always be, about belonging. Each day, people come together on our service to build communities around shared interests, and to express themselves authentically. For this to be possible, we work hard to ensure that our community is a safe place."</p>
<p>"Millions of streamers, with a wide variety of views and perspectives, spend time on Twitch. We recognise that some content, while allowed on our service, may be objectionable to some members of our community. The views shared by streamers on Twitch are not the views of Twitch nor are they my personal views."We’re grateful for the feedback and input from our community," Clancy concluded. "Our safety approach continues to build and evolve, as our service grows. We want to ensure that anyone can find their place on Twitch, and remain committed to ensuring that hate and harassment have no place here."</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-apologises-for-issue-preventing-account-sign-ups-in-israel-and-palestine">Twitch issued an apology for preventing new account sign-ups from Israel and Palestine due to the ongoing conflict</a>. It said sign-ups were temporarily disabled following the attacks on 7th October 2023 to "prevent uploads of graphic material related to the attack and to protect the safety of users". However, until recently, this verification had not been re-enabled.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Epic Games has announced that Fortnite Chapter 2 Remix is live now on the popular free-to-play battle royale game. Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-season-og-breaks-player-count-records/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">record-breaking example</a> set with Fortnite Season OG, the island has been reset to the Chapter 2 map, albeit with several twists that will unroll throughout the season.</p>
<p>Starting right now, the Agency grounds are now known as The Doggpound, the new headquarters and home base for Snoop Dogg's enterprise. Players who venture there will have the opportunity to fight him and turn him into an ally, as well as obtain his Snoop's Drum Gun Mythic weapon.</p>
<p>In the second week of Fortnite Chapter 2 Remix, Eminem himself will take ownership of the Grotto cave and establish a restaurant called Mom's Spaghetti there. If you head to Mom's Spaghetti and defeat Eminem, you'll gain his support and receive the Mythic RG Minigun - a lyrical, rapid-fire weapon.</p>
<p>In the third week, hip-hop rapper Ice Spice is set to appear on Shark Island, which will temporarily be renamed Ice Island. Ice Spice is turning it into an ominous-looking shopping mall. If you defeat her, you're getting her support and the Ice Spice's Grappler weapon.</p>
<p>The Fortnite Chapter 2 Remix finale event, which will go live on November 30 at 2 PM Eastern Time, will feature a homage to Juice Wrld. All players who log in between November 30 at 1 AM Eastern Time and December 1 will receive the cel-shaded Slayer Juice WRLD Outfit.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fortnite Chapter 2 Remix Official Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9zJK2qBcSYs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The biggest news for Fortnite is arguably the imminent addition of a brand new cosmetic item called 'Kicks.' Epic Games explained:</p>
<p><em>The initial lineup of Kicks will feature Nike and Jordan brands alongside Fortnite originals. Look out for other brands to join the lineup in the future! Kicks will be compatible with over 500 of the most popular Fortnite Outfits to start, with more than 95% of Outfits compatible by Spring of next year. While there are a few Outfits that are particularly challenging to style Kicks for, we’re working hard to make sure that as many Outfits as possible can throw on a fresh pair.</em></p>
<p>The first pair of Nike Air Jordan Kicks will be available from the Shop starting on Tuesday, November 12.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-underworlds-emberguard-new-edition-with-plenty-of-changes</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warhammer-underworlds-embergard-a-new-edition-with-plenty-of-changes.1026006/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-underworlds-emberguard-new-edition-with-plenty-of-changes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Normally when you see board games move from edition to edition rules will be upgraded, but nothing truly monumental will shift. That's certainly not the case with the new edition of <em>Warhammer Underworlds Embergard</em>. While the core idea of a team skirmish game remains intact the board and way the Warbands are set up is entirely different.</p>

<h2>What's In The<em> Warhammer Underworlds Embergard </em>Box?</h2>

<p>Along with a new way to play the packaging has also been shaped up. Opening the box you'll be met with a large box that contains the games' 36-page instruction manual, a double-sided quick start guide, Miniature sheets and their assembly instructions, tokens, a game board, and four Rivals Decks.</p>

<p>The Rivals Decks are Emberstone Sentinels, Blazing Assault, Countdown to Cataclysm, and Pillage and Plunder.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-emberguard-box-contents.jpg?itok=h_1-rFAG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-emberguard-box-contents.jpg?itok=dH2dWfCQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This is the first of one of the major changes to the game. Warband-specific mechanics have been moved off the fighter's individual cards and onto a Warband card. The individual fighter cards instead allowing for beautiful full-color card artwork for each of the miniatures and using icons to represent their attacks and abilities.</p>

<p>Realistically you still end up with the same, or more things to keep track of but I'm all for not needing to cram lots of tiny text onto cards. The Warband cards also contain some story context and how each Warband is inspired.</p>

<p>One disappointing aspect of how the game is packaged is that after putting together your Warbands there's no way to fit them in the box without it bulging out. A simple solution to this is to remove the bases off the larger minis (The Embergard) and just reassemble the next time you're wanting to pull it out to play.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-emberguard-emberwatch.jpg?itok=vyYSlnGS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-emberguard-emberwatch.jpg?itok=GOy8OV-- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture>

<p>With each player picking a Warband <em>Warhammer Underworlds</em> is a skirmish game. Players take it in turns moving their characters according to their stats around the game board working to simultaneously complete Objectives, while also hindering their opponent from completing theirs, or just trying to kill them.</p>

<p>The game is played out over just three rounds with very limited turns meaning that every step, or misstep, has a chance to shift the momentum of the game. Each round is comprised of each player getting to take four turns, and then each of these turns is made up of an Action Step and a Power Step.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-emberguard-battle-setting.jpg?itok=BP2CLoqu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-emberguard-battle-setting.jpg?itok=6JxZo3iO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This means that in Round 1 you'll have Player 1 start, take their Action and Power step, and then Player 2 will take their Action and Power step, before it moves back to Player 1. This pattern will repeat until Player 2 has taken their fourth turn which will signal the end of the Battle Round with an End Phase.</p>

<p>The Action Step focuses on what's on the board in front of you, while the Power Step gives you a chance to activate cards from your hand or special abilities.</p>

<p>Gameplay, as well as the instructions, have been incredibly streamlined and it's now nowhere near as high a barrier of entry for a new player interested in getting started in the world of <em>Warhammer Underworlds.&nbsp;</em></p>

<h2>New Players Rejoice</h2>

<p>I've spoken in the past about how <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a4a60a44-5c6a-4787-be2e-abd18b18f684" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-underworlds-starter-set-2023-review"><em>Warhammer Underworlds</em> can be complicated to get started</a>, but once you have it the pace speeds up. After praising the last Starter Set's ability to include an example game to teach you the mechanics this box does the same.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-emberguard-instructions-and-quick-start.jpg?itok=ep8VOTUL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-emberguard-instructions-and-quick-start.jpg?itok=c8mNgNUA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The two-page Quick Start document shows you an example layout, how to set it up yourself, and how the first Action and Power step would function. There's even an included video link.</p>

<h2>Warbands And The RIvals Decks In Action</h2>

<p>The major benefit of having all of the thematic mechanics now on a Warband card is that no matter what deck you play a Warband with they will still retain their core mechanics. Yes, this does mean the complete removal of Warband decks.</p>

<p>The Emberwatch is a trio of powerful Fighters that are all about launching the offensive. Each has a massive amount of health and will do all they can to mow down your opponents Warband as quickly as possible. Becoming inspired based on being in enemy territory even their abilities are about placing themselves in the middle of the action and dealing additional damage at a moments notice.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-emberguard-skaven.jpg?itok=02BgApzf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-emberguard-skaven.jpg?itok=iId18sRh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Alternatively, Zikkit's Tunnelpack is a group of five Skaven fighters who inspire if one of their Warband takes damage or is killed. Leaning into this mechanic the greater numbers are combined with more fragile units. You'll want to sacrifice some to empower the rest here.</p>

<p>It's an interesting juxtaposition to include both of these Warbands in the same box. The strength of one side channels into empowering the other. This makes this pairing a unique battle to see whether your own growth can outpace the growth that you're allowing your opponent to reach.</p>

<p>The four rival decks have their own unique gameplay mechanics that when combined with the different Warbands create for a wholly unique experience. These don't just change how you might approach combat in <em>Warhammer Underworlds</em> but also how you'll navigate the board.</p>

<p>The Emberstone Sentinels Rivals Deck is all about completing objectives related to holding Treasure Tokens across the board, these are specific territories. The Blazing Assault Warband instead promotes a Warband's offensive capability.</p>

<p><em>Warhammer Underworlds</em> has always been a fun experience at my table, but whenever I've had to bring a new player in teaching the game has always been a daunting tasks. With the release of <em>Embergard</em>, even though it's not specifically a Starter Set aimed at those who have never played before, it does an incredible job setting up the players for success.</p>

<p>With new interactions between Warbands (and their constant abilities) and the different Rivals Decks changing the desired play style this also sets up this edition for success as new Warbands appear and Rival Decks are released each will be more compatible with one another.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/2/24284956/windblown-roguelikes-friends-multiplayer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Some of the most beloved roguelikes are single-player — the likes of <em>Hades</em>, <em>Balatro</em>, and <em>Dead Cells</em> are all solo titles. But <em>Windblown</em>, the new roguelike from Motion Twin, the studio that created <em>Dead Cells</em>, showed me just how cool it can be to play a roguelike with other people.</p><p>In <em>Windblown</em>, your character, one of a few adorable animal adventurers like an axolotl or a bat, is shot out of a cannon into a mysterious giant tornado to fight your way through various zones. Like <em>Dead Cells</em>, you can equip up to two main weapons. I typically have one for close-range bouts and another for long-distance attacks. But with every weapon, you’re also able to pull off a combo that uses a special move from the <em>other weapon</em> called an “Alterattack.”</p><p>Here’s an example. I love using a crossbow to attack enemies from a distance, and I pair it with a giant heavy blade. I rarely use the blade on its own; instead, I use its Alterattack that cracks open the earth in a straight line to continue to wallop on enemies at range. That turns a run into a steady rhythm of slinging arrows and using the Alterattack at <em>exactly</em> the right time, and with my five hours so far with the game, I haven’t gotten tired of the pattern.</p><p><em>Windblown</em> just launched in early access, and you can already unlock more than a dozen weapons, meaning there are a lot of combinations that I haven’t messed around with. And with four different biomes to get through on a run, there’s a lot to see, too.</p><div><figcaption><em>The bosses are no joke.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Motion Twin</cite></p></div><p>All of that would be enough to make <em>Windblown</em> part of my regular rotation of roguelikes I use to wind down at the end of a long day. But the game’s multiplayer is making <em>Windblown</em> the game I turn to every time I turn on my Steam Deck.</p><p><em>Windblown’s</em> multiplayer lobbies, which you unlock fairly early on, let you play a full run with a team of three people. You can use voice and text chat to communicate, but it’s not required; I haven’t used those at all, instead relying on four in-game emoji. I also like that you can name your lobbies. I created one titled “help me get 1st win” and immediately had two helpful people join up to help me tackle the tornado. (Sadly, we did not get the win.)&nbsp;</p><p>When playing solo, I’ve found that I’m somewhat cautious and strategic as I think about how to use weapons and positioning to take on the game’s aggressive enemies and dodge their attacks. With the help of a team, battles are speedier and become delightful explosions of light, color, sound, and damage. It’s <em>so</em> fun to absolutely annihilate baddies with other people, and it’s comforting to know that they’ve got your back in a pinch.</p><p>There are <em>a lot</em> of great roguelikes to play right now; <em>Hades II</em> just got <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24271897/hades-ii-2-major-update-olympic">a huge update</a>, <em>Balatro</em> is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame">nearly impossible</a> to put down (especially now that it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24256010/how-to-play-balatro-mobile-localthunk-playstack">on mobile</a>), and I’ve wanted to get back into <em>Shogun Showdown</em>, which I think <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/15/24243908/shogun-showdown-review">everyone is sleeping on</a>. <em>Windblown</em> needed more than just its Motion Twin pedigree to stand out, but so far, the multiplayer is the hook that keeps me coming back.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-necessary-to-change-narrative-of-ubisofts-inconsistency-in-quality<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Assassin's Creed boss Marc-Alexis Coté has discussed the recent shock decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">delay the launch of Assassin's Creed Shadows until February 2025</a>, just a month before its originally intended release.
</p>
<p>
The move means Shadows will miss Assassin's Creed's typical pre-Christmas sales window, and comes amidst much <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-acknowledges-buyout-reports-stating-it-regularly-reviews-options">scrutiny of publisher Ubisoft's ongoing fortunes</a>, as well as a culture war that has erupted over Shadows' main characters.
</p>
<p>
Speaking at a BAFTA event attended by Eurogamer in London last night, Coté reflected on the reasons for delay, and the crucial importance of the game to Ubisoft at such a pivotal moment for the company and the Assassin's Creed brand.

<p>
"Players can afford to be selective, choosing only the best, and they rightfully demand excellence," Coté said. "Ubisoft's portfolio has faced criticism in recent years for a perceived inconsistency in quality. 
</p>
<p>
"Players expect more polish, more innovation and deeper engagement from the games we release, and they're not shy about letting us know when they feel we have fallen short. This environment pushes us to do better and to be better. 
</p>
<p>
"<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> represents our opportunity to change that narrative, not just for Assassin's Creed, but I think for Ubisoft as a whole."
</p>
<blockquote>"In today's market, being amongst the best is just not enough anymore."</blockquote>
<p>
Shadows marks the beginning of a bold new push for the Assassin's Creed brand, and comes after a lengthy wait since the series' last fully-fledged blockbuster, 2020's Viking-fuelled Valhalla. (2023's Mirage was deliberately a smaller game, that began life as a Valhalla expansion.)
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft is priming Shadows to be the launch of a new era of Assassin's Creed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-explains-what-assassins-creed-infinity-actually-is">underpinned by a central game launcher/hub</a>, a more accessible ongoing narrative, and technological advances made possible by finally ditching the last generation of consoles.

At the same time, Ubisoft's other 2024 blockbuster - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> - underperformed commercially, and the company once again finds itself the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-and-tencent-considering-buyout-taking-the-company-private-report">subject of speculation on its ongoing corporate independence</a>. The stakes have never seemed higher.
</p>
<p>
"We know this game has the potential to be one of the best in the franchise's storied history, set in one of the most anticipated settings we've yet to explore," Coté said. "But we also know that in today's market, being <em>amongst</em> the best is just not enough anymore." 
</p><p>Coté reflected on the infamous 2014 launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-unity">Assassin's Creed Unity</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-on-what-created-the-perfect-storm-behind-assassins-creed-unity">an ultimately too-ambitious technical leap for the series</a> set during the French Revolution. Ahead of launch, Ubisoft boasted that the game - the series' first installment for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles - would be where the "next generation started". Ultimately, Unity's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-addresses-every-known-assassins-creed-unity-glitch-and-workaround">graphical issues</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-unity-patch-removes-need-to-play-companion-app">convoluted online systems</a> wrecked first impressions, and the brand took a huge hit.
</p>
<blockquote>"We only have one shot at launching this game, and it has to exceed expectations."</blockquote>
<p>
"[Unity] was meant to be a major milestone for the series, but its reception at launch, marred by technical issues, left a deep impact on all parts of the company, from production to publishing, especially given Ubisoft's roots as a French company," Coté said. "This low point affected all of us, but it also served as a wake up call, reminding us how crucial it was to maintain the quality and integrity of the player experience from day one, a lesson that lives with us to this very day."
</p>
<p>All these years later, the spectre of Unity's launch still haunts the brand, it seems - and both Coté and Ubisoft bosses are keen to ensure it is never repeated.</p>
<p>
"After much reflection and analysis, I recommended to our top management to delay the release of Assassin's Creed Shadows," Coté continued. "Our playtests and team feedback made it clear Shadows had immense potential, but I felt we needed more time to ensure it fully meets the high expectations of our players. 
</p><p>
"We only have one shot at launching this game, and it has to exceed those expectations. Shadows is our most ambitious and complex project yet, with interconnected mechanics, narrative and technology all releasing across the largest number of platforms with the most options we've ever, ever supported. 
</p>
<p>
"Taking this extra time allows us to polish every aspect and set a new standard for the franchise, one that I hope will carry us forward for years. This decision reflects our commitment to delivering an experience worthy of our players' time and attention on day one. We believe Shadows will shine as a true showcase of Ubisoft's talent and dedication, setting a new benchmark in quality for the franchise."
</p>
<p>
Last night, Eurogamer reported on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-boss-discusses-devastating-impact-of-shadows-diversity-and-inclusivity-backlash">Coté's lengthy and impassioned defence of Assassin's Creed Shadows' narrative choices and characters</a> - the reaction to which has involved a wave of backlash and online abuse aimed at the game's developers this year.

          <p>Some of my favorite games deny me the thing I think I want most.&nbsp;<em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/elden-ring-review-come-see-the-softer-side-of-punishing-difficulty.1482655/">Elden Ring</a>&nbsp;</em>refuses to provide manageable save files (and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/06/shadow-of-the-erdtree-has-ground-me-into-dust-which-is-why-i-recommend-it/#gsc.tab=0">I paid for it</a>).&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/balatro-arrives-on-phones-sept-26-so-plan-your-sick-days-accordingly/#gsc.tab=0"><em>Balatro</em></a> withholds the final math on each hand played (and <a href="https://aftermath.site/balatro-the-long-dark">its developer suggests avoiding calculators</a>). And the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/09/xcom-2-war-of-the-chosen-review-a-world-worth-saving/">modern X-COM games</a> force me to realize just how much a 98% chance to hit is not the same as 100%.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379910/Dystopika/"><em>Dystopika</em></a> (Steam, Windows) is a city builder in maybe the strictest definition of that two-word descriptor, because it steadfastly refuses to distract you with non-building details. The game is described by its single developer, Matt Marshall, as having "No goals, no management, just creativity and dark cozy vibes."<em> Dystopika</em> does very little to explain how you should play it, because there's no optimal path for doing so. Your only job is to enjoy yourself, poking and prodding at a dark cyberpunk cityscape, making things that look interesting, pretty, grim, or however you like. It might seem restrictive, but it feels very freeing.</p>

<p>The game's interface is a small rail on the left side of the screen. Select "Building" and a random shape attaches to your cursor. You can right-click to change it, but you can't pick one. Place it, and then optionally place the cursor near its top to change its height. Making one building taller will raise smaller buildings nearby. Reaching certain heights, or densities, or something (it's not explained) will "unlock" certain new buildings, landmarks, and decorations.</p>

<p>You do get to pick out "Props," like roads and trams and giant billboards and hologram objects and flying carports, but the game is similarly non-committal on what you should do with them, or most anything. You put things down, or delete them, expand them, connect them, and try things out until you like how it looks.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-isnt-getting-any-dlcs-as-bioware-is-wholly-focused-on-mass-effect-next/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-age-the-veilguard-isn%E2%80%99t-getting-any-dlcs-as-bioware-is-wholly-focused-on-mass-effect-next.1025961/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-isnt-getting-any-dlcs-as-bioware-is-wholly-focused-on-mass-effect-next/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is seemingly doing well for itself so far. It had already <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-breaks-steam-records-for-a-bioware-and-ea-single-player-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broken</a> Steam concurrency records for a BioWare and EA single-player premium game yesterday, and the numbers have improved since, with a new peak of 77.4K registered twelve hours ago.</p>
<p>However, for the time being, there are no plans to make any story DLCs for it. That's what Rolling Stone&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/dragon-age-the-veilguard-john-epler-interview-1235147001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a></span> as part of an interview with Dragon Age: The Veilguard Creative Director John Epler. The reason is fairly straightforward: BioWare isn't a large team nowadays, and they are currently focused on making the next Mass Effect game, which Executive Producer Mike Gamble recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-next-will-stay-photorealistic-and-mature-confirms-executive-producer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> will stick to the photorealistic art style and mature tone.</p>
<p>Of course, this interview was conducted when the game had only just released. If Dragon Age: The Veilguard turns out to surpass EA's sales estimates (CEO Andrew Wilson recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-breakout-potential-says-ea-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> investors it has breakout potential), there's a chance those plans might change. Still, from a narrative standpoint, Veilguard does close up nicely (unlike Inquisition, which very much needed the DLCs to really bring the story to a proper conclusion).</p>
<p>In the Rolling Stone interview, John Epler went into the feedback that BioWare absorbed from its fans to make Dragon Age: The Veilguard a better game. From Mass Effect Andromeda, the studio learned that the polish wasn't enough and that the open world design was lacking:</p>
<p><em>I do think Andromeda was a better game than its reception suggested, but on the flip side, I don’t think the reception was unfair. At the time of launch, there were technical issues and things that didn’t work.</em></p>
<p><em>We had been doing Dragon Age pre-production on versions of Dragon Age 4, and we did have a version that was a lot more open-world. But again, we ran into the same problem of how do you make it compelling or narratively interesting? The reception to Andromeda definitely solidified that.</em></p>
<p>From Anthem, of course, they understood that the multiplayer focus was not working:</p>
<p><em>We’re a studio built to make single-player RPGs. And more importantly, I think a lot of people have come here to build single-player, story based RPGs. So, it just kind of ended up making more sense to make this game the way it is versus a multiplayer game.</em></p>
<p><em>We were alienating parts of our fan base that had been with us for a long time, and not successfully bringing in anyone else through the multiplayer side of things. The reception to Anthem was very clear in that we needed to get back to those aspects that we did well, and multiplayer became an obstacle in the way of doing just that.</em></p>
<p>With that said, Epler did not entirely close the door to doing another multiplayer game in the future:</p>
<p><em>It’s possible to tell a strong story in a multiplayer game. Final Fantasy XIV does an excellent job. Multiplayer also introduces some complications around world states. I make a giant choice in my world and the world changes.</em></p>
<p>Lastly, Epler said Inquisition players felt there wasn't enough companion banter, which was also fixed in Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p>

<p>Old-school Apple fans probably remember a time, just before the iPhone became <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2011/07/iphone-users-spend-147-hours-a-month-playing-games/">a massive gaming platform in its own right</a>, when Apple released a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/05/wicked-cool-apple-gaming-wednesday/">wide</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2006/09/5439/">range</a> of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/12/peggle-and-bomberman-keep-the-good-ipod-gaming-times-flowin/">games</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/08/games-games-games-one-for-your-ipod-and-one-for-your-iphone/">designed</a> for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/11/new-ipod-game-phase-rhythm-games-on-a-clickwheel-yippee/">late-model</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/09/tetris-ms-pac-man-sudoku-for-new-ipods-released/">clickwheel</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/07/game-review-song-summoner-the-unsing-heroes-ipod/">iPods</a>. While those clickwheel-controlled&nbsp;titles <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/looking-back-at-the-history-of-ipod-click-wheel-games/">didn't exactly set the gaming world on fire</a>, they represent an important historical stepping stone in Apple's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/03/the-mac-gaming-console-time-has-forgot/">long journey</a> through the game industry.</p>
<p>Today, though, these clickwheel iPod games are on the verge of becoming lost media—impossible to buy or redownload from iTunes and protected on existing devices by incredibly strong Apple DRM. Now, the classic iPod community is engaged in <a href="https://github.com//ipodclickwheelgamespreservationproject">a quest to preserve these games</a> in a way that will let enthusiasts enjoy these titles on real hardware for years to come.</p>
<h2>Perhaps too well-protected</h2>
<p>The short heyday of iPod clickwheel gaming ran from late 2006 to early 2009, when Apple partnered with major studios like Sega, Square Enix, and Electronic Arts to release 54 distinct titles for $7.49 each. By 2011, though, the rise of iOS gaming made these clickwheel iPod titles such an afterthought that Apple <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-removes-ipod-click-wheel-games-from-itunes-store/">completely removed them from the iTunes store</a>, years before the classic iPod line was discontinued for good in 2014.</p>

      YouTuber Billiam looks takes a hands-on tour through some of the clickwheel iPod's games.

<p>In the years since that delisting, the compressed IPG files representing these clickwheel games have all been backed up and collected in <a href="https://archive.org/details/ipod-click-wheel-games-archive">various archives</a>. For the most part, though, those IPG files are practically useless to classic iPod owners because of <a href="http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/Home/728B5C4B-0A35-40BE-A2E7-E5464C68B80A.html">the same strict Fairplay DRM</a> that protected iTunes music and video downloads. That DRM ties each individual IPG file not just to a particular iTunes account (set when the game file was purchased) but also to the specific hardware identifier of the desktop iTunes installation used to sync it.</p>
<p>Games already synced to iPods and iTunes libraries years ago will still work just fine. But trying to sync any of these aging games to a new iPod (and/or a new iTunes installation) requires pairing the original IPG file provided by Apple years ago with the authorized iTunes account that made the original purchase.</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p>Didn't back up that decades-old file? Sorry, you're out of luck.</p>
<p>A set of 20 clickwheel iPod games was eventually patched to work on certain iPod Video devices that are themselves flashed with custom firmware. But the majority of these games remain completely unplayable for the vast majority of classic iPod owners to this day.</p>
<h2>A virtual workaround</h2>
<p>Luckily for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ipod/">the sizable community</a> of <a href="https://discord.gg/nZ2dD64X">classic iPod enthusiasts</a>, there is a bit of a workaround for this legacy DRM issue. Clickwheel iPod owners with working copies of any of these games (either in their iTunes library or on an iPod itself) are still able to re-authorize their account through Apple's servers to sync with a secondary installation of iTunes.</p>

<p>If multiple iPod owners each reauthorize their accounts to the same iTunes installation, that copy of iTunes effectively becomes a "master library" containing authorized copies of the games from all of those accounts (there's a five-account limit per iTunes installation, but it can be bypassed by copying the files manually). That iTunes installation then becomes a distribution center that can share those authorized games to any number of iPods indefinitely, without the need for any online check-ins with Apple.</p>
<p>In recent years, a Reddit user going by the handle Quix used this workaround to amass a local library of 19 clickwheel iPod games and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ipod/comments/vzaj7w/comment/igc8nkz/">publicly offered</a> to share "copies of these games onto as many iPods as I can." But Quix's effort ran into a significant bottleneck of physical access—syncing his game library to a new iPod meant going through the costly and time-consuming process of shipping the device so it could be plugged into Quix's actual computer and then sending it back to its original owner.</p>
<p>Enter Reddit user Olsro, who <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ipod/comments/1fydso6/preservation_of_ipod_clickwheel_games_read_this/">earlier this month</a> started the appropriately named <a href="https://github.com//ipodclickwheelgamespreservationproject">iPod Clickwheel Games Preservation Project</a>. Rather than creating his master library of authorized iTunes games on a local computer in his native France, Olsro sought to "build a communitarian virtual machine that anyone can use to sync auth[orized] clickwheel games into their iPod." While the process doesn't require shipping, it does necessitate jumping through a few hoops to get the Qemu Virtual Machine running on your local computer.</p>

<p>Over the last three weeks, Olsro has worked with other iPod enthusiasts to get authorized copies of 45 different clickwheel iPod games synced to his library and ready for sharing. That Virtual Machine "should work fully offline to sync the clickwheel games forever to any amount of different iPods," Olsro wrote, effectively preserving them indefinitely.</p>
<h2>For posterity</h2>
<p>Olsro told Ars in a Discord discussion that he was inspired to start the project due to fond memories of playing games like <em>Asphalt 4</em> and <em>Reversi</em> on his iPod Nano 3G as a child. When he dove back into the world of classic iPods through a recent purchase of a classic iPod 7G, he said he was annoyed that there was no way for him to restore those long-lost game files to his new devices.</p>
<p>"I also noticed that I was not alone to be frustrated about that one clickwheel game that was a part of a childhood," Olsro told Ars. "I noticed that when people had additional games, it was often only one or two more games because those were very expensive."</p>
<p>Beyond the nostalgia value, even Olsro admits that "only a few of [the clickwheel iPod games] are really very interesting compared to multiplatform equivalents." The iPod's round clickwheel interface—with only a single "action" button in the center—is less than ideal for most action-oriented games, and the long-term value of "games" like <em>SAT PREP 2008</em> is "very debatable," Olsro said.</p>

      A short review of <em>Phase</em> shows off the basic rhythm-matching gameplay.

<p>Still, the classic iPod library features a few diamonds in the rough. Olsro called out the iPod version of <em>Peggle</em> for matching the PC version's features and taking "really good advantage from the clickwheel controls" for its directional aiming. Then there's <em>Phase</em>, a rhythm game that creates dynamic tracks from your own iPod music library and was never ported to other platforms. Olsro described it as "very addictive, simple, but fun and challenging."</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>Even the bad clickwheel iPod games—like Sega's nearly impossible-to-control <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> port—might find their own quirky audience among gaming subcommunities, Olsro argued. "One [person] <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HdWWhZ0hDM">beat <em>Dark Souls</em> using DK bongos</a>, so I would not be surprised if the speedrun community could try speedrunning some of those odd games."</p>
<p>More than entertainment, though, Olsro said there's a lot of historical interest to be mined from this odd pre-iPhone period in Apple's gaming history. "The clickwheel games were a reflect[ion] of that gaming period of premium games," Olsro said. "Without ads, bullshit, and micro-transactions and playable fully offline from start to end... Then the market evolved [on iOS] with cheaper premium games like <em>Angry Birds</em> before being invaded with ads everywhere and aggressive monetizations..."</p>

<p>While Olsro said he's happy with the 42 games he's preserved (and especially happy to play <em>Asphalt 4</em> again), he won't be fully satisfied until his iTunes Virtual Machine has all 54 clickwheel titles backed up for posterity. He compared the effort to complete sets of classic game console ROMs "that you can archive somewhere to be sure to be able to play any game you want in the future (or research on it)... Getting the full set is also addictive in terms of collection, like any other kind of collectible things."</p>
<p>But Olsro's preservation effort might have a built-in time limit. If Apple ever turns off the iTunes re-authorization servers for clickwheel iPods, he will no longer be able to add new games to his master clickwheel iPod library. "Apple is now notoriously known to not care about announcing closing servers for old things," Olsro said. "If that version of iTunes dies tomorrow, this preservation project will be stopped. No new games will be ever added."</p>
<p>"We do not know how much time we still have to accomplish this, so there is no time to lose," Olsro <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ipod/comments/1fydso6/preservation_of_ipod_clickwheel_games_read_this/">wrote on Reddit</a>. iPod gamers who want to help can contact him through his Discord account, inurayama.</p>

Fortnite Remix Chapter 2 is imminent.

But when will that be? Unfortunately, it's not a question with an easy answer, because there's no scheduled time for this maintenance window to end. Typically, you can expect to see a new Fortnite season to kick off between 7 AM and 10 AM ET on launch day--in this case, November 2--though there have been major exceptions.</p><p>Earlier this year, for example, there was some sort of technical issue that kept the game offline until late in the evening, with Fortnite staying offline for nearly a day.

<p>Step aside, my collection of gaming headsets, there’s something new and even more immersive in town.</p>



<p>I was recently lucky enough to review the OXS Thunder Pro+ ‘gaming sound system’, an innovative piece of technology that fuses a phenomenal soundbar with the ‘world’s first wireless satellite neck speaker’ to promote <strong>the most immersive </strong>sound experience you can get in gaming.</p>



<p>Read on to check out my full OXS Thunder Pro+ review and find out if it’s worth the hefty investment.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-next-generation-sound">Next-Generation Sound</h2>



<p>I’ve always been a headset-focused kind of gamer, but in the last few weeks, I’ve been toying with the OXS Thunder Pro+, a multi-functional, multi-dimensional gaming sound system that works on so many levels. Presently, the soundbar is sitting under my main monitor, a placement that’s facilitated by the device’s relatively unassuming profile.</p>



<p>It might boast some of the most powerful sound output I’ve ever heard, but it’s just 24 inches wide and 3 inches high, which means it’ll fit nicely into almost any gaming space. It’s an attractive unit, too. It looks like something from the future, and it features customisable RGB lighting that is a must-have for many gamers out there.</p>



<p>In terms of the on-board audio, the OXS Thunder Pro+ soundbar has 7.1.2 Dolby Atmos built-in, with multi-directional speakers taking full advantage of eight precision-tuned drivers to ‘create a lifelike 3D soundscape’, as the manufacturer says. It does feel like that when you’ve got the thing switched on and pumping out anything from music to the cacophony of a game of Call of Duty.</p>



<p>Another huge win is the accessibility of the device. It can be connected to almost anything through a range of methods, including Bluetooth, optical, HDMI, and USB. There’s a handy control unit that handles power and volume, and there’s also a remote in the box. </p>



<p>It’s a one-touch operation that never ceases to amaze me, and the connectivity and responsiveness of the device are off the charts.</p>



<p>Here are some numbers to consider:</p>



<ul>
<li>96dB output</li>



<li>Bluetooth 5.0</li>



<li>Peak power output – 160W</li>



<li>DSP onboard</li>



<li>HDMI eARC for better console connectivity</li>



<li>50% smaller than competing soundbars, and weighs barely 6.5 KG</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-fully-tested">Fully Tested</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The neck speaker system hasn’t been much of a game-changer</figcaption></figure>







<p>I put the OXS Thunder Pro+ through its paces, connecting it to a PlayStation 5, mobile devices, and of course, my PC. I found that my favourite ‘preset’ was RAC, which is designed for racing games but works so well across a variety of genres. From deep, booming bass to a depth of audio and clarity the likes of which I’ve never heard in a sound system, the OXS Thunder Pro+ constantly impressed me.</p>



<p>The 40W bass woofers and neodymium drivers are put to work regardless of what you’re playing, watching, or listening to.</p>



<p>Also, there’s a PC app in case you want to go a step further and fully customise the lighting and equalisation, too. I’m not a sound nerd so I haven’t played with this, but the app is intuitive and easy to use.</p>



<p>If I have one complaint, it’s that the ‘satellite neck speaker’ doesn’t seem to be at all worth the investment. If you only want to buy the soundbar, it’ll set you back $599.99, but adding the neck speaker bumps that up to $699.99.</p>



<p>As a neck cushion, it’s close to flawless. It has a unique silicone covering that feels wonderful to the touch and has a nice cooling effect, and it’s ergonomic and comfortable in all gaming conditions, but the onboard speakers just aren’t it. It’s supposed to promote ‘3D surround sound’, but you can barely hear the speakers and they’re very tinny and underpowered.</p>



<p>If I’m being brutally honest, I’d say that the OXS Thunder Pro soundbar is <strong>well worth the investment</strong>, but lumping on the extra $100 for the neck speaker probably isn’t a shrewd purchase. Unless you want a <strong>very </strong>comfortable and durable neck cushion, then you’re fine.</p>



<p>What really should be possible is controlling the volume of the neck speakers <strong>separately </strong>from that of the soundbar. Even with the soundbar blaring, the neck speakers are almost inaudible. </p>



<h2 id="h-switching-off">Switching Off</h2>



<p>So, let’s sum up this OXS Thunder Pro+ review:</p>



<ul>
<li>The sound quality of the bar is nothing short of flawless, and even when it’s <span><strong>booming</strong></span>, the speakers can handle the throughput without crackling or vibrating too much.</li>



<li>It looks phenomenal and futuristic, and with the RGB included, it’s so nicely at home in a gaming setup.</li>



<li>The levels of accessibility and compatibility are unparalleled and the OXS Thunder Pro+ will become the beating, thumping heart of your audio ecosystem.</li>



<li>It doesn’t necessarily provide the surround-sound audio of a headset, so it’s not ideal for competitive shooters, but for everything from casual multiplayer to single-player epics, it’s <strong>perfect</strong>.</li>



<li>The neck speaker unit is a waste of time unless you want a $100 cushion that can play some tinny audio behind your ears.</li>
</ul>



<p>My verdict? <strong>Buy</strong>.</p>



<p>If you’ve got $600 to burn and want a top-notch gaming soundbar that’ll blow your hair back with both audio quality and onboard features, the OXS Thunder Pro won’t let you down.</p>

<p>One of the nastiest teams in competitive Call of Duty was recently assembled to compete in The Flank’s $25,000 Black Ops 6 Invitational.  The four-way combination of Dashy, Drazah, Simp, and Shotzzy proved too much for the competition to overcome, and this dream team managed to dominate so effectively that their opponents rage-quit in the final seconds.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-dynasty-has-been-cemented">‘The Dynasty Has Been Cemented’</h2>



<p>… is what Simp cried out as the final seconds of a ridiculous round of Hardpoint closed out on Skyline. The scoreline was separated by such a huge distance that the team of Scrap, Crimsix, Insight, and CleanX couldn’t compete. By the end of the series, the FaZe-OpTic team was just having a blast and picking up an easy payday.</p>



<p>It’s not all bad, though – the second-place finish was taken in good spirits by the likes of Crimsix, the winningest competitor in Call of Duty history and an esports legend:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Got 2nd in The Flank invitational #2. My teammates played insane. Thank you to those who tuned into the stream! But not bad for a pro race car driver.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On October 30, the first Flank tournament was won by Ghosty, Scrap, Gwinn, and TJHaly, so while Scrap was forced to rage-quit this follow-up event, he at least got <strong>something </strong>in the bank. </p>



<p>That’s not the end of all things, though – the crowning gem of The Flank’s Invitational series is yet to take place. From November 5 – 6, $50,000 will be on the line in the final round of the tournament, and once again, it’ll be played by randomised teams, which means anything is possible.</p>



<p>Presently, Activision is yet to reveal the schedule for the 2025 CDL season, so once The Flank’s Invitational series is wrapped, we’re back to wagers and scrims.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review-return-of-the-max.1025922/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been almost a decade since the first Life is Strange title hit platforms worldwide, and in that time, several follow-up games have been released to flesh out the universe. However, for many, the first game is by far the best and most memorable, and much of that can be attributed to the stellar story laid out by the lead characters: Max Caulfield and Chloe Price.</p>



<p>On October 29, Deck Nine and Square Enix released Life is Strange: Double Exposure, bringing back the Max Caulfield character for the first time since 2015 (except for a brief reappearance in 2018). This all-new game represents a fresh dynamic for the character and the series, and it delivers in every way imaginable.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-beautifully-mysterious">Beautifully Mysterious</h2>



<p>Life is Strange: Double Exposure is a touch of fan service mixed with an honest attempt to expand a universe that has unravelled over a decade. There’s no doubt that bringing Max Caulfield back was a shrewd move by the developer, as this is the character that kickstarted the entire franchise in 2015.</p>



<p>As a die-hard fan of the Life is Strange series, I sat down with my copy of Double Exposure (on PlayStation 5) and dove in expecting nothing but good things. The series as a whole has ebbed and flowed, but in my opinion, there has never been a <strong>bad </strong>Life is Strange game.</p>



<p>Fortunately, my expectations were met and exceeded in Double Exposure.</p>



<p>Life is Strange: Double Exposure has been built in Unreal Engine 5, which promotes a sumptuous visual palette that players will be pleased to explore. The original game featured a rather simple aesthetic and little in the way of animations, but Double Exposure is fully motion-captured and everything from the in-game interactions to the facial animations are nothing short of flawless.</p>



<p>Now more than ever, the characters’ emotions are being pulled to the surface.</p>



<p>Of course, where a Life is Strange game shines is in the story, and Double Exposure has twists, turns, and opportunities to explore off the beaten path in droves. It took three years to assemble this game, and it shows – there’s plenty of meat on the bones here and full completion of the five-chapter title will take around ten hours.</p>



<p>And with Life is Strange <strong>being </strong>Life is Strange, you’re encouraged to go back around and try approaching the game from a different angle, making new choices that open up fresh paths through the title.</p>



<h2 id="h-this-action-will-have-consequences">This Action Will Have Consequences</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Deck Nine has established something special with Double Exposure, and we now know it’s not the end for Max Caulfield. This isn’t a spoiler as it was announced by Square Enix, but the character <strong>will return </strong>in future games, which is nothing but a win for all involved.</p>



<p>As I played through Life is Strange: Double Exposure, I found it extremely difficult to be critical of the game. If I have any concerns, they’re mostly centred around the game’s audio. I felt at times that the audio balancing was a little strange, and in one scene, voices could be deafening, while in the next, they’d be whisper-quiet.</p>



<p>At one point, I had a bug that made one character’s voice muffled as though they were standing three rooms over and talking to me through the walls.</p>



<p>It’s not enough to take away from the wonderful set pieces, unique story elements, and phenomenal acting, though. I believe that Double Exposure features the best acting work in the series, and the whole ‘between two worlds’ mechanic is brilliantly done, encouraging players to constantly poke and prod to capture all the small details.</p>



<h2 id="h-verdict-buy">Verdict: Buy</h2>



<p>As a Life is Strange fan, I can’t recommend this game enough. Beyond that, even if I weren’t a fan, this is a solid creation from a dedicated team, backed by a brilliant cast and a stellar engine that makes the game look unbelievably good at times. It’s <strong>well worth </strong>the investment. Max Caulfield is back and she’s better than ever, and that’s all the average fan should need to know to pick up their copy.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-eminem-snoop-dogg-skins/</link>

<p>It wasn’t the quadruple-threat collection I expected, but Epic Games has gone ahead and done it anyway. On social media, images have surfaced showcasing the Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Juice Wlrd, and Ice Spice skins coming soon to the world’s most popular battle royale game, and fans are excited, to say the least.</p>



<p>In a post on the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-run-it-back-with-snoop-eminem-ice-spice-and-juice-wrld-in-battle-royale?lang=en-US&amp;sessionInvalidated=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fortnite blog</a>, Epic unveiled the collection of skins and new locations debuting soon in the Chapter 2 Remix. From Snoop Dogg’s ‘Doggfather’ mansion to Eminem’s restaurant, ‘Mom’s Spaghetti’ in the Grotto, there’s plenty to explore in the coming weeks with this update.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-interesting-update">Interesting Update</h2>



<p>Players will have to contend with these artists as enemies in Fortnite, with each character taking over a unique, on-theme location and dropping rare loot upon defeat. For instance, if you slay Eminem, he’ll turn around on a dime and help you out, offering you the Mythic RG Minigun.</p>



<p>Through November, each new week will be dedicated to the arrival of a different artist. First, players will fight Snoop Dogg, then Eminem, and in the third week, they’ll contend with Ice Spice on Shark Island. </p>



<p>In the fourth and final week, players will come face to face with Juice Wrld, but instead of fighting him, Epic has arranged a tribute to his legacy, offering a unique ‘Slayer Juice Wrld Outfit’ to any player logging in during a specific window. He’ll also be the frontman for the Remix: The Finale live event on November 30.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to this hip-hop collaboration in Fortnite? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> which skin you’re most excited to cop.</p>

                <p>This week, Dragon Age fans have been able to dive back into the continent of Thedas in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-gone-gold/1100-6526915/" data-ref-id="1100-6526915">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>. Longtime players may recognize that events in the game were foreshadowed in some of the previous installments. According to former Dragon Age lead writer David Gaider, that's because he laid out of the series' lore years ago in a document that's still influencing the direction of the games.</p><p>"The way I created the world was to seed plots in various parts of the world that could be part of... a single game," Gaider told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-knew-the-deepest-secrets-of-dragon-age-lore-20-years-ago-and-locked-it-away-in-an-uber-plot-doc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>. "Then there was the overall uber-plot, which I didn't know for certain that we would ever get to, but I had an understanding of how it all worked together... A lot of that was in my head until we were starting Inquisition and the writers got a little bit impatient with my memory or lack thereof, so they pinned me down and dragged the uber-plot out of me. I'd talked about it, I'd hinted at it, but never really spelled out how it all connected, so they dragged it out of me. We put it into a master lore doc, the secret lore, which we had to hide from most of the team."</p><p>Although Gaider left BioWare after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-inquisition-the-descent-review/1900-6416222/" data-ref-id="1900-6416222">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a>, there are signs in The Veilguard that his original plan is still being followed, at least to a degree. He pointed to the return of Fen'Harel as a major example. However, Gaider declined to state what his original ending for the Dragon Age lore was just in case BioWare ever gets around to telling that story.</p><p>"I always had this dream of where it would all end, the very last plot," added Gaider. " But the idea that this uber-plot was this sort of biggest, finite... That the final thing you could do in this world that would break it was there as a 'Maybe we would get to do that one day.'"</p><p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is out now on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <p>Assassin's Creed franchise boss Marc-Alexis Coté has addressed the online backlash which has swirled around the main characters of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, the subsequent  impact it has had on the game's development staff, and the attempts by bad faith commenters to disrupt and dissuade creative teams from telling stories featuring diverse and inclusive characters in general.</p>
<p>Speaking tonight in London, at an event organised by BAFTA and attended by Eurogamer, Coté offered a full-throated defence of his team's work on Shadows which has come under such notable criticism this year, particularly over the inclusion of Black samurai Yasuke as one of the game's two protagonists. Coté has addressed the subject previously, in particular <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-boss-explains-why-he-ignored-elon-musk-after-backlash-over-african-samurai-yasuke">when the subject was commented on negatively by X owner and billionaire Elon Musk</a>, but never before in such an impassioned manner, in so much detail, at such length.</p>
<p>Discussing the current "shifting cultural landscape", Coté described the current "discussions around representation and inclusivity in media" as an additional and previously unforeseen challenge. "These conversations can influence how our games are perceived, but rather than shy away from those conversations, we should see them as an opportunity," he explained.</p>

<p>"Assassin's Creed has always been about exploring the full spectrum of human history, and by its very nature, that history is diverse. Staying true to history means embracing the richness of human perspectives - without compromise. For example, in Assassin's Creed Shadows, we highlight figures, both fictional like Naoe, a Japanese woman warrior, and historical, like Yasuke, the African born samurai. While the inclusion of a Black samurai in feudal Japan has sparked questions and even controversy, Naoe, as a fictional character, has also faced scrutiny for her gender.</p><p>"But just as Yasuke's presence in Japanese history is fact, so too are the stories of women who defied societal expectations and took up arms in times of conflict," Coté continued. "So while both Naoe and Yasuke's stories are works of historical fiction, they reflect the collision of different worlds, cultures and roles, and their inclusion is precisely the kind of narrative that Assassin's Creed seeks to tell, one that reflects the complexity and interconnectedness of our shared history.</p>
<blockquote>"We've consistently introduced protagonists from diverse racial, ethnic and gender identities."</blockquote>
<p>"And this isn't new ground for the franchise," he noted. "From Altaïr to Aveline de Grandpré to Ratonhnhaké:ton [the protagonists of Assassin's Creed 1, Liberation and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-iii">Assassin's Creed 3</a> respectively], we've consistently introduced protagonists from diverse racial, ethnic and gender identities. History is inherently diverse, and so is Assassin's Creed and the stories we tell. So to be clear, our commitment to inclusivity is grounded in historical authenticity and respect for diverse perspectives, not driven by modern agendas."</p>
<p>Coté's tone seemed notably different to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">Ubisoft's last, vague mention of "polarised comments" by company boss Yves Guillemot</a>, who raised eyebrows in September when he told investors that Ubisoft was "an entertainment-first company, creating games for the broadest possible audience, and our goal is not to push any specific agenda". Guillemot's comments followed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-team-acknowledges-elements-that-have-caused-concern-among-japanese-fans">similarly vague blanket apology by Ubisoft</a> for "some elements in our promotional materials [that] have caused concern within the Japanese community" which also stated that "while Yasuke is depicted as a samurai in Assassin's Creed Shadows, we acknowledge this is a matter of debate and discussion". <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-boss-condemns-malicious-developer-abuse-after-assassins-creed-shadows-reveal">Guillemot had previously condemned</a> the "malicious and personal online attacks" directed at Shadows' development team in the wake of the game's reveal.</p><p>"Alongside these deep-rooted franchise values is our commitment to recognise and listen to legitimate criticism as an essential part of the creative process," Coté said tonight. "Our community helps us grow, evolve and deliver better games. Today, we all however face the added challenge of distinguishing between genuine feedback and attacks driven by intolerance.</p>
<p>"The current climate is tough on our creative teams," he continued. "They face lies, half truths and personal attacks online. When the work they pour their hearts into is twisted into a symbol of division, it's not just disheartening, it can be devastating. What keeps me going is the resilience born out of conviction that I see in our teams every day. I am especially proud of the Shadows team for staying true to their creative vision and the core tenets of Assassin's Creed.</p>
<blockquote>"Our creative teams face lies, half truths and personal attacks online."</blockquote>
<p>"By choosing Naoe and Yasuke as protagonists, we are expanding the narrative landscape, offering new points of view that challenge established norms found in many works of fiction, while staying true to the history that shaped them. At the end of the day, Assassin's Creed is not just a franchise, it's a platform for entertainment, dialogue, discovery and understanding. Our commitment isn't just about reflecting on the past, it's about ensuring that the stories we tell continue to unite, inspire and challenge players, regardless of their background, and we'll continue to stand by these values because they are central to the heart of the franchise, and I believe, to the future of storytelling itself. Ultimately, we believe that the diversity and richness of the human experience is what helps Assassin's Creed resonate with players across the globe, and we're committed to standing firm on that foundation."</p>
<p>Coté noted that Assassin's Creed has featured universal themes "like resistance to tyranny and the preservation of knowledge and identity" since its outset, and that it has always featured an opening message acknowledging the game as a work of fiction created by a team diverse in both its backgrounds and beliefs. "From the very beginning, Ubisoft has embraced this diversity," Coté said. "Assassin's Creed is more than just a game. It can be a platform for meaningful exploration and reflection wrapped in the excitement of unforgettable gameplay, and it is that fusion of creativity, diversity, immersion and fun that continues to define the franchise and connect it with players around the globe."</p>
<p>Coté closed with a broader reflection on the stifling of creative freedoms more generally, as cultural differences become ever more divisive.</p>
<p>"Today, the stakes are higher," Coté said. "The stories we tell, the characters we create and the game worlds we build are instrumentalised by those who seek to silence creativity, to stoke fear and incite hatred. I believe we are facing what [author] Fareed Zakaria calls an 'Age of Revolution', a time when the real conflict is not between the left and the right, but between societies that close themselves off and those that open themselves up to the world. Throughout history, it's the open societies that have always eventually prevailed. While there may be setbacks over years or even decades, it is openness that has continually pushed humanity forward.</p>
<blockquote>"When we self-censor in the face of threats, we hand over our power, until freedom and creativity wither away."</blockquote>
<p>"This echoes the selfless bravery of our Assassin's Creed protagonists," he continued. "They fought for freedom, knowledge and the right to chart their own paths, just as we, as creators, fight to tell stories that matter in a world that grows increasingly divided. As the authors of 'How Democracies Die' so powerfully stated, democracies crumble when good people decide to stay silent. The same is true, I think, of our creative freedom when we allow fear to stifle our voices. When we self-censor in the face of threats, we hand over our power, piece by piece, until freedom and creativity both wither away. We cannot let that happen. It's time for us as creators to stand firm on our commitment to our values, by telling stories that inspire, that challenge and that help people connect. Our silence cannot become complicit.</p>
<p>"To our players - the ones who have stood by us, supported us and celebrated our work over the years with enthusiasm and constructive feedback - this stance is for you," Coté concluded. "You are the heart of our journey. We create for you, and your support fuels our creativity and strengthens our resolve to keep pushing boundaries, to tell stories that matter. This journey is yours as much as it is ours, and I thank you for being with us every step of the way. I'm an optimist and a dreamer. I believe that the answer to hate is to continue creating experiences that celebrate the richness of our world and capture the magic of our collective imagination, because in the end, creativity is stronger than fear, and together, we are creating the future of entertainment."</p><p>Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-developer-on-adapting-japanese-culture-social-media-pressures-and-ubisofts-controversial-apology">previously sat down with Assassin's Creed Shadows' art director</a> Thierry Dansereau to discuss the game's adaption of Japanese culture, social media pressures and Ubisoft's controversial apology. "Of course we're making creative choices," Dansereau told me. "It's a video game."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
