			<p>Indiana Jones and The Great Circle was previously slated to be an Xbox exclusive. However, that idea has since been scrapped, and the game will also be coming to PlayStation 5. Xbox confirmed this on Tuesday at Gamescom Opening Night Live, where it was revealed that the game will be swinging onto PS5 in early 2025. However, those on PC and Xbox Series X|S will experience the adventure on 9 December, 2024. Today, Phil Spencer spoke about upcoming changes for Microsoft.</p>
<p>This announcement spells out a huge change happening at Xbox, as this is the latest first-party Xbox game to be announced on PS5. This year has already seen some significant announcements for Xbox, including DOOM: The Dark Ages, Sea of Thieves, and Pentiment, which will also be coming to alternative platforms, such as PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>During an<a href="https://x.com/Knoebelbroet/status/1826246589977153723?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1826246589977153723%7Ctwgr%5Efee93a41b2c89426528ec32cc9492cfb3045d0a1%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.videogameschronicle.com%2Fnews%2Ftheres-going-to-be-more-change-phil-spencer-speaks-on-indy-ps5-news%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> interview today</a> at Gamescom, Phil Spencer was asked to comment on Xbox's latest announcement and the stark change from their previous statement regarding Indiana Jones in February.</p>
<p>"Going to the PlayStation announcement, obviously, last spring we launched four games- two of them on the Switch, four on PlayStation - and we said we are going to learn." Looking at the statistics side, having the games launch on multiple platforms other than being an Xbox exclusive greatly benefits Microsoft.</p>
<p>"What I see when I look is that our franchise are getting stronger, our Xbox console players this year are as high as they've ever been, so I look at it and I say, our player numbers are going up for the console platform, our franchise are as strong as they've ever been... and we run a business," says Phil Spencer at Gamescom.</p>
<p>At the end of the interview, Phil Spencer spoke up about the changes in the gaming industry and the pressure it's facing as a whole. This year alone has seen thousands of layoffs across all types of companies in the games industry, with Microsoft included in that statistic. Spencer claimed that traditional ways of distributing games would continue to change.</p>
<p>"The last thing that I'll say is I think as an industry right now, there's a lot of pressure on the industry. It's been growing for a long time and now people are looking for ways to grow." Which, when looking at the statistics of all major gaming consoles and sales, that doesn't strictly feel true. <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-sales-down-52-year-on-year-in-europe-while-ps5-sales-are-up-143/">Xbox in particular</a> has sold the least amount of units, particularly in Europe. In addition, they've also been dealing with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/ftc-files-complaint-against-microsoft-following-game-pass-price-hike/">complaint filed by the FTC</a> regarding their Game Pass price hike, which doesn't exactly spell good news for Microsoft.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/avowed-30fps-xbox-target</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/avowed-will-run-at-30fps-on-xbox-series-x-s.962004/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/avowed-30fps-xbox-target<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Obsidian has revealed that upcoming action RPG&nbsp;<em>Avowed&nbsp;</em>will target a 30fps frame rate on Xbox Series X|S, so if you're a frame rate fanatic, you might want to pick this one up on PC.</p>
<p>This information comes via Obsidian's Matt Hansen, who's serving as art director on the RPG (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avowed-runs-at-30fps-on-xbox-series-x-and-s-obsidian-confirms" rel="noopener" target="_blank">thanks, IGN</a>). In a recent podcast interview, Hansen told the hosts that Obsidian would target a "baseline" of 30fps, and he doesn't draw any kind of distinction between the Series S and the Series X on that front.</p>
<p>Hansen says that 60fps isn't necessary for a "first-person, single-player game", and that dropping the frame rate target allows him and his studio to "get a lot juicier with VFX and lighting and all this other stuff".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avowed-30fps-console-lizard.jpg?itok=-dmqQUaJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avowed-30fps-console-lizard.jpg?itok=-G_4I7KK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Avowed won't have a high frame rate, but it will have some fancy visual effects.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Hansen, the trade-off that sacrifices a higher frame rate for nicer graphics is one he and the team decided to make "relatively early", and Obsidian is "really happy" with the call it's made.</p>
<p>Despite the relatively low frame rate target, Hansen says that&nbsp;<em>Avowed&nbsp;</em>is "running pretty smooth" considering its visual density, and that the finer points of performance are still being worked out, as they're "one of the last things" developers address.</p>
<p>As IGN points out, there's a history of developers targeting 30fps on launch, only to introduce a 60fps performance mode later. Games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/redfall-will-launch-with-30-fps-quality-mode-only-on-xbox-series-xs"><em>Redfall</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/plague-tale-requiem-60-fps-mode-added-for-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-in-new-patch"><em>A Plague Tale: Requiem</em></a>, and&nbsp;<em>Starfield&nbsp;</em>all launched without 60fps modes, only to have performance-based options added in later.</p>
<p>There's every chance&nbsp;<em>Avowed&nbsp;</em>will go through the same process, but for now, if you're picking the game up on Xbox, you're going to have to cope with a lower frame rate.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avowed-30fps-console-bear.jpg?itok=EUzQkdsy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avowed-30fps-console-bear.jpg?itok=SSijJxgb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This bear won't be moving at a silky-smooth 60fps, at least at launch.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wondering what&nbsp;<em>Avowed&nbsp;</em>is, it's an upcoming fantasy RPG from&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a>&nbsp;</em>developer Obsidian.</p>
<p>Set in the same world as the developer's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/pillars-of-eternity"><em>Pillars of Eternity</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Avowed&nbsp;</em>is a first-person action RPG akin to something like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim"><em>Skyrim</em></a>, albeit hopefully with less bugs and jank on launch. It's heading to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2457220/Avowed/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/avowed/9nhrdqvfpq34" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on February 18th.</p>

</div><div>



            <p>Everything I know about the French Revolution has hitherto come from two literary works: Hilary Mantel's excellent doorstopper <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Place_of_Greater_Safety">A Place Of Greater Safety</a>, and <a href="http://www.harkavagrant.com/index.php?id=321">Kate Beaton's webcomics</a>. Neither Mantel nor Beaton mention mechs, which are a core feature of Studio Imugi's new "ideology driven" turn-based strategy game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bonaparte-a-mechanized-revolution">Bonaparte: A Mechanized Revolution</a>. I, for one, feel like I've been grossly ill-informed. Kate, Hilary - I've been quoting you for years at parties and it seems like all this time, people have been silently judging me for my ignorance of the role giant clockwork soldiers played in the fall of the Bastille.</p><!--more-->
<p>Studio Imugi are made up of veterans of prolific Canadian indie publisher Kitfox Games and Sea Of Stars devs Sabotage. This is their debut game, and it very much looks like a Kitfox production - a nerdy, narrative-led alt-historical sandbox. Here's the announcement trailer...</p>

<p>...and here's some background from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2560340/Bonaparte__A_Mechanized_Revolution/">the Steam page</a>. The game begins in 1789 and casts you as either Céline or César Bonaparte - two seemingly fictional variations upon noted megalomaniac Napoleon. The game keeps some foothold in historical record, but lets you pick your own path through the events of the Revolution. There doesn't have to be a Revolution, for starters. Guillotines are so <em>gauche</em>, after all.  You might choose to defend Marie Antoinette and her ilk against the mob, sending your troops to force-feed the peasants rhetorical cake. Or you could side with the moderates and try to reform the system somehow. Hey, it worked out so well for us British!</p>
<p>Apparently, players will be able to "see policy play out in real time on the battlefield", but it's not really clear what that amounts to from the trailer. It looks like a game of two halves: hex and turn-based battles featuring the aforesaid mechanical Colossi, and tense branching dialogue with period luminaries such as Robespierre. There's also a papery world map with army figurines which looks very Paradox Interactive.</p>
<p>It's out in early 2025, and has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2560340/Bonaparte__A_Mechanized_Revolution/">a Steam page</a>. I get a faint whiff of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/suzerain">Suzerain</a> from the presentation, which is promising, but I'm a little concerned about the mechs, who do feel like an afterthought, skulking furtively behind the colon in the title. Or worse, a publicity gimmick. This doesn't seem to be a steampunk world in other respects. Perhaps Mantel and Beaton were in the right of things, after all.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While many players have defeated the Stone Vanguard, a required boss near the Fright Cliff area, fewer have discovered Shigandang, an optional boss fight that first requires finding the six Buddha’s Eyeballs.

As one player points out, in order to do that, it seems like you need to arrive in the Fright Cliffs through the Squall Hideout rather than the bridge and cave most players are likely to enter from.  you need to have not come into this area via the bridge and cave. Otherwise, it sounds like the Stone Vanguard will be blocking the way to finish getting all of the Buddha’s Eyeballs. </p><p>Once Shigandang and the Stone Vanguard are fighting each other you can either watch from the sidelines or start waling one them yourself like an<em> Elden Ring</em> boss fight where the enemy is distracted by a summoned NPC. Shigandang will eventually destroy the Stone Vanguard for you, at which point you’ll need to finish the job. But it’s neat that the required boss fight is finished for you and a cool scene to watch given how one of <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>’s strong points are its visual designs and cinematic animations. </p><p>You can read more about the game’s strengths and weaknesses in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/black-myth-wukong-review-soulslike-pc-ps5-1851629456&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/black-myth-wukong-review-soulslike-pc-ps5-1851629456"><em>Kotaku</em>’s review</a></span>. <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/black-myth-wukong-steam-game-pass-cyberpunk-elden-ring-1851626674&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/black-myth-wukong-steam-game-pass-cyberpunk-elden-ring-1851626674">flew to the top of the Steam Charts</a></span> hours after coming out this week, beating out records set by other single-player games like <em>Elden Ring</em> and <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>.

<p>Game Science has just confirmed that Black Myth: Wukong has sold 10 million copies since its release on August 20. That makes it one of the fastest-selling games in years, and the numbers outside of the overall sales figure represent the rampant popularity of this title. It has topped streaming charts and the player count is breaking records on some platforms.</p>



<p>With 10 million copies old and no sign of slowing down, this monumental title is shaping up to be the talk of the town for quite some time.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-10-million-and-counting">10 Million and Counting</h2>



<p>Black Myth: Wukong broke peak player count records on Steam, storming above Counter-Strike and securing the top spot as the most-played single-player game in the platform’s history. It hit almost half a million concurrent viewers on Twitch, but it likely dominated Chinese streaming platforms much more effectively – we just don’t have the numbers at present.</p>



<p>For a while, the game was shaken by a slight scandal that surfaced. It was revealed that Game Science issued ‘guidelines’ to influencers that prohibited them from streaming the game and talking about topics like feminism and COVID-19. This was enough to rile some in the gaming community, but it did nothing to slow down the overall impact of the game. </p>

<p>Some players have reported difficulties beating certain bosses, but that’s the nature of the game. It’s another entry in a long line of ‘soulslike’ games that many refer to as ‘Boss Simulators’. However, the enemies in Black Myth: Wukong are innovative and unique enough to stand apart from the competition, even if the general vibe isn’t too dissimilar from top titles like Elden Ring.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> boss Holly Longdale says Blizzard has learned from its controversial Shadowlands launch, acknowledging the expansion "wasn't enough" and "wasn't the right stuff", admitting the team should have "listened more" to its community.</p>
<p>Talking to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/world-of-warcraft/warcraft-vp-on-what-blizzard-should-have-done-differently-over-the-game-s-20-years-we-should-have-listened-more/">PC Gamer</a>, Longdale reflected back over World of Warcraft's storied 20 years, partly as a player, and "as a very humble and lucky leader on this team".</p>

<p>"I think we should have listened more to the player base," Longdale said. "I think quite often in earlier times, game design wasn't even a job, really," she said. "It was a bunch of super incredibly passionate geeks figuring out how to make tabletop gaming into 3D. So, I think there was a lot of going on their best instincts."</p>
<p>Acknowledging the changing shape of social media and community management, Longdale said the development team at the time "wasn't really reflective", so the team has learned to "listen more and observe".</p>
<p>"So listening to the community, and being able to verify the discussions - now we have the technology and the data to be able to map those two, "Longdale explained. "Like, whoa, did we really miss something? And then checking to verify that, oh yeah, this is an issue."</p>
<p>Talking specifically about class balancing, she said: "Like, oh, my class is a disaster. And you get a wealth of commentary and support for those ideas, and then you make a change and then it breaks everything else. Balance is a big example.</p>
<p>"It took longer to make [Shadowlands] content than we would've liked. We remained committed to get it out there, but it wasn't enough, and it wasn't the right stuff. And we looked at that very deeply and we still do to use it as guidance for where we're going."</p>
<p>World of Warcraft's new expansion, The War Within, is now available in early access. For everyone else, the long-running MMORPG will launch soon, on 26th August.</p>
<p>Did you know that the entirety of Blizzard's 500-strong World of Warcraft development team <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzards-world-of-warcraft-team-forms-500-stong-union">have unionised</a>, making it the largest group within Microsoft's gaming teams to do so thus far?</p>
<p>Around 1750 employees within Microsoft's gaming teams are now unionised, including those working on Blizzard's veteran MMO.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>There is a new update on Steam which informs other players if a review left on a game's page was primarily played on Valve's handheld Steam Deck.</p>
<p>The news was shared via the Steam Deck's social media team on <a href="https://x.com/OnDeck/status/1826673475119186082/photo/1">X</a>, with the straight to the point wording: "We've just shipped a new feature on Steam that shows when a customer review was written by someone who played primarily on Steam Deck."</p>

<p>Valve asks that patrons look out for the Deck icon, to "see how these players reviewed the game". It shared an example of how this icon looks on a review, with a little Deck outline displayed in the upper right corner of the screen.</p>
<p>Response to this update has been positive, with many other X users sharing their appreciation. Several messages such as "fantastic idea" and "that'll be extremely helpful" have popped up in the replies since Valve made the announcement. </p>
<p>What do you think of this new Steam update?</p>

<p>As for the Steam Deck itself, back in May, Digital Foundry said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-steam-deck-rt-tested-vs-rog-ally">Valve's portable PC had "quietly become a reasonably capable ray tracing handheld"</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Valve-related news, its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-hero-shooter-deadlock-still-hasnt-been-announced-but-had-16k-steam-concurrent-players-this-weekend">hero shooter known as Deadlock</a> and which the company still hasn't actually announced has welcomed quite the number of players over the last few weeks.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Previous Hero Projects have focused on areas like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonys-china-hero-project-shows-off-five-upcoming-chinese-indie-games">China</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-india-hero-project">India</a>, but this one focuses on eleven specific countries within the MENA regions, aiming to support companies through "mentorship, training, and project-based investment".</p>
<p>According to Sony, the MENA Hero Project is part of "identifying new and diverse developers worldwide" and showcasing "the most incredible talents" the region has to offer. Looks like we might be about to see a whole lot more games from Middle Eastern and North African developers.</p>

<li>Kuwait</li>
<li>Oman</li>

<p>I should point out that the link doesn't appear to work for me, but that might be because I'm based in the UK, and the link only works for those who are operating from one of the above countries.</p>

<p>Of course, it's also possible that the link is just broken right now and that the page will go live at some point in the near future. If that's the case, you might want to bookmark it so that you can check whether it's working later down the line. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things PlayStation.</p>

The powerful material is needed by the elves, but the dwarves stopped mining it because of how dangerous it was. It took nearly an entire season of convincing, but Elrond managed to get Durin to help him get some mithril—however, just as they’re about to start mining again, Durin’s father (the king) stops them. He strips Durin of his title and banishes Elrond from Khazad-dum.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="85605b9c9aca17e486c5fcac6c1a0d2e" data-recommend-id="image://85605b9c9aca17e486c5fcac6c1a0d2e" data-format="jpg" data-width="5000" data-height="3332" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Nori looks towards the sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Nori looks towards the sky." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Amazon Studios</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="85605b9c9aca17e486c5fcac6c1a0d2e" data-recommend-id="image://85605b9c9aca17e486c5fcac6c1a0d2e" data-format="jpg" data-width="5000" data-height="3332" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Nori looks towards the sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Early on in season one, a Stranger (David Weyman) falls from the sky and lands in the land of the Harfoots, who are one of three breeds of Hobbits. Small in stature, brown-haired, and big-footed, the Harfoots are a migratory species, avoiding conflict and relying on nature to keep themselves safe and well-fed. One Harfoot, named Nori (Markella Kavenagh), discovers the Stranger after he crash-lands nearby, and the two forge a bond as he travels with the Harfoots. The Stranger is a wizard (everyone knows it’s Gandalf even though the show hasn’t said it outright yet) who appears to have lost his memory and is struggling to regain the use of his powers. When he leaves to go on an adventure to discover his identity, Nori agrees to go with him, leaving her family behind.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="52b0e734149754f86a6c42765a0a7c16" data-recommend-id="image://52b0e734149754f86a6c42765a0a7c16" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="1688" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The three rings of power." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The three rings of power." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Amazon Studios</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="52b0e734149754f86a6c42765a0a7c16" data-recommend-id="image://52b0e734149754f86a6c42765a0a7c16" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="1688" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The three rings of power." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The rings of power are magical artifacts bestowed upon men, elves, and dwarves that highlight and enhance the user’s innate abilities.

During <em>The Rings of Power</em> season one, we learn that the Elven smith Celebrimbor (Charles Edwards), is forging these rings with a small amount of mithril.

Throughout the season, their bond grows stronger, even after he’s captured by Orcs and forced to work on their dam. Arondir and Bronwyn help defend the Southlands against the Orcs, and are saved at the last minute by Galadriel and the Númenóreans. Bronwyn plans to lead her people, who are now without a home, to the port of Gondor. <br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d7a6ef68bb6d0c29ebb3ede58fd33664" data-recommend-id="image://d7a6ef68bb6d0c29ebb3ede58fd33664" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="2000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Adar walks behind Orcs." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Adar walks behind Orcs." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Amazon Studios</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d7a6ef68bb6d0c29ebb3ede58fd33664" data-recommend-id="image://d7a6ef68bb6d0c29ebb3ede58fd33664" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="2000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Adar walks behind Orcs." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Adar (played by Joseph Mawle in season one, and Sam Hazeldine in season two), is a fallen elf who became leader of the Orcs. He oversees their work to create Mordor, torturing the people of the Southlands, but he soon becomes disillusioned by Sauron’s plans and his treatment of the Orcs and decides to seek a magical sword hilt that can bestow great power upon him. That sword hilt, first found and stolen by Bronwyn’s son, Theo, is believed to have been forged by Morgoth (the big bad before Sauron) and will lengthen into a full sword if imbued with someone’s blood. In the final episode of season one, Adar is captured after the Númenóreans and Galadriel come to the rescue of the people of the Southlands, and it’s believed he leaves the sword hilt behind. But he escapes, and we discover that he switched out the sword hilt for a decoy—now he has the sword and Mordor.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fe34c8a6990fc02b561d6450308425c1" data-recommend-id="image://fe34c8a6990fc02b561d6450308425c1" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="1999" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Miriel stands at court." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Miriel stands at court." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Amazon Studios</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fe34c8a6990fc02b561d6450308425c1" data-recommend-id="image://fe34c8a6990fc02b561d6450308425c1" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="1999" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Miriel stands at court." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>A huge focus of <em>The Rings of Power</em> season one is the tension between races, especially men and elves.

But some Númenórean senators are unhappy with this decision, and by the end of season one, it’s clear that this is going to become a problem for Miriel going forward. After the horrific battle at Mordor, Elendil (Lloyd Owen) thinks his son Isildur (Maxim Baldry), the very same Isildur who eventually is corrupted by a ring of power, is dead, and Miriel is blind. The future of Númenor and the relationship between men and elves hangs in the balance.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="db58b9c00f6226ac251037ea03f7f34b" data-recommend-id="image://db58b9c00f6226ac251037ea03f7f34b" data-format="jpg" data-width="2999" data-height="2001" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Halbrand captured." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Halbrand captured." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Amazon Studios</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="db58b9c00f6226ac251037ea03f7f34b" data-recommend-id="image://db58b9c00f6226ac251037ea03f7f34b" data-format="jpg" data-width="2999" data-height="2001" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Halbrand captured." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>For much of season one, Galadriel is hanging out with a hottie known as Halbrand (Charlie Vickers) in Númenor, the great island civilization of man.

After spending some time there (Galadriel was not allowed to leave at first), she convinces Halbrand to join her in the fight to reclaim the Southlands, and the two defeat Adar, the leader of the Orcs.

<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeAQ9zpZg8I" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new trailer</a> released today, Maximum Entertainment confirmed that Squirrel with a Gun will launch on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5 on October 15, 2024.</p>



<p>Until now, those platforms only had a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/squirrel-with-a-gun-release-date-window-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release window for fall 2024</a>, and today’s announcement coincides with day three of Gamescom. The new console release trailer showcases vehicle and drone gameplay, a wide range of shooting, platforming, and more. </p>



<p>Ahead of the Xbox and PlayStation releases, Maximum Entertainment <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/squirrel-with-a-gun-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously announced</a> that Squirrel with a Gun will launch on PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store on August 19, 2024.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Just this week, Insider Gaming also revealed reactions after a hands-on experience with the game, deeming Squirrel with a Gun <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/squirrel-with-a-gun-hands-on-another-indie-must-buy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another Indie Must Buy</a>. There is currently no plan to release the game on last-gen consoles. </p>



<p>Today’s trailer also shows off the central objective of the sandbox game, which is to collect golden acorns by any means necessary. </p>



<p>Earlier this month, the devs shared a post-release roadmap on the official <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2067050/Squirrel_with_a_Gun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam page</a>, including content coming through August 2025. This September, the game will add a Photo Mode. A new Super Platforming Challenge level and a new rival are both coming in December 2024.</p>



<p>Some fans compare Squirrel with a Gun to hit sandbox action games like Goat Simulator 3 from Coffee Stain, who <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/goat-simulator-remastered-revealed-at-gamescom-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced a Remastered version</a> during Gamescom.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/firaxis-big-swing-with-civilization-vii-convincing-players-to-actually-finish-their-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It has been eight years since Firaxis launched </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Civilization VI</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but creative director Ed Beach hasn't stopped ruminating on what the studio might have done differently.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Civilization VI</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was very successful," he says, speaking to Game Developer at Gamescom 2024, "but it didn't mean the design team loved it by the time we were finished. We are self critical, and we're happy to dissect and pick apart our own creation and see its flaws."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Beach was looking to the past to explain how Firaxis is approaching the future, which is important to understand given it has just unveiled </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Civilization VII</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. He explains Firaxis uses a formula that requires each new entry in the franchise to incorporate equal parts new content, updated content, and existing content.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a rule of thirds that enables the studio to innovate without completely alienating players—while also avoiding scope creep. Digging into how that equation influenced production on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Civilization VII</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which is slated to launch in February 2025, Beach says the headline issue was the fact players simply weren't finishing games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The number [of people who completed a game of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Civ VI</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">] was surprisingly, depressingly—whatever adjective you want to put in there—low. It was less than 50 percent. So, why is that happening?," he asks.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The short answer is 'pacing.' He says your average Civilization player might spend 15 to 20 hours completing a single game. As the hours pass and empires grow, the managerial elements become more pronounced, leaving players needing to complete a exponentially growing list of tasks just to get through a turn.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Beach claims players "hated" the pacing of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Civilization VI</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It's an admission that resulted in Firaxis&nbsp;conducting individual postmortems of each system to learn when they pushed "important, strategic decisions you don't have to make more than every five to 10 minutes," and when they demanded players make "tiresome 'click here, click here, click, here' decisions that just aren't very interesting."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A sequel for the ages">A sequel for the ages</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That inquisition saw Firaxis reconfigure </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Civilization VII</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to ensure more people felt capable of crossing the finish line. "The number one thing we wanted to do was break the game up into chapters," Beach explains. "We're calling them 'ages' this time. We're only at three ages to get through the game, because there's a lot of restructuring around the map that happens between the two age transitions. We wanted to make it so we could reset the board a little bit and simplify things out and change up the rules. [For instance], our trade system works differently in each age."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Exploration has also been tweaked to preserve the sense of fun sparked by discovery. "I think a core pillar of 4X games is exploration, and that's one reason players wouldn't go all the way through the game and restart. It's because that first 50 turns of figuring out where you are on the map and who's around you is innately fun. We have done some things [this time] to bottle up that fun and spread it throughout the game," says Beach.</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kK_JrrP9m2U?si=Yi1_1aiiNZ7TuO6w" height="315px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Elaborating, he explains </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Civilization VII</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is broken into chapters, beginning with the 'Antiquity Age.' During that age, players will only be allowed to explore the landmass they start on. "Even if you invest in a lot of naval technology, we won't let you go across the ocean," adds Beach.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When asked how the team will essentially restrict players without causing frustration, he explains the technique was used in past titles across 70 to 80 percent of maps. Now, it's being enforced without exception.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Again referencing the formula we mentioned earlier, Beach says the team wasn't shy when it came to pitching new ideas—but sometimes you have to cut your coat according to your cloth.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The design team were so self-critical," he says. "They were like 'we want to change this, and this, and this.' So, I would bring up that rule of thumb and say 'you want to do something entirely different here, Another thing entirely different here. These two areas—the foundations are the same but they're falling into our 'one third modified'. There were times I could see the trajectory was radically different enough that it was violating that formula."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Beach created a spreadsheet that he whipped out during two design meetings to prove his colleagues were over-indexing and breaking the formula. "[I said] basically you get 33 percent total change, and then another 33 percent you can modify," he adds. "So you've got a 50 percent budget for changing the game, and you're all at 60 percent—and we haven't even finished all of this."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When deciding which aspects of the franchise to alter, Firaxis uses a technique called 'ripples.' It's a process that requires the team to understand "the minimum viable amount of implementation you need to get to the core idea of something you can then experiment with." Testing is a fundamental part of that process.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We have single player playtests and multiplayer playtests on a scheduled cadence," continues Beach. "So, whatever is ready to try out in the next playtest session [is included]. Then the whole design team gets together and discusses [the feedback]."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Underlining the importance of variety when playtesting, he notes combat becomes more visible in multiplayer tests because people "like to bash on each other." Conversely, single player tests are better for appraising systems like building and diplomacy.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Looking towards launch, Beach explains Firaxis currently has hundreds of developers working on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Civilization VII</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and is "taking full responsibility for shipping to all the platforms in house." That decision was made to ensure all versions of the title, which is built on a proprietary engine, work as intended. He says it's a choice that has left the studio in a "more comfortable place" as it attempts to wrap production.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

Take the ballroom scene from Disney's Beauty And The Beast, swap the wailing utensils for an army of chibi cats, endow Belle with low-key Doctor Manhattan-grade powers of matter transformation, and you're perhaps <em>beginning</em> to approximate the experience of Infinity Nikki - an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> dress-up adventure from Singapore-based Infold and former Legend of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild developer Kentaro Tominaga.</p>
<p>Trailered this week at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/gamescom-2024">Gamescom 2024</a>, it's the fifth installment in the hitherto mobile-focussed Nikki series and it's seemingly going down a storm, with over 12 million pre-registrations so far (albeit, many of them motivated by the prospect of collectively unlocked in-game bonuses). It's also a free-to-play game, and I have the usual unanswered questions about currencies and gacha, but I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt for the minute, because I have not spent nearly enough of my life considering the tactical applications of ballgowns. Here's that trailer.

Some plot gleaned from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/infinity-nikki-the-first-hands-on-preview">a recent Ian Games preview</a>: princess or princess-adjacent heroine Nikki is rifling through her wardrobe for an outfit when she discovers an enchanted dress. The dress promptly abducts her, yanking her through a portal into the sparkling Narnified Hyrule that is Miraland. Here she meets a cursed goddess, Ena, who tasks her with saving the world from evil using the power of the lost Miracle Outfits.</p>
<p>Along the way, she'll snatch up a bazillion other fresh looks that bestow various powers and skills - fishing, stealthy movement, mastery of electronics, bug-catching, shrinking yourself so you can ride around on your pet <del>Moogle</del> cat's head. It's the costume-based verbing of Final Fantasy X-2, applied to open worlding. Do not despair of the absence of expressly warlike elements, for war is but fear cloaked in taffeta, and the hem is mightier than the sword.
</p>
<p>
There <em>is</em> combat, aka monster purification, but it's played light. Enemies have names like Bouldy and sometimes literally consist of materials for posh frocks. The land appears to be populated chiefly by tailors and stylists, rather than the usual brooding blacksmiths and arms dealers. Zeldary touches abound: you get a Pear-Pal tablet akin to Breath Of The Wild's Sheikah Slate, which is used principally for photoshoots, and one of the dresses lets you glide. There are also dungeons of a sort with platforming sequences: one of them consists of a Dream Warehouse full of paper cranes that represent wishes. Complete it, and you'll get to fly away on one. Some other things you can ride on: magic trains, bicycles, minecarts in wine cellars, and a bloody great bird that follows a fixed route around the map.
</p>
<p>
I'm fairly charmed? I am firmly expecting the so-far-unspecified monetisation elements to be as savage as the visuals are saccharine - this feels like it's aimed squarely at magpie children with unregulated access to their parent's bank cards. But I dig the idea of an open world explicitly built around gladragging, inasmuch as playing dress-up is secretly the best part of many games - including games which ostensibly frown upon such frivolous distractions because Look Here, I Am A Serious Artform or Dress-Up Is For Girls. Put it this way: Dark Souls has a fashion scene. Anyway, you can read more of Nikki and her doings on <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/infinity-nikki-71fc64?lang=en-US">the Epic Game Store</a>.</p>

		<p><em>It’s never been more expensive and more convoluted to watch sports. This game is only on this streaming service at this time. That game is only available if you sign up for cable or some digital equivalent.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>What every service has in common, though, is that those sports look pretty crummy! It doesn’t matter if you have an OLED TV, fiber internet—or both. We live in an era where TV manufacturers will brazenly slap an 8K sticker on a piece of equipment, yet you can’t watch athletes toss a ball at half that resolution.</em></p><p><em>It might seem like a weird thing to get hung up on, but given how much Olympics we’ve been watching at Remap, given how much anticipation we have for the upcoming NFL season, is it any surprise that we’re now fully in the mode of nitpicking how it looks? </em></p><p><em>This is Remap—do we even consider this a “nitpick”?</em></p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@pakro?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Peter Oertel</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Patrick, I have to tell you about my Saturday because it was one of the most “did you ever think you’d have it so good?” lazy weekends in recent memory. MK and I woke up late and decided to watch <em>The Caped Crusader </em>on Amazon, both of us inordinately pleased that we were getting to enjoy Saturday morning cartoons at our age. Then it was time to catch up on some of the weird Olympic indoor cycling events, each of which seems designed to take sprint cycling and make it somehow more complicated, faster, and dangerous—every single one of them feels like a sport you’d see on TV in a dystopian sci-fi movie, except that everyone would be wearing more latex and neon. Next thing I know, it’s time to watch Caleb Williams in his first preseason game with the Bears (hey, he looked <em>good</em>) and then it was the gold medal men’s basketball match between France and the U.S., which might have given me some of the greatest sports moments of my life.</p><p>Weekends, man. They’re great.</p><p>But the thing that I wanted to bring up is the fact that most of what I was watching didn’t actually look <em>good</em>. Which is funny because if you watch sports on TV for a couple hours you’ll see at least a couple ads for new TVs that promise to make sports look more lifelike and more involving than ever before. Now those ads always use generic “football!” footage where no league or team branding is remotely identifiable, and I’ve usually assumed that’s because every league now has “official” TV brands they partner with… but I think the fact that any actual game footage looks like compressed, pixelated crap might also have a lot to do with it.</p><p>I don’t know how, with a bigger screen and paying more money than ever before to watch TV on it, the names on players’ jerseys have gotten <em>harder </em>to read, but somehow they have. At least watching the basketball game on Peacock you had that gorgeous court that players really popped against, but that Bears game on the NFL Network? I felt like I was watching it on a flip phone circa 2006. It honestly looked like the NFL was hosting a pirate restream of its own game.</p><p>I can’t tell why I’m noticing this more these days. Maybe it’s that Youtube TV is just compromised enough that it bugs me more than Comcast’s compression did on my DVR, but it also feels like sports broadcast standards just haven’t improved in a decade? If you’re not watching a flagship sports broadcast, it’s a complete crapshoot as to what you are going to get. The really funny thing is, the local Bulls broadcast generally looks pretty good but anything on ESPN looks like it’s been piped through multiple cable splitters, before being brute-force resized to make space for ESPN’s news crawl.</p><p>Is this what we get for being the audience that networks have always known is the most captive? Increasingly I think the only people who regularly watch live TV are sports fans, but I cannot believe how little any league seems to care about how their product is represented. Do you think this ever gets better, or are we going to be watching blocky 720p regional sports broadcasts on our deathbeds?</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@emanuelekstrom?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Emanuel Ekström</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>Every few months, I’ll click on the “4K upgrade” option that YouTube TV dangles in front of you during a major sports event. And every time, you’re reminded how very little 4K content there is available to watch, outside of the singular game they’re advertising against. I can’t speak to the exact technical limitations that are preventing the transition to 4K, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/49ers/comments/1907o2w/when_is_the_nfl_going_to_start_broadcasting_in_4k/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>but reading this reddit thread is pretty illuminating.&nbsp;</u></a></p><p>I do think it comes down to being conservative on costs, and knowing the vast majority of people absolutely do not give a shit about 4K and could not tell you if it existed. We’ve gotten used to lower bit rates. We’ve gotten used to motion smoothing. We’re getting used to shockingly good AI upscaling. TV production became a race to produce cheaper panels at larger sizes and slap a 4K sticker on top of it, even though most people aren’t using physical media that could best take advantage of such a display, and I doubt most people are even aware if their streaming service is capable of letting them stream 4K.</p><p>That’s before you consider that, in an era of devices, people are often not even watching on a TV itself.&nbsp;</p><p>Plus, we’re instead in an era of convenience, and companies are turning the screws on convenience after hooking us on a decade-plus of unsustainably cheap services that Wall Street is finally demanding should actually make money. At some point, there will be a middle ground between how much these companies can charge, produce, and retain subscribers while ensuring profitability. It’s at that point these companies will have a few less levers to pull to get more out of people. 4K, though, is one of those premium levers, and while it might have less pull on a more disposable service like Netflix, it might have actual pull when you’re talking about a live sports event that’s meant to be consumed and enjoyed as it’s taking place.</p><p>4K…as a treat? (Just remember to cancel your 4K upgrade as soon as the event is over.)</p><p>Which is all to say that my suspicion is that 4K is coming slowly and mostly by accident, as internet infrastructure moves along, equipment gets replaced, etc. And the moment it becomes possible for 4K to become the status quo, you’ll get charged up the ass for it, especially for sports. Why would they give it to you for free, when they absolutely know that you and I would kill to watch even pre-season games in 4K?</p>

<p>In a new <a href="https://blog.ja.playstation.com/2024/08/23/20240823-tgs2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a>, PlayStation revealed some of its plans for Tokyo Game Show 2024 such as a Death Stranding 2 stage event, booth titles, scheduling, and more.</p>



<p>Sony confirmed that this year’s booth will feature Astro Bot and Monster Hunter Wilds. Although the former launches in early September 2024, before the Tokyo Game Show itself, Monster Hunter Wilds doesn’t release until 2025.</p>



<p>PlayStation will have a giant functioning gacha machine, inspired by the upcoming Astro Bot game. There will also be 40 units of Monster Hunter Wilds at the booth, with a limited supply of acrylic keychains for guests.</p>



<p>Most recently, Capcom revealed an all-new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/watch-the-new-monster-hunter-wilds-gameplay-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monster Hunter Wilds gameplay trailer</a> as part of Gamescom’s Opening Night Live.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Loosely translated from today’s blog, PlayStation also announced the “Death Stranding 2 Special Stage” presentation. </p>



<p>This will feature director Hideo Kojima and Daichi Miura, as well as a few guests. PlayStation will host Death Stranding 2 Special Stage beginning at 10:30 on September 29, 2024.</p>



<p>Most recently, Kojima <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-posts-new-death-stranding-2-tease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased a new character</a> coming to Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, possibly involving actor Kenjiro Tsuda.</p>



<p>PlayStation also plans to reveal more playable titles and events coming to Tokyo Game Show 2024 at a later date. TGS 2024 will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tokyo-game-show-2024-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kick off on September 26, 2024</a>, and this year’s theme is “Trailblaze the World with Gaming.” </p>

            <p>Good news, Nintendo fans - Super Mario and Pokémon products will be popping up in the middle aisles of Aldis everywhere this weekend.</p>
<p>Whilst some Teenage Mutant Ninja/Hero Turtles, Paddington Bear, and Hello Kitty stuff crept into Aldi earlier this week, from Saturday 24th August middle aisles will boast a <a href="https://www.aldi.co.uk/c/specialbuys">selection of cut-price game-flavoured treats</a>, including duvet sets, throws, and cushions.</p>

<p>As well as Mario and co., you may also find some items pertaining to other famous game franchises, too, like Sonic the Hedgehog and Pokémon merchandise.</p>

<p>Sadly, it appears that most of the <a href="https://www.aldi.co.uk/gaming-single-duvet-set/p/735254794984400">duvet sets</a> are for single beds only, so you won't be able to surprise your other half by slipping a Super Mario quilt onto the bed Saturday night. Sorry.</p>
<p>As is usually the case on Aldi's middle aisle deals, "once they're gone, they're gone", so the store advises eager fans to turn up early if they fancy anything.</p>
<p>If you miss out on Aldi's merch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-confirms-six-all-new-mario-kart-sets-are-on-the-way">Lego recently revealed that six new Mario Kart sets are on the way</a>. This marks the very first time Mario's racer will be immortalised in brick form.</p>
<p>Launching on New Year's Day 2025, Lego says "each set has been designed to ensure that anyone can enjoy the joy of the Super Mario universe" and includes interactive elements such as audio and visual effects.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It looks like people are quite keen to get their hands on the next instalment in the Nikki series.</p>
<p>As shared on social media platform X, over 12 million of us have already pre-registered for Infinity Nikki, the "cosy open-world adventure" follow-up to the highly successful mobile series of dress up games.</p>
<p>Infinity Nikki is helmed by PaperGames with Kentaro Tominaga - whose name you may recognise from his days at Nintendo - <a href="https://kotaku.com/love-nikki-infinity-nintendo-breath-of-the-wild-pc-ps5-1849836269">leading the project</a>. Tominaga's other credits include  designer on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and director of its Expansion Pass, to name but two.</p>

<p>Sharing the game's latest milestone, the Infinity Nikki team thanked everyone who has signed up so far, writing: "Look, some airborne friends are carrying Nikki across the vast sky with their blessings. Thank you to all the stylists for your support and enthusiasm!"</p>
<p>It said there will be "more surprises ahead" and we should all "aim for the next goal together". That next goal will be 20 million pre-registrations, which will <a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/en/home?shortlink=EN&amp;c=%E9%A6%96%E6%9B%9D%E8%B7%B3%E8%BD%AC%E5%AE%98%E7%BD%91-0530&amp;pid=X6-%E7%A4%BE%E5%AA%92-%E9%A6%96%E6%9B%9D%E8%B7%B3%E8%BD%AC%E5%AE%98%E7%BD%91-0530&amp;af_click_lookback=30d&amp;af_xp=custom&amp;source_caller=ui">reward the community with a 4-star outfit</a>.</p>
<p>For more context on this pre-registration enthusiasm, Niko Partners analyst <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1826664499518009684">Daniel Ahmad</a> noted the previous game in the series had over 100m downloads.</p> <div>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-games-boss-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-still-trying-to-find-hook.961890/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-games-boss-lord-of-rings-mmo<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Amazon Games boss Christoph Hartmann has provided an update on the ongoing development of the studio's&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</em>MMO, and it sounds like the project is still very early on in its development.</p>
<p>In an interview with IGN, Hartmann says the&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</em>MMO is "still early" and that the project is still "trying to find the hook". Hartmann says he and Amazon don't want to "go and do the same thing over", but instead to "find a fresh twist" on the MMO genre.</p>
<p>He says Amazon and the development team are still searching for "what could be the thing which is different to all the other games out there", so it sounds like it's going to be a very long time before we actually get to play the company's&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</em>MMO.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lord-of-the-rings-online-amazon-lotr-mmo.jpg?itok=EQ0guavk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lord-of-the-rings-online-amazon-lotr-mmo.jpg?itok=DKPjWcSD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Amazon's upcoming&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</em>MMO will sit alongside Standing Stone's <em>The&nbsp;</em><em>Lord of the Rings Online</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>We first learned about the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</em>MMO <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-games-new-world-developer-working-on-lord-of-rings-open-world-mmo">back in May last year</a>, when it was revealed that the development team behind the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-world-review-bomb-relaunch">somewhat ill-fated</a>&nbsp;<em>New World&nbsp;</em>would be working on it.</p>
<p>This is, it should be noted, distinct from the project that Amazon reportedly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-game-studios-cancels-lord-of-rings-game">canceled over a contract dispute</a> with Tencent back in 2021, although since neither game was technically officially unveiled, the new title could certainly be using some of the DNA of that canceled project.</p>
<p>In any case, Hartmann also provides an update on the new&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>game in the IGN interview. He says Crystal Dynamics is "fairly sheltered" from what IGN calls the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-has-laid-off-8-of-its-employees-and-it-isnt-done-yet-despite-record-quarter">"recent turmoil"</a> with the developer's parent company Embracer Group.</p>
<p>Hartmann acknowledges that making a new&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>is a "huge, huge task" with a "high" bar, but he says "things are progressing". That's arguably not much of an update, but hey, it's nice to know the game hasn't been canned.</p>

<p>It's not just updates about games that Hartmann provides in the IGN interview, though. He's also got some...interesting (some might say "questionable") things to say about the gaming industry as a whole.</p>
<p>One rather intriguing comment Hartmann makes is that the gaming industry doesn't "really have acting", a sentiment with which I'm sure the industry's voice actors and motion capture professionals would vehemently disagree.</p>
<p>Hartmann is making these comments as part of a wider point about generative AI, which he says can "help us to have new gameplay ideas" and take away "the boring parts" of game development. Hmm.</p>

<p>He goes on to say, however, that having such a franchise is "the whole point" for Amazon, because it's a "larger than life company" and because smaller franchises would "not be interesting". He also says Amazon's not "in here to try it out and do some cute game development".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-doesnt-need-60-fps-mode-says-obsidian/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Obsidian confirmed in a new interview that Avowed’s core performance target will be 30 fps on Xbox Series X/S consoles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Obsidian’s art director, Matt Hansen, recently discussed Avowed’s performance during an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxBL4jTHs5w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Iron Lords Podcast</a>. When asked about the game’s console performance targets, Hansen stated that the team is ‘core targeting 30 fps bare minimum’.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🎙️ INTERVIEW  🎙️</p><p>Avowed developers confirm 30FPS was the target FPS from the start of development </p><p>“Since the game is a first person single player game you don't need a 60fps mode”</p><p>It could be 30FPS locked on Xbox </p><p>How do you all feel about this?💚🎮<br> <a href="https://t.co/FLBIZVnJa7">pic.twitter.com/FLBIZVnJa7</a></p></div>— GPT Gaming News (@GPTGamingNews) <a href="https://twitter.com/GPTGamingNews/status/1826920564700631363?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 23, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Hansen added that Avowed is a “first-person, single-player game”, so players don’t “necessarily need” 60 fps. Additionally, targeting 30 fps allows Obsidian to bring better visuals to the table as they could get “a lot juicier with the effects, the lighting, etc.”. It’s a “tradeoff” that the studio had decided on pretty early into the development process, and the “game has been running pretty smooth for how visually dense it is”, stated Hansen.&nbsp;He concluded by stating that they are still figuring out the performance stuff as that is “one of the last things you do”. </p>



<p>Our Senior Editor attended a gameplay demo live at Gamescom 2024 and failed to see any issue with how Avowed ran. Even in intense combat sequences filled with blasts of magic and clashing swords, the game looked brilliant on screen. He noted that the traversal system needed a little work, but Avowed presents itself as a solid and well-built game overall.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/heroes-of-might-and-magic-olden-era-takes-the-franchise-back-to-its-roots.961878/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/heroes-of-might-and-magic-olden-era-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft and developer Unfrozen Studio have announced&nbsp;<em>Heroes of Might and Magic: Olden Era</em>, and as the name suggests, it's a deliberate throwback to the strategy gaming roots of the franchise.</p>
<p>Per Ubisoft's <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/62HpoWQkAIVogVkoVk8JuJ/heroes-of-might-and-magic-olden-era-unveiled-at-gamescom" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement post</a>, the game will be released "just in time for [the franchise's] 30th anniversary" and will take place in the land of Enroth as it was before the events of the original 1995&nbsp;<em>Heroes of Might and Magic</em>.</p>
<p>If you're a&nbsp;<em>Might and Magic&nbsp;</em>buff, you might recognize the name of the as-yet unrevealed continent of Jadame, which is where the game takes place, allowing Unfrozen to include "new factions, biomes, and creatures".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/heroes-of-might-and-magic-olden-era-combat.jpg?itok=ii6hn_49 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/heroes-of-might-and-magic-olden-era-combat.jpg?itok=2jWVzFsE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Heroes of Might and Magic: Olden Era&nbsp;</em>returns to the franchise's roots.</figcaption></figure><p>Gameplay will largely be split between two core pillars: exploration, in which you'll find resources and build your base, and combat, in which you'll pit your armies against your enemies.</p>
<p>Compared to previous games in the series, Ubisoft and Unfrozen say you'll have "more control over how [you] level up heroes and their factions". The classic hexagonal grid is back, though, so if you're a&nbsp;<em>Heroes of Might and Magic&nbsp;</em>fan, that'll probably give you a nice nostalgic kick.</p>
<p>Specifically, Ubisoft says&nbsp;<em>Heroes of Might and Magic&nbsp;</em>takes inspiration from&nbsp;the third game in the series, as well as the second and fifth entries, all of which are considered strategy classics by the series' fanbase.</p>
<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Heroes of Might and Magic: Olden Era&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>

<p>If you feel like you've heard developer Unfrozen's name somewhere before, you may be thinking of its previous game,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/iratus-lord-of-dead"><em>Iratus: Lord of the Dead</em></a>, which took heavy inspiration from Red Hook's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/darkest-dungeon"><em>Darkest Dungeon</em></a>. It does, however, prove that Unfrozen has prior when it comes to turn-based combat.</p>
<p><em>Heroes of Might and Magic: Olden Era&nbsp;</em>launches for PC via Steam Early Access (an unusual move for Ubisoft, but one shared by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/rogue-prince-of-persia-is-roguelite-precision-platforming-at-its-finest"><i>The Rogue Prince of Persia</i></a>) next year. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/FirstDescendant/status/1826952588295913791" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a> today, producer Lee Beom-jun announced that Season 1 of The First Descendant will now have two updates instead of three, moving its fall updates to October 10, 2024.</p>



<p>The producer acknowledged fan backlash following yesterday’s announcement that Season 1 Invasion would have a three-part structure. They apologized to fans, stating that “I have to admit that I’ve failed to fully meet your expectations.”</p>



<p>The previous Season 1 schedule would drop two different updates on September 26 and October 30, 2024. Lee Beom-jun explained this intended to “provide consistent updates every month, before each content release.” </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Now, The First Descendant’s October 10 update will merge all of the content from both of Season 1’s previous fall updates. That includes Ultimate Freyna, hard-mode infiltration, external components, and more.</p>



<p>In today’s post, Lee Beom-jun revealed that “we have also begun examining the update methods for the upcoming seasons in the future.” This implies that following seasons will also adhere to the updated schedule.</p>



<p>They also added that “the Dev team is working on continuous updates and hotfixes,” reorganizing their development process, and recruiting more personnel.</p>



<p>The First Descendant rolled out its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-descendants-new-major-content-update-is-releasing-early/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first major content update</a> late last month, as well as some <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-descendant-summer-vacation-bundles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Summer Vacation-themed skins</a>. Season 1 Invasion will still begin on August 29, 2024. </p>
