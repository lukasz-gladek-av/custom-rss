What makes it tricky is that you do not have free control of this weapon, and must instead use wires that are pre-set through-out the level. Once you come across these traps, you’ll have to trick the nearby enemies into walking through them, and swiftly destroy the irritating bots. Luckily, the Tripcaster lines occur fairly early in the level, so you should have the trophy pretty quickly.</p><p>Make your way through the level until you come across a floating balloon with a green canister attached to it. Shoot the balloon to open a red target through the other side of the mountain. Firing an arrow at this will cause a wire to shoot out, connecting both sides. Slide down it and while doing so, use your bow to take down the two electric enemies waiting for you at the end.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="7440953375855505cd15754f756285af" data-recommend-id="image://7440953375855505cd15754f756285af" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The red target seen through the tree." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The red target seen through the tree." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7440953375855505cd15754f756285af" data-recommend-id="image://7440953375855505cd15754f756285af" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The red target seen through the tree." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You will then come across your first tripcasters in the level, but there aren’t any enemies here to destroy. So jump on the launchpad up ahead to be brought up to a landing where there are three of the traps aligned in a circle, and seven enemies. How convenient!<br></p><p>The goal here is to jump over the lines, attract the attention of the enemies, and then jump back and forth tricking them into running into the traps. One thing to note is that hovering over the lines will cause them to break, so as you are hopping around, make sure not to whip out your hover lasers. The enemies will also occasionally not fall for the trap, and end up hopping over the line. If they do, just keep on moving around the circle until they run into another one.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="536e337d6dd1fa351fe2ab2dcb7b5a3a" data-recommend-id="image://536e337d6dd1fa351fe2ab2dcb7b5a3a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The key spot for trapping baddies with tripwires." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The key spot for trapping baddies with tripwires." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="536e337d6dd1fa351fe2ab2dcb7b5a3a" data-recommend-id="image://536e337d6dd1fa351fe2ab2dcb7b5a3a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The key spot for trapping baddies with tripwires." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There is another spot later in the level that has Tripcasters as well, however there aren’t seven enemies here. It could be used if you accidentally kill one of the enemies in the first area, but it is generally easier to just restart the level and try again.<br></p><hr><p>Now that its objectives have been cleared up, you can enjoy the rest of the level inspired by the hit <em>Horizon</em> games stress-free.

These remastered editions update the sprites of the originals and add some quality of life improvements. While there were some issues with the versions upon release—such as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-pixel-remasters-cost-a-bunch-and-have-tin-1847207168&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-pixel-remasters-cost-a-bunch-and-have-tin-1847207168">tiny text</a></span>—those have largely been smoothed out through updates. Which means Xbox users shouldn’t have much of a problem and can dive right in.</p><p>That does raise the eternal question: where to start? If you really want to take a trip down memory lane you can start with the very first <em>Final Fantasy</em>, which was originally released in 1987. While the more simplistic RPG is a far cry from the epic stories seen in more recent entries, series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi still thinks it’s the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-creator-s-pick-for-the-most-complete-en-1851635714&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-creator-s-pick-for-the-most-complete-en-1851635714">most complete</a></span> game of the bunch, and it holds up surprisingly well.</p><p>My personal suggestion would be to start with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-iv-was-ahead-of-its-time-1785708699&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-iv-was-ahead-of-its-time-1785708699"><em>FF4</em></a></span>. The 1991 RPG is essentially the real birth of the franchise as we know it today. It’s the first <em>FF </em>game known for having an emotional story driven by an incredible cast of well-written characters. The story of the Dark Knight Cecil coming to terms with his own culpability in horrific acts in a journey to save the world feels like a classic fantasy story of knights, wizards, and monsters. It also happens to be an amazing love story, paving the way for the likes of Cloud and Aerith, Rinoa and Squall, and other memorable pairings in later entries. Additionally, the turn-based combat feels well-designed but not overly complicated like it can be in <em>FF3 </em>or <em>FF5</em>, so it’s a great on-ramp for newcomers.</p><p>A lot of readers might be shocked I didn’t suggest you start with<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-vi-retrospective-simply-the-best-1792398695&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-vi-retrospective-simply-the-best-1792398695"><em>FF6</em></a></span>. While it might be widely considered the pinnacle of the franchise, I think you need to work your way up to its grand adventure. <em>FF4</em> is a much more welcoming first brush with the series. If you like what you see, then you can graduate to <em>FF6 </em>and see what all the fuss is about.

                <p>SteelSeries, the manufacturer behind multiple of the best headsets for consoles and PC, is jumping into the nascent gaming earbuds market with the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D225336X1707200%26xs%3D1%26xcust%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fsteelseries.com%2Farctisgamebuds&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsteelseries-arctis-gamebuds-gaming-headset-leader-unveils-first-wireless-earbuds%2F1100-6526721%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arctis GameBuds</a>. Slated for release on October 29, these wireless gaming earbuds sport a 2.4GHz wireless connection with a compact dongle as well as Bluetooth with compatible devices. With the GameBuds, SteelSeries has sandwiched its speaker drivers inside tiny in-ear buds with active noise-canceling tech. SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds are available to preorder now for $160 at <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1854741578870750274%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsteelseries-arctis-gamebuds-gaming-headset-leader-unveils-first-wireless-earbuds%2F1100-6526721%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy</a>.</p><p>Like the manufacturer's range of wireless headsets, the Arctis GameBuds come in two different models: one geared toward Xbox and PC, and another for PlayStation and PC. The Xbox edition will work wirelessly with all platforms, including PlayStation consoles. The PS5 version supports all platforms <em>except </em>for Xbox. If you're unfamiliar with this trend, Microsoft has a custom wireless protocol that prevents non-officially licensed gear from syncing with Xbox consoles. PlayStation, meanwhile, uses a conventional wireless protocol, which allows some "Xbox" wireless headsets and earbuds to connect to PlayStation devices.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4373812-steelseriesarctisgamebuds.png" data-ref-id="1300-4373812" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4373812-steelseriesarctisgamebuds.png" data-ref-id="1300-4373812"></a><figcaption>SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4373812-steelseriesarctisgamebuds.png"></figure><p>Both models are available in an all-black design, but PlayStation users who want to match their earbuds to their PS5 console have the option of white GameBuds, too.</p><p>SteelSeries says you can get over 10 hours of battery life on a full charge, and the included charging case increases the total playback time to up to 40 hours before the case needs to be charged, too. These numbers will vary considerably depending on your connection type and listening mode; with all headsets, active noise cancellation always depletes your battery faster than transparency mode. The charging case supports Qi wireless charging and USB-C charging (cable included). The latter is quick-charge enabled and replenishes three hours of juice from 15 minutes of charging.</p><p>To come up with the ideal shape for its first gaming earbuds, SteelSeries scanned the ears of over 62,000 people. The aim was to create earbuds that are comfortable for all-day use while also offering a secure fit. GameBuds come with three different sets of silicone eartips. After placing the silicone tips in your ear canals, you lightly twist the earbud, which effectively locks it into place. I'm still in the early stages of testing the GameBuds, but as someone who often finds earbuds to be uncomfortable and prone to falling out, my initial impression of the design is positive. They are lightweight, snug, and I've worn them all day for a few days now without any discomfort.</p><p>I've been impressed with the audio and microphone performance so far, too. They sound similar, though not quite as good, as the pricier <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-Platform-Headset/dp/B0B15QM5LL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arctis Nova 7</a>, which is GameSpot's pick for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-wireless-gaming-headset/1100-6525389/" data-ref-id="1100-6525389">best wireless gaming headset</a>. Simply because of the form factor and larger speakers, gaming headsets always provide a more immersive audio experience than comparably priced earbuds. But the GameBuds offer the usual SteelSeries audio features, including 360-degree spatial audio and the PS5's Tempest 3D audio tech. The built-in microphones work well, and I didn't need to speak any louder than usual while making calls on iPhone. I've only had the chance to briefly test the microphones while gaming on PS5, but I haven't run into any issues yet.</p><p>Earlier this year, SteelSeries released the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D2YC9GM9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arctis Nova 5</a>, a new mid-range wireless gaming headset for consoles and PC. It launched alongside an exclusive mobile companion app for customizing your audio experience. It's a handy app that features a bunch of game-specific audio presets created by SteelSeries. The GameBuds will be the second SteelSeries product to support the app at launch. On-ear shortcuts can quickly switch between ANC and transparency modes, change devices by bouncing between Bluetooth and 2.4GHz connections, and pause playback. Instead of touch sensors for on-ear controls, the GameBuds have clickable buttons.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4373813-steelseriesarctisgamebuds2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4373813" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4373813-steelseriesarctisgamebuds2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4373813"></a><figcaption>The case can be charged via USB-C or on a wireless charging pad</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4373813-steelseriesarctisgamebuds2.png"></figure><p>The inclusion of both ANC and transparency modes is great for everyday use. My early takeaway is that active noise cancellation works as well on the GameBuds as it does on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Headset/dp/B0D1S99TD7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arctis Nova Pro</a>, which is SteelSeries' only other audio product with ANC and one of the better examples of noise cancellation in the gaming space. The Nova Pro retails for $350, so this is certainly a nice perk for the $160 GameBuds.</p><p>In general, gaming-focused gear doesn't offer the same caliber of ANC as premium, traditional headphones, such as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Wireless-Cancelling-Headphones/dp/B0CCZ1L489?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bose's QuietComfort Ultra headphones</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Cancelling-World-Class-Cancellation/dp/B0CD2FSRDD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">earbuds</a>. I have found one exception on this front: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Wireless-Cancelling-Earbuds-WF-G700N/dp/B0CJH6NV38?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sony's Inzone Buds</a> for PC and PS5. The Inzone Buds utilize tech found in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WF-1000XM5-Bluetooth-Canceling-Headphones/dp/B0C33XXS56?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sony's XM5 earbuds</a>, so the ANC is next-level compared to other gaming gear. Unfortunately, Inzone Buds only support Bluetooth LE, which is found on some newer Android phones. You can only connect the Inzone Buds to iPhone via the USB-C dongle, which means you'll need an iPhone 15 or newer, or a Lightning-to-USB-C adapter for older models. At $200, the Inzone Buds are $40 more than GameBuds, and they don't work with as many platforms (no Xbox support).</p><p>New gaming headsets release seemingly every week, but there are very few wireless gaming earbuds for major manufacturers. The SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds is the most versatile option yet in terms of platform support. As a reminder, the Xbox edition can be viewed as universal, while the PlayStation version will work with all of your devices except for Xbox. You can use the GameBuds on Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, Meta Quest headsets, and more. Since the GameBuds work with Meta Quest 3, you should have no problem using them with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/meta-quest-3s-batman-arkham-shadow-bundle-preorder-guide/1100-6526720/" data-ref-id="1100-6526720">newly announced Meta Quest 3S</a>, which also releases in October.</p><p>If you prefer over-ear headphones, Amazon has some nice deals on wireless gaming headsets in the SteelSeries Arctis Nova line.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Wireless-Multi-System-Headset-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CD8T9QF1?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arctis Nova 7P for PS5/PC (White)</a> -- $141 (<del>$180</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-Platform-Headset/dp/B0B15QM5LL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arctis Nova 7 for PS5/PC (Black)</a> -- $144 (<del>$180</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Multi-Platform-Gaming-Mobile-Headset/dp/B0CD99Q59P?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arctis Nova 7X Universal (White/Black)</a> -- $160 (<del>$180</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D2YC9GM9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arctis Nova 5X Universal (Black)</a> -- $110 (<del>$130</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Headset/dp/B0D1S99TD7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arctis Nova Pro Universal (White)</a> -- $295 (<del>$350</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Headset/dp/B0CCXWH6WG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arctis Nova Pro for PS5/PC (Black)</a> -- $288 (<del>$350</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Headset/dp/B0D1S7D9YX?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arctis Nova Pro for PS5/PC (White)</a> -- $293 (<del>$350</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Headset/dp/B0BHKTVDQ4?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arctis Nova Pro for PS5/PC (Refurbished)</a> -- $215</li></ul><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-mario-red-nintendo-switch-oled-is-back-in-stock-with-a-big-discount-at-amazon/1100-6526568/">Super Mario-Themed Nintendo Switch OLED Drops To Best Price Yet At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avatar-the-last-airbender-now-has-a-deckbuilding-card-game/1100-6526544/">Avatar: The Last Airbender Now Has A Deckbuilding Card Game</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stanley-kubrick-the-shining-compendium-stephen-king-adaptation-preorder-guide/1100-6526309/">The Shining Compendium Box Set Is A Staggeringly Ambitious Examination Of Kubrick's Horror Classic</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/walmart-exclusive-lego-batman-bundle-comes-with-three-sets-for-only-50/1100-6526223/">Walmart-Exclusive Lego Batman Bundle Comes With Three Sets For Only $50</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-popular-pokemon-labyrinth-board-game-is-getting-a-glow-in-the-dark-edition/1100-6526286/">The Popular Pokemon Labyrinth Board Game Is Getting A Glow-In-The-Dark Edition</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cult-of-the-lamb-the-first-verse-graphic-novel-is-up-for-preorder-at-amazon/1100-6526253/">Cult Of The Lamb: The First Verse Graphic Novel Is Up For Preorder At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/trigun-manga-preorders-amazon/1100-6523338/">Save Big On Trigun Deluxe Edition Manga Ahead Of Next Week's Release</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-nightmare-before-christmas-manga-is-returning-to-haunt-the-winter-holidays/1100-6526230/">The Nightmare Before Christmas Manga Is Returning To Haunt The Winter Holidays</a></li>   </ul> </div>

			<p>The latest free update for Warhammer 40,000: Darktide is available for players to dive into, and the update comes to <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-darktide-hands-on-preview/">the game</a> one day early. It was officially released yesterday by Fatshark, with the Unlocked and Loaded update, including a mass overhaul to itemization, the Rolling Steel operation, and the Party Finder feature. This update is available to those <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1361210/Warhammer_40000_Darktide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on PC</a> and Xbox.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Darktide  - Unlocked &amp; Loaded | Narrative Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IGPVTYzBGBI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While this update is predominantly focused on overhauling some of the features in the game to make it a smoother experience for the players, it also adds a new mission for players to complete, as well as the new social features and balance changes.</p>
<p>The Itemization Overhaul in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide 'reinvents' weapon progression by giving players the ability to experiment and progress with their weapons rather than being locked into just one. In this update, two new systems have been added: Mastery and Power. The mastery system allows players to gain experience just from using a weapon in missions, where players will unlock three different types of rewards. They are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blessing Points: This allows layers to unlock tiers of Blessings.</li>
<li>Weapon Marks: Players will be able to unlock various weapon marks that are attached to the Mastery track of the weapon's family.</li>
<li>Perks: Perks unlock automatically as players advance in a chosen mastery track.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Power system allows players to improve their weapon's stats by spending their resources at the Shrine of the Omnissiah. This will enable players to increase the base stats of any weapon they use.</p>
<p>The new update for Warhammer 40,000: Darktide also adds a new mission type called Operations. Operations are typically a shorter experience, but they add a more cinematic experience. The first Operation to be added to the game is called Rolling Steel, and players will have to stop a moving train that has been hijacked by cultists.</p>
<p>The Party Finder is a brand-new feature that has been added in this free update, allowing players to team up with other players. They can filter the party finder by Game Mode, Difficulty, Language and assorted Tags to be able to discern whether the group is right for them. As this feature is tested out, it will continue to evolve and improve once community feedback is received.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a time-limited special event players will be able to dive into called Unrelenting Hordes. From September 26 to October 10, players will have to work to retrieve Grimoires and Scriptures from the Infected Moebian 21st successfully.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/synduality-echo-of-ada-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has announced the&nbsp;<em>Synduality: Echo of Ada&nbsp;</em>release date, and the anime-inflected extraction shooter is launching early next year.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://x.com/synduality/status/1839304227350294646" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Synduality&nbsp;</em>X (formerly Twitter) account,&nbsp;<em>Synduality: Echo of Ada&nbsp;</em>launches across PC and current-gen consoles (although that doesn't count the Switch) on January 23rd.</p>
<p>As is often the case with Japanese games' release dates, however, a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1245480/view/4656249009457970268" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam post</a> points to January 24th as the release date. The discrepancy is likely down to time zones, so make sure to check which date the game is releasing in where you are.</p>

<p>You play as a Drifter, a mech pilot whose role is to collect a rare resource strewn across a post-apocalyptic landscape that's also inhabited by vicious monsters known as Enders.</p>
<p>As you do so, you'll also have to contend with other players, who are going to be looking to collect the same resources you are. If you've played games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/escape-from-tarkov"><em>Escape from Tarkov</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Gray Zone Warfare</em>, or other extraction shooters, you'll know the drill here.</p>
<p>You can check out the release date announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Synduality: Echo of Ada</em>, which also gives a sense of the game's art style and gameplay feel, right here.</p>

<p>Three editions of the game will be available at launch; the base game, the Deluxe Edition, and the Ultimate Edition. Each one grants different bonuses, and you can see what those bonuses are <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/synduality/synduality#shop-now" rel="noopener" target="_blank">via the official website</a>.</p>

<p>An investor in Ubisoft is claiming it has the support of 10% of shareholders looking to make major changes at the top of the organization, including a sale.</p>



<p>First reported by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/ubisoft-activist-investor-says-it-has-support-10-shareholders-management-tussle-2024-09-26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reuters</a>, AJ Investments says that it is building support for a sale of the company and potentially a change of leadership.</p>



<p>“We call on the management of Ubisoft to allow the sale of the company to third parties or private equity firms at a fair price,” the firm, which owns less than 1% of the company, said in a letter shared with Reuters.</p>



<p>The firm didn’t name the other investors it claimed to have the support of. They also declined to provide that information to Reuters when asked.</p>



<p>AJ Investments <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-being-pressured-to-go-private-as-share-prices-continue-to-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first made calls for a sale</a> and change of executive leadership in early September. At the time, they said they believe the company is “mismanaged” while Ubisoft shareholders were “hostages of Guillemot family members and Tencent who take advantage of them.”</p>



<p>“Management is focused on pleasing investors with beating quarterly results and not focusing on long-term strategy to provide exceptional experience for the gamers,”  they said in their first letter. “Our company has extensive knowledge about the gaming industry and we were longterm shareholder in Activision Blizzard and we started our Ubisoft position couple weeks ago and still adding to it.”</p>



<p>The latest letter has yet to be publicly posted.</p>



<p>Over the last few weeks, Ubisoft’s shares have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-stock-prices-falls-to-11-year-low-after-assassins-creed-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fallen to 11-year lows</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-investigation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">investigations have been started</a>. On top of that, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows has been delayed</a> to February 2025.</p>



<p>What do you think of the latest push by investors for Ubisoft to make changes to leadership or even force a sale? Join the discussion in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/530/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official community forums.</a></p>

How fast you move determines how fast time moves," the description reads. "You can use the Cyberpunk engine tweaks to bind the controls to toggle this mode on and off."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Longtime fans looking for a new way to play Cyberpunk 2077 — on the one year anniversary of its one and only expansion <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-review">Phantom Liberty</a> launching — could perhaps find some entertainment here. Toggling in and out of the mode for certain battles seems like it would add some new intensity to the game and allow players to perform some particularly dramatic takedowns.</p><p>In fact, the gameplay change somewhat recreates a piece of cyberware available to players in Cyberpunk 2077: the Sandevistan. Though this does exist in the game, it's not available in quite the same flashy way it was shown off in anime <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-edgerunners-review">Cyberpunk Edgerunners</a>, where protagonist David Martinez would manipulate time to dodge through bullets and take down baddies.</p><p>This mod is based on Superhot, a puzzle game which debuted the mechanic of time stopping if the player stops. "Every level in Superhot is an exciting, self-contained, time-bending puzzle that turns typical fast-paced first-person shooter mechanics on their head," <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/25/superhot-review">IGN said in our review</a>.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

                <p dir="ltr">Focus Entertainment has announced a new patch is now available for Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, bringing ultrawide support for PC and private lobbies for PvE in Operation mode for the game. The update also adds a new special sparring stage to screw around with buddies.</p><p dir="ltr">On <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/90-space-marine-2-patch-3-0-26-09-24" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the Space Marine 2 community page</a>, it's noted this new stage is called the Hub Sparring Arena. Players can find it in the Battle Barge for Operations and Eternal War modes, and it's a way to fight against friends before another mission. Meanwhile, the private lobbies let you team up with bots or another person instead of working with randoms. Other tweaks with the patch include an "option to reset custom color presets" and Veteran difficulty adjustments. Your health has decreased a tad, but so has enemy aggressiveness for this setting during campaign missions.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1544741603" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

            <p>In the time since PlayStation announced it would be releasing a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawns-remaster-arrives-in-october-and-itll-cost-10-to-upgrade">remastered PS5 and PC version of Guerrilla's Horizon Zero Dawn</a>, it has also quietly bumped up the price of the original PS4 game.</p>
<p>Price history data on the game, as shared on site's such as <a href="http://psprices.com/">PSPrices.com</a>, shows the PS4 version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> Complete Edition was selling for £15.99 - and had been for some time - until it got a sudden, sharp, price increase yesterday (25th September).</p>
<p>Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition is now retailing for £34.99 on the official <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP9000-CUSA10213_00-HRZCE00000000000">UK PlayStation Store</a>, more than double what it was a couple of days ago. On the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA10237_00-HRZCE00000000000">US store</a>, meanwhile, it is currently retailing at $39.99.</p>

<p>The timing of this increase is no coincidence. During <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-sonys-playstation-state-of-play">this week's State of Play broadcast</a>, PlayStation announced Horizon Zero Dawn was getting its long-rumoured PS5 and PC remaster.</p>
<p>Set to arrive this October, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered promises a range of enhancements on the now seven-year-old original, including "more than 10 hours" of re-recorded conversation motion capture, as well as "countless" graphical improvements.</p>

<p>On its release, this remastered version will retail at $49.99 in the US (I am looking for the UK equivalent), but those who already own Horizon Zero Dawn or Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition will be able to upgrade to the new PS5 or PC version for $9.99.</p>
<p>So, in short, if you had purchased Horizon Zero Dawn a few days ago, it would have been cheaper overall to follow that $10 upgrade path. But, if you purchase the PS4 version now, you will end up paying the same amount as the remastered version's full price if you choose to upgrade.</p>
<p>We see you Sony.</p>

<p>In addition to Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, Aloy is also getting a bricky makeover thanks to the series' collaboration with Lego.</p>

			<p>Having been delayed to early 2025, Assassin's Creed Shadows is now in direct competition with Sucker Punch's Ghost of Yotei, but this won't be a problem for the new entry in the long-running open-world series, according to Ubisoft's CEO.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-ghost-of-yotei-ubisoft" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IGN</a>, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot commented on the two games launching in the same year, saying that there's a lot of space for very high-quality games and that the two games can both sell well. Assassin's Creed Shadows, in particular, will set itself apart from the competing game with its dual protagonists and the two different complementary gameplay styles.</p>
<p>Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot further commented on Assassin's Creed Shadows and its recent delay in a new internal memo sent to staff before today's earnings call, as reported by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/yves-guillemots-internal-memo-to-staff/">Insider Gaming.</a> The memo highlighted how the game's delay to <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025-ubisoft-announces-return-to-steam-on-day-1-and-departs-season-pass-model/">February 14th, 2025</a>, was motivated by the need to release ultra-polished games on day one, something that did not happen with the recent Star Wars Outlaws, whose initial sales were lower than expected.</p>
<p>While not mentioning Assassin's Creed Shadows outright, Yves Guillemot also commented upon the company's creative choices, which are not dictated by any specific agenda. As an entertainment company, Guillemot continued, Ubisoft's mission has always been to <em>"entertain players and enrich their lives with original and memorable experiences, that resonate with a global audience."</em></p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows launches, as mentioned above, on February 14th, 2025.

But if you want something relatively affordable that looks incredibly stylish, it’s hard to go wrong with the DualSense 30th Anniversary Edition.</p><p>Like all DualSense controllers, this one works with PS5, PC, and mobile.

                <p>Earlier this week during Sony's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-september-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5793/" data-ref-id="2900-5793">State of Play</a>, the company announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-a-ghost-of-tsushima-follow-up-announced-at-state-of-play/1100-6526653/" data-ref-id="1100-6526653">Ghost of Yotei</a>, the first sequel to the acclaimed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ghost-of-tsushima-review-you-khan-do-it/1900-6417501/" data-ref-id="1900-6417501">Ghost of Tsushima</a>. But instead of continuing the story of Jin Sakai, Ghost of Yotei jumps ahead a few centuries and introduces a new female ronin named Atsu, who has adopted Jin's Ghost persona as her own. Somewhat predictably, Atsu's very existence has already sparked a backlash from gamers who don't want to play as a heroine. That led to a direct response from ex-Sony executive Shawn Layden.</p><p>Layden, who was the former chairman of Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios, reacted to a post on X that complained about Atsu. Layden's reply was simple: "It's a game. If you don't like it, don't buy it."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/ShawnLayden/status/1838781831010754672" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">1 It's a game. An entertainment. A story a team of creators believes in. They want to make this.<br>2 it's a game. If you don't like it, don't buy it. In fact, why not make the game you want yourself?</p>  — shawn layden 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️🇺🇸🇯🇵 (@ShawnLayden) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShawnLayden/status/1838781831010754672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 25, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>It does seem odd and regressive that simply placing Atsu in the leading role is seen by a few players as some sort of affront to their idea of what gaming should be. There have been plenty of heroines in the history of Japan-centric video games, including the similarly themed Tenchu: Fatal Shadows and Red Ninja: End of Honor. And just because Atsu is the Ghost in this game doesn't mean that another character can't assume the role in any potential sequel that emerges.</p><p>Sony and developer Sucker Punch Productions haven't released any gameplay trailers for Ghost of Yotei yet, but the game is expected to hit PlayStation 5 in 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-goku-how-many<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new <em>Dragon Ball</em> game, <em>Sparking Zero</em>, is just around the corner, and with its immense <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/dragon-ball/news/the-ultimate-surprise-the-final-reveal-of-dragon-ball-sparking-zero-full-character" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly-200-character roster</a> comes the reemergence of a question as old as time: How many Gokus are in this one?</p><p>Before I delve into the nitty gritty, I must give credit where credit’s due: Aftermath’s own Chris Person first asked this question of <em>Dragon Ball FighterZ</em> <a href="https://x.com/Papapishu/status/1002659819768238082" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">back in 2018</a>, and he and our esteemed former colleagues Harper Jay (now at Double Fine) and Eric Van Allen (<a href="https://x.com/seamoosi/status/1838575296422805724" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hire him!</a>) proceeded to argue it out at <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-many-gokus-are-in-dragon-ball-fighterz-exactly-1827369805" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Old Website</a>. I am merely carrying forward the torch they lit, and I will do my best to honor the shared Goku-counting rubric they created by cherry picking the parts of it I like and leaving out the parts I don’t. With that said, let’s begin:</p><ul><li><span>Android 13 - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Android 16 - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Android 17 (<em>DB Super</em>) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Android 17 (<em>DBZ</em>) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Android 18 - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Android 19 - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Anilaza - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Babidi - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Baby Vegeta (<em>GT</em>) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Bardock - Looks exactly like Goku, but is actually Goku’s dad. Therefore, not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Beerus - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Bergamo - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Bojack - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Broly (<em>DB Super</em>) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Broly, Super Saiyan (<em>DB Super</em>) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Broly, Super Saiyan Full Power (<em>DB Super</em>) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Broly (<em>Z</em>) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Broly, Legendary Super Saiyan (<em>DBZ</em>) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Broly, Super Saiyan (<em>DBZ</em>) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Burter - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Cabba - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Cabba, Super Saiyan - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Cabba, Super Saiyan 2 - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Caulifla - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Caulifla, Super Saiyan 2 - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Cell, 1st Form - And now we reach our first rough patch. Cell looks nothing like Goku, but he is technically composed of some of Goku’s cells, along with those of the other Z fighters. How many? We don’t know. But he is technically some tiny percentage of a Goku, as are all of his other forms. So let’s go to the source for this one: While the original manga implies that Cell is the sum of microscopic matter from a number of powerful lifeforms, it only mentions Goku, Vegeta, Piccolo, Freeza, and Freeza's father by name. Thus, for our purposes here today, Cell counts as one-fifth of a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Cell, 2nd Form - One-fifth of a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Cell, Perfect Form - One-fifth of a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Perfect Cell - One fifth of a Goku. (Also, a note: I’m not sure why they’re differentiating “Cell, Perfect Form” and “Perfect Cell,” but every version of this list I’ve seen published contains both. Maybe it’s a reference to the form Cell achieves after he blows himself up in an attempt to kill Gohan? I guess we’ll see.)</span></li><li><span>Cell Jr. - I’m tempted to say that Cells Jr – short, stout Cells that split off from the main body – would count as a smaller subdivision of a Goku, but they’re a byproduct of asexual reproduction, which tends to result in an identical organism to the original. So: one-fifth of a Goku.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Chiaotzu - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Cooler - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Cooler, Final Form - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Cui - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Dabura - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Dodoria - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Dr. Gero - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Dr. Wheelo - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Dyspo - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Frieza (<em>DB Super</em>) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Frieza, 1st Form (DBZ) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Frieza, 2nd Form (DBZ) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Frieza, 3rd Form (DBZ) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Frieza, 4th Form (DBZ) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Frieza, Full Power (DBZ) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Frieza Force Soldier - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Frost - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Bojack, Full Power - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Fused Zamasu - Fused Zamasu is – deep breath – a fusion of Zamasu, a mortal-hating god, and Goku Black, a time-traveling version of Zamasu who stole Goku’s body in an alternate timeline. If you gave Goku Black a DNA test, it’d say he’s Goku. As a result, he counts as one full Goku. Therefore, Fused Zamasu is one half of a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Fused Zamasu, Half-Corrupted - Half corrupted, but still the same guy. Thus: one half of a Goku.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Fusion Android 13 - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Future Trunks - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Future Trunks, Super Saiyan - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Ginyu - He did once possess Goku’s body, but this is Ginyu in his own body. Therefore, not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Gogeta (<em>DB Super</em>) - Gogeta is a fusion of Goku and Vegeta. As a result, he’s one half of a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Gogeta, Super Saiyan (<em>DB Super</em>) - One half of a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Gogeta, Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan (<em>DB Super</em>) - One half of a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Gogeta, Super Saiyan 4 (<em>GT</em>) - One half of a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Gohan (Adult) - Goku’s son, but not a Goku himself.</span></li><li><span>Gohan, Super Saiyan (Adult) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Gohan, Super Saiyan 2 (Adult) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Gohan (Future) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Gohan, Super Saiyan (Future) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Gohan (Kid) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Gohan (Teen) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Gohan, Super Saiyan (Teen) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Gohan, Super Saiyan 2 (Teen) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Goku (<em>GT</em>) - This is Goku! In the purest sense, Goku counts as one Goku.</span></li><li><span>Goku, Super Saiyan (<em>GT</em>) - One Goku.</span></li><li><span>Goku, Super Saiyan 3 (<em>GT</em>) - One Goku.</span></li><li><span>Goku, Super Saiyan 4 (<em>GT</em>) - One Goku.</span></li><li><span>Goku (<em>DB Super</em>) - One Goku.</span></li><li><span>Goku, Super Saiyan (D<em>B Super</em>) - One Goku.</span></li><li><span>Goku, Super Saiyan God (<em>DB Super</em>) - One Goku.</span></li><li><span>Goku, Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan (<em>DB Super</em>) - One Goku.</span></li><li><span>Goku, Ultra Instinct (<em>DB Super</em>) - One Goku.</span></li><li><span>Goku (Teen) - One Goku.</span></li><li><span>Goku (<em>DBZ</em>-Early) - One Goku.</span></li><li><span>Goku (<em>DBZ</em>-End) - One Goku.</span></li><li><span>Goku, Super Saiyan (<em>DBZ</em>-End) - One Goku.</span></li><li><span>Goku, Super Saiyan 2 (<em>DBZ</em>-End) - One Goku.</span></li><li><span>Goku, Super Saiyan 3 (<em>DBZ</em>-End) - One Goku.</span></li><li><span>Goku (<em>DBZ</em>-Mid) - One Goku.</span></li><li><span>Goku, Super Saiyan (<em>DBZ</em>-Mid) - One Goku.</span></li><li><span>Goku Black - We already went over Goku Black’s whole thing earlier in this list, but again, despite the fact that Goku Black’s mind is not Goku’s, his body is. Therefore: One Goku.</span></li><li><span>Goku Black, Super Saiyan Rose - One Goku.</span></li><li><span>Goku, Mini (Pre-order bonus) - One Goku.</span></li><li><span>Golden Frieza - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Goten - Goku’s other son, who – like Goku’s father – looks exactly like him, but not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Goten, Super Saiyan - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Gotenks - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Gotenks, Super Saiyan - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Gotenks, Super Saiyan 3 - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Great Ape, Baby (<em>GT</em>) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Great Ape,Vegeta - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Great Saiyaman - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Guldo - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Hirudegarn - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Hit - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Janemba - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Jeice - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Jiren - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Jiren, Full Power - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Kakunsa - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Kale - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Kale, Super Saiyan - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Kale, Super Saiyan (Berserker) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Kefla - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Kefla, Super Saiyan - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Kefla, Super Saiyan 2 - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>King Cold - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Krillin - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Lord Slug - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Lord Slug, Giant Form - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Kid Buu - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Majin Buu - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Majin Buu, Evil - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Majin Vegeta - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Majuub (<em>GT</em>) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Master Roshi - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Master Roshi, Max Power - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Mecha Frieza - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Metal Cooler - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Mr. Satan - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Nail - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Nappa - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Omega Shenron (<em>GT</em>) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Pan (<em>GT</em>) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Piccolo - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Piccolo, Fused With Kami - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Raditz - Goku’s brother, who looks nothing like Goku.

He also later goes on to absorb Vegito and, therefore, Goku. But at this point, he hasn’t done it yet. Therefore, not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Super Buu (Gotenks Absorbed) - Still not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Super Garlic Jr. - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Super Gogeta (<em>Z</em>) - One half of a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Super Janemba - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Super Trunks - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Super Vegeta - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Super Vegito - Vegito is another fusion of Goku and Vegeta, this time using the Potara earrings instead of the fusion dance.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/blizzard-reveals-overwatch-2-x-my-hero-academia-collab-starcraft-heading-to-pc-game-pass.993120/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/blizzard-reveals-overwatch-2-x-my-hero-academia-collab-starcraft-heading-to-pc-game-pass/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During the Xbox Tokyo Game Show 2024, Blizzard revealed some of its upcoming plans. These included a collaboration for Overwatch 2 with the hit anime My Hero Academia, as well as StarCraft: Remastered and StarCraft II, both heading to <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-sends-1-month-pc-game-pass-trial-triggering-speculation-of-more-games-joining-the-service/">PC Game Pass</a>.</p>
<p>The Overwatch 2 collaboration will begin on October 17 and through October 30, where players will get the opportunity to obtain skins of characters such as Deku, Uravity, All Might, Kiriko, and Tomura Shigaraki. Of course, these skins are premium, so players will have to fork over some money to get the skin they choose. The skins are typically $19 each, with the bundles typically being about $67. The paid skins have been a point of controversy since Overwatch 2 was released. While the loot boxes were predatory to a degree, they at least gave the option for people to try and earn the legendary skins for free via loot boxes rather than forcing them to pay for it or hope they scrounge up enough currency from purchasing the Battle Passes. It's unlikely Blizzard will ever go back on this decision.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The second main announcement that came from Blizzard during the Tokyo Game Show was regarding StarCraft. As of November 5, StarCraft: Remastered and StarCraft II: Campaign Collection will be available to those who have a PC Game Pass or Game Pass Ultimate subscription. This franchise is incredibly popular and is one of the most iconic games in the franchise. For the most part, StarCraft: Remastered was well revered in the community and felt like a faithful remaster of the game, as the campaign and gameplay elements were unchanged. For the most part, StarCraft: Remastered was the perfect game for professional players, as it's an 'almost perfect' remaster of the original. However, for the ordinary player, it fell a bit short.</p>
<p>With the game being added to Game Pass, it means players will be able to test out the game without having to fork out more money on the Battle.net client to be able to play StarCraft. The original StarCraft is still available on Battle.net for free, but you'll have to <a href="https://eu.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/starcraft-remastered" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pay $15.99</a> if you want to play the remastered version.</p>
<p>While it may seem on Battle.net that you can play StarCraft II for free, you will have to pay to be able to play the campaign if you want to dive into the expansive story. With the games being added to Game Pass, it's significantly cheaper to play them via Game Pass than purchased on Battle.net.</p>
<p>By being on Game Pass, players will be able to experience the game that helped continue to influence the RTS genre, with players able to interact with three different factions throughout both games.</p>
