Steamforged Games has announced a crowdfunding campaign so that those who missed out on the first campaign can enjoy the board game adaptation of Ubisoft's shooter. The campaign has two new expansions for returning fans.</p>



<p>According to its <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/steamforged-games/6-siege-pre-order" rel="nofollow">Gamefound campaign page</a>, the <em>Rainbow Six: Siege</em> board game reprint will include the base game and all of its expansions. As the name implies, the game is a tabletop adaptation of Ubisoft's competitive tactical shooter.</p>

Each Operator has a unique kit or special ability, allowing you to breach through walls, fortify defenses, or set up special weapons and gadgets. The base game contained 20 Operators with the expansions introducing 40 more.</p>

<p>If you already backed the <em>Rainbow Six: Siege</em> board game, this reprint campaign has two more expansions. One is a map pack, introducing the Skyscraper and Villa environments alongside cardboard obstacles. The second contains eight new Operators: Osa, Grim, Brava, Sens, Fenrir, Thorn, Solis, and Azami.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Rainbow Six: Siege board game reprint campaign has a pre-order incentive. If you back the game in advance, you'll get an alternate profile and miniature for the Zero Operator at no additional cost.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/no-warzone-3-if-verdansk-does-not-retain-players/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been claimed by a prominent Call of Duty leaker that Warzone 3 won’t happen alongside Call of Duty 2026 if Verdansk’s revival fails to retain enough players. That includes either those currently playing or those returning for the map’s revival next month.</p>



<p>Warzone has been in a sorry spot for a while, and Verdansk’s imminent return is expected to move mountains, but for how long?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-end-of-the-road">End of the Road?</h2>



<p>On Twitter, <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1896672391457349981">TheGhostOfHope wrote</a> a few exclusive details about Modern Warfare IV – otherwise dubbed ‘COD 2026’.</p>



<p>Amongst <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2026-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other details</a>, he claimed that Warzone 3 won’t be implemented alongside next year’s Call of Duty title if Verdansk fails to perform when it’s brought back alongside the Season 03 update. Earlier today, Activision revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-season-03-delay/">Season 03 is delayed</a> to April 3 in Black Ops 6 and Warzone to allow more time to finesse the update.</p>



<p>In March 2020, Call of Duty: Warzone was released to an overwhelmingly positive reception, with tens of millions of gamers worldwide pouring their hearts and souls into the battle royale. It changed the face of Call of Duty, creating an entirely new ecosystem that stood at the top of the genre for quite some time.</p>



<p>Things have changed since then, though.</p>



<p>Warzone has been on the rocks for a while, but Activision is hoping that Fornite OG-style event can bring back millions of players. It was claimed recently – also by TheGhostOfHope – that Verdansk will return as it was in 2020, which is sure to be a blast from the past for many players.</p>



<p>Do you think Verdansk is enough to save Warzone, or will the map’s imminent failure prove to be the final nail in the coffin for Call of Duty: Warzone?</p>



<p>Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2026-xbox/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-2026-is-being-developed-for-the-next-generation-xbox-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1124229/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2026-xbox/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It’s been claimed that Call of Duty 2026, which is assumed to be another Modern Warfare title is in development for the next generation Xbox.</p>



<p>That’s according to reputable Call of Duty leaker <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGhostOfHope</a>, who took to X (formerly Twitter) to break the news after it was announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-season-03-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 3 of Black Ops 6 would be delayed until April</a>. </p>



<p>According to Hope, the 2026 title is not being development for past generation consoles (<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2025-in-development-for-last-gen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unlike Call of Duty 2025</a>) and is being developed for the next generation of Xbox. If true, this could be our first real hint that the next-gen Xbox could release around Fall 2026.</p>



<p>Also pointed out by Hope is that apparently if Verdansk does not bring players back to Call of Duty: Warzone, a third game in the free-to-play Battle Royale will not release.</p>



<p>Officially, Activision nor Microsoft have released any information on Call of Duty 2026, or even Call of Duty 2025 at this moment in time. But according to our sources, the next game in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-2-call-of-duty-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty franchise is a Black Ops 2 seque</a>l headed once again by Treyarch Games following rough internal decisions that saw Sledgehammer Games wanting to develop their own fully-fledged Call of Duty title for 2027.</p>



<p>As always, take such rumors with a grain of salt, but Call of Duty 2026 being in development for the next-generation Xbox console is an interesting tidbit of information, if true.</p>



<p>What do you think of the next generation of Xbox potentially releasing in 2026? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/call-of-duty-2025-in-development-for-last-gen-consoles.1711/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Insider Gaming Forums.</a></p>

Additionally, it appears that some of these mobile games may not even exist, as only Guitar Hero Mobile has been officially acknowledged on Activision's social media.</p><p dir="ltr">The ads for these rumored games are reportedly appearing on Facebook and Instagram, and contain a link to a survey where players can share their opinions on the games, which have not yet been released.</p><p dir="ltr">The Guitar Hero Mobile ad in particular seems to have truly upset players who have viewed it. Art for the game features four oddly shaped guitarists, each holding an even more oddly shaped red guitar. The strange look of the ads doesn't appear to be the result of Activision trying out a new art style, but instead features what players believe to be the hallmarks of AI-generated art: blurry, oddly shaped, and non-cohesive assets.</p><p dir="ltr">Even stranger, it appears that some of these mobile games may not actually exist. Guitar Hero Mobile, Crash Bandicoot Brawl, and the Call Of Duty titles have yet to be officially announced by Activision, and Guitar Hero Mobile is the only game with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DGn9-qkAR3F/" rel="nofollow ">an ad that's viewable</a> outside of Facebook and Instagram ads.</p><p dir="ltr">Eagle-eyed fans did manage to dig up a <a href="https://store.geeklab.app/p/f6c46a6e325cb82fbb206399" rel="nofollow ">Guitar Hero Mobile page on Geeklab</a>, a mobile marketing platform that helps developers gauge player interest. Geeklab's website says it exists to "create app store pages before the app is released, test product pages, research competitors, build assets, run surveys, run A/B tests, and optimize app stores." Clicking "get" on the Guitar Hero Mobile page <a href="https://lab.geeklab.app/survey/7562005b447f52556c832f82?tq=267a0d4c6151982266fa5a03d97051&amp;pid=3252054" rel="nofollow ">takes players to a survey</a> (also hosted on the Geeklab site).</p><p dir="ltr">The two Call Of Duty titles and the Crash Bandicoot Brawl mobile game do not yet appear to have Geeklab pages, nor do they have official pages on Activision's website, but Facebook and Instagram users are asserting that ads for all three games--plus Guitar Hero Mobile--are regularly running on the two Meta-owned social media sites. Art featured on the Guitar Hero Mobile Geeklab page also appears to include AI-generated assets, according to players. In addition to the bizarre shape of the guitarists and their instruments, the speakers on the stage appear to be facing in multiple directions at once.</p><p dir="ltr">"Thank you Activision," reads one sarcastic player comment on the Guitar Hero Mobile Instagram post. "Thank you for killing any interest I may have had in your games. Makes not supporting you way easier."</p><p dir="ltr">Activision declined to comment when asked about these ads and their reported use of AI-generated assets.</p>

<p>During an IRL livestream, popular streamers Valkyrae, Emiru, and Cinna were stalked and harassed by a young man who threatened to kill them. The stream ended abruptly, but thankfully all three women and their staff were unharmed after the disturbing incident.</p>



<h2 id="h-stream-stalker-charges-at-and-threatens-streamer-trio">Stream Stalker Charges at and Threatens Streamer Trio </h2>



<p>During the multi-day Sis-a-Thon stream, hosts Valkyrae and Cinna were hanging around Santa Monica Pier yesterday with fellow streamer Emiru when the incident occured. The trio, along with members of the camera crew, walked past a young man crouching on the ground who asked for Emiru’s number. She declines and the group decides to move on, but the man says “I’m going to keep following her.”</p>



<p>After being followed for some time, despite asking him to stop, the group attempts to leave. The man then gets into an altercation with one of the friends of the group, and when the streamers call for security to intervene, he charges at them, threatening first to fight them before saying “I’ll kill you right now.” After distancing themselves from the man, amidst more calls for security, the stream ended.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Soon after the stream ended, both Cinna and Valkyrae took to Twitter to tell fans they were alright, but also to inform them that the Sis-A-Thon would be ending as a result. The next day, Valkyrae went back on Twitter to <a href="https://x.com/Valkyrae/status/1896613433245614442" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">address</a> baseless accusations that the incident was staged, while also criticizing those that stirred up hate towards the women earlier during the stream:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Seeing accounts that have harassed us for a 10 second clip of downtime during a 24/7 marathon accusing us of “just begging for subs, women do nothing” to then farming engagement from this stalker situation while we IRL stream has been so sad to see. Seeing accounts accusing my friends and I for faking this and blaming us instead of questioning the man’s behavior has been embarrassing to see. I’ve learned it doesn’t matter how much I accomplish in this industry or how much I try to gain respect, some men will hate women and blame women no matter the situation.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pockets-triumphant-light-expansion-just-gave-water-decks-another-powerful-card-and-everyones-a-little-over-it<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">When Pokemon TCG Pocket first launched, the meta quickly came to be dominated by a very small handful of decks. One of those, centered around Misty and water-type Pokemon, came to be hated early on due to its potential to overpower opponents early on based entirely on how well some coin flips went. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, three expansions later, you would think other cards would have swooped in to replace or counter Misty decks. But instead, Pokemon TCG Pocket's latest expansion just added a new card that makes Misty decks stronger than ever, and a lot of players are kind of over it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For context, it's not that Misty decks are necessarily the most powerful in the game. It's that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/misty-has-become-pokmon-tcg-pockets-greatest-villain">the luck-based nature of Misty makes losing to them feel very, very bad</a>. Misty is a Supporter card, with the unique ability to allow the user to pick a water-type Pokemon, and flip a coin until they land on tails. They then attach a water-type energy to that Pokemon for every heads they flipped. This could result in a player attaching 0 water-type energy, effectively wasting a deck spot on the card and a supporter card play. Or they could attach 1, 2, 3, 5, 10 energy, or more, if luck is on their side that day. A well-flipped Misty could allow a player to win on turn one in certain situations, before the opponent even has a chance to make a move. Or, in more common scenarios, the user gets enough bonus energy to bring extremely powerful cards online before their opponent can build a meaningful defense.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All that's fine and dandy, but what's made Misty worse are the numerous cards in subsequent expansions that have made it even more powerful. Mythical Island added Vaporean, which has an ability allowing players to essentially move all that bonus energy freely around between their water-types. Space-Time Smackdown brought Manaphy in, which adds <em>even more water energy</em> to the board. Both expansions saw new, powerful water-type Pokemon that can make use of that energy, such as Palkia ex and Gyarados ex. As a result, water decks have been at the top of the meta consistently for multiple expansions in a row.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And now, with Triumphant Light, there's <em>another</em> card out there making Misty decks even more hellish: Irida. Irida, like Misty, is a Supporter card, but its effect is that it can heal 40 damage from each Pokemon that has any water-type energy attached. Up to this point, grass-type decks have been the healing experts. But with Irida, water-type decks can make significant comebacks as long as they've collected and spread out enough energy...and between Misty, Manaphy, and Vaporeon, they're very likely to do so.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For what it's worth, some Pokemon TCG experts are offering a pretty logical explanation for Irida. In TCG Pocket, decks are limited to 20 cards That means if you want to add something like Irida, you need to take something else out. Water decks are simply swimming in good cards - at a certain point, players must weigh whether or not it's actually worth removing Misty for a card like Irida. Some players are speculating that developer DeNA added Irida in an effort to crowd Misty out and force players to make tough choices about which Supporters to include. But that doesn't mean plenty of wise deckbuilders haven't found ways to include both.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the player above points out, Pokemon TCG Pocket is gearing up for a regularly-scheduled event, where rewards will be doled out for going on win streaks in the game's online competitive mode. The best reward, a gold profile badge, will be given out for winning five matches in a row. This is surprisingly difficult to do, and even moreso when many decks you'll be facing can sweep you away within the first few turns if they flip coins correctly, and have backups like Irida to save them even if the flips go bad for them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Expect to see a lot of water decks during this event and for a long time to come. In fact, at this point, it may just be worth playing one yourself if you're not already.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Just one week after it admitted to using generative AI in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> for a number of assets, the publisher is now being accused of using generative AI again to promote a different game: Guitar Hero Mobile. But even as audiences criticize the promotion, sharp-eyed fans are discovering that Guitar Hero Mobile may not even be a real game in the first place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/guitar-hero-mobile-ad-ai-art/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As reported by Insider Gaming</a>, the generative AI in question appears to have been used in an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DGn9-qkAR3F/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram ad for the newly-announced Guitar Hero Mobile</a> posted two days ago. The ad features four guitar players on a stage in very similar poses with similarly-blobby red guitars, surrounded by distorted speakers that look suspiciously like washing machines and some mass of blobby microphones directly behind them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In front of them is an audience that includes a number of visible legs that don't seem to belong to anybody, and down the center is a Guitar Hero track with incorrectly colored tracks and blobby, inconsistent notes, some of which don't color match the track they're on. Put together, all of these issues are tell-tale signs of generative AI art, and given Activision's recent track record, it's pretty likely that's what's happening.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the comments, fans are furious. "Shows how much effort went into this when you can't even get your own game right," reads one response. Another calls the ad "Lazy AI slop," while another reads, "you’d think a giant company like Activision would have some budget for a real graphic designer". A fourth says, "Wow. It appears they're still using midjourney 1.0. I haven't seen AI art this bad since the early days."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But this isn't where the weird generative AI ads end. As a few websites such as <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/03/activision-comes-under-fire-for-using-ai-art-to-gauge-interest-in-new-mobile-games" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Time Extension</a> and <a href="https://80.lv/articles/activision-gets-criticized-for-ai-generated-mobile-game-advertisements/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">80.lv</a> have pointed out, Activision appears to have quietly dropped a number of generative AI-created ads on Instagram for a smattering of games that haven't otherwise been announced by the company. These include a Call of Duty Zombies mobile game, something called Call of Duty: Sniper, and something else called Crash Bandicoot Brawl. At the time we're writing this, none of these ads are viewable publicly on Activision's official Instagram, but the Guitar Hero Mobile game ad is still <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DGn9-qkAR3F/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">available via direct link</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Where this gets even weirder is that fans have managed to <a href="https://store.geeklab.app/p/f6c46a6e325cb82fbb206399" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">find a page for Guitar Hero Mobile</a> on a website called Geeklab, complete with even more AI imagery.

The visuals also received a significant overhaul, and the 23-year-old game looks nice on modern consoles. The graphical upgrades coupled with the chilling soundtrack help create a tense and unsettling atmosphere.

			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/la-quimera-is-a-new-co-op-sci-fi-fps-from-reburn-formerly-4a-games-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> of La Quimera, a new sci-fi first-person shooter in development at Reburn (formerly known as 4A Games Ukraine), 4A Games (the Malta office) decided to <a href="https://www.4a-games.com.mt/4a-dna/2025/2/28/4a-games-studio-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release</a> a brief explanation to those in the community who might still be confused.</p>
<p>As we explained in last week's news, the two studios are entirely separate now, and the Maltan developer, who is now the only one to carry the revered name, has confirmed to be working on the next Metro installment with franchise creator Dmitry Glukhovsky.</p>
<p><em>We are the team that created and built the Metro games you know and love. We’re still making the next Metro with Dmitry Glukhovsky, the same core founders, leadership, developers, and nearly 20 years experience on the series. We also have our other new IP project in the works. We’ll reveal more about both when we’re ready.</em></p>
<p><em>We are proudly Ukrainian in our roots, and in the majority of our diverse team. We make games from our offices in Kyiv and Sliema, as well as remotely, and even sometimes from the front line in Ukraine. We now have studios in two countries, but the majority of our team remain in Ukraine - roughly 150 out of about 200+. The rest work in Malta, or remotely.</em></p>
<p><em>In 2014, we, led by the original "four A's" - the founders of 4A Games - formed “4A Games Limited” and created a new HQ in Malta with roughly 50 of our fellow team members. We have since grown and work to this day on Metro under contract with Deep Silver and Plaion.</em></p>
<p><em>We continued to work closely with our remaining Ukrainian colleagues at “4A Games Ukraine” on Metro Exodus through an outsource relationship led by us. Once Metro Exodus and its DLC was released, we created another Kyiv studio under 4A Games Limited and welcomed roughly 50 more of our colleagues to continue on with us, while 4A Games Ukraine continued to pursue their own project La Quimera, as a completely separate entity and recently renamed themselves Reburn. We wish them every success.</em></p>
<p><em>The 4A Games you know and love have not changed, and we are not rebranding. We are the same developers of Metro that brought you Metro 2033, Metro: Last Light, Metro Redux, and Metro Exodus.</em></p>
<p>It's been a long time since the last mainline entry in the post-apocalyptic franchise. Exodus <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metro-exodus-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched over six years ago</a>, after all. Sure, there have been the DLCs and other post-launch drops, such as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/metro-exodus-enhanced-edition-impressions-4a-games-delivers-the-most-advanced-lighting-yet-without-sacrificing-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Enhanced Edition</a> and the mod tools, but the fans are eager to get back into the world envisioned by Dmitry Glukhovsky - and the recently released VR-only game <a href="https://wccftech.com/metro-awakening-vr-announced-for-psvr2-launches-november-7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metro Awakening</a> (developed by Vertigo Games) certainly didn't sate them.</p>
<p>4A Games owner THQ Nordic (now Embracer Group) first <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-new-metro-game-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a new Metro game in August 2019. Since then, the studio has been awfully quiet, although they did <a href="https://wccftech.com/metro-exodus-sold-10-million-units-in-5-years-next-mainline-installment-coming-in-202x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirm</a> about a year ago that the next game is coming in '202X'. Industry rumors have previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/metro-exodus-sequel-reportedly-fully-playable-could-be-revealed-later-this-year-for-2024-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> the game to have been fully playable as early as February 2023, so perhaps they'll surprise with a launch in late 2025 or early 2026.</p>

          <p>Zach Barth, the namesake of game studio Zachtronics, tends to make a certain kind of game.</p>
<p>Besides crafting the free browser game <em>Infiniminer</em>, which <a href="https://www.cascadepbs.org/2015/08/the-godfather-of-minecraft-a-conversation-with-indie-gamer-zachary-barth">inspired the entire global <em>Minecraft</em> industry</a>, Barth and his collaborators made <em>SpaceChem</em>, <em>Infinifactory</em>, <em>TIS-100</em>, <em>Shenzen I/O</em>,<em> Opus Magnum</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Exapunks</em>. Each one of them is some combination of puzzle game, light capitalism horror, and the most memorable introductory-level computer science, chemistry, or logistics class into which you unwittingly enrolled. Each game is its own thing, but they have a certain similar brain feel between them. It is summed up perhaps best by the Zachtronics team itself in a book: <em><a href="https://www.zachtronics.com/zach-like/">Zach-Like</a></em>.</p>
<p>Barth and his crew have made other kinds of games, including a forward-looking visual novel about AI, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/08/eliza-review-startup-culture-meets-sci-fi-in-a-touching-fascinating-tale/"><em>Eliza</em></a>, and multiplayer card battler <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/01/nerts-is-the-free-pleasant-six-player-card-game-we-could-all-use-right-now/"><em>Nerts!</em></a>. And Barth himself told PC Gamer that he hates "<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/puzzle/one-of-the-best-puzzle-game-designers-is-back-with-kaizen-a-factory-story-a-game-about-manufacturing-japanese-consumer-goods-during-the-largest-economic-bubble-in-history/">saying Zach-like</a>." But fans of refining inputs, ordering operations, and working their way past constraints will thrill to learn that Zach is, in fact, back.</p>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2275490/Kaizen_A_Factory_Story/"><em>Kaizen: A Factory Story</em></a>, from developer Coincidence and comprising "the original Zachtronics team," puts you, an American neophyte business type, in charge of a factory making toys, tiny electronics, and other goods during the Japanese economic boom of the 1980s. You arrange the spacing and order of operations of the mechanical arms that snap the head onto a robot toy, or the battery onto a Walkman, for as little time, power, and financial cost as possible.</p>

                <p>Despite Activision's efforts to curb cheating among some Call of Duty players, it remains an issue even in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review/1900-6418306/" data-ref-id="1900-6418306">Black Ops. 6</a>. But now, there's potentially cause for celebration among CoD fans as Phantom Overlay, one of the most prominent cheat developers, has announced that it is shutting down.</p><p>Via <a href="https://gamerant.com/call-of-duty-phantom-overlay-cheat-provider-shut-down/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Rant</a>, Phantom Overlay's <a href="https://t.me/PhantomOverlayAnnouncements/1052" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Telegram channel</a> states that it plans to "immediately" close its operations, with a caveat that it will remain online for at least another month to fulfill the 30-day keys that it has already sold players. Phantom Overlay went on to promise that anyone who bought lifetime keys would get a partial refund.</p><p>"This is not an exit scam and no external entity could ever compel me to exit scam my customers," wrote the creator of Phantom Overlay. "I'll keep everything updated, safe, and online for 32 days longer."</p><p>There was no information in the post about why Phantom Overlay is closing down, and <a href="https://x.com/Beyond_Dark_TM/status/1896214682727579879" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">some players online are naturally skeptical</a>. Phantom Overlay successfully monetized CoD cheats, and the creator could theoretically try again with a different company or a new alias. As noted by one user on X, Phantom Overlay's cheats <a href="https://twitter.com/InsuredFrames/status/1896052805653426600" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were reputed to be undetectable</a>, while rival cheat-makers have struggled with that.</p><p>Last year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/27000-call-of-duty-cheaters-were-banned-this-past-weekend/1100-6522492/" data-ref-id="1100-6522492">27,000 CoD cheaters were banned in a single weekend</a>. Activision's Call of Duty anti-cheat program, Ricochet, shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-cheaters-may-now-lose-their-parachutes-sending-them-plummeting-to-their-death/1100-6519058/" data-ref-id="1100-6519058">its ambitious anti-cheat CoD plans</a>, but Activision has previously apologized for not being able to kick cheaters out of Black Ops. 6 ranked play as quickly as promised. Activision has also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/two-call-of-duty-cheat-makers-ordered-to-pay-3-million-to-activision/1100-6511845/" data-ref-id="1100-6511845">sued cheat developers in the past</a>, and successfully won a $3 million judgment against them. Regardless, the battle between Activision and the cheaters will likely continue well into the future regardless of whether Phantom Overlay makes a comeback under a new name. In the meantime, Activision has launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-recon-squad-announced-but-its-not-a-new-game/1100-6529557/" data-ref-id="1100-6529557">Call of Duty: Recon Squad</a> to get more feedback from players.</p>
