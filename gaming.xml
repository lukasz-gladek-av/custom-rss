A <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/FearedBuck/status/1848051719894450543&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/FearedBuck/status/1848051719894450543" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clip of Fr0gan saying that she “hoped” American soldiers got PTSD</a></span> during a livestream was shared across X (formerly Twitter) and Reddit and commented on by YouTuber Ethan Klein and Steven Kenneth Bonnell II, aka Destiny. </p><p>On October 20, Fr0gan issued an apology on X, writing:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>the us military has conducted some of the most horrific crimes against humanity in the modern era in countries such as iraq, afghanistan, syria, lebanon, and palestine my anger is directed at individuals who are currently championing these war crimes as if they “liberated” my people. it’s horrific and disgusting. the beginning of the clip was worded poorly and i do apologize for that. i go onto clarify in the clip that i do not mean “all” military, but specifically those with no remorse. what i said was out of frustration as they are currently bombing my family in the name of “liberation”. i realize that wishing people harm isn’t the best way to talk about these issues and that i could have talked about these topics in a more sensitive way.</p></blockquote><p> However, it appears Fr0gan was not banned for what she said on her more recent stream but instead for the Rating Streamers panel from September 21. During the panel in question, the streamers utilized a popular internet meme called a tier list, in which the top of the tier is the “best” or, in this case, the person for whom using “habibi” is most acceptable and the bottom was the least acceptable. At the TwitchCon panel, the tiers were labeled “Arab Coded, Asks Permission, Thinks It’s a Slur, and Loves Sabra,” a reference to Sabra Hummus, a popular brand of hummus manufactured in the United States. The VOD for the entire second day of TwitchCon (which was when Rating Streamers aired) has been removed from the GivePlz Twitch channel, which hosts all of the TwitchCon videos. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFZPZxOPbag&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFZPZxOPbag" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The video is still available on the Ayyrabs YouTube page</a></span>.</p><p> Fr0gan, Capri, and Raffoul are all Arab (Fr0gan is Muslim, Raffoul is Jewish, and Capri is Christian) and host a podcast called Ayyrabs together. DenimsTV is an Arab woman and Vio is Middle Eastern. Two other streamers who briefly took part in the panel were not Arab or Middle Eastern. They were not banned at the time of publication. </p><p>On October 19, Klein <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtFiJ8AVdW0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtFiJ8AVdW0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted a video to YouTube titled “Twitch Has a Major Problem”</a></span> in which he said that panel was “kinda Arab good, Jew bad,” because Sabra is a “very popular Hummus brand” in Israel that is “the subject of [a] pro-Palestine boycott.” He also shared a clip from the panel in which Denims jokingly says that Klein deserved his own category for “Zionist.”&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/clip/UgkxHhREDce5Cx878rHaXWCZKDToP1lf_Xse&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/clip/UgkxHhREDce5Cx878rHaXWCZKDToP1lf_Xse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Then, on a live-stream on YouTube today</a></span>, October 20, Klein discussed Fr0gan, the “Tier List,” Twitch CEO Dan Clancy, and Hasan “Hasanabi” Piker, another noted political streamer who used to host a show with Klein before the two had a falling out.

<p>While we do not know exactly what will be featured in the broadcast, we can expect to gain a plethora of Fallout news. Now, this does not mean a new game will be announced. While that is a possibility, it is more than likely that Bethesda will talk more about the hit TV show.</p>



<p>We know that season two is currently in production, so it is more than likely we will get some news on that. We may even get to see one of the cast members speak, which would be incredibly exciting.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>There could also be updates on Fallout 76, the popular Multiplayer Fallout game. Who knows, though, we could get a brand new game announcement. A new Fallout game before Elder Scrolls 6? Anything is possible.</p>



<p>Will you be watching the Fallout Day broadcast?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/in-whirlwind-24-hours-twitch-re-enables-sign-ups-in-israel-and-palestine-bans-five-streamers-following-claims-of-antisemitism.1015767/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/twitch-israel-palestine-frogan-ban-h3h3<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Twitch began its week by correcting what it deemed an “unacceptable miss”: Many users in Israel and Palestine haven’t been able to sign up to use the site for a year. Yesterday, the issue finally roused Twitch, evidently asleep at the wheel, following recent viral social media and Israeli media posts. As a result of those posts and others, Twitch today went on to suspend five streamers who participated in a TwitchCon panel over perceived antisemitism. In so doing, it managed to clean up one mess and immediately make another.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"Following the October 7, 2023 attacks, we temporarily disabled sign ups with email verification in Israel and Palestine,” Twitch’s official support account <a href="https://x.com/TwitchSupport/status/1848191418377830708" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on Twitter</a>. “We did this to prevent uploads of graphic material related to the attack and to protect the safety of users."</p><p>Twitch’s track record of actually preventing real-world violence from appearing on the site is spotty, but it has at least <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/05/20/twitch-buffalo-shooter-facebook-nypd-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prioritized speedy responses</a> to mass shootings and other tragedies in recent years.&nbsp;</p><p>Twitch says that new users in Israel and Palestine who logged in using phone verification instead of email verification were still able to register, but evidently taking down part of the system still stopped many at the door. So, what happened? Due to some configuration of left hand not meeting right hand, Twitch failed to re-enable functionality in Israel or Palestine. For a year.&nbsp;</p><p>"We’ve learned that, inadvertently, we did not re-enable email verification sign ups for either region,” the company wrote. “We deeply regret this unacceptable miss, and the confusion it has caused. We’ve fixed the issue, meaning all affected users can sign up with email verification."&nbsp;</p><p>While it’s unclear how exactly Twitch managed to lose track of something so major, it is noteworthy that following <a href="https://aftermath.site/latest-twitch-layoffs-spread-teams-even-thinner-no-idea-how-folks-are-going-to-make-it-work" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple rounds of layoffs</a> totalling out to nearly 1,000 employees, the company is running about as lean as possible, with some current Twitch staff <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-ceo-dan-clancy-profitable-layoffs-interview-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently telling Aftermath</a> that remaining employees are overworked. It’s a recipe for things slipping through the cracks, whether or not that includes this particular situation.</p><p>Twitch ended yesterday’s post with a vaguely-worded statement about how it will continue to enforce its rules.</p><p>"We’ve also heard concerns about whether our Community Guidelines apply to all content on our service,” Twitch wrote. “We continue to enforce our rules as consistently as possible, and are actively reviewing content and taking enforcement action where needed."</p><p>As <a href="https://www.404media.co/twitch-quietly-blocked-new-users-from-israel-and-palestine-since-october-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">404 explains</a>, content creators and Israeli media tried to use Twitch’s sign-up flub as evidence of antisemitism, also pointing to the platform’s unbanning of creators Sneako and Fresh &amp; Fit – who <a href="https://x.com/AlexNaivety/status/1847955885961728374" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">do</a>, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/118/meeting/house/115561/documents/HHRG-118-IF16-20230328-SD033.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admittedly, suck</a> – and a tongue-in-cheek TwitchCon panel hosted by the Ayyrabs podcast a month ago in which the cast <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/streaming-site-twitch-accused-of-unchecked-antisemitism-anti-israel-bias/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">allegedly</a> ranked other content creators on a scale from Arab to Jew, but a) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFZPZxOPbag" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actually</a> did not include “Jew” anywhere on their scale, which <a href="https://x.com/fr0gan/status/1847651231432659010" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ranked who is allowed to say “habibi,”</a> an Arabic word meaning “my love,” and b) used the scale to poke fun at themselves, critique wider systemic issues like racism, and take shots at Israel – at least, insofar as they were able from inside TwitchCon, whose sponsorship deal with Chevron <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitchcon-2024-protest-chevron-palestine-hilton" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drew pro-Palestinian protests</a> outside the convention center. </p><p>The "habibi" scale was the brainchild of Raffoulticket, a streamer who is Jewish. “[People calling the panel antisemitic] are so fucking racist they don’t realize I’m Jewish,” Raffoulticket <a href="https://x.com/Raffoulticket/status/1847528829532983675" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said on Twitter</a>. “Weaponizing ‘antisemitism’ like this is ANTISEMITIC.”&nbsp;</p><p>Now, following <a href="https://x.com/ADL/status/1848501823100932346" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a conversation</a> with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2024/jan/05/adl-pro-israel-advocacy-zionism-antisemitism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">notoriously pro-Israel</a> Anti-Defamation League, Twitch has suspended all five of the streamers from the Ayyrabs TwitchCon panel: Frogan, Denims, Vio, CapriSunnPapi, and Raffoulticket.</p><p>"We appreciate Twitch making the right decision to finally suspend the streamer Frogan for abusing her platform and the TwitchCon event to spread antisemitic vitriol during this time of intense apprehension for the Jewish community," reads <a href="https://x.com/ADL/status/1848501823100932346" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a post from the official ADL account</a> on Twitter.</p><p>Frogan is a Lebanese streamer who has repeatedly been targeted by big names like Ethan “H3H3” Klein, who has claimed that Frogan’s <a href="https://x.com/fr0gan/status/1763751586617332205" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anger at Israel</a> and <a href="https://x.com/fr0gan/status/1848179969312051507" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the military industrial complex</a> constitute antisemitism. In the creator-sphere, Klein, who <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/esports/news-ethan-klein-hints-pausing-leftovers-podcast-israel-palestine-issue-co-host-hasanabi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had a falling out last year</a> with former collaborator Hasan “HasanAbi” Piker after conflating hatred of Israel with hatred of Judaism, has been one of the biggest voices <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjJqvaNWHEA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expressing outrage over the Ayyrabs TwitchCon panel</a> – which, again, took place a month ago, and which Twitch allowed at the time.</p><p>“30-day ban for saying people like bottom of the barrel hummus, but other people get two weeks for advocating for the genocide of Palestinians. Got it,” Frogan <a href="https://x.com/fr0gan/status/1848497912432546112" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on Twitter</a>, seemingly referencing Twitch star <a href="https://aftermath.site/asmongold-apology-palestine-hasan-piker-twitch-youtube" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Asmongold’s recent suspension</a> following an anti-Palestinian rant.&nbsp;</p><p>Vio confirmed to Aftermath that her suspension will also last 30 days.</p><p>"It’s wild ‘cause I literally have been ignoring this whole drama and didn’t even say anything,” Vio told Aftermath. “I just existed as another Middle Eastern person on the panel."</p><p>Aftermath has reached out to Twitch, Frogan, Denims, Raffoulticket, and CapriSunnPapi for more information.</p><p>Twitch’s decisionmaking on this front has some content creators baffled.</p><p>“These streamers were on stage at TwitchCon streaming on the Twitch page and had the [video on demand] remain up for a month before a hate raid was launched against them,” <a href="https://x.com/AlexNaivety/status/1848509319517753556" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote Alex Naivety</a>, a creative director and channel manager for multiple creators. “Doesn't matter what you think about their politics; Twitch had the capacity to stop them at any point and didn't.”</p><p>"Them getting 30 days while Asmon gets just two weeks so he can return for election coverage would be one of the grossest Twitch conduct rulings I’ve seen," <a href="https://x.com/ConnorEatsPants/status/1848501842453663807" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> popular Twitch streamer ConnorEatsPants.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>October is full of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/october-is-thankfully-stacked-with-new-horror-games/2900-5825/" data-ref-id="2900-5825">new horror games you can play now</a> or before Halloween comes to a close. Though it won't be among those playable so soon, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/corporeal/" data-ref-id="5000-645589">Corporeal</a> looks creepy enough to stretch spooky season into a future month. The New Zealand-based indie team Cold Out has revealed the paranormal mystery game, which is played using a photo album of real-life people, not in-game renderings.</p><p>The outcome of that choice is a game that feels unnervingly real, at least in this reveal trailer. It reminds me a bit of a Sam Barlow and Half Mermaid game, such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/immortality/" data-ref-id="5000-533269">Immortality</a>, mixed with touches of 2012's underrated horror movie, Sinister, in which a writer scrubs through left-behind home movies and photos to piece together his new house's haunted backstory.</p><p>Players will flip through a photo album with analog-inspired interfaces and gameplay, solving non-linear puzzles that uncover the game's mystery of the cursed family at the heart of it all. Though I've likened it to Sinister and Immortality, the team also drew comparisons to Annapurna's Storyteller meets the cult-classic horror movie, Lake Mungo.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Og5vPtM3IpQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Og5vPtM3IpQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Corporeal is set in the 1990s, making it the latest in a growing line of projects, particularly spooky ones (I Saw The TV Glow, Long Legs, et al.), that have gone back in time to that era. The nineties nostalgia is in full bloom.</p><p>Corporeal is coming to Steam, though no release date was yet revealed.</p>

These strategy guides have been developed in conjunction with the development team at Ubisoft, and they serve as useful companion pieces that you can consult whenever you find yourself stuck in certain points of the game or looking to gain mastery in every skill tree. While there'll likely be no shortage of online guides to consult, guidebooks like these are nice because they get straight to the point of what you're looking for instead of spending valuable time trying to convince you to like and subscribe to a channel.</p><p>In addition to a spoiler-free overview of all main quests, walkthroughs for secondary objectives, and a comprehensive rundown of the game's inventory, you'll also get a map with detailed annotations revealing the position of all key points of interest and collectibles. This includes landmarks, viewpoints, chests, valuables, loot caches, hideouts, and more, allowing you to get a 100% completion rate in the game more easily.</p><p>Both books have over 400 pages of content, and for the collector's edition, it comes in a premium hardcover format and includes an exclusive additional 32-page section.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Assassins-Creed-Shadows-Complete-Collectors/dp/191333015X?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Assassin's Creed Shadows: The Complete Official Guide (Collector's edition)</a> -- $40.49 ($<strike>45</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Assassins-Creed-Shadows-Complete-Official/dp/1913330168?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Assassin's Creed Shadows: The Complete Official Guide (Standard edition)</a> -- $30</li></ul><hr><p>In addition these guidebooks, there's also an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-art-book-from-dark-horse-will-release-alongside-the-game/1100-6524680/" data-ref-id="1100-6524680">Assassin's Creed Shadows hardcover art book set to release on February 18</a>, which will offer readers a behind-the-scenes look at the game's art direction, development details, and more.</p><p>For more video game walkthrough books, publisher Piggyback has a few comprehensive tomes for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Legend-Zelda-Complete-Official-Expanded/dp/1911015486?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Legend-ZeldaTM-Complete-Official-Collectors/dp/1913330001?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tears of the Kingdom</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cyberpunk-2077-Complete-Official-Guide-Collectors/dp/1911015761?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Cyberpunk 2077</a>.

            <p>
Delta Force: Hawk Ops, the free-to-play tactical FPS and Call of Duty/Battlefield challenger from publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>, is launching for PC as a global open beta on 5th December this year.
</p>
<p>
The Delta Force series was originally developed by NovaLogic and debuted in 1998; it would go on to spawn eight sequels, with a ninth announced but never released due to NovaLogic's closure in 2016. Last year, however, Tencent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-reviving-delta-force-fps-franchise">announced it was reviving the series</a> for PC, consoles, and mobile, and Delta Force's reboot (developed by the publisher's Timi Studio Group, which also created <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-mobile">Call of Duty: Mobile</a>) has had several alpha playtests since then.
</p>
<p>
And Delta Force is now ready to move to the next stage. Its global open beta (previously referred to as Early Access) is considered to be its "initial release version", featuring full live-service content updates and no more progress resets. Its 5th December arrival also marks the start of its first season, Genesis, which is set to introduce new maps and modes for both its 32-player Havoc Warfare component and Hazard Operations' squad-based PvPvE. There's also talk of a new operator joining the existing seven, new weapons, and a new vehicle.

Tencent's <a href="https://www.playdeltaforce.com/en/detail.html?father_content_id=6cc4e588ae1c9a4b55aba70a6f0f9d77a927&amp;content_id=6cc4e588ae1c9a4b55aba70a6f0f9d77a927">FAQ</a> also notes paid content - Battle Passes, weapon appearances, and vehicle appearances are all specifically mentioned - will be available when the open beta goes live, but it insists there'll be "no pay-to-win elements". And looking to the future, new maps, modes, Operators, weapons, and vehicles are all expected to be introduced as the open beta progresses, alongside gameplay enhancements, improved performance, bug fixes, better anti-cheat, and controller support. Delta Force's third element, its Black Hawk Down-inspired single-player campaign, will arrive at an unspecified later date.
</p><p>
Delta Force: Hawk Ops will be available via Tencent's official browser, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2507950/Delta_Force/">Steam</a>, and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/delta-force-acea48">Epic Games Store</a> when it launches into PC open beta on 5th December. PlayStation, Xbox, and mobile releases are all expected at some point in "Q1" 2025.
</p>
<p>
"If Delta Force: Hawk Ops can provide a decent single-player experience, alongside its combination of big multiplayer fireworks and free-roaming tactical engagements," Eurogamer contributor Rick Lane <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/delta-force-hawk-ops-has-a-real-shot-at-knocking-call-of-duty-and-battlefield-off-their-perch">wrote in his preview</a> earlier this year, "then Battlefield and Call of Duty could be in for a rather unpleasant surprise.

Instead, Shadows was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-until-early-2025/1100-6526703/" data-ref-id="1100-6526703">pushed back to an early 2025 release</a>. Now, players who purchase the Assassin’s Creed Shadows collector’s edition won't be getting early access to the game.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ac-shadows-early-access-cancelled/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a>, Ubisoft confirmed the cancelation of Assassin's Creed Shadows' early access during <a href="https://discord.com/servers/assassins-creed-215838530889318401" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a Discord Q&amp;A session</a>. The company also reiterated it will not be moving forward with its plans of implementing season passes. Consequently, the price of Assassin’s Creed Shadows collector’s edition will be dropping from $280 to $230. The collector's edition will still come with a steelbook, an artbook, a statue, and more. However, there may be additional changes to those products before the final release.</p><p>The report indicates that these late changes may "be inspired by the issues Ubisoft has had thus far maintaining historical accuracy and cultural representation." That was one of the given reasons for the game's delay in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-developers-pushed-for-assassins-creed-shadows-delay-report/1100-6526847/" data-ref-id="1100-6526847">a previous report</a>, in addition to a request from Shadows' developer Ubisoft Quebec to have more time to polish the game before its release.</p><p>Additionally, there's been word that Ubisoft Quebec <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-is-getting-a-co-op-mode-report/1100-6526890/" data-ref-id="1100-6526890">may be adding a co-op mode to Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>. Presumably this will allow two players to fight side-by-side as the game's dual protagonists, Naoe and Yasuke. But given the delay of the game, that feature may not be ready by launch.</p><p>Assassin's Creed Shadows will hit PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on February 14, 2025.</p>

The app will include scripted “kid-friendly” podcasts, interactive games, jokes, video recipes, crafting ideas, e-books, and original, exclusive streaming shows. One of these shows will feature the Chick-fil-A cows—stars of the chain’s long-running “Eat Mor Chikin” campaign—and another is <em>Evergreen Hills. </em></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/SuGam8-iOng&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/SuGam8-iOng" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s the first trailer for <em>Evergreen Hills</em></a></span>, which appears to be an animated series about kids discovering some magical tree, and is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/3IPMq4-mLd4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/3IPMq4-mLd4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">based on a series of ads from a few years ago</a></span>. </p><p> If you’re curious, the animated series starring cows will likely look a lot like this short released by Chick-fil-A a few months ago. I’ll let you decide if that’s a good thing or not. Also, just say the words “A Chick-fil-A Original Story” a few times out loud and really marinate in how bad this all is.</p><p>And now, here’s a human being trying to convince you that it’s totally normal and logical that a fast food restaurant that serves chicken sandwiches should also make TV shows for kids. From the press release:</p><p>“Hospitality and fun have always been at the core of the Chick-fil-A family experience, whether inside our Restaurants and play areas, or through our Kids Meals,” said Dustin Britt, executive director of brand strategy. “The Chick-fil-A Play App is a digital extension of that experience and another way we’re reimagining ‘Play’ for our Guests, in a unique way through entertainment that really encourages time together.”<br></p><p>That’s a terrifying amount of buzzwords and nonsense crammed into one paragraph, but it is October, so I guess it’s perfectly spooky. Anyway, if you want to watch any of this stuff or read books approved by Chick-fil-A, the app goes live on Apple and Android on November 18. Enjoy? </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Similar to <em>Skyblivion</em>, a project aimed at remaking <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em> using <em>Skyrim</em>, <em>Vault 13</em> was aimed at translating the original isometric, non-open-world <em>Fallout </em>into a modern Bethesda RPG. </p><p>The publisher has made clear it’s not working on a remaster or remake itself anytime soon, so fans took it upon themselves to reimagine the classic with all the bells and whistles of the most recent numbered entry in the franchise.

<p>Whenever a brand-new survival horror hits the market, content creators and fans rush to finish it before spoilers wind up online. It’s often a race to the finish. But sometimes, players can’t get enough of the horror genre despite their insistent fear. They want to know how long it takes to complete a game like this. So, here’s what you should know about A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead length!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-to-beat-a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead">How Long to Beat A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead?</h2>



<p>If you want to finish A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead, expect to play for approximately 6 to 8 hours total. Most players finish the game in around 7 hours, give or take. However, you can stretch the experience by playing immensely carefully, watching your every step, and reading all the notes scattered throughout the environment for additional backstory. </p>



<p>My first playthrough lasted around eight hours, during which time I immersed myself in the environment instead of playing my usual run-and-gun horror game.</p>



<p>All that said, this is a straightforward, story-based survival horror experience without much side content. Besides a handful of collectibles, the odd note or drawing left behind by another survivor, and some valuable pick-ups scattered about the world, you won’t find much besides a linear path forward.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-multiplayer">Is A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead Multiplayer?</h2>



<p>Of course, a survival horror game with multiplayer would add considerable length to any experience, but sadly, that’s not happening here. A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is a single-player game focusing on the story of Alex Taylor, an asthmatic college student doing her best to survive the end of the world. You won’t play co-op or versus in this tale.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-luigi-brothership-dev-likely-revealed-as-octopath-traveler-studio<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Another mystery solved?</h2></div><section><p>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership's mystery developer has finally been revealed, and it's not who many expected. While a number of fans guessed ILCA, Next Level, or even a new studio made up of former AlphaDream developers, the actual answer seems to be Acquire, co-developers behind Octopath Traveler.</p><p>We (probably) know this from various screenshots posted from one of the game's official pages being shared around online, which attributes the copyright to the game to both Nintendo and Acquire. While it's always possible all these images going around are doctored somehow, this is also how we found out that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-really-didnt-want-us-to-know-who-developed-the-super-mario-rpg-remake">Super Mario RPG Remake was made by ArtePiazza</a>, so it's pretty unlikely.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">CONFIRMED: Mario &amp; Luigi Brothership was co-developed by Acquire (Octopath Traveler, Tenchu, Way of the Samurai) <a href="https://t.co/MNZvtqdcPE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/MNZvtqdcPE</a></p>— Nintendeal (@Nintendeal) <a href="https://twitter.com/Nintendeal/status/1848377416328323547?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 21, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Acquire is one heck of a storied studio. It's a Japanese company founded waaaay back in 1994 that made its mark with the Tenchu: Stealth Assassins franchise, and has since gone on to make a number of games across several platforms. It was especially productive on the PlayStation Vita and PSP, but its most notable contribution perhaps is as a co-developer on Octopath Traveler and Octopath Traveler 2. Over the years it's been acquired by GungHo Online Entertainment, which owned it from 2011 until this year, when it was picked up by FromSoftware owned Kadokawa Corporation.</p><p>This year alone, Acquire released Ancient Weapon Holly, C.A.R.D.S RPG: The Misty Battlefield, Scars of Mars, and something called Hookah Haze. It also co-developed Amedama and All in Abyss: Judge the Fake.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Given Acquire's track record, especially with Octopath Traveler, the news about Acquire's work on Brothership is being received fairly well, although with some surprise. This is Acquire's first time developing a first-party Nintendo title, and it's interesting to see Nintendo branching out to even more external developers beyond its usual stable of Game Freak, DeNA, Grezzo, Camelot, Next Level, Good-Feel, ArtePiazza, Intelligent, and others. </p><p>That said, it remains very weird that we have to play these goofy games of checking French copyright info to see who makes Nintendo's biggest annual titles. We did it with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-really-didnt-want-us-to-know-who-developed-the-super-mario-rpg-remake">Super Mario RPG Remake</a>, we did it with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-interview-reveals-host-of-new-details-including-confirmation-of-series-first-woman-director">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/princess-peach-showtimes-director-developer-have-finally-been-revealed">Princess Peach: Showtime</a>, we even dealt with something like this when <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-wonder-mick-wingert-nintendo">Mario got a new voice actor</a>. Just tell us upfront who the devs are, Nintendo! We promise we won't get mad.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. You can find her posting on BlueSky @duckvalentine.bsky.social.

But like so many of the internet's other great joys, those posts come at an unseen cost. </p><p>While we've all been enjoying SMB's trivia for years now, I don't know if too many people ever stopped to think about the man behind the account, or the circumstances that allowed him to post so often,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAPGbeknudY" target="_blank">so it was certainly a shock last week to see Supper Mario Broth's current owner post an emotional video outlining their position</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>He says he has spent the last few years caring for a number of sick relatives, including his mother, and that following the latter's sad passing recently he was not only facing a loss of income (he had received a pension as a caregiver) but even the prospect of losing his home as well.&nbsp;Unless...people could help him out.</p><p>The response to the video has been overwhelming. <a href="https://www.patreon.com/suppermariobroth" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fans have flooded SMB's Patreon page</a> to pledge financial support for the account, and at time of posting over 3700 people had signed up for monthly accounts, transforming it instantly from a hobby (the Patreon page had already existed, but wasn't doing numbers like this) to a full-time occupation.&nbsp;Indeed it's so much money that he says it'll start being funnelled back into the account, telling fans "any additional support will be used to procure material and acquire equipment to make more and better Mario content".</p><p>This rules. Supper Mario Broth is one of the most enjoyable and authoritative&nbsp;Nintendo voices on the internet, and it's wonderful news to hear it'll be able to keep on posting for the foreseeable future. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

From the disillusioned noble Strohl to the songstress superstar Junah, <em>Metaphor </em>has a truly weird group of goofballs who are gathering together to try and make real change in the world of Euchronia. Though they’re all united by a desire to make the world a better place for its citizens, a lot of these folks could not be more different. How can one compare Hulkenberg’s gloomy struggles with tragedy to Eupha overcoming her naivete? Well, we’re certainly going to try. Here’s the <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio </em>cast from least perfect and good to most perfect and good.</p><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="75a429a06dfa166b2b93dba2160d4a79" data-recommend-id="image://75a429a06dfa166b2b93dba2160d4a79" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gallica waves at the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gallica waves at the camera." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="75a429a06dfa166b2b93dba2160d4a79" data-recommend-id="image://75a429a06dfa166b2b93dba2160d4a79" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gallica waves at the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Gallica, our fairy helper, isn’t a party member in the traditional sense, but rather acts as a navigator for the team, checking for enemy weaknesses, and just generally being a companion to the protagonist. She’s a little sassy, but believes deeply in the group’s cause of saving Euchronia’s slumbering prince to ensure a better future for its people. Gallica’s best moments come late in <em>Metaphor</em> as she learns surprising truths about herself and those around her. But even as things get hard, she never wavers, and is there to support the crew through their darkest moments.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="92e52e9b991e3c024270ac66bbfe7b0d" data-recommend-id="image://92e52e9b991e3c024270ac66bbfe7b0d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Eupha leans against a round window in the runner." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Eupha leans against a round window in the runner." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="92e52e9b991e3c024270ac66bbfe7b0d" data-recommend-id="image://92e52e9b991e3c024270ac66bbfe7b0d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Eupha leans against a round window in the runner." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When you meet Eupha, she has the world on her shoulders despite having seen very little of it. She’s the priestess of the mustari tribe, and she, like the rest of her people, misunderstands what that means. Initially, she believes that she must be sacrificed to a dragon in order to protect her people. This is tradition on her island, and even though there’s a big world out there, this is all she really knows. Eupha spends most of <em>Metaphor </em>trying to figure out what a “better” world even means when she has little frame of reference for what the world is now. Having an outsider around to voice their perspective can sometimes help reveal that something is all wrong, because they might see things more clearly than someone who’s been embedded in a system their whole life. Eupha delivers that. Unlike the others, she hasn’t been taught that the injustices of Euchronia simply reflect “the way things should be,” so she’s the first person to ask questions, and those questions often force everyone else to realize how ridiculous what they believe in sounds when you hear it out loud.. Eupha leaves a home she believes to be fair and just, only to discover that isn’t the rest of the world’s MO. Trying to find your place in a world that’s both new to you and also harsher than anything else you’ve experienced isn’t easy, but Eupha takes it in stride.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="040703a6fc8c292eae9a5cd7ecf5c2cd" data-recommend-id="image://040703a6fc8c292eae9a5cd7ecf5c2cd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Basilio looks at the camera without a thought behind his eyes." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Basilio looks at the camera without a thought behind his eyes." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="040703a6fc8c292eae9a5cd7ecf5c2cd" data-recommend-id="image://040703a6fc8c292eae9a5cd7ecf5c2cd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Basilio looks at the camera without a thought behind his eyes." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Despite towering over him, Basilio begins <em>Metaphor </em>largely living in the shadow of his older brother Fidelio. The duo starts off as lackeys for antagonist Louis before they are betrayed by their boss, leading to Fidelio’s murder. Up until this point, Basilio has spent so long following others, whether that be his brother or his would-be king, and in one fell swoop, he loses both of his anchors. He’d already been questioning the ways of the world, but he often had to look to his brother for permission to believe what he wanted. Now that he doesn’t have to answer to anyone, he has to decide what he even wants out of this life. Basilio embodies the type of person who has spent so long being told what to do and think that they’re not sure who they are sometimes. They can hear something that sounds logical and right, but there’s always that knee-jerk reaction to look to someone for approval. When Basilio loses that, he finds out who he truly is. Sometimes tragedy is the quickest way to find out more about yourself, and then you can crawl out of the hole, born anew. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cf50f601f14ef6f97ac286789482bb92" data-recommend-id="image://cf50f601f14ef6f97ac286789482bb92" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Strohl falls from the sky but looks content because he did some cool stuff." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Strohl falls from the sky but looks content because he did some cool stuff." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cf50f601f14ef6f97ac286789482bb92" data-recommend-id="image://cf50f601f14ef6f97ac286789482bb92" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Strohl falls from the sky but looks content because he did some cool stuff." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Strohl is your ride or die. Your first party member is a disillusioned noble who has seen how the ruling class cares little for the suffering of those beneath them. Growing up in nobility and seeing how the people are treated when their homes are destroyed is a quick path to radicalization, and Strohl’s caring, headstrong nature means he’s always willing to jump in and help someone. But that gusto means that he’s also liable to get ahead of himself. Strohl is quick to insert himself into everyone’s problems and jump ahead of the chain of command without consulting others if he thinks he knows best. He’s as subtle as a boot to the face, but that means he gets results. That’s the kind of person you want at your side while you’re fighting for change. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2bf09ad418faafdf11fc7ea9cb1bd08a" data-recommend-id="image://2bf09ad418faafdf11fc7ea9cb1bd08a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Junah looks sad at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Junah looks sad at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2bf09ad418faafdf11fc7ea9cb1bd08a" data-recommend-id="image://2bf09ad418faafdf11fc7ea9cb1bd08a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Junah looks sad at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Junah could have been a one-note (no pun intended) Taylor Swift in a fantasy world archetype (sheesh, sorry, these puns came from God, not me), but her entire schtick is subversion. She’s a widely beloved musician seemingly aligned with the enemy, but then it’s revealed that she’s an undercover agent who’s been slyly working behind the scenes to help save the prince. Junah presents herself as a starlet who is the epitome of grace and showmanship, but as a nidia, she’s actually using glamor to hide her true appearance as a childlike doll. Junah is full of surprises when she could easily have fallen into a number of predictable tropes. By the time she joins the party, almost everyone on the team has been dour and dramatic at some point, so Junah’s swagger is a welcome change. But she’s not without her own drama, and her carefree attitude is never at the expense of complexity. Junah contains multitudes, both in the way she presents herself to others and in who she reveals herself to be. While the world of <em>Metaphor </em>knows her best as a songstress, it’s in the moments that she reveals who she truly is that she’s the most memorable.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="17daaec746c576675df9bef1d7207c42" data-recommend-id="image://17daaec746c576675df9bef1d7207c42" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Hulkenberg stands in front of a smoke cloud in the sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Hulkenberg stands in front of a smoke cloud in the sky." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="17daaec746c576675df9bef1d7207c42" data-recommend-id="image://17daaec746c576675df9bef1d7207c42" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Hulkenberg stands in front of a smoke cloud in the sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In a political drama, undying loyalty to the monarchy can often be a red flag.

But her love for the prince is not blind faith, it is a trust and love that was built brick by brick, weathering the storm of political strife and standing strong against the indiscriminate passage of time. Hulkenberg’s principles endure even when she’s been given every reason to give up on herself and those around her. She sees the good in the world because she sees it in the people around her, and is willing to do anything to get a person who upholds those ideals on the throne.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d1c37790f2fb0adeef5b073dc18f30ac" data-recommend-id="image://d1c37790f2fb0adeef5b073dc18f30ac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Heismay smirks at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Heismay smirks at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d1c37790f2fb0adeef5b073dc18f30ac" data-recommend-id="image://d1c37790f2fb0adeef5b073dc18f30ac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Heismay smirks at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Metaphor’s </em>thief starts out lower than the rest of the crew.

<p>The Nintendo Switch Online playtest program has barely just begun, and leaks are coming out left and right. It took just minutes for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-online-playtest-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first batch of information</a> to leak out from someone on social media, and now, just hours later, more has been spotted via data mining.</p>



<p>A user by the name of <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sky.femboyfurry.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sky</a> began posting the information on Bluesky on Monday morning. </p>







<p>Information found includes the playtest’s codename of “Rockstock” as well as a list of what appears to be mechs or vehicles and minigames. It was also shown to be being developed by Nintendo EPD 4, which is the development group responsible for games such as 1-2-Switch, Ring Fit Adventure, Nintendo Switch Sports, and more. </p>



<p>Other things discovered were the song files from the playtest, text that would fit with a character creator such as setting skin tone or body shape, and even files to suggest both PvE and PvP within the game.</p>



<p>“I would like to grant you a Beacon… However, it seems that you cannot carry any more Pieces,” one string reads. “Prepare some empty space, then return to me.”</p>



<p>Speaking of the song files, Sky uploaded what appeared to be the full soundtrack for people to download and listen to themselves.</p>



<p>Nintendo has yet to confirm any information about what the playtest program could be about. When it was first having people sign up, the company asked people not to share information about what they experience online. It’s clear that many didn’t take that request to heart. Based on the information that’s come out in the last 24 hours or so, it seems clear that it might be some sort of MMO in development at Nintendo.</p>



<p>What do you think this Nintendo Switch Online playtest program is all about? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1057/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout">Fallout</a>: Vault 13 - the ambitious mod attempting to remake Fallout 1 in the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-walkthrough-and-guide-4019">Fallout 4</a> engine - has ceased active development in order to "prioritise the well-being of project members", but it'll have the chance to live on when a build is shared with the community soon.
</p>
<p>
Fallout: Vault 13, named after the first Vault players experience in the Fallout series, has been in the works since 2021, but it started to make headlines following the release of a demo in August this year. It was to feature five open-world areas, a "completely overhauled levelling system", voice acting, plus some "tasteful, lore-friendly additions" to complement the full roster of original Fallout 1 quests and characters.
</p>
<p>
But despite the excitement generated by Fallout: Vault 13's demo, its development team has now called time on the project "due to a combination of factors". In a <a href="https://x.com/FalloutVault13/status/1848149475132375468">statement shared on social media</a>, project founder and co-lead Culinwino explained, "After much careful thought and deliberation, we have decided to officially suspend development on Fallout: Vault 1. This was not an easy decision, but we believe it is the right step at this stage of our journey".

<p>
In a <a href="https://x.com/FalloutVault13/status/1848159106588418216">follow-up post</a>, Culinwino cited "burnout" and "personal life changes among core team members" as some of the reasons behind the project's cancellation. "This was an ambitious project being made with limited resources by volunteers", they noted, adding the decision to end development was made in order "to prioritise the well-being of project members". Culinwino stressed "there was no infighting or cease-and-desist from Bethesda."
</p><p>
However, while Fallout: Vault 13 will no longer be developed by its present team, the entire project as it currently exists will be released as a build on Nexus Mods "in the coming weeks". Culinwino says this will "allow the community to experience" the work completed so far and "serve as a foundation for anyone interested in continuing or building upon it in the future." Additionally, the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/85307">previously released demo</a> will remain available to download.
</p>
<p>
"While this may mark the end of active development, it's not the end of our journey together," the statement concluded. "Down the line, we are planning to release a retrospective that will take a look back at everything we've accomplished with Fallout: Vault 13, celebrating the highs, the lessons learned, and the passion that drove this project... Thank you again for being a part of this incredible experience. Your support means the world to us, and I look forward to seeing where the community takes Fallout: Vault 13 from here".
</p>
<p>
Although Vault 13 has, for the time being at least, reached the end of its journey, 2024 remains a banner year for Fallout fans. Fallout 4's long-in-the-works next-gen update finally arrive this April (albeit to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-upgrade-launches-to-mixed-response-with-broken-mods-and-bugged-xbox-quality-mode">mixed reception</a>), while Amazon's acclaimed Fallout TV series has<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-series-passes-impressive-viewer-milestone-after-six-months"> helped bring the series to a whole new audience</a>. And in the modding world, the hugely ambitious <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-london">Fallout: London</a> - a brand-new fan-developed game built in Fallout 4 - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-mod-closes-in-on-1m-downloads-as-team-folon-gears-up-for-next-fix">has been a massive success</a>.

<p>It has been quite the past few weeks, as many big esports teams have begun to announce all their new Valorant signings while preparing for the 2025 VCT season. Among these teams is team Vitality, which just announced one of its biggest signings, Derke.</p>



<h2 id="h-derke-joins-team-vitality">Derke Joins Team Vitality</h2>



<p>It is no secret that Derke is quite the decorated player in competitive Valorant. Back in 2023, the competitor helped Evil Geniuses win the VCT 2023: Master Tokyo event and even took the stage with Team Vitality back in July of 2024 for the EMEA Stage 2, where the team came first.</p>



<p>However, Derke competed with Sentinels in the VCT Champions this year.</p>



<p>Now, the player will be joining Team Vitality for the entirety of 2025, helping to give the team one of its best years yet.</p>

<p>“Very excited to join this team with very amazing and promising players,” said Derke on Twitter when announcing his signing to Team Vitality. “Next year will be very exciting for everyone and especially for me as it’s the first time I’m having big changes like these and I’m considering it as a good challenge. The boys already felt very welcoming and really hungry to win so I’m very excited for the next season.”</p>



<p>The Finnish/Russian player will be a massive asset for the esports team going into 2025.</p>







<h2 id="h-team-vitality-s-record">Team Vitality’s Record</h2>



<p>Team Vitality has struggled throughout the past few years with its Valorant competitive side. The team has yet to take home first place in an S-Tier Valorant tournament, with its last first place being back in 2022 VRL France: Revolution Stage 2. </p>



<p>However, that does not change the fact that the team continues to sign some of the best names in Valorant.</p>



<p><strong>Team Vitality’s current Valorant Roster:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Derke</li>



<li>Less</li>



<li>trexx</li>



<li>Sayf</li>



<li>Kicks</li>

</ul>
