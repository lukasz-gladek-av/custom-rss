            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Yesterday, the Trump Administration, in all its brain-rotting glory, posted </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/donald-trump-halo-gamestop-console-wars-meme-ai-images-2000639237"><span>an AI mockup of the president in Master Chief armor</span></a><span> as it declared that the man, who has likely never played a moment of </span><i><span>Halo </span></i><span>in his life, had ended the console war. This whole thing started because retail chain GameStop made a joke about the bitter feud between PlayStation and Xbox players finally ending, thanks to the impending arrival of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-remake-campaign-evolved-playstation-cross-play-2000638951"><i><span>Halo: Campaign Evolved </span></i><span>on PS5</span></a><span>. For some reason, the administration jumped in, presumably because someone on staff pays attention to video game news and only views the world through a memetic lens. Now, in what I can only assume is further committing to the bit, the White House has put out a statement declaring not only that&nbsp; Trump has ended a war, but that he is “hugely popular” with gamers.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>In a statement issued to journalist and ex-</span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>editor </span><a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/exclusive-white-142217261?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&amp;utm_source=copyLink&amp;utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_content=join_link&amp;fbclid=PAZnRzaANtDVtleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABpz3WlKQSLeaQPnwHSgd_8kbdaOk9khYlDlkGwojXSUxrjZoBTQMEypzyzDjJ_aem_4-XJdI-3mwtRpkA9nPgsXQ"><span>Alyssa Mercante</span></a><span>, the White House said that he is the only leader “fully committed to giving power to the players,” which is a reference to GameStop’s tagline. So, taking this at face value, the Trump administration is claiming credit for Microsoft bringing its longest-running series to PlayStation, and saying that under his presidency, gamers are thriving.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Yet another war ended under President Trump’s watch—only one leader is fully committed to giving power to the players, and that leader is Donald J. Trump,” the statement reads. “That’s why he’s hugely popular with the American people and American Gamers.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Putting aside that this is obviously just some White House goon taking the piss out of a situation for the meme, the fact of the matter is, the video game industry has been </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-gta-6-price-switch-2-trump-tariff-2000618881"><span>thrown into a tailspin by the Trump administration</span></a><span>. The president’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-trump-tariffs-vietnam-china-trade-war-1851774438"><span>tariffs have increased console prices</span></a><span> across the board, with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-prices-pro-controllers-tariffs-amiibo-2000614471"><span>Nintendo</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-console-price-increase-sony-america-august-21-2000618873"><span>Sony</span></a><span>, and Microsoft all raising their respective price tags on systems and accessories over the course of 2025. Xbox </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-s-price-hike-raise-trump-tariff-microsoft-2000627228"><span>even did it twice</span></a><span>, though it does sound like Microsoft’s internal shifts </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-price-hike-game-pass-layoffs-new-console-2000638546"><span>have contributed to that</span></a><span> as well.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Trump has done tangible damage to the video game industry in the past 10 months, and yet, there’s an odd, concerted effort within his administration to brand him as some kind of gamer-friendly leader. This includes dumb shit like these memes, but also the Department of Homeland Security’s use of imagery from video games and anime, such as </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-halo-ice-pokemon-video-dhs-2000639308"><i><span>Halo</span></i></a> <span>and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-responds-to-dhs-video-using-the-original-animes-theme-2000628222"><i><span>Pokémon</span></i></a><span>,&nbsp; to try and recruit people to ICE. Misinformation and fascist rhetoric is the Trump administration’s M.O., however, so they’re counting on people to clap and cheer at stupid posts of the president dressed as a character they like while he simultaneously undermines the very industry they’re a fan of. Anyone who falls for this isn’t paying attention, and if a fascist playing AI-generated dress-up as Master Chief is enough to get you to ignore this on top of all the bigger problems happening because of this idiot’s nationwide ego trip, we are well and truly fucked.</span></p>

                <p>For the second year in a row, it's looking like an official Lego tabletop game is going to be one of the most popular board/card games during the holiday season. Last year it was <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZVPLJFY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Monkey Palace</a></strong>, a fun strategy board game for up to four players. This year it's <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brick-Like-This-Official-Party/dp/B0DX26KGCY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Brick Like This</a></strong>, a collaborative party game for up to eight players. Brick Like This: A Lego Party Game--not to be confused with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO%C2%AE-Party-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0FCGVMVRD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego Party</a>, the video game--is available now for only $20 at Amazon and other major retailers. </p><p>Brick Like This and Monkey Palace were designed by Dotted Games, a studio under the Asmodee umbrella dedicated to Lego board games. Based on the sustained success of Monkey Palace and how well Brick Like This appears to be performing out of gate, it seems likely we'll be talking about Dotted Games' third Lego board game this time next year.</p><div title="[Lego] Brick Like This: A Lego Party Game" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4827" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="[Lego] Brick Like This: A Lego Party Game" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brick-Like-This-Official-Party/dp/B0DX26KGCY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Brick-Like-This-Official-Party\/dp\/B0DX26KGCY?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Brick-Like-This-Official-Party/dp/B0DX26KGCY?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Brick Like This!

It's a fast-paced game that's dynamically designed to offer a different experience each time you play.</p><p>Players are split into teams of two in a race to see who can build miniature Lego models the fastest. One player builds the model based on instructions communicated by their partner. There are 92 shape cards and 48 total Lego pieces. Models have a minimum of five bricks and a maximum of eight bricks. You're awarded more points by opting for models with more pieces--though the instructor won't know what the model actually looks like until they flip the card over.</p><p>In addition to the regular shape cards, there are 20 challenge cards that introduce restrictions for builders and instructors, such as building the model with your eyes closed or with one hand and limiting the types of hints you can provide as the instructor.</p><p>When a team completes the model, they flip the hourglass, which starts a 30-second countdown to the end of the round. After six rounds, teams tally their scores and declare a winner. Each game takes around 15 minutes total.</p></div>                      </div><div title="[Lego] Monkey Palace Board Game" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4829" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="[Lego] Monkey Palace Board Game" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZVPLJFY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0CZVPLJFY?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZVPLJFY?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Monkey Palace: A Lego Board Game</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZVPLJFY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0CZVPLJFY?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZVPLJFY?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$39.25 (was $42)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>If you haven't played the studio's debut game Monkey Palace, I'd highly recommend for family game nights if you like strategy and puzzle games. </p><p>Two to four players take turns building staircases and decorating the makeshift palace.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> may soon be an Xbox Play Anywhere title, according to a presumed premature advert spotted on the Xbox Store.</p>
<p>I don't personally see the advert on the Xbox store, either on console or PC, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1ohg4ay/baldurs_gate_3_xbox_play_anywhere/">an image was captured on Reddit</a> showing a Baldur's Gate 3 promo block with the words "Now Xbox Play Anywhere" on it. This could have been faked but the scruffy nature of it and the odd angle make it a convincing fake if so.</p>
<p>I asked Larian for clarification this morning but its position is "no comment" for now, which I think bodes well.</p>

<p>Xbox Play Anywhere games, as I'm sure you know, are games that you buy once and can play on PC and Xbox and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rog-xbox-ally-x-review">the new handheld ROG Ally X</a>, all within the Xbox-branded ecosystem. So if you were to buy Baldur's Gate 3 as an Xbox Play Anywhere game, you'd be able to chop and change where you play.</p><p>I'm not sure how it works retroactively, and whether if you already own the game on Xbox you'd be able to go back and play on a different platform, but I presume that'll be the case. I don't see why you'd punish earlier adopters of the game.</p>
<p>Baldur's Gate 3 remains one of the finest role-playing games of this generation, and it's a game that's been heavily updated by Larian since it was released in 2023. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3s-last-ever-major-update-gets-a-long-awaited-release-date">The final BG3 patch, Patch 8</a>, released in the spring, brought cross-play, new subclasses, a photo mode, and the long-awaited addition of split-screen co-op on Xbox Series S. In short, if you haven't played it, do.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach now supports the PlayStation 5's power saver mode, and its implementation is among the most interesting to date, according to a new technical analysis.</p>



<p>In the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> examined how the two entries in the Kojima Productions series support Power Saver Mode, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-september-17-system-software-update/">a newly introduced operating mode for the PlayStation 5 console</a> that cuts CPU resources in half, halves the memory bandwidth, and reduces CPU and GPU clocks to reduce the system's power consumption.</p>



<p>While the implementation in Death Stranding: Director's Cut was not particularly challenging, as it is the enhanced port of a PlayStation 4 game, things get more interesting in Death Stranding 2: On the Beach. According to Digital Foundry, Power Saver mode in the second entry in the series, at a glance, only runs the game in Performance Mode while capping the framerate to 30 frames per second.</p>



<p>A closer look, however, reveals some interesting details. Tessellation and geometry, for example, are in line with that seen in Quality Mode, while the resolution is kept at 1440p, although with dynamic resolution scaling in place. This approach is interesting in how the developer worked around the constraints to balance the reduced framerate, possibly caused by the CPU limitations, with increased fidelity in some instances over Performance mode.</p>



<p>Seeing how Kojima Productions handled Power Saver Mode support in Death Stranding 2: On the Beach again raises the question of why so much effort is being put into supporting an operating mode that will likely see very little use. According to Digital Foundry, this could be a way to prepare developers for a certain level of expected flexibility required to scale games on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-handheld-ai-upscaling-16gb-lpddr5x-16mb-mall/">rumored PlayStation handheld.</a></p>



<p>As is, however, the current Power Saver Mode shouldn't be considered as an early showcase of what the rumored PlayStation handheld will deliver, as a 115W power target is way too high for a device that will likely target between 15 and 25W, and the resolution of all the games currently supporting Power Saver Mode is way too high for a portable device, usually 1440p if not even higher in some instances. This further reinforces how supporting Power Save Mode is mostly preparation work for the rumored handheld.</p>

            <p>Workers at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-are-about-to-be-bought-for-50-billion-by-saudi-arabia-and-jared-kushners-investment-firms-claims-report">soon to be under new ownership</a> Electronic Arts are reportedly struggling with a push from management towards trying to use AI for "just about everything". That's according to a new report, which claims staff are concerned about the likes of code mistakes they'll then have to clean up and the tech being trained to replace them.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The report from <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-ai-divide-roiling-video-game-giant-electronic-arts-2025-10">Business Insider</a> asserts that the publishers have been pushing their around 15,000 employees to use AI for almost all of the daily tasks. According to anonymous staff, that includes having managers use it to script chats with colleagues about sensitive topics like pay and promotions. You know, the sort of thing that definitely requires and is improved by spending time asking a bot to do words.</p>
<p>The report cites prompts advising managers about "how to talk to a direct report whose performance is negatively affecting business results but who believes otherwise" and "how to phrase constructive questions when a sought-after promotion is denied" as examples.</p>
<p>Staff are also reportedly being made to train the tech to do bits of their jobs, naturally <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-boss-boasts-of-being-able-to-ai-generate-guns-from-youtube-videos-but-says-itll-never-replace-the-human-aspect">fuelling fears</a> that doing so will be a factor in whether staff in certain roles will be among the next round of layoffs. A former senior QA worker at Respawn told Business Insider that he believes AI being used to review and summarise feedback from play testers contriubuted to him ending up among 100 people <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/respawn-reportedly-lay-off-staff-across-apex-legends-and-star-wars-jedi-teams-cancel-two-incubation-projects">laid off by EA this spring</a>.</p>
<p>AI tools such as a chatbot dubbed ReefGPT are also reportedly being used to produce code, leading staff to have to go back and fix flaws or errors in what the machine spits out.</p>
<p>EA declined to respond to Business Insider's request for comment, but did discuss their approach to AI in a US financial filing earlier this year. "The use of artificial intelligence might present social and ethical issues that, if not managed appropriately, may result in legal and reputational harm, cause consumers to lose confidence in our business and brands and negatively impact our financial and operating results," they wrote.</p><p>Meanwhile, CEO Andrew Wilson said AI is "not merely a buzzword for us", but "the very core of our business" in a speech to investors last year. That sort of setting is the kind of place you'd expect to hear the Generative AI dream being pushed most heavy-handedly, something arguably borne out by the fact Wilson's comment looked to lump it in with playing a FIFA match against a computer-controlled opponent the devs have programmed.</p>

		<p><em>And Roger </em>opens as a horror game and concludes with transporting the player into a puddle of tears. It’s one of the best games I played all year. </p><p>It’s also impossible to discuss it without spoiling it. So let’s start there.</p><p><em>And Roger i</em>s a story about the decline of a loved one. Not their death, but their dying. It’s about the fairy tale we tell ourselves about what it will be like to die of old age alongside someone, as if we’ll wake up one day and go “well, that’s enough” and flip a switch while we hold hands in bed.</p><p>Reality is usually much more cruel. <em>And Roger </em>does not shy away from the cruelty, nor the frailties and failings of caregivers for people who may be losing their grasp on reality.</p><p>Sometimes, the change is swift. A person is here, until suddenly they’re not. Other times, it happens over days, weeks, years. The transition is quiet, perhaps hard to notice. But it’s happening. And over time, you come to realize the person you know is no longer fully there.</p><figure><figcaption><span>And Roger frequently plays with perspectives, an advantage of video game storytelling. Credit: TearyHand Studio</span></figcaption></figure><p>All of this happens in the midst of a game whose design can be reasonably described as a mashup of a visual novel and, of all things, Nintendo’s eccentric mini-game-centric <em>Wario Ware</em> series.&nbsp;</p><p>“I wanted the players to take away or feel something from the simple controls provided,” said the designer behind <em>And Roger</em>, who goes by Yona, in a brief email interview with <em>Remap</em> recently.</p><p>The game Yona most credits as inspiration, though, is the wonderful game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1102130/Florence/?ref=remapradio.com"><em><u>Florence</u></em></a> from 2020, which tells the story and the intimate ups and downs of a relationship. It’s one of my favorite games, too.</p><p>“I think it’s the most wonderful game I’ve ever played,” said Yona. “It taught me the value of storytelling through games.”</p><blockquote>“Expressing the religious aspect of myself is directly tied to my purpose for living. That’s why I have such a strong desire to communicate this message. At the same time, I understand that simply expressing my beliefs as-is won’t necessarily resonate with everyone.”</blockquote><p>Other vital touchstones were 2019’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/349270/Mosaic/?ref=remapradio.com"><em>Mosaic</em></a> (“It was the first time I met a game that felt like ‘art.’") and 2020’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1392820/Milk_inside_a_bag_of_milk_inside_a_bag_of_milk/?ref=remapradio.com"><em>Milk inside a bag of milk inside a bag of milk</em></a> (“It left a deep impression with its clever use of meta elements and how it crafted a simple yet profound experience.”)</p><p>Yona’s last game was the 2D story puzzler <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2361610/In_His_Time/?curator_clanid=45640489&amp;ref=remapradio.com"><em><u>In His Time</u></em></a>. It‘s thematically similar to <em>And Roger</em>. One Steam commenter said they were “teary eyed towards the end” and that it told a story where “people are imperfect but this game is brilliant.”</p><p>“I feel that when gameplay becomes a substitute for words or when gameplay itself begins to ‘speak,’ that’s the key to narrative in games,” said Yona. “That’s why I kept text to a minimum and aimed to make the story compelling through interaction.”</p><p>You can see an example of how the game handles this in the clip below, where the player moves items across the screen to represent having a conversation or putting on a ring. Some interactions are very game-like, with ways to win or lose, while others are merely participatory.</p><figure data-kg-thumbnail="https://remapradio.com/content/media/2025/10/edit_thumb.jpg" data-kg-custom-thumbnail="">

        <img src="https://remapradio.com/content/media/2025/10/edit_thumb.jpg"></figure><p>Part of Yona’s process was drawing out scenes in “manga-style panels” and sketching each gameplay concept “on paper, one by one.”</p><p>“The text sets the direction of the story, and the gameplay expands on and propels it forward,” said Yona. “I think it’s somewhat similar to how musical films alternate between cinematic scenes and music scenes.”</p><p>Storytelling—more “traditional” storytelling, anyway—has not come easy to video games. It was only after the medium established itself as something wholly unique, aspiring beyond a premise to addictively munch quarters, that stories became more important to video games as a whole. That was decades ago. </p><p>Even now, the question remains: How? (Answer: Insert a sad Dad.)</p><p>Games and stories have come a long way, and yet, it’s not hard to wonder sometimes, did this story have to be told here? Could it have been a movie? A book? Why did it have to be a game?</p><p>“This might be a disappointing answer, but to be honest, the reason I chose to tell a story through a game is simply because creating a game was the only tool I had,” said Yona.</p><p><em>And Roger </em>feels very personal. You’d naturally wonder if it pulled from personal experiences, because the encounters and emotions are so specific. But Yona said that while his “own upbringing and family experiences had an influence” that “most of the scenes in the game are not direct reflections of my own life.” Perhaps the intimacy of a video game, where you’re pulling the strings set out by the designer, make one feel more susceptible to believing it’s real.&nbsp;</p><p>One aspect of the game that <em>is</em> very real, however, is its religious tone. Yona is Christian. The game doesn’t feel oppressively religious, but it does conclude with an excerpt from the Bible:&nbsp;</p><p><em>“And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love. – 1 Corinthians 13:13”</em></p><p>In the moment, I went “huh, you don’t see that very often.” I’m used to killing God—or some kind of god—in video games. It’s rare that you see religion, Christianity or otherwise, used as theme.</p><p>“Expressing the religious aspect of myself is directly tied to my purpose for living,” said Yona. “That’s why I have such a strong desire to communicate this message. At the same time, I understand that simply expressing my beliefs as-is won’t necessarily resonate with everyone.”</p><p>At its core, <em>And Roger</em> about another, more universal form of faith: love. And a belief that love, whatever comes, can break through.</p><p>“What’s important, I think, is not that I present the message directly,” he continued, “but that I create an experience where the player can come to understand or see it themselves through their own personal experience. While I can’t control how players interpret it, I believe that’s something I should entrust to the power of God.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Laptops come in all sizes and specs. If your everyday routine involves some heavy multitasking, working with creative apps, gaming with friends or hopping on video calls frequently, you need a machine that won’t slow you down. Think at least 30GB RAM, a spacious solid state, and a powerful processor that’s made to handle whatever your productive days throw at it. Sure, the market’s full of options, but finding one that’s powerful and reasonably priced? That’s the tricky part, but we’ve got good news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5055/">We just spotted the 16-inch Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 on Amazon for just $799, after a massive 73% off its regular price.</a> You’re getting premium, high-end specs for less than $800, which makes it feel like a steal. Just note that the discount is only around for a short time. We recommend getting your orders in before the retailer pushes the price back up to $3,000.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5055/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Heavier Workloads Won’t Be a Problem</h2>
<p>Ideapads are sleek laptops, but they don’t compromise on performance; at all. Here, you’re getting a powerful Intel Core i7-13620H chip that packs 10 cores and 16 threads with clock speeds up to 4.9GHz. It’s made for heavier workloads and even surpasses Intel’s Ultra 7 255U in benchmark comparisons, but that’s not it. The processor is paired with a massive 40GB of DDR5 RAM, which makes it easy to power through demanding tasks without a hint of lag. Using a bunch of different apps at once, hopping between tabs, taking video calls while also presenting – none of that is going to slow you down.</p>
<p>Then there’s the 2TB PCIe SSD that offers plenty of space to store all your data, plus ultra-fast boot times and quicker file access. The display is a 16-inch WUXGA (1920 x 1200) IPS anti-glare panel that delivers sharp, vibrant visuals in all lighting conditions. The 300-nit brightness and 45% NTSC color coverage keep things easy on the eyes, even during longer usage.</p>



<p>Connectivity-wise, you’re covered with Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.2, a USB-C port (with PD and DisplayPort), two USB-A ports, HDMI, a headphone/mic combo jack, and even a full-sized SD card reader. The machine runs on Windows 11 Pro, which is a great option for both students and work professionals alike.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5055/">There’s a lot more to like about the Lenovo Ideapad 3, especially now that it’s down to $799</a>. Snag it up for less while the offer is still live.</p>

            <p>Hide your wumpa fruit and reinforce all your wooden crates: Crash Bandicoot looks set for an animated return via a brand-new series set to debut on Netflix.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/crash-bandicoot-animated-series-in-the-works-at-netflix/">What’s on Netflix</a>, WildBrain Studios, the minds behind the well-received and very fun Sonic Prime, is making a Crash Bandicoot adaptation for the streaming giant.
</p>
<p>If you're unfamiliar with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-quick-look-at-sonic-prime-on-netflix">Sonic Prime</a> (you shouldn't be: anyone with a passing interest in the Blue Blur should check it out, because it's a really nice interpretation of the Sega mascot), perhaps you'll know some of the other projects the studio has worked on: Carmen Sandiego, Malory Towers, Camp Snoopy, or the Caillou reboot.</p>
<p>If you're trying to remember any other small-screen interpretations of Crash and coming up short, that's because the Sony mascot has never had a series to himself before. It looks like WildBrain has managed to snag an iconic debut here, and I'm pretty confident that the Canadian entertainment company has the chops to pull it off.</p><p>Let's hope this venture isn't as cursed as a previous attempt at bringing Crash to the small screen. Per leaks on Reddit, there were plans for a collaboration between Activision and Amazon to launch an animated Crash show in 2021, which was ultimately cancelled due to script disputes (or so legend has it, at least). We don't know much about the history of this project, all we know is that a (very cool-looking) animation test was uploaded to Youtube some four years ago. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVFJ49X11ck">Check it out here.</a>
</p>
<p>Crash has leant his big eyes and 90s energy to other media - including a Japan-only manga made by Coro Comics called <em>Crash Bandicoot—Dansu! de Jump! na Daibōken</em>, which followed the events of Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back. He also appears in a series of web shorts that released in 2007 to promote Crash of the Titans.</p>
<p>As for Crash games, the status of the raving marsupial is a little in the air right now. The last few titles (N. Sane Trilogy, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled">Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled</a>, Crash 4: It's About Time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crash-team-rumble">Crash Team Rumble</a>) were handled by Toys for Bob, and as of February 2024, the developer has left Activision to go independent. On its departure, the studio did note that it was exploring "a possible partnership between our new studio and Microsoft," claiming that Microsoft and Activision were "extremely supportive" of the way things were shaking out. We don't yet know what Toys for Bob is working on, but there has been speculation it's a new Crash game. 
</p>
<p>Either way, a 2024 report suggested Crash Bandicoot 5 was cancelled <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crash-bandicoot-5-cancelled-in-favour-of-live-service-games-report-claims">in favour of live-service games</a>, noting that the title would have been a direct sequel to It's About Time.</p>

            <p>A fan-made Bully Online mod is not only real, it's entering Early Access starting this December to those who support the project on Ko-Fi.</p>
<p>The mod will not only provide access to multiplayer servers, but it'll also feature a mix between open sandbox gameplay and competitive mini-games. Players will be able to earn money which can be spent on items, housing, cars and more. There'll also be racing, with custom-made vehicles.</p>
<p>Those who support the mod on Ko-Fi will also earn behind the scenes content, a special blue player name tag, an in-game digital camera, priority when joining servers, and a special role in the mod's Discord server.</p>

<p>A new trailer and a breakdown of Bully Online features was uploaded to the SWEGTA channel, the face of the small development team that has been working on the mod for some time. In this video it's noted that public access to the mod will be coming "in due time", but for now the December Early Access is the only date set in stone.</p><p>Bully has gained a cult following ever since its release back in 2006, though somewhat recently there has been some sour news for this loyal fanbase. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-co-founder-dan-houser-opens-up-on-bully-2-you-just-cant-do-all-the-projects-you-want">Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser stated back in September that: "you just can't do all the projects you want"</a> when talking about why there was never a sequel to the beloved schoolyard adventure game.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/once-upon-a-katamari</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/review-once-upon-a-katamari-switch-%E2%80%93-a-roll-em-up-revival-done-right.1336645/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Once Upon a Katamari Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159955/large.jpg"></a></figure><p>The core gameplay conceit of the <strong>Katamari</strong> series — rolling up everything you see into a giant ball of wriggling debris, one object at a time — almost feels like it shouldn’t work. Yet <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/once_upon_a_katamari">Once Upon a Katamari</a> manages to turn mess into something meditative, pulling you into a satisfyingly tactile flow state where hoovering stuff up feels as good as popping bubble wrap.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, the main objective of Katamari games is simple: roll your katamari (a Japanese word meaning 'clump' or 'mass') over objects smaller than itself. These objects stick to the ball, making it grow progressively larger, which in turn allows you to pick up bigger things, starting from thumbtacks and ants and eventually rolling up buildings and clouds.</p>
<p>If it sounds surreal, it most certainly is. Pair that with psychedelic low-poly visuals, plus a soundtrack that veers from sugar-high J-pop to cosmic funk and an absurdist story where a flamboyant, god-like king haplessly destroys the cosmos and sends you to Earth to roll everyday things up into new stars to restore the heavens, and it’s clear you’re not in Kansas anymore.</p>
<figure><a title="Once Upon a Katamari Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159949/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Hopes were understandably high that this new entry, the first mainline Katamari game in 14 years, would tap into what made the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/katamari_damacy_reroll">Katamari Damacy</a> and its direct sequel on the PlayStation 2 critical darlings, particularly given that later entries in the series arguably saw a bit of wear on the formula and lacked the same degree of broad acclaim.</p>
<p>Once Upon a Katamari does just that, picking up right where the early-2000s classics left off. It remains faithfully true to the core rolling formula, but with more refined controls and a clearer emphasis on replayability with heaps of stages, collectibles, and objectives. It also offers some fun new gameplay wrinkles, making it feel like a true continuation of a beloved series.</p>
<p>Players can choose between the classic dual-analogue scheme, which could feel awkward at first yet can be quite precise with a little practice, or a new Simple mode that streamlines movement to a single stick. There are added camera tweaks, such as an X-ray view when you’re obscured by obstacles and surroundings, and handy shortcuts for dashing or repositioning the katamari.</p>
<figure><a title="Once Upon a Katamari Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159952/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>New to the mix are power-ups called Freebies, which offer short bursts of utility without upsetting the game’s balance: pick up a Magnet to pull in nearby objects, a Stopwatch to freeze time and roll up fast-moving targets, use Sonar pings to locate hidden goodies, and fire off Rockets to propel your katamari forward in a high-speed surge.</p>
<p>This entry sends players time-travelling through whimsical historical backdrops — from Edo-era Japan and ancient Greece to the Wild West and ancient Egypt — each era brimming with thematic clutter to roll up. Together, the refined controls, new power-ups, and vibrant technicolor settings make this feel like a faithful continuation with a modern sheen.</p>
<p>Levels are tackled in short bursts of typically two to ten minutes or more, and each one has its own objective, like reaching a certain size before time runs out or gathering a specific item type. Each diorama-like stage brims with collectibles, too, including dozens of Cousins who can be unlocked as playable characters, along with hidden Presents and three shiny Crowns.</p>

<p>The combination of multiple, usually well-hidden collectibles with optional challenge variants that remix objectives makes every map worth revisiting. There’s a pleasing amount of content on offer with around 50 stages. It takes roughly 8-10 hours to beat the main game, but completionists could easily spend hours more rolling up every corner of the map.</p>
<p>Between levels, short cutscenes showcase the series’ trademark absurdity with slapstick humour that will feel instantly familiar to returning players. That said, the verbosity of Katamari’s cosmic ruler can test your patience, feeling somewhat intrusive when his face and dialogue text box overlays the screen during gameplay, which can itself be a sensory overload at times.</p>
<p>There are moments when your katamari grows too large in confined spaces and gets wedged between walls or obstacles, resulting in being a bit stuck until you find a direction to wiggle free. The camera does its best to follow along, but can sometimes be an irritant in such moments. These quirks, however, are baked into Katamari’s DNA and don’t meaningfully ruin the fun.</p>
<figure><a title="Once Upon a Katamari Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159948/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Once Upon a Katamari includes an online multiplayer mode called Katamari Ball, which functions as a light, competitive side mode that can also be played against AI opponents. Four players race to roll up the most items in a shared arena, periodically depositing their haul into a UFO beam to bank points and shrink their katamari back to a nimble size.</p>
<p>The bigger you grow, the slower you move, a trade-off that encourages bursts of scoring, though if you’re large enough, you can roll up your opponents for extra points. The end-of-round scoring, complete with random bonus categories, feels straight out of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/mario_party">Mario Party</a>, making for a fun palate cleanser between the solo main campaign. Couch co-op is sadly unsupported.</p>
<p>We received our review code shortly after launch, which meant I was able to properly test Once Upon a Katamari’s online multiplayer mode under real-world conditions. Matchmaking was quick; we were paired with live players within moments of initiating a session. Online play felt stable and responsive, with no noticeable lag or connection drops.</p>
<figure><a title="Once Upon a Katamari Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159954/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Performance is relatively smooth across the board on Switch 2 and the base Switch model, with the latter more noticeably dropping frames during busy moments. Load times are brief, around two to three seconds, but occur mid-stage when the game expands your playable area when you increase your weight class, causing a brief pause before snapping back into the action.</p>
<p>Switch 2 smooths over the edges further, with seemingly faster transitions and steadier performance, though there’s unfortunately no bespoke optimisation for the newer hardware. Graphically, the game’s low-poly aesthetic looks crisp and vibrant with minimal pop-in. The saturated, dayglow palette also looks great in handheld mode on the Switch OLED.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Once Upon a Katamari proves its worth as a mainline sequel and differentiates itself from other action-puzzlers with its irresistible game feel.</p>
<p>Rolling the katamari and sticking things to its surface with a satisfying pop is a continuous, sensory delight not dissimilar to vacuuming up gems in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>. Refined controls and the introduction of power-ups like the Magnet simply enhance this core experience, making for a deeply satisfying roll ’em up.</p></section>

            <p>
Stop Destroying Videogames - the European campaign inspired by the Stop Killing Games movement - says it's "confident" its petition will progress to the legislative phase now that 15 EU countries have successfully verified almost half of its 1.4m signatures between them.
</p>
<p>
Stop Destroying Videogames is looking to convince the EU to pass regulations preventing "the remote disabling of video games by the publishers, before providing reasonable means to continue functioning of said video games without the involvement from the side of the publisher." Its European Citizens' Initiative - an official EU mechanism designed to provide a way for citizens to propose a legal act to the European Commission - surpassed the required 1m signatures before the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/eci">petition</a> closed in July, meaning it can be presented to the EU for either a public hearing or full debate session at the European Parliament provided those signatures can be successfully verified.
</p>
<p>
Writing in September, Stop Destroying Videogames said it expected the verification process to take around three months, and it's now shared a progress report in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StopKillingGames/comments/1og0kb3/stop_killing_games_announcement/">new post to the Stop Killing Games campaign's subreddit</a>. "Out of 1,448,270 signatures, 689,035 are already verified, and 15 countries have met their thresholds," petition organisers explained. "We are still missing the two largest countries - Germany and France - but based on our current progress, we are confident we have surpassed the required thresholds." They added only about 3 percent of signatures have failed verification so far.
</p>
<p>
According to the update, Stop Destroying Videogames organisers have been engaged in "intense discussions" with Members of the European Parliament, national governments, political parties, and the European Commission throughout the verification process, ready for the legislative phase. It's also been working to secure expert backing from academics, explaining, "Having politicians, lobbyists, and developers in our ranks is invaluable, but we must credibly address the tough questions." Organisers <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-stop-destroying-videogames-petition-verification-continues-in-eu-organisers-preparing-to-counter-misinformation-and-industry-lobbying">previously said</a> they were taking steps to counter "misinformation and industry lobbying".
</p><p>
"Our fight is not against a united CEO front," the update continues. "It's against a handful of companies holding our favourite games hostage... Let's not just talk about developers but with them, big and small, who are already resisting these awful practices. We can't undo past damage, but we can stop what's coming. If we allow these few bad actors to dictate the future, we will continue to lose ground on issues that should never have arisen."
</p>
<p>
Stop Destroying Videogames' update concludes with a call for EU citizens to reach out to their governments, local consumer protection groups, and favourite studios in order to spread the word. It also encourages developers to make their voices heard. "We are already in talks with many in the industry," it explains. "If we’ve missed you... please reach out to us... We are planning public events and want to bring some of you in front of parliament to demonstrate how things could be."
</p>
<p>In July, EU industry body Video Games Europe - whose members include Ubisoft, Take-Two, Warner Bros., Riot Games, Activision Blizzard, Microsoft, and Nintendo - insisted the initiative's proposals <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stop-killing-games-proposals-for-game-preservation-prohibitively-expensive-major-publishers-insist">would make games "prohibitively expensive to create"</a>.</p>

            <p>The US government's use of AI-generated Halo imagery on social media has absolutely been a power-play to appeal to like-minded American gamers.</p>
<p>As if there were any doubt, <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/exclusive-white-142217261?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&amp;utm_source=copyLink&amp;utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_content=join_link">White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai told journalist Alyssa Mercante</a> overnight: "Yet another war ended under President Trump's watch - only one leader is fully committed to giving power to the players, and that leader is Donald J. Trump. That's why he's hugely popular with the American people and American Gamers."</p>
<p>Desai's comments were made in relation to <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1982819431894901043">an image tweeted by the Department of Homeland Security</a>, which showed a picture of a Halo ring world and two spartan soldiers in a Warthog jeep - one driving it and the other on top of it, operating the machine-gun turret. The soldiers appear below the words "Destroy the Flood" and a call to join the Immigration Customs Enforcement group, ICE.</p>
<p>The Flood are the primary antagonists in the Halo franchise - a parasitic lifeform which overran the galaxy. The reference here in the ICE promotional image, then, is depressingly clear: the Flood represents the immigrants ICE seeks to forcefully detain.</p>

</span></p><p>The US government's use of AI-generated Halo imagery started at the weekend, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-mascot-and-long-time-microsoft-exclusive-halo-is-coming-to-ps5-for-the-very-first-time-this-is-halo-for-everyone">Microsoft announced a remake of the Halo: Combat Evolved campaign</a> will be coming to PC, Xbox and - for the first time - PlayStation. In response, <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1982213786221109263">US games retailer GameStop posted a memey statement declaring the console wars dead</a> - the inference being that now Halo, the series that epitomised the rivalry between Xbox and PlayStation, was heading to Sony's machine, the console wars were effectively over.</p><p>The White House X account responded to this <a href="https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1982638578913206632">with an AI-generated image of Donald Trump as Master Chief</a>, holding a blue energy sword and saluting in front of an American flag, which doesn't have the correct amount of state-stars on it. "Power to the Players," the tweet read.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1982654845166428607">GameStop replied with another AI-generated Halo image</a> showing Trump's face in Master Chief's helmet, and holographic AI companion Cortana as Vice President JD Vance nearby. GameStop hasn't tweeted since.</p>
<p>All eyes now are on Microsoft and whether it will do anything about the unsanctioned use of AI-generated Halo imagery to promote political causes such as this. Microsoft has not commented on the matter and I expect never will, though I've asked through official channels all the same.</p>
<p>However, we can find depressing precedent in the recent lack of action (or effect) by Nintendo's legal team to do anything about the US Department of Homeland Security using imagery and music from Pokémon to promote ICE causes. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-pokemon-company-confirms-that-no-its-imagery-was-not-granted-for-use-in-disturbing-us-department-of-homeland-security-video">The Pokémon Company even publicly confirmed it had not sanctioned the use of Pokémon  assets in this way</a>, further underlining its apparent powerlessness to change the situation.</p><p>That, then, is what I expect this latest Halo-related display is: another power-play. Another demonstration that as unsanctioned and abhorrent as the use of the Halo imagery is, and enormously powerful as Microsoft is, it probably won't be able to force the US government to take it down.</p>

			<p>EA is pushing its employees to use AI for basically every task, but the results can be flawed, resulting in more work for developers.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-ai-divide-roiling-video-game-giant-electronic-arts-2025-10">Business Insider</a> recently talked with current EA staff, who confirmed that the company's leadership has spent the past year or so pushing its 15,000 employees to use AI for virtually every task, from producing code and concept art for games to advising managers how to speak to staff about a certain number of topics, including pay or promotions.</p>



<p>The AI tools used to produce code are among those creating the most issues for developers. It is reported that these tools produce flawed code that requires manual fixing. Other developers are concerned about the AI software training they are expected to do with their own work, which could decrease the demand for concept artists and level designers.</p>



<p>Heavy AI usage also puts QA roles at risk. One former employee at Respawn, one of EA's biggest studios, said that they were laid off this Spring, along with around 100 other employees, because the company was using AI to review and summarize feedback from play testers, work previously conducted by human employees like the ones that were fired.</p>



<p>Although heavy AI usage in game development and related tasks poses a real danger to jobs in the field, not every developer is against its use. Masahiro Sakurai, creator of the Super Smash Bros. series, believes that <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-smash-bros-creator-development-ai/">using generative AI can improve efficiency and make large-scale development sustainable</a> in the current age, especially in Japan, where the talent pool is getting smaller and smaller. Hideo Kojima, creator of the Metal Gear and Death Stranding series, also has a positive view on generative AI, seeing it as a <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-sees-creating-together-with-ai-way-stay-one-step-ahead/">way to boost efficiency while he can focus on the creative part of game development. </a></p>

            <p>The USA's Immigration Customs Enforcement service, aka ICE, have started using imagery of Microsoft's sci-fi shooter Halo for recruitment posts on social media, even as Gamestop and the US administration indulge in some bantz characterising Donald Trump as Master Chief, and even as Microsoft attempt to flog a new Halo game.
</p><!--more-->
<p>As <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/exclusive-white-142217261?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&amp;utm_source=copyLink&amp;utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_content=join_link">reported</a> by journalist Alyssa Mercante, the US Homeland Security account put out <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1982819431894901043">a Xeet on October 27th</a> with the message "Finishing this fight", a reference to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/halo-3">Halo 3</a>'s tagline, alongside a picture of Mr Chief driving the legendary Warthog humvee across the original Halo ringworld from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/halo-combat-evolved">Halo: Combat Evolved</a>, with the label "Destroy the Flood". 
</p>
<p>For context, the Flood are an enveloping, parasitic lifeform who want to overrun and consume all other species. You can see how that framing of an overwhelming invasion might appeal to the top brass at ICE, who have carried out <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/26/immigrants-criminal-record-ice-detention">a brutal mass deportation campaign</a> that has placed tens of thousands in detention, including thousands who have no criminal record.
</p>
<p>Separately, US retailer GameStop have declared "the console wars over" in <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1982213786221109263">a Xeet from October 25th</a>. The impetus for this is Microsoft's announcement of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-mascot-and-long-time-microsoft-exclusive-halo-is-coming-to-ps5-for-the-very-first-time-this-is-halo-for-everyone">a Halo: Combat Evolved campaign remake</a>, which will be the first Halo project to appear on PlayStation consoles - much to the public outrage and secret voyeuristic delight of Xbox fanboys - and introduces a few prequel missions featuring Chief's buddy Sergeant Johnson.
</p><p>"Console loyalists are instructed to cease hostilities, disband militias, and enjoy this new era of gaming," goes the GameStop post, in jocular legalese. "GameStop will continue to operate as a demilitarized zone, offering hardware, accessories, and trade-ins to combatants on all sides". 
</p>
<p>A couple of days later, the official White House twitter <a href="https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1982638578913206632">shared GameStop's post</a> with the message "power to the players", adding a dinky little image of Donald Trump dressed in Spartan armour with a plasma sword, saluting on 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW in front of the Stars and Stripes.
</p>
<p>GameStop <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1982654845166428607">replied with an image of their own</a>, featuring Master Trump and a remarkably unpleasant version of Chief's AI mission handler/love interest/mother figure Cortana, who has been doctored to resemble US vice-president JD Vance. The speed at which the images were shared implies that they were AI-generated, though I can't confirm this.
</p>
<p>It's often and not unreasonably claimed that reactionary gamers played a major part in Trump's rise to power, with the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/gamergate-chat-logs/">Gamergate hate movement</a> of 2014 onwards <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/mar/08/gamergate-trolls-woke-game-consultants">introducing various "alt-right" demagogues and Trumpist politicians to an embittered segment of players</a> who think feminism and progressive politics are a blight on society. The Trump administration's tweets above certainly reinforce that chain of connection. 
</p><p>In general, the banter between GameStop and Trump together with ICE's latest recruitment drive is an absolute triple-concentrated circus of contemporary demons. Fascism, chan humour, and the military entertainment complex spinning around in a toilet bowl, exchanging possibly Grok-derived high fives. The trade-in shelf as DMZ. The marketing fiction of a war between rival consumers re-deployed as a MAGA meme. 
</p>
<p>Neither GameStop nor Microsoft have responded to Mercante's requests for comment. The White House press office has replied to her with some snippy (and in Mercante's view, likely illegal) emails referencing <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4g7d9j7p5qo">the current US government shutdown</a>, which they blame on their Democrat opponents in Congress.
</p>
<p>This isn't the first time the USA's Homeland Security organisation has invoked a videogame for recruitment purposes. Back in September, they put out <a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-ice-pokemon-song-video-2000627900">a jokey Pokémon video on Xitter</a> with the caption "Gotta Catch 'Em All", which shows immigration enforcement agents rounding people up, with bleak gags about Pokémon being vulnerable to ice-based attacks. It seems obvious that the aim is as much to wind up progressives as to draw recruits.</p>
<p>Nintendo and The Pokémon Company have <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8ex9n8gxdwo">pushed back</a> against ICE, albeit gingerly, stating that "our company was not involved in the creation or distribution of this content, and permission was not granted for the use of our intellectual property." We'll see if Microsoft do likewise. I'll send them a request for comment now.</p>

              <p>Earbuds are great, but they don’t compare to the sound quality achievable with a pair of headphones. You can even get a pretty solid pair for not much cash. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5054/">Right now, Amazon has the Beats Solo 4 on-ear Bluetooth headphones on sale for 35% off.</a> That ends up bringing the price down by $70. The headphones start at $200, so that brings the price down to just $130. This is the lowest price we’ve seen for the Beats Solo 4 since the summer.</p>
<p>Now, even though these on-ear headphones can produce pretty stellar sound, do note that they do not support active noise cancellation or transparency mode like some of the premium model Beats do. The option of turning on noise cancelling is super practical and can be great to have, but its one of those features that can really jack up the price of a pair of headphones. So you end up getting high-quality audio at a fraction of the price by going without ANC. If that’s a deal breaker for you though, check out the Beats Studio Pro instead.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5054/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>All-Day Listening</h2>
<p>With the Beats Solo 4, you can expect to get a full 50 hours of playtime off on just a single charge. That’s more than two days of non-stop listening if you really wanted to. Then when they finally do die down to zero percent, they can charge up super quickly. Say you’re about to head out for the day and realize you forgot to plug them in overnight. Not a problem. The Beats Solo 4 support fast fuel charging which can bring your battery up from dead to five full hours of listening time after charging the set for just 10 minutes.</p>
<p>That long battery life wouldn’t do you any good if the headphones weren’t comfortable to wear. Well, the Beats Solo 4 have an ultralight yet durable construction which means you can keep them on throughout the entire day without them weighing down your noggin. Plus, the flex-grip headband with adjustable angled ear cup and plush ear cushions help to ensure they stay snuggly fit and comfy for all sizes and shapes of heads.</p>



<p>Connecting to your Beats Solo 4 is easy whether you have an iPhone or an Android. The headphones support touch to pair functionality with is exactly what it sounds like. Just touch you phone to your headphones and you’ll immediately be able to listen to your favorite music, audiobooks, or podcasts.</p>
<p>Choose between five different color options which include matte black, black gold, cloud pink, metallic pink, or slate blue. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5054/">All colorways are on sale for $70 off for a limited time.</a></p>

                <p>Loulan: The Cursed Sand has been officially revealed, and this action-RPG will see players take control of a skeletal warrior--who goes by the on-the-nose name of Cursed Sand--on a quest to rescue his beloved princess. Thanks to magical sand powers, the resurrected warrior stands a fighting chance against the monsters standing between him and the princess as he travels along the ancient Silk Road.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sX46D-gW1Rk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sX46D-gW1Rk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/10/27/loulan-the-cursed-sand-is-coming-to-ps5/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">In a PS Blog post</a>, game director Hongwen Huai revealed that the design of Cursed Sand is inspired by the Loulan mummies and the desert sand of China's western regions. This resulted in developer ChillyRoom creating a "dual-form" protagonist, who wraps himself in golden sand to take on a human-like appearance. When he uses his powers, he shifts from Sand Form to Bone Form, which Huai described as a powerful stance built for one-against-many combat.</p><p>"On his journey, he will face powerful factions ranging from the Loulan royal family--who embody the power of the sun--to the frost-bound spiders of the Western Regions," Huai said. "We've reimagined iconic landscapes of the western region through a fantastical lens, from vast deserts to flowing rivers of sand."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4592319-54875016489_3a7f0dbb11_h.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4592319" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4592319-54875016489_3a7f0dbb11_h.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4592319"></a><figcaption>Loulan: The Cursed Sand</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4592319-54875016489_3a7f0dbb11_h.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4592320-54874775056_dbbfcef11b_h.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4592321-54874775126_daa7e098e6_h.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4592322-54874999743_40bc4267ee_h.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4592323-54874999773_376322f325_h.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4592324-54875071555_2229a904c7_h.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4592320,1300-4592321,1300-4592322,1300-4592323,1300-4592324" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4592320-54874775056_dbbfcef11b_h.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4592321-54874775126_daa7e098e6_h.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4592322-54874999743_40bc4267ee_h.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4592323-54874999773_376322f325_h.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4592324-54875071555_2229a904c7_h.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4592320-54874775056_dbbfcef11b_h.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4592321-54874775126_daa7e098e6_h.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4592322-54874999743_40bc4267ee_h.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4592323-54874999773_376322f325_h.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4592324-54875071555_2229a904c7_h.jpg"></figure><p>Loulan: The Cursad Sand is one of several projects supported by Sony's China Hero Project.

            <p>Twice now <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> devs Team Cherry have put out a Simplified Chinese translation of the Metroidvania, only for Chinese players to point out some stuff it does weirdly. Well, in their third crack at providing said translation, Team Cherry look to have gone the tried and trusted route, introducing a fan-made one people already like with the latest update to patch 4's ongoing Steam beta.</p>
<p>As a quick recap, the Simplified Chinese translation <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong</a> offered at launch was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/team-cherry-working-on-quality-issues-with-hollow-knight-silksongs-simplified-chinese-translation-following-mixed-steam-reviews">flagged as being a bit Shakespearey</a>, leading to mixed reviews of the game in the region. Team Cherry were quick to introduce a second translation in an attempt to rectify the issue, but that one ended up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-patch-4-live-in-steam-beta-problems-persist-with-its-new-simplified-chinese-translation">earning thumbs downs from players</a> due to how it translated some place and character names.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>That brings us to attempt number three, the delivery of a Simplified Chinese fan translation by Team Cart Fix. "Team Cart Fix's translation has been well received by the community," Team Cherry wrote in the patch 4 beta update <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/603045243319975841/">Steam post</a>. "Their approach builds from elements of the original translation, retaining existing names for characters and places, except in instances where the original translation was incorrect, or inconsistent with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a>."</p>
<p>Scrolling down to read some early feedback on the translation, which the devs stress will have "some small issues" due to the fact its implementation hasn't been finalised, I can see one Chinese player claiming that "some errors that were previously corrected by new translators have been retained again". They've highlighted 'Last Judge' and 'Fay Mountains' as perhaps having been translated a bit too literally, but we'll have to wait for more verdicts to roll in to see for sure whether those are wider issues or more personal nitpicks.</p><p>As for the rest of patch 4, Team Cherry say it's still in line for more fixes ahead of release. With this update, they've added fixes for the likes of issues with Rune Rage and Thread Storm damage, when using the harpoon to stun or kill certain bosses, and "instances of Hornet being able to push some enemy types through the floor". Couriers should also no longer offer you exactly the same delivery immediately after you've completed it. Phew.</p>
<p>Hopefully this fan translation does the trick, or I fear patch 4 might be in the beta realm forever.</p>

<p>The Simpsons are on their way to Fortnite, and it appears Bart Simpson is the first to make his arrival, as his iconic treehouse can be found on the Battle Royale island, and we’ll tell you exactly where to go.</p>



<p>Fortnite’s mini-season themed around The Simpsons kicks off this week, starting with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-simpsons-live-event-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">huge live event</a>, which marks the final part of Chapter 6 in the game, with Epic Games now gearing up for the big release of Chapter 7 at the start of December.</p>



<p>Ahead of the big live event, a new quest is live in Fortnite that tasks you to investigate the Mysterious Anomaly, and we’ve got a full breakdown of where you need to go.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-find-the-mysterious-anomaly-in-fortnite">How to Find The Mysterious Anomaly in Fortnite</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Head here. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Mysterious Anomaly in Fortnite, aka Bart Simpson’s treehouse, is located in the northwestern part of the map, close to the Creepy Camps POI.</strong></p>



<p>Approaching this location, you’ll immediately spot a cell-shaded treehouse that sticks out like a sore thumb compared to the rest of the environment, which serves as a huge teaser ahead of the Simpsons-themed mini-season that will serve as the final swansong of Chapter 6 in Fortnite.</p>



<p>To claim the 20,000 XP and complete the quest, which provides a huge bump to your season level and can help you unlock any remaining rewards from the Battle Pass and Fortnitemares, simply approach the Treehouse. When you appear close enough, the challenge will automatically tick off and provide the reward.</p>



<p>There’s no need to head inside the treehouse, but if you do, you’ll be treated to another mini easter egg for the forthcoming season, with a TV that has a sketchy signal in the corner of the building. Periodically, images will flash up with memes from The Simpsons, another major hint at what is coming.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-there-any-other-simpsons-easter-eggs-in-fortnite">Are There Any Other Simpsons Easter Eggs in Fortnite?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, there are other Simpsons-themed easter eggs located on the Fortnite app, though none of the others provide an additional quest or XP bonuses.</strong></p>



<p>In the Steamy Shacks location, a workstation very similar to Homer Simpson’s at the nuclear power plant can be found, with no secret as to who it belongs to, as pink-glazed donuts are also there, many of which have had a bite taken out of them.</p>



<p>Additional teasers could be added before the start of the live event this weekend, but it’s not too long to wait now until the big reveal of everything there is to enjoy.</p>

                <p>In April 2022, developer and publisher Sharkmob officially launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodhunt/" data-ref-id="5000-533058">Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodhunt</a>, a battle royale set in White Wolf Publishing's World of Darkness. Players took control of vampires in Prague as they joined rival sects and battled each other with their supernatural abilities and conventional weapons. However, new updates for the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/1-year-later-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodhunt-is-shutting-down-servers-to-remain-online/1100-6514160/" data-ref-id="1100-6514160">ceased in 2023</a>, and now Bloodhunt's servers are going offline in 2026.</p><p>Sharkmob announced <a href="https://bloodhunt.com/en-us/news/bloodhunt-servers-will-close-on-april-28-2026" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the news on its site</a> that Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodhunt will have its final death on April 28, 2026. Once the game's servers go offline, the PC and PlayStation 5 versions of this title will no longer be playable.</p><p>In a message addressed to the Bloodhunt community, Sharkmob shared its gratitude for the game's four-year run.</p><p>"When we first opened the streets of Prague to you, we could only hope that the nights you spent there would create the memories they did," reads the statement. "From the battles fought on the rooftops to the friendships made in the chaos, Bloodhunt has lived through you in countless unforgettable ways. During these past four years, we have been thrilled to see your passion and dedication to Bloodhunt ... However, despite you, our amazing community, the current player population has reached a level where keeping the servers running is no longer sustainable. This has led us to make the difficult decision to take Bloodhunt offline."</p><p>Token purchases have already been disabled, but the in-game store will remain open so players can use the tokens they already have before the game goes offline.</p><p>Earlier this month, the action-RPG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/" data-ref-id="5000-494182">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> hit PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Wachowskis, the writers and directors behind the Matrix movies, once asked Metal Gear creator Hideo Kojima to design a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-matrix"><u>Matrix</u></a> video game, but publisher Konami reportedly turned it down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's according to <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/10/they-were-big-fans-of-kojima-the-wachowskis-once-asked-the-metal-gear-creator-to-make-a-matrix-video-game" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Time Extension</u></a>, which said that while a December 1999 edition of NextGen magazine stated Kojima was apparently in the running to develop a game based on the blockbuster movie, Konami exec Kasumi Kitaue shot down discussions in favor of keeping Kojima focused on the Metal Gear series instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The Wachowskis were big fans of Kojima," Konami Digital Entertainment VP of licensing, Christopher Bergstresser, told Time Extension. "So Kazumi Kitaue, Kojima, Aki Saito (who still works with Kojima), and I were at the Konami HQ, and we got a call from the Wachowskis, who wanted to come in and meet with Kojima. So they did!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The two of them came in with their concept artist, and effectively they said to Kojima, ‘We really want you to do the Matrix game. Can you do that?’ Aki translated this into Japanese for Mr. Kitaue, and Kitaue just looked at them and told them plainly, ‘No.' We did still get to enjoy the Matrix Japanese premiere and afterparty, though."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, that's not quite how everyone recalls events. Another former Konami employee, this one unwilling to go on record, claimed Konami had actually shown "strong interest" in the game, and there was "immense disappointment" when the project didn't go ahead. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Matrix franchise was adapted into a series of games nonetheless, starting with Shiny Entertainment's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/franchise/the-matrix">Enter the Matrix</a> in 2003, follow up <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-matrix-path-of-neo">The Matrix: Path of Neo</a> in 2005, and Monolith Production's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-matrix-online">The Matrix Online</a> in the same year. We were also treated to a Matrix-themed tech demo in 2021, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-matrix-awakens-an-unreal-engine-5-experience">The Matrix Awakens: An Unreal Engine 5 Experience</a>, in which Epic Games showed us what Unreal Engine 5 was capable of. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It didn't turn out too badly for Kojima or Konami, either; after 1998's Metal Gear Solid, Kojima and his team then concentrated on the critically-acclaimed and award-winning <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid-2-son-of-liberty"><u>Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</u></a>, which was released in 2001.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Matrix Movies in (Chronological) Order</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And Kojima is equally busy now, of course. With Death Stranding 2 out the door, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kojima-productions-beyond-the-strand-10th-anniversary-livestream-everything-announced-hideo"><u>Kojima is working on a number of new projects</u></a>, including horror game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/od-a-hideo-kojima-game"><u>OD for Xbox Game Studios</u></a>. He <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-reveals-first-trailer-for-xbox-game-studios-title-od"><u>revealed the first trailer for it last month</u></a>, sparking speculation that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-od-connected-to-pt-hideo-kojimas-new-horror-game-explained"><u>it is connected to P.T. in some way</u></a>. Certainly, there are striking similarities. The mysterious game will star Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves' Sophia Lillis, Hunters' Udo Kier, and Euphoria's Hunter Schafer, with the trailer showcasing Lillis' character in a spooky house, lighting candles before meeting a malevolent figure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
