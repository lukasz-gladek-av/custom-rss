The Twitch campaign runs until November 13, with four items up for grabs, including a weapon blueprint. In order to get these drops, you will need to watch Twitch streams of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 where the creator has enabled drops.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Black Ops 6 Twitch Rewards</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4390713-blopstwitchdrops.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390713" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4390713-blopstwitchdrops.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390713"></a><figcaption>It takes four hours to earn all four items from Twitch drops.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4390713-blopstwitchdrops.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There are four items up for grabs: the XMG Get Wiped blueprint, Never Broken calling card, Azurite Vision charm, and the Deflected emblem. Most of these rewards are purely cosmetic, although the XMG blueprint can be used in-game, letting you access attachments for the weapon before you might have unlocked them by leveling up. Each of these items has a specific hour count you need to hit.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Deflected emblem - 1 Hour</li><li dir="ltr">Never Broken calling card - 2 Hours</li><li dir="ltr">Azurite Vision - 3 Hours</li><li dir="ltr">XMG Get Wiped blueprint - 4 Hours</li></ul><p dir="ltr">You can check your progress by navigating to your profile icon on Twitch and going down in the drop menu to <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/drops/inventory" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Drops and Rewards</a>, which is also where you can claim these items once you earn them. Before you can start earning these drops, you need to make sure your Twitch account and Activision account have been linked. If your account isn't connected, there is a connect option in the Drops and Rewards screen under the Black Ops 6 campaign, which will take you to the Activision website, where you can log in and connect the two accounts.</p><p dir="ltr">Once you have successfully connected your accounts, the connect link will no longer be on that page. From there, just head to the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6</a> category on Twitch and look for the tag DropsEnabled to find a stream to watch. <strong>You will need to collect your rewards from the Drops and Rewards menu once you have met the time requirements.</strong></p><p>For more help with Black Ops 6, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-weapon-loadouts/2900-5892/">Best Weapon Loadouts</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-perks-and-wildcards/1100-6527396/">Best Perks</a> guides.</p>

Last year, the Foundation released a study saying </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/study-finds-nearly-every-pre-2010-video-game-is-unavailable">87 percent of games</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> released prior to 2010 in the country were virtually inaccessible.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In page 191 of the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.copyright.gov/1201/2024/2024_Section_1201_Registers_Recommendation.pdf">Registers' Recommendation</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the Office cited comments from the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) which claimed preservation supporters like the VGHF "[did] not propose a clear requirement to know who the users are or why they want to access a game." Likewise, it suggested those lack of requirements meant supporters aimed to "reserve almost complete discretion in how they would provide access to preserve[d] games."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The ESA and game preservation">The ESA and game preservation</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The ESA has repeatedly </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/esa-org-won-t-cooperate-game-preservation">pushed back</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> against game preservation efforts, and continued to do so here. In its argument, the organization said a "substantial market" still exists for classic games, including secondary markets. "Enabling widespread remote access to preserved games with minimal supervision would present a serious risk to an important market," it wrote.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Comments like those echo the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/esa-expects-companies-to-fix-preservation-problem">organization's stance</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> back in 2023: preservation is an issue to be handled by the publishers and their affiliates, not historians or archivists of any kind.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ultimately, the Register sided with the ESA, saying the VGHF "have not met their burden of showing that reproducing works to allow for multiple simultaneous use in the computer program class is likely to be fair." Additional criticism was levied at the VGHF's emulation stance, which was deemed "inconsistent and incomplete and the technologies are not addressed in the exemption text."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In response to the Office's stance, the VGHF said it was "not done fighting here.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/microsoft-ceo-we-continue-to-extend-our-games-to-new-platforms/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-annual-letter-relevance-reinvention-satya-nadella-v91xc/?trackingId=jGFh4qisSbKEPXgV6DMZRQ%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> his annual letter, which was published in the company's 2024 report, via LinkedIn. In the letter, Nadella discusses every major focus area for Microsoft: AI, security, business applications, professional social network (LinkedIn), search/ads/news, and gaming.</p>
<p>On this subject, the Microsoft CEO chose to highlight how the gaming side of the company has begun expanding its content (which now also includes all of Activision Blizzard King's franchises) on many more devices, and he seemed to hint that this trend will continue in the future.</p>
<p><em>We are bringing great games to more people on more devices. With our acquisition of Activision Blizzard King, which closed October 2023, we’ve added hundreds of millions of players to our ecosystem. We now have 20 franchises that have generated over $1 billion in lifetime revenue—from Candy Crush, Diablo, and Halo, to Warcraft, Elder Scrolls, and Gears of War. And with Xbox cloud gaming, we continue to innovate to offer players more ways to experience the games they love—where, when, and how they want. Finally, we brought four of our fan-favorite titles to Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation for the first time, as we continue to extend our content to new platforms.</em></p>
<p>Nadella is, of course, referring to the big tectonic shift in Xbox's strategy that happened in February when Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-indiana-jones-not-going-multiplatform-4-older-xbox-titles-will/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided</a> to bring four games to PlayStation 5 and/or Nintendo Switch: Pentiment, Sea of Thieves, Grounded, and Hi-Fi Rush. At the time, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-gaming-ceo-phil-spencer-is-confident-in-xboxs-future-but-stresses-the-need-to-find-new-customers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> fans that the company had to find ways to attract new customers and that the whole gaming industry had to return to growth to stay sustainable. In June, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-teased-by-phil-spencer-who-also-confirms-more-first-party-games-coming-to-other-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> that more games would launch on other platforms in the future, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was later <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-release-as-timed-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> at Gamescom 2024 to be coming to Sony's PlayStation 5 console just a few months after the PC and Xbox debut.</p>
<p>It is, after all, a strategy change that could have been foreseen in Nadella's own testimony rendered during the FTC vs Microsoft trial. At the time, the Microsoft CEO <a href="https://wccftech.com/nadella-no-exclusives-blames-sony/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>:</p>
<p><em>If it was up to me I would like to get rid of exclusivity on consoles. But that’s not for me to define, especially as a low-share player in the console market. The dominant player there [Sony] has defined market competition using exclusives, so that’s the world we live in. I have no love for that world.</em></p>
<p>True Xbox exclusives will be far and few between, then, as Microsoft aims to release its games on as many devices as possible, including competitor consoles and mobile, to maximize growth.</p>

There are lots of typical bug fixes and gameplay adjustments, but also something completely new for an EA sports game: Adobe Express. The program will let players design custom logos for stadiums and jerseys in <em>College Football 25</em>'s Team Builder mode, either from scratch or using generative AI. </p><p>“Team Builder is getting an upgrade!” reads the developer commentary part of the patch notes. “We’re excited to announce a new partnership with our friends from Adobe.

Some players already use Adobe to make their designs and import them separately, while others prefer to use the in-game tools. “God, I hope they keep the Adobe thing as optional because I have a fear it will become Adobe everything by the next game so they can have that partnership and reap more money off this game,” wrote one fan on the subreddit. “As well Adobe at least for me is a slow-ass tool.”</p><p>Earlier this year, EA CEO Andrew Wilson <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ea-college-football-25-generative-ai-fifa-1851609733&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ea-college-football-25-generative-ai-fifa-1851609733">said that AI tools</a></span>, including machine learning, were the only way that <em>College Football 25</em>, with thousands upon thousands of unique players hailing from all different schools, was able to be made. It’s the franchise’s first new sequel since 2013 back when it was called <em>NCAA Football 14</em>. And whether due to pent up demand or the explosion in popularity of college football in the years since, <em>College Football 25</em> has already become the best-selling sports game <em>ever</em>, according to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3l7be4h7lsj27&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3l7be4h7lsj27" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the market data firm Circana</a></span>.</p><p>You can find the full patch notes for the October 24 title update below:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><h3 id="h112620"><a id=""></a>GAMEPLAY</h3><p>General</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Refreshed the Ability Loadouts of players in Front End Rosters.DEV NOTE: <em>These ability changes are based on current player performance this season and changes to their ratings.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-ops-6-review-the-best-we%E2%80%99ve-had-in-years.1019673/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>After a miserable streak of Call of Duty games ranging from Vanguard to Modern Warfare III, it’s refreshing to finally say that <strong>this year’s </strong>Call of Duty title is a <strong>hit</strong>. Black Ops 6 is finally here and millions of players worldwide are soaking up this triple-threat of a title that boasts a solid campaign, a round-based Zombies offering, and a stellar multiplayer platform.</p>



<p>As a Call of Duty fan of almost 20 years, I’m so pleased that I can finally recommend the latest release to anyone who asks, ‘Is Black Ops 6 good?’ It <strong>is beyond </strong>‘good’, and in this short, snappy Black Ops 6 review, I’ll outline why.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-diversity-is-unreal">The Diversity is Unreal</h2>



<p>I <strong>always </strong>play the campaign portion of a Call of Duty game first. Last year’s paltry offering left me thoroughly disappointed, so I went into Black Ops 6 with guarded expectations. From end to end, it took me just south of seven hours to finish Black Ops 6, and that’s playing on the easiest difficulty setting. </p>



<p>That’s what I’d expect from a top-tier Call of Duty campaign, so I’m satisfied with the length.</p>



<p>What’s better than how long the campaign is is just how <strong>diverse</strong> an offering Raven and Treyarch arranged for us this time around. Every mission feels like a portion taken from a unique game. </p>



<p>In one sequence, I was exploring a semi-open-world Iraqi environment, hunting down several objectives. In the next, I was decked out in disguise, sneaking around a gala hosted by Bill Clinton and trying to solve puzzles. I was thrust into the thick of intense combat sequences against advanced soldiers, and then shortly after, plunged into a fight for my life against the undead.</p>



<p>The pacing is nothing short of remarkable.</p>



<figure><figcaption>This is where I met Bill Clinton.</figcaption></figure>







<p>As you’d expect, Black Ops 6 is a globetrotting adventure, taking players from Russia to the United States to Iraq, and beyond. I can’t fault the world-building – everything looks flawless on screen and is a wonder to explore. The attention to detail is second to none, and the mysteries and collectables scattered throughout each mission give you a reason to look beyond the run-and-gun nature of the series.</p>



<p>I came away from the campaign <strong>hungry </strong>for an open-world RPG-style Call of Duty game. Everything from the ‘customisation’ of the base of operations you unlock to the new skills and abilities you gain with cash found in the world gave me a reason to be much more thorough.</p>



<p>I won’t spoil the story, but Black Ops fans will be left satisfied with what’s on offer. It’s a classic Black Ops setting, packed full of recognisable characters, a punchy soundtrack, and of course, references to Zombies.</p>







<h2 id="h-magic-mechanics">Magic Mechanics</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It doesn’t matter how you play, the suite of mechanics will suit your style.</figcaption></figure>







<p>We knew from the beta that Black Ops 6 is one of the most innovative games in the series when it comes to movement and mechanics. From the campaign to the multiplayer, those mechanics are explored in full. Pre-launch, Activision’s teams applied tweaks to the ‘Omnimovement’ system, and leaping through the air while firing akimbo, full-auto handguns feels <strong>smooooooth</strong>.</p>



<p>The fluid movement and intuitive controls lend themselves nicely to a pleasant seven or so hours of gameplay through the campaign, and they translate perfectly to Black Ops 6’s multiplayer ecosystem. While I’m not a fan of every map or mode, what I have played, I’ll rate quite high.</p>



<p>What I’ve found is that Black Ops 6 feels accommodating to both newcomers and veterans. It’s as typical a multiplayer offering as you can ask for, but you <strong>just get it </strong>so much faster than previous titles. Within a few matches, I had my custom classes levelling up, I was learning hills and spawn points, and I was getting to grips with the mechanics that weren’t present in the beta.</p>



<p>It’ll make for a <strong>fantastic </strong>competitive Call of Duty, let’s say that.</p>







<p>It’s hard to offer up a Black Ops 6 multiplayer review as it’s such a subjective topic. All I’ll say is that I’ve played the multiplayer on every game since Call of Duty 4 (2007) and this is the best multiplayer I’ve experienced in a long time. Previously, I enjoyed Cold War – but Vanguard, MWII, and MWIII left me feeling cheated and dismayed.</p>



<p>Summing up:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>SBMM </strong>– Not too rough</li>



<li><strong>Settings </strong>– Slimmed down in some areas, which is good</li>



<li><strong>Audio </strong>– Nice, especially with the new enhanced audio option</li>



<li><strong>Aim assist</strong> – Good enough that PC players will complain about it again</li>



<li><strong>Maps </strong>– Can take or leave some of them</li>



<li><strong>Stability </strong>– Packet burst is still a thing</li>



<li><strong>Progression </strong>– Love the new attachment and camo options, and gaining levels is easy enough</li>
</ul>



<p><em>What else would you want listed?</em></p>



<h2 id="h-the-other-stuff">The Other Stuff</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>What else can we say as part of this Black Ops 6 review?</p>



<p>I experienced one bug in the campaign that forced me to reload checkpoint, that’s about it. The AI is intelligent enough to be mostly believable, the story is <strong>somewhat </strong>unpredictable and intriguing, and the combat feels satisfying and engaging. For challenge hunters, it’s a superb game – there’s plenty of meat on the bones here.</p>



<p>I’ll admit that I haven’t probed too deeply into the Zombies mode <strong>yet</strong>, but from what I’ve heard, it’s one of the best COD Zombies games in years, and the round-based operating model <strong>slaps</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-verdict-buy">Verdict: Buy</h2>



<p>As this is the first Call of Duty game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to land on Game Pass</a> at launch, Xbox and PC subscribers can get their copy for no added charge, which is a huge bonus. If you’re <strong>not </strong>a subscriber, I wholeheartedly recommend investing the cash and securing your copy of Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>From a long and entertaining campaign to a stacked and solid multiplayer platform that feels refreshingly modern and well-built, to the round-based Zombies offering and the promise of a decent roadmap, there’s nothing about Black Ops 6 that turns me off. If I had to put a number against this Black Ops 6 review, it would be a 9 out of 10.</p>



<p>This honestly is the best we’ve had in years.</p>

We don’t know, and because Valve famously doesn’t explain many of their decisions or plans, your guess is as good as mine. </p><p>However, I have a theory about this change. Last year, around this same time, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/half-life-new-update-fixed-old-bug-animation-blast-pit-1851043667&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/half-life-new-update-fixed-old-bug-animation-blast-pit-1851043667">Valve fixed a very old bug in <em>Half-Life</em></a></span> involving a monster’s animation. I think as the year wraps up, Valve might let devs tinker as the holidays approach, and perhaps that’s why this patch has suddenly appeared. Maybe someone got a bit of free time and used it to hop into <em>TF2 </em>and correct this mistake? </p><p>Or perhaps Valve just likes trolling fans? Maybe both! Anyway, Scout’s pants are finally the correct color and we can all sleep easy knowing that the world is a better place. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The sales numbers come from copies sold worldwide on all available platforms.</p>







<p>Sonic X Shadow Generations is a remake of 2011’s Sonic Generations. Where it differs, however, is that it includes new content in the form of Shadow Generation.</p>



<p>“Sonic X Shadow Generations&nbsp;is a title that combines two games:&nbsp;Sonic Generations, where players can enjoy speed-running various stages with Classic Sonic and Modern Sonic, enhanced with new elements, and&nbsp;Shadow Generations, a completely new game featuring the dark hero Shadow&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/racing">racing</a>&nbsp;through dynamic environments,” Sega’s overview of the game reads.</p>



<p>“The story begins as a mysterious creature called the “Time Eater” creates distortions in time and space, setting off separate&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>s for Sonic and Shadow. Players can look forward to a high-speed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>-adventure with distinct gameplay experiences and narratives.”</p>



<p>Sonic X Shadow Generations is available on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

The movement is fast-paced and sweaty this year, so you'll want to make sure you have the best perks and Wildcards to suit your playstyle.

Take less fall damage.</p><p dir="ltr">This is a perk you might've overlooked in recent years, but it's a top choice for Black Ops 6. This perk is best suited for you if you plan on making the most of the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6s-action-hero-movement-changes-call-of-duty-for-the-better-with-some-risks/1100-6526239/"> game's omnimovement</a>. The benefits work really well to help you keep more control for gunfights while sliding, diving, and jumping around.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Ghost:</strong> Undetectable by enemy Scout Pulse and UAV while moving, planting, defusing, or controlling.</p><p dir="ltr">This is a great perk for staying off the radar if you're a player who wants to go for stealthy plays. It's also a great choice to use for laying low with a sniper class.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Ninja:</strong> Move more quietly</p><p dir="ltr">Like Ghost, this perk can be used for stealthy plays. It's also one of the best picks for non-respawn modes like Search and Destroy.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390640-blackops6perks.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390640" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390640-blackops6perks.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390640"></a><figcaption>Black Ops 6 perks</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390640-blackops6perks.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Perk_2_slot">Perk 2 slot</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Fast Hands:</strong> Swap weapons faster and extend fuses when throwing back grenades.</p><p dir="ltr">Movement and speed are so important in a fast-paced game like Black Ops 6. Having the faster weapon swap can really save you when your primary runs out of ammo.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Assassin:</strong> Enemies on a kill streak get a unique minimap marker and drop bounty packs when killed. Pick up the packs for more score.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Dispatcher:</strong> Reduced score cost for non-lethal streaks. Stacks with Bankroll.</p><p dir="ltr">While Fast Hands and Assassin are going to be more popular picks for aggressive players, Dispatcher is a great pick if you like to lean into a support role. It's also great for leveling up faster, as you'll get your UAVs and other support streaks faster, equalling to more score opportunities.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Perk_3_slot">Perk 3 slot</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Double Time:</strong> Greatly increased duration of Tactical Sprint.</p><p dir="ltr">This is going to be a popular pick for aggressive playstyles. This is the perk you want to run when you're the player rushing to capture hardpoints or just the run-and-gun playstyle.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Bankroll:</strong> Start each life with +150 score towards scorestreaks.</p><p dir="ltr">This is a great perk to pair with Dispatcher because it stacks. This is a great pick for getting your support streaks even faster, and together these perks should give you more opportunities to earn XP and level up fast.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Cold-Blooded:</strong> It's always good to have at least one loadout equipped and labeled as your Cold-Blooded class. This makes it easy to switch and save yourself, if you find you're in a match where you're getting hammered by lethal enemy streaks.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Best_Wildcard_picks">Best Wildcard picks</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390641-wildcards.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390641" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390641-wildcards.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390641"></a><figcaption>Black Ops 6 Wildcards</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390641-wildcards.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 6 brings back Treyarch's Wildcard system. Each loadout can be equipped with one Wildcard to help you further customize your loadout to your preferred playstyle. Here are some recommended options:</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Overkill:</strong> Equip and non-melee weapon in Primary and Secondary slots.</p><p dir="ltr">Overkill is not a perk this year. If you want to run an additional primary weapon, you'll need to equip this wildcard.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Gunfighter:</strong> Get three extra attachments for your primary weapon.</p><p dir="ltr">If you can't decide on just five attachments for your gun, Gunfighter lets you add three more for a very powerful weapon build.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Perk Greed:</strong> Equip an extra perk.</p><p dir="ltr">It's always handy to have an extra perk, especially with so many good perks being stacked in the Tier 1 slot. This will let you equip Ghost and Ninja together for added stealth, and this is also a good combo for Search and Destroy players.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Specialty_bonuses">Specialty bonuses</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390642-combatspecialist.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390642" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390642-combatspecialist.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390642"></a><figcaption>Black Ops 6 Combat Specialist</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390642-combatspecialist.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's worth noting that perks are all labeled using three different categories: Enforcer (red), Recon (blue), and Strategist (green). If you fill your loadout with three perks from the same category, you'll get an additional bonus.</p><p dir="ltr">This won't always be the best route to take, but one combo that does work well and gives you decent perks with a helpful bonus is equipping <strong>Dexterity</strong>, <strong>Assassin</strong>, and <strong>Double Time</strong> for an aggressive playstyle. <strong>This earns you the Enforcer bonus</strong>, which grants you a temporary buff to movement speed and health regen rate.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're looking for Black Ops 6 weapon builds to pair with your perks, we have several <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-weapon-loadouts/2900-5892/#1">recommended builds to try in your next match of multiplayer</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're on console, we have a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-settings/1100-6526279/">recommended settings guide</a> for getting the most out of Black Ops 6 on PlayStation or Xbox consoles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-animated-tomb-raider-series-is-returning-for-season-2-and-laras-teaming-up-with-an-old-pal<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Congratulations are in order for Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft! <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a>'s animated adaptation of the iconic video game series has successfully managed to appease the streaming service gods and will be returning for a second season (not that I'm extremely bitter about Kaos' cancellation or anything) at some unspecified future point.
</p>
<p>
Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft's debut season launched on Netflix earlier this month, whereupon I completely failed to watch it because I immediately cancelled my subscription after the whole Kaos incident (not that I'm still extremely bitter about 1899 or anything). However, enough people seem to like it despite middling reviews - and, probably more importantly, actually <em>watch</em> it - that Netflix is now ready to do it all again with a Season 2.
</p>
<p>
Netflix announced a second season for Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft, a fate regrettably not enjoyed by Kaos or 1899 (not that I'm still extremely bitter about Glow or anything), in a <a href="https://x.com/netflix/status/1849828264686256596">message shared on social media</a>. "Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft will return for SEASON 2!," it bellowed in several capital letters. "Lara will officially join forces with the one and only Sam Nishimura for an all-new adventure."
</p>

</div><figcaption>Oh yeah, and American Vandal was good too.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yh3jz8rvYBY" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
That means when Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft makes a comeback (not that I'm still extremely bitter about The Santa Clarita Diet or anything), she'll finally have her bestie by her side after the character was notably absent in Season 1. Sam, of course, was introduced in Crystal Dynamics' 2013 Tomb Raider reboot and promptly disappeared from the series after that - although she did pop up in a prequel comic.
</p><p>
Netflix hasn't provided any hints as to when Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft's second, Sam-starring season might eventually arrive, but while we're all here, let's take quiet moment to remember the dearly departed likes of Kaos, 1899, Glow, The Santa Clarita Project, and that thing about the dead boy detectives, whatever you were called.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to Eurogamer this week, Tomb Raider 2013 writer Rhianna Pratchett <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-netflix-series-ptsd-focus-was-something-game-writers-werent-allowed-to-explore-rhianna-pratchett-says">applauded the TV series' decision to touch on Lara's PTSD</a> after her early experiences, noting it "was an area we weren't allowed to explore in the games", despite the narrative team wanting to do so.

It’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK37CSHP?tag=theverge02-20">available for preorder now for $49.99</a> and is expected to be released on November 29th, 2024.</p><p>The Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller can be attached to smartphones or smaller tablet devices measuring between 100mm and 170mm in length. For expanded compatibility, instead of plugging in with USB-C, 8BitDo’s new controller connects wirelessly over Bluetooth but only supports Android devices.</p><p>The use of Bluetooth necessitates a 350mAh rechargeable battery in the controller, which 8BitDo says is enough for 15 hours of play on a 1.5-hour charge. That added battery also means the Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller weighs 236 grams, making it heavier than competitors’ offerings like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22753567/backbone-one-plus-iphone-gaming-controller-android-phones">Backbone One</a>, which connects through a device’s charging port and weighs 138 grams.</p><div><figcaption><em>The controller features Hall effect joysticks and triggers.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: 8BitDo</cite></p></div><p>Like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/24/24187539/gamesir-g8-bluetooth-mobile-controller-ios-android-nintendo-switch-pc">GameSir’s G8 Plus smartphone controller</a>, 8BitDo is using <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21504741/nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift-problem-explained">drift-resistant</a> magnetic Hall effect sensors in its joysticks and triggers so players will potentially avoid experiencing unwanted movements or button presses while gaming. The controller also features a pair of shoulder buttons, a four-way directional pad with a “clicky” feel, turbo, macro, and profile buttons, and two additional programmable paddle buttons on the back.</p><div><figcaption><em>The controller is compatible with 8BitDo’s Ultimate Software allowing it to be customized and reconfigured.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: 8BitDo</cite></p></div><p>Unlike some of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185806/gaming-8bitdo-controller-ultimate-2c-hall-effect">8BitDo’s more budget-friendly offerings</a>, the Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller fully supports customization through the company’s Ultimate Software, which is available as a desktop and mobile app. In addition to remapping controls, creating macros, and even setting up multiple profiles, if you’re an FPS player, you can use it to adjust the sensitivity of the controller’s triggers so they’re more immediately responsive.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/25/24278489/ring-battery-doorbell-plus-deal-sale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’re a gamer looking to save but can’t wait until another a month until Black Friday, it might be worth checking out <a href="https://howl.me/cnnelayGOJc"><strong>Best Buy’s three-day gaming sale</strong></a>. Now through October 27th, the retailer’s offering discounts on gaming gear, but some of the best deals are on hardware specifically. </p><p>For example, Best Buy has some notable deals on Windows handheld consoles, like the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/23719210/asus-rog-ally-review"><strong>Asus ROG Ally</strong></a>, which is on sale&nbsp;with a Z1 Extreme chip for <a href="https://howl.me/cnnexVKi7NU">$549.99 ($100 off)</a> (and even cheaper at $499.99 for My Best Buy Plus and Total members). That’s $50 shy of its best price to date, and nearly half the price of its successor, the ROG Ally X. Admittedly, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24204770/asus-rog-ally-x-review-handheld-gaming-pc">ROG Ally X</a>, offers more impressive performance and battery life, but the ROG Ally is still more powerful than Valve’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/23513517/steam-deck-long-term-test-valve">Steam Deck</a> with a larger 1080p and 120Hz display. Alternatively, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24088011/lenovo-legion-go-review"><strong>Lenovo Legion Go</strong></a> is also on sale for <a href="https://howl.me/cnnd4I8l55Z">$599.99 ($150 off)</a> with 1TB of storage, which is one of its better prices to date. The handheld isn’t as fast or as lightweight as the ROG Ally, but it does offers a larger 8.8-inch 144Hz display so it can double as a decent Windows tablet. It also has detachable controllers and even a kickstand.</p><p>It’s not all pricey handhelds, either. Gaming accessories like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/30/24168172/scuf-nomad-iphone-mobile-controller-hall-effect-specs-price"><strong>Scuf’s Nomad&nbsp;controller</strong></a><strong> </strong>have dropped to their best prices to date, selling for <a href="https://howl.me/cnnd84vVxJJ">$79.99 ($20 off)</a>, with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SCUF-Wireless-iPhone-Mobile-Controller/dp/B0D49HBW9D/?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> matching that deal too.

And while the video game deals aren’t as impressive, there are a few noteworthy ones to consider, like the  open-world&nbsp;title <em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em>, which is down to one of its better prices to date of <a href="https://howl.me/cnneJt0bAvO">$29.99</a> <a href="https://howl.me/cnneJt0bAvO">($20 off)</a> for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X.</p><div><p>The ROG Ally is Asus’ first crack at a Steam Deck rival.

The streamer has a habit of just gruesomely canceling shows, even when they have great ratings and are adored by their audience. (<em>Kaos</em>, I’m still mourning you.) There rarely seems to be any rhyme or reason, making it such a risk to invest in an ongoing story. However, today we’ve learned that&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft</em> is getting a season two.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196470" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Reignited Rivalries And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="123" data-playlist="196470,195579,196013" data-current="196470"><div><p>The Week In Games: Reignited Rivalries And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22020.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The series, featuring a Hayley Atwell-voiced Lara Croft, has been picked up by Netflix for another run, just two weeks after the animated show’s eight episodes were added to the streamer.</p><p>Hopefully you’re loving the show, and are greeting this news with delight. That’s less likely to be the case for <em>Kotaku</em>’s Willa Rowe, who described the show as “[Croft’s] most boring adventure yet.” Wider critical reception was extremely mixed, with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/tomb-raider-the-legend-of-lara-croft/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/tomb-raider-the-legend-of-lara-croft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">its Metascore</a></span> sitting at a middling 65, but with scores spread from 5 to 9 out of 10.

Lara’s thrilling new adventure takes her around the globe as she delves deeper into the hidden secrets of Orisha history, dodges the machinations of a dangerous and enigmatic billionaire who wants the masks for herself, while discovering these relics contain dark secrets and a power that defies logic. Power that may, in fact, be divine.</p></blockquote><p>It at least sounds a bit more exciting that the first season, and confirms the main voice actors are returning to the project.</p><p>Of course, the animation also drew the Eye of Mauron, because—I dunno—Lara’s breasts weren’t scraping on her toes, or that one character who was also in that one game in 2006 wasn’t a carbon copy? You know how they are, confusing the entire world and all that exists within it with their personal masturbatory material. User scores are extremely low, as a result of sad little boys who are too scared to go to Porn Hub. So on this level alone, it’s a pleasure to see the show renewed, just to watch them have to put their “GO WOKE GO BROKE” jpegs back in their soggy pockets.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/2024/10/spike-jonze-series-netflix-dead-1236157805/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/2024/10/spike-jonze-series-netflix-dead-1236157805/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">We also learned</a></span> today that Spike Jonze’s exciting-sounding sci-fi project is no more, before filming even began. It’s unknown if that was Netflix’s decision, or Jonze’s. Now please sign my petition to renew <em>Kaos</em>. I need more Jeff!</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
